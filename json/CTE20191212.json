He is joined by Mark Brady, deputy director of audit.<\/p> <p>  No apologies have been received.  I propose that we hold over the minutes of the meeting last week to our next meeting.  We will deal with anything related at that point.<\/p> <p>  There is one item I wish to bring up relating to last week's meeting.  I will bring it up at this stage.  It relates to the national paediatric hospital.  As part of our meeting we circulate to all members follow-up items relating to the session.  It is not formally part of the minutes but it is a follow-up note for members.  I want three other items put onto the list from last week's meeting.  We did not get to clarify everything we had intended on the day because of time and everything else.<\/p> <p>  The first thing is the big issue relating to the design and extras.  I want to write to the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board seeking confirmation that the design works are now fully completed, all design work drawings have been given to the builder, and there is no ongoing design work at this stage.  If there is, then by definition it could lead to extras.  We want to know the position of the paediatric board in respect of managing the builder and all obligations.  The builder is on the site building phase 2 at this stage.  I want absolute confirmation that the builder has completed all works and that, a year and a half into the project, it has completed the design of the hospital.  If it is not completed at this stage, no one can talk about the estimated future cost.  Have all drawings and estimates been given to the builder?<\/p> <p>  We got the report with the figure of &euro;1.433 billion last January or thereabouts.  That was the figure at that stage.  We want a summary of any changes to the design that have been made since that date.  Have all changes been agreed with the builder as feasible?  We want an estimate of any design work that was completed since we got the final gross price of &euro;1.433 billion.  That is reasonable.  We need to know whether the builder is free to build it out or whether is he waiting every month for new designs and different aspects.  That matter has to be clarified.<\/p> <p>  The second matter I wish to clarify is whether there is a confidentiality agreement in the contract.  We hear about commercial confidentiality every time we raise an issue.  This matter has come up.  Is the board bound by any confidentiality agreement?  If so, what are the constraints to what it can say?  We had quite a discussion at this committee on certain aspects, including inflation.  It dawned on me that perhaps there is a confidentiality agreement and there may be limits on what the board can tell us or otherwise.  I would be concerned if the largest capital project in the country has a confidentiality agreement and the contract is completed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019121200002#B00200","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1576141200,"counter":7,"content":"<p>The board told us in the end but it took some time to get there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019121200002#B00300","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1576141200,"counter":8,"content":"<p>Yes, we should clarify it.  I agree.  The board mentioned the claims that are put in every month.  I gather there is a monthly system.  Is that in line with the contract?  We mentioned the windows.  I think ten or 12 are in now.  Will there be a claim for the windows?  I am using that as an example since it is the most visible aspect of the building.  What if something comes up relating to claims for windows?  I am using that example because it is obvious.  I am sure it will take months to complete all the windows and fenestration of the building.  Is a claim put in every month for the windows being put in?  Is that part of the contract?  Should there be a claim for the thing <i>in toto<\/i>?  We want to get a feel for how the process is running.  I am sorry that they are small points but they are issues that I had meant to mention the previous day.  We will include that on the list of items for the paediatric hospital board.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019121200002#B00400","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1576141200,"counter":9,"content":"<p>Last week I looked for an updated list.

We never published it but we will formally publish it as we discussed it the last day.<\/p> <p>  The next item is 2598 B from Mr. William Beausang, assistant secretary, Department of Education and Skills, dated 29 November.

I was speechless when I read the letter and I want to make a number of recommendations.<\/p> <p>  I will give some context to the letter.  We had a report or examination of the commercialisation of intellectual property from 2009 to 2011 carried out by Peter McLoone on behalf of the Higher Education Authority, HEA.  We know that it is an unpublished report.  The Attorney General has said that the HEA had operated outside its remit and for that reason the report could not be published.  I understand more than 50 people contributed to the process, including whistleblowers who had concerns about the process and, to be fair, others who had an alternative view.  Having said that, there was a report but it was not published.<\/p> <p>  We had asked the Department to use its powers.  A Minister could appoint an examiner or investigator and the examiner could look at the functions of the board and the governance, oversight and management of potential conflicts of interest between 2009 and 2011, including Aceno mobile technologies.  That would have been covered under the examination.  It looks like the Minister had signed off on it and procurement was put in place to allow it to happen.  This needs to happen to ensure that we follow this process through fairly for all of those who have come forward and made submissions for the previous report.<\/p> <p>  Bizarrely, the Department is saying that it met the board of Waterford Institute of Technology on 24 October.  The board informed the Department that it is carrying out its own external expert review looking at \"governance procedures currently in place\".  These are two completely different issues.  Whatever is currently in place is great.  We know there have been improvements in some areas since the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The Accounting Officer accepted many of the recommendations and points in the report.  We know improvements have been made in governance of this area since these issues first came to light.<\/p><p>An external examination by Waterford Institute of Technology of current arrangements is not the issue here.  While that will be of value, it does not in any way supersede, and should not interfere with, the process that looks back at 2009 and 2011.  They are two entirely separate processes.  I do not see any overlap whatever here.<\/p><p> I will put a question to the Comptroller and Auditor General, although I will not ask him to comment on the response of the Department.  The Comptroller and Auditor General has experience of producing reports.  Does he see an overlap between the two examinations that will now be done?  In other words, if the board is appointing an external contractor to examine current procedures and the Department had an examination done of a different time period, is that an overlap?  Would there be a difficulty in conducting the two processes at the same time?  Are the two examinations doing two different things?  Would the Department's review, as set out here, do something entirely different from what the external contractor appointed by the board of Waterford Institute of Technology is doing, namely, examining contemporary issues and what is in play at the moment?  Are they two separate processes?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019121200002#B00900","speaker":"1258","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1576141200,"counter":15,"content":"<p>I suppose the key risk that I would see in a situation like this where the same subjects are being looked at but in different time periods is that one would have different standards and different criteria being applied.  However, that is then a debate about what is the appropriate set of criteria to examine.  Looking at a process that is currently in place and a process that applied a decade ago, it should be capable of being managed in a way that there would not be an unmanageable overlap.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019121200002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1576141200,"counter":16,"content":"<p>That is how we should proceed.  Other members of the committee may take a different view but I utterly reject the content of the letter and the proposal made by the Department.  It is not acceptable.  I would also go a bit further than the Comptroller and Auditor General because the two processes are entirely different.  A review of what is happening now will not examine anything that happened in 2009 and 2011.  The review is looking at what procedures are in place now to oversee potential conflicts of interest when intellectual property is commercialised in the here and now, as opposed to what happened in 2009 and 2011, which is entirely different.  That was the basis of the McLoone report, which was never published.  We cannot throw whistleblowers under the bus, which is what the Department would be doing here.<\/p> <p>  The Department's letter also states that, following the Waterford Institute of Technology external review of what is currently in place, \"a decision will be made as to whether it is necessary to re-engage with the HEA\".  Of course, that is necessary because two different issues are being examined.  This is a case of kicking the can down the road and conflating issues.  It is completely and utterly wrong and it is doing an injustice to all of those who have come forward.<\/p> <p>  The president of Waterford Institute of Technology has asserted a number of times that much of the commentary in this committee in respect of WIT is unfair.  I have rejected that view in the past.  I want to be fair to everybody concerned, namely, Waterford Institute of Technology, those who were in place in the research bodies in 2009 and 2011 and those who came forward.  The only way to do that is to have a proper independent process appointed by the Minister in which there is a proper examination of the issues.  Whatever that report says, it says.  All we are interested in are the facts of what happened at that time.  That is fair to everybody.<\/p> <p>  We need to tell the Department there is no overlap and the Minister's recommendation on this review should proceed forthwith.  If the Department is not agreeable to that, we should ask Mr. Beausang, who is acting on behalf of the Secretary General who had to recuse himself from dealing with this issue due to a conflict of interest, to appear before the committee in January, if necessary.  We will see what his response is but I put Mr. Beausang on notice that I am not happy with the response the committee has received.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019121200002#C00300","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1576141200,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I support Deputy Cullinane's position.  I would not be as <i>au fait<\/i>with the minutiae as the Deputy but I followed this case when representatives of Waterford Institute of Technology, including its president, appeared before the committee.  I had concerns at that time about intellectual property rights and spin-out companies.  I know now that there are also spin-in companies.  There were issues with the college itself and then bigger issues that we need to look at in the future.<\/p><p>The third paragraph on page 3 of the letter states that the Minister for Education and Skills recently approved a recommendation for a review.  He made that recommendation with the usual caution that there should not be any comment on the actions of any individuals.  However, a sensible decision was made that &quot;a review should be carried out of the performance of the Governing Body of WIT of its functions concerning the governance, oversight and management of potential conflicts of interest arising in relation to commercialisation activities of TSSG in WIT between 2009 and 2011&quot;.  That is a sensible, practical decision referring to a specific period of time and looking at governance issues.  The letter goes on to state that the terms of the review had been finalised and the Department had initiated a procurement process for a reviewer.  This is followed by the caution.  However, the next paragraph bears no connection with that paragraph.  It starts with the word &quot;Finally&quot;, which just does not make sense here.  The Minister makes a decision, sets the terms of references, decides the period of time and then the next paragraph states, &quot;Finally, the Department met with representatives of the GB of WIT on 24th October&quot;.  It goes on to advise that the Chair told the Department of Education and Skills that the board was doing its current review now.  Suddenly, the Department rolls over and says that is okay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019121200002#C00400","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"speech","time":1576141200,"counter":18,"content":"<p>However, there is no review of that period.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019121200002#C00500","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1576141200,"counter":19,"content":"<p>I understand that.

A follow-on paragraph should have been included explaining that when the Department met the governance board of Waterford Institute of Technology, it decided to give in or that the board's arguments were stronger.  It should have given some reason for the Department deciding to give up with regard to its decision to have an independent review.  This does not make sense.  I doubt the Chairman has ever seen a letter like that.  I certainly have not seen one, certainly not with regard to the two paragraphs I have cited which have no connection with each other.<\/p> <p>  This has serious implications for the committee in terms of when issues emerge or members have concerns.  We took a moderate approach and we did not go overboard.  We raised concerns and tried not to personalise the issue.  The provocation was not on our part.  We could have ended up personalising the issue but we resisted that temptation and tried to stay with the issues.  This has serious implications beyond this issue.  It also has serious implications for intellectual property rights generally and how the universities and third level institutions are dealing with them and what the State is getting back.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019121200002#C00600","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"speech","time":1576141200,"counter":20,"content":"<p>We will conclude on this issue.

These issues occurred in Waterford Institute of Technology between 2009 and 2011.  Deputy Cullinane outlined the history of the reports that were to be carried out and that have not been completed for legal reasons.  The Higher Education Authority did not have the authority to do so.  It is clear, however, that the Department had agreed to examine these matters.  According to the letter, the terms of reference for the review had been finalised and the Department had initiated the relevant procurement process to appoint a reviewer.  Therefore, the Department had committed money to this process by commencing the procurement process.  It was well down the road of doing this.  It had decided to do it and had commenced the process of appointing the reviewer.  That report will be in relation to 2020.  The board is conducting a review, which is fine and good.  We welcome that and the board should do that because it should be happy with the current arrangements.  However, that has no relevance to what happened in 2009 and 2011.  I do not accept the statement in the letter regarding a \"clear potential for overlap\".  I cannot see for the life of me the overlap between something that happened in 2010 and something that might happen this year or next year.  If there is potential for overlap between two different groups looking at a particular topic, they should be able to manage any conflict or overlap.<\/p><p>If the Department is saying it is not capable of managing an overlap, I would be very worried about it.  We have the Accounting Officer from the Department of Education and Skills in this committee to ensure there is governance right down the system in terms of the &euro;1.7 billion spent on third level education.  It went down a road to do this review and, as has been said, it capitulated to the board of Waterford Institute of Technology.  We will note and publish this letter but we are sending a copy of it back to Mr. Beausang stating that the view of this committee is that they are to complete the road they had gone down in commencing procurement and that we will hold the Department to account if it walks away from the process it stated it was necessary to do without an adequate explanation.  We will ask Mr. Beausang to have a letter confirming that the Department will reconsider the matter in light of this discussion, that both reviews can proceed and that any conflict or overlap will be managed.

I think we have dealt with that and it is clear where we are going on it in January.<\/p> <p>  The next item of correspondence is 2599 from An Bord Plean&aacute;la, referenced 29 November, relating to information requested by our committee.  There are three issues dealt with, one of which is the review recommendations in respect of a report that was carried out some years ago.  There is a comprehensive report and the actions taken in respect of that previous report.  We will note and publish that.<\/p> <p>  On another item of interest, we asked about the number of material contraventions of local development plans that arose as a result of the An Bord Plean&aacute;la decision.  They state, which is interesting because it means the Committee of Public Accounts is doing its work, that they do not have any statistical information on this and that they are now making arrangements for statistical recording of planning decisions of An Bord Plean&aacute;la which materially contravene the relevant planning authority development plan.  They state: \"This protocol is being developed with a view to implementation in relation to Board decisions made on or after the 1st of January, 2020 with a view to having a complete data set on this for 2020 which would be included in the Annual Report ...\".  They are now commencing the process for the first time ever to gather this information.  We felt it should have been a basic function but at least they are now doing it now as a result of the matter being raised here.<\/p> <p>  The other item in that letter is the integrity of the appeals issue where a Deputy commented in the previous meeting on a particular planning matter.  Some of the objections were not from people whose names were on the letter.  They were fake objections that resulted in an appeal to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  They say that they take the person's name in good faith.  They ask the applicant to comment on the objections.

For example, without naming names, somebody might have been on a contract for seven or eight years.  When RT&Eacute; considered what grade and contract to allocate a person, its terms of reference stipulated they would only look at the years of 2017 and 2018 and yet some of these people were on contracts as long ago as 2012 to 2016.  Therefore, these people have been put at a disadvantage.  They believe that they have been offered grades and salaries that are simply unsustainable for them to work in Dublin.  That is the reality for many of them, about which they are very sore.  An issue has been corrected but, according to these people, it has been unfairly corrected.  Yes, these people have been put on contracts and moved away from freelance contracts they should never have been on but they have been put on low grades, which is unfortunate.<\/p><p> RT&Eacute; does not come under the purview of this committee, which arose when it came before us.

He gave a very comprehensive response and I will touch on the topics.  He supplied a 42-page document that contains outstanding information.  I am saying to the public, and especially to other Accounting Officers, that this is how Accounting Officers should deal with the Committee of Public Accounts when asked questions.  Mr. McKeon was given a list of 20 follow-up questions, provided good information on the day, and answered everything that was possible on the day.  There was openness and candour from them.  We gave them a list of 20 questions and they have come back within a number of weeks with a 42-page response to each of the 20 questions.  They are to be admired for doing so.  Other Accounting Officers should follow suit because it falls into the point whereby people say that people often get a hard time at these meetings.  Witnesses who come prepared and offer information have no trouble at this committee.  Other people who do not have a level of information do not find our meetings as easy but that is our job.<\/p> <p>  I shall call Deputies Munster and Cullinane to speak but first I shall give people a flavour of the contents of the letter.  First, it includes information on the number of fraud cases identified in 2018, and the figures to date for 2019.  There were 32 last year and 16 to date.  <\/p> <p>  There is a note on outsourced training and retained courses by Turas Nua and Seetec. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019121200002#E01500","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1576141200,"counter":59,"content":"<p>Can we start with that note because I asked a question on that matter?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019121200002#E01600","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1576141200,"counter":60,"content":"<p>Let me put this document on the record first.  I suggest that the Deputy marks the points that he wants to deal with because there might be more than one.<\/p> <p>  There is a note on the number of people participating in back to work initiatives.  They include the figures which add up to about 50,000 people, and that is on page 5.  Most of those people are on community employment, rural employment schemes, back to education allowance scheme, and T&uacute;s schemes.  Whereas there is only about 5,000 people on back to work enterprise allowance schemes, short-term enterprise allowance or the part-time job initiative.  It is good to get that information.<\/p> <p>  There is a profile of the debt written off.  A sum of &euro;32 million was written-off in 2010 with, I think, values of under &euro;10,000.  There is a detailed schedule there of what was written off by the Department and written off by the Social Insurance Fund - &euro;35 million.  We discussed that at the meeting and asked for a breakdown. <\/p> <p>  We asked about the cost-effectiveness of An Post's banking charges, and to include the difference with standard banking fees.  They say that approximately 60% of payments in 2018 were by electronic funds transfer, 40% were where the payee presents to the post office and about 1% were where cheques were issued in the post.  There is detailed information.   <\/p> <p>  There is a breakdown of all payments that were made by the Department that directly support families.  We were given very detailed information on that.  <\/p> <p>  There are details on prepayments at the year end.  <\/p> <p>  There is further information on the public services card, the contract and everything relating to that.  <\/p> <p>  There is a note on Turas Nua and Seetec.  Deputy Cullinane wants to comment on that. <\/p> <p>  There is a note on the number of refusals that were subsequently appealed and their decisions and they gave a complete breakdown.  The appeals office allowed approximately 32% of appeals, partially allowed 2% and made a revised decision in 21% of the cases and in about 37% of cases, the appeals were disallowed by the appeals office.  It is roughly 60% where there was some improvement for the applicant and about 40% where the decision of the Department was fully upheld.<\/p> <p>  There is a note on the requirements for a qualified adult allowance in the context of the State contributory scheme.  I raised this issue myself.<\/p> <p>  While people will find this interesting, I will not read out the note.  We asked for a breakdown of the reasons claims are rejected based on the means of the applicant and those rejected based on a lack of contributions or other reasons.  The Department gave the reasons for all of their major schemes as to whether it was means or a lack of information.  A full breakdown consisting of three pages was given and it is important that people take a look at that.  I know many people will want to read the note in detail.<\/p> <p>  There is a note on the review of the 94,000 cases by the Department, to include a breakdown by gender.  That refers to people who had left the workplace early.  The Department gave all of the figures and we mentioned that.<\/p> <p>  There is a note on the five contracts not subject to competitive procurement.  The details have been supplied.<\/p> <p>  I wish to highlight the note that we received on the school meals schemes, to include the number of eligible schools which did not receive a payment in the first term and an update on the operation of the scheme for 2019 and 2020.<\/p><p>If I read it correctly it gives the number of pupils on a county by county basis for the DEIS schools not participating in the school meals programme.  There are 3,317 children in DEIS schools which have not put in place the school meals programme.  That is dreadful.  Those children should be getting those meals.  We will ask the Department in the first instance to communicate with the chairman of the board of each of those schools to find out why the children are not getting what they are entitled to in those DEIS schools.  In Mayo, there are 408 children entitled to this scheme who are not getting it.  That is not acceptable.  Some other counties have much fewer.  The Mayo figure appears to be the highest.<\/p><p> The Department had a separate initiative for non-DEIS schools and there are 6,455 children eligible in schools to receive the school meals programme and those schools have not yet put that in place.  That is approximately 10,000 children entitled to the school meals programme but for some reason the schools are not providing it.  We want the Department to follow up on that and contact each of the schools because it is not fair to the children involved and we want a report on that by the end of March.  We will give them a couple of months to make progress on that but it is something people should know about.<\/p><p> We mentioned fraud cases earlier and in the interest of balance I always ask for the top five settlements, in this case for 2018, pertaining to the Social Insurance Fund to include the amounts recovered.  This refers to employers in respect of redundancy and insolvency payments and in one case the debt was &euro;2.882 million and the Department recovered &euro;2.871 million.  There are other cases for &euro;252,000, &euro;258,000, &euro;313,000, and another employer owed &euro;1.069 million but the Department recovered only &euro;227,000.  A lot of money has to be recovered from employers as well as individual claimants.  We want always to maintain the balance.  It also gives a detailed breakdown of the customer debt where the figures were less than &euro;10,000 and which were written off.  Some go back to 1984, a long time ago. <\/p><p> There are other items in respect of the back to education allowance and exceptional needs in the housing support which will be relevant to the housing topic.  There is also a detailed note on the free travel scheme, the travel pass and the integrated ticketing system. I am just highlighting points.  There are 42 pages which I ask people with an interest to study.  I have only touched on the topics. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019121200002#E01700","speaker":"1216","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1576141200,"counter":62,"content":"<p>On page 3, of section A in respect of the number of fraud cases identified and the public services card, there are two points, namely, failure of a person to complete the registration process and the detection of identity fraud through facial recognition.

I would have thought there was correlation between the unemployment rate and the number of people going through the schemes.  In 2016, when there was a higher rate of unemployment, the cost was &euro;25 million.  The unemployment rate began to fall after that.  In 2017, the scheme cost &euro;57 million.  The unemployment rate fell again in 2018 but the cost was &euro;71 million.  To the end of October, the figure is &euro;51 million.  It strikes me that there is no relationship between the falling unemployment rate and the amount these companies are getting.<\/p> <p>  This means there is a smaller cohort of people and there has to be multiple referrals.  That matches our experience.  It corresponds with what people are telling us.  For example, a person may do a year on a T&uacute;s scheme, then come back in and be referred again.  Then the person goes to sit at a computer and looks at something she could examine at home and there is little intervention.  That is what people are telling us.  I guess other things can be said on another side but that is certainly what we are routinely being told.  There is something out of synchronisation with the unemployment rate and the transfer of funds when we drill down into it.  We should match it against the unemployment rate in each of those years.<\/p> <p>  Another issue is cropping up with the appeals or outcomes of appeals.  This is why it is useful to get these tables.  Let us consider page 19.  There are two areas where I expect the figures to be high.  We have live examples by virtue of the fact that we are assisting people when they come to our constituency offices.  The domiciliary care payment and the invalidity pension are the two I would examine first.  Where the number of reversals of decisions on appeal is high, we have to ask whether the job is being done correctly in the first place or whether there is a waste of money on administration.  I tell people applying for the domiciliary care payment that if they get it first time the should treat it as a bonus, but that they should expect to have to appeal it.  That has been the experience.  This is borne out by the figure of 47% allowed under appeal.<\/p> <p>  For invalidity pension, a person has to be presumed to be ill for at least a year into the future to be considered.  A medic puts that in a letter but it is rejected.  Then we see 36% get it on appeal.  It may well be that the applicant is not giving enough information, but if that is the case, then the Department needs to up its game in terms of the information sought to make a decision on an application.  These schemes require a high level of administration.  This imposes a cost on the Department.  There is a value for money issue apart from the fact that community welfare officers have to discharge a separate function while something is being decided under appeal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019121200002#G00300","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speech","time":1576141200,"counter":76,"content":"<p>In some of these cases, like those referred to by Deputy Murphy, the applicant has gathered more information for the appeal.  Perhaps certain information was unavailable to the Department in the first place.  I always tell people that if they are going for an appeal, they have to have new information to justify a reversal of the decision.  However, that should be done early in the process rather than people having to go through the Department, go for review and then get a file under freedom of information provisions.  I always tell people anytime they get a refusal to put in a freedom of information request.  This allows us to see the reason an application has been refused before appealing it.  We need to know what the Department is thinking.<\/p> <p>  It takes several months to get all of that.  There is nothing in the document about how long people are waiting.  They could be waiting 12 months in some of these cases.  That is a big issue as well in terms of how long the process takes.  The Deputy's comments are totally correct.  If the Department had a better way of getting information earlier, it might obviate the need for so many appeals having in the first place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019121200002#G00400","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1576141200,"counter":77,"content":"<p>I have one question on page 4.

There is a reference to temporary use of the site.<\/p> <p>  Reference is made to the number of people convicted of being in possession of drugs with a minimum value of more than &euro;13,000.  Most people thought there was to be a ten-year mandatory prison sentence or a certain minimum sentence for those caught over that value or a certain number of sentences.  The document gives the breakdown of the 142 people convicted in this category in 2018.  A total of 39 got over five years and four got over ten years while 61 got over three years.  It makes the point that of the 142 persons some 98 of those convicted had part of their suspended by the court.  That is a matter for the judges but often parts of sentences are suspended.  People have asked about the length of sentences.  Sometimes the prison term is part of it and the suspended sentence is part of it too.<\/p> <p>  We asked about the Fines (Payment and Recovery) Act.  A chart is highlighted in the document and the Courts Service gives us the figures.  The document states the number of fines where the due date has passed as a percentage of the total number of fines imposed in the period before the commencement of the Act was 17%.  After the Act was brought in, the figure jumped to 46%.  The value of those payments was 20% before the commencement of the Act.  This relates to the where the fines were paid where the due date has passed.  The figure is now 50%.  The Courts Service is saying that the data suggests more people are waiting longer to address the fine imposed than was the case under the old regime.  The document makes the point that the new regime is not speeding up the collection of fines.

The advertising revenue in 2017 was &euro;5.4 million for the NTA, but it would have passed back &euro;4 million of that to Dublin Bus and &euro;634,000 of it to Bus &Eacute;ireann, totalling &euro;4.634 million that was passed back.  The figures are broadly similar for every year and it looks like the NTA keeps about &euro;1 million of the approximately &euro;5 million to &euro;6 million that comes from that advertising.  The NTA says it uses that for the provision of new bus shelters, the replacement of corroded bus shelters, refurbishment and other sustainable projects.  That is where the money from advertising on bus shelters goes.  We will note and publish this item.<\/p><p> The next item is 2635 B from Mr. Maurice Buckley, chairman of the Office of Public Works, OPW, dated 10 December 2019, providing a response on its involvement in matters related to the new Oireachtas printer.<\/p><p> The next item is 2636 B from Mr. Peter Finnegan, Secretary General, Houses of the Oireachtas Commission, dated 10 December 2019, providing a further report on the purchase of Oireachtas printing equipment and related matters.

The baseline valuation is referred to on the bottom of page 3 and going on to page 4.  The correspondence says there was a review of local property tax conducted by the Department of Finance that was submitted to the Committee on Budgetary Oversight, which is considering it.  When that review is completed, the review of the baseline will be recommenced and referred to the Committee on Budgetary Oversight.

He said he read the transcript of the committee's discussion and that he interpreted that the main issue was the change in the Irish Water payments.  That completely misses the point.  In October 2018, there had been a pointed reference to the fact there had been an increase in local government funding and espousing the virtue of same.  This year, when the figure dropped by &euro;35 million, there was no reference to that whatsoever apart from one line.  I remember that stood out like a sore thumb and I followed that up in the context that this emanated from that change.  This goes to the heart of the matter, but the Secretary General's remark misses the point completely.<\/p> <p>  The subvention has gone off the books and it is akin to the local property tax.  When the local property tax was introduced, the requisite amount of Exchequer funding dropped by some &euro;400 million or &euro;500 million in that case as well.  The money is coming directly out of the Exchequer funding and county councils are moving towards an ideology of self-financing.  That goes to the core of the matter.  The interventions by the State are dropping and there is a focus on county councils becoming more reliant on their income strands, whether that be off the back of commercial rates, property owners or service charges.  That is the key point.  We need to drill that down into where we find the equilibrium and the balance, because to my mind there has been a rapidly decreasing intervention from the central Exchequer in recent decades and that is not allowing local government to perform to the standards it should be doing.  That is the heart of the matter and that reference from the Secretary General misses the point completely.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019121200002#J01400","speaker":"1218"},{"type":"speech","time":1576141200,"counter":128,"content":"<p>We need to write back to the Department asking for a timescale on when this is expected to commence and when it would expect to report.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019121200002#J01500","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1576141200,"counter":129,"content":"<p>I suspect it is probably a political decision.  I concur with the point Deputy Cassells makes that it was really a three-card trick.  The expectation was that local property tax would be additional to the Local Government Fund.  In fact, what happened is that the local property tax was substituted for it and there was a growth in commercial rates to fill up the shortfall.  The Comptroller and Auditor General has referred to the complexity of local government funding, which those of us who have been in local authorities know.  I do not think it is appreciated by the public, as there was an expectation that there would be some additionality.  That is part of the problem, but it is reinforced by virtue of the fact that new needs are not counted at all, and that is where the baselines come in.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019121200002#K00100","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speech","time":1576141200,"counter":130,"content":"<p>We will note and publish that and we will ask for a timescale from the Department.

We will deal with No. 2595 C, dated 29 November, which is from an individual who makes some points concerning the Oireachtas printer.  Members can read that, and those matters can be discussed in the afternoon.  No. 2597 C is dated 29 November and is from an individual about the public services card.  The individual makes some corrections to previous correspondence.  We agreed to provide details of who was at the meeting when the individual's previous item was considered.  He is unhappy with the level of consideration he believes the committee gave to his correspondence.  It is important to point out that we have given the matter of the public services card considerable attention to date and we may return to it in the future.  Members are free to raise matters referred to in the individual's correspondence if they so wish.  We do not publish category C correspondence.  We have discussed the matter at length and, no doubt, we will probably come back to it again.  Is it agreed that we note this item?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  No. 2617 C is further correspondence from the individuals who call themselves B and C, dated 5 December 2019, providing a link to an item on social media regarding matters at the University of Limerick.  Is it agreed that we note this item?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  No. 2618 C is from Deputy Alan Kelly, dated 3 December 2019, requesting the committee to make inquiries regarding Cork Institute of Technology.  There is a detailed list of approximately 60 specific questions to which he wants replies.  I have not read the details, but I think we will have to hold over the matter because the Deputy is not here.  I understand the content, but in any event we would want the secretariat to be happy with the format, wording and appropriateness of the phraseology of any letter going out from the Committee of Public Accounts, rather than from an individual Deputy.  I do not argue with the points Deputy Kelly raised but we would want a response to meet the norms of committee correspondence.  Is it agreed that we hold over this matter because Deputy Kelly is not here?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  No. 2621 C is from an individual dated 14 November 2019 with further queries regarding wards of court.  We wrote to the individual recently providing information that was requested from the Courts Service and providing a link to the transcript because some matters in relation to the wards of court were dealt with during the meeting.  We have advised the correspondent that the matter can best be dealt with elsewhere and we do not intend to pursue the matter further.  Our discussion on the wards of court today is about transitioning to the new arrangement.  As we already know, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice and Equality did publish a report on wards of court which was debated on the floor of the D&aacute;il some time ago.  Given those debates that have taken place the Committee of Public Accounts cannot revisit the matter because we are subsidiary to the D&aacute;il not above it.  Is it agreed that we note the item?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  No. 2622 C is from an individual dated 26 November 2019, who is making some points about procurement in the HSE.  The individual is advocating for the publication of award notices on foot of contracts as it could encourage SME participation in the tender process.  That is a valid point.  It probably arises from the person watching our discussion on the national children's hospital last week.  We will be returning to procurement matters in the new year. Is it agreed that we note the item?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  No. 2623 C is from an individual dated 1 December 2019, who is requesting the committee to investigate the disbursement of EU funds by the Irish Aviation Authority, IAA, and alleges that the authority is operating a confidential payroll.  However, no details are given.  I propose that with the individual's permission, we forward the item to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, as it is a transport issue, to provide a response regarding the disbursement of EU funds.  The IAA is a wholly-owned commercial semi-State company.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform is the main shareholder in the company.  We will progress the matter once the person gives consent to forward the letter, because that is the era we are in now.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  No. 2624 C is from an individual dated 4 December 2019, who is making some points regarding the procurement of chaplaincy services in the third level sector.  The individual alleges that a number of institutions are not compliant with procurement rules when it comes to chaplaincy contracts.  With the individual's permission, I propose we forward the item to the Higher Education Authority, HEA, for a response.  We have to go back and get permission to forward the person's details to the HEA for a response.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019121200002#K00200","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1576141200,"counter":131,"content":"<p>Are we then going to follow up with the HEA when we get permission from the individual?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019121200002#K00300","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"speech","time":1576141200,"counter":132,"content":"<p>Yes, when we have the permission.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019121200002#K00400","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1576141200,"counter":133,"content":"<p>I have read the letter and it is interesting in terms of the 2016 report from the HEA which makes recommendations on value for money and chaplains.

The first one is from the Health Research Board, which got a clear audit opinion except for the normal reference by the Comptroller and Auditor General that the cost of superannuation entitlements are accounted for as they become payable rather than in the year entitlements are earned, which is standard in the health bodies.  The Environmental Protection Agency got a clear audit opinion for its 2018 accounts.<\/p> <p>  Interestingly, the next one is the regulator of the national lottery.  In 2018 it had an income of &euro;1.5 million.  The first thing that strikes me is that its accounts were certified by the Comptroller and Auditor General on 17 June and it has taken almost six months for them to be laid before the Oireachtas.  We will write to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  The national lottery legislation was sponsored by the then Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, so it comes under the remit of that Department.  We will ask the reason for the delay.  Next, is the national lottery fund.  I presume that is the prize fund of &euro;494 million that is disbursed.  Again, the accounts were certified by the Comptroller and Auditor General on 18 June and it has taken almost six months for them to be laid before the Oireachtas.<\/p> <p>  I know the matter of the regulator is being discussed by the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach so we will not get into any unnecessary duplication.  The only point I will make is that the National Lottery Act 2013 stated the regulator shall be appointed by the Minister on such terms and conditions, including remuneration, as the Minister may determine.  That is in section 7(2).  It also states that the accounts are to be submitted not later than four months from the year end for certification by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  I take it if Mr. McCarthy had his work done by 17 June that he received the accounts in good time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019121200002#K00800","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1576141200,"counter":137,"content":"<p>Yes.

Because there is an issue in terms of how the regulator performs its functions, I think we should ask about the process involved in appointing the regulator by the Department.  We will write to the Department to ask about two issues: first, to ask the reason it took the regulator of the national lottery and the national lottery fund almost six months to lay the accounts before the Oireachtas and; second, the process of appointing the regulator.  All too often, as people have said in the past, regulators are asleep at the wheel.  I do not suggest that is the case here, but we must be satisfied as to the process for appointing the regulator and the competence of the regulator.  We can hand it over to the other committee then.  We will not be holding any hearings on it but it would be remiss of us not to ask the question given that the accounts are before us today.<\/p> <p>  Next, we have the accounts for the Dublin Institute of Technology, DIT.

We will plan our work programme such that we are not caught when we come back in the new year.  The secretariat can make the necessary arrangements.  Deputy Cassells will be pleased to hear that our first meeting in the new year will be with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, although that is subject to confirmation.  It is scheduled for 16 January.  The next meeting will take place on 23 January and involve representatives of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  On 30 January, we will meet representatives of the Department of Education and Skills regarding its appropriation account, Vote 26, chapter 7 - purchase of sites for school provision and special report No. 107 on the delivery of capital projects in the higher education sector.  The committee has not yet examined the latter report.  We agreed at our most recent meeting that we would have the Office of Public Works, OPW, in on 6 February to deal with chapter 6 - expenditure under a maintenance contract.  It has been suggested that we meet the Departments of Children and Youth Affairs, Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform and Communications, Climate Action and Environment, as well as Transport Infrastructure Ireland.  I do not think we have had representatives of TII before the committee recently.

Members saw the volume of replies with which we dealt today.  I ask the secretariat to ensure that any outstanding departmental replies to requests for information since we returned after the summer recess be obtained for our first meeting in the new year.  It has several weeks to do that.  Many replies have been received.

Pobal is a State-owned not-for-profit company limited by guarantee.  The company was originally established in 1992 by agreement with the European Commission to manage an EU grant scheme to support local development.  Over time, the functions of Pobal have expanded significantly.  It now functions as an agent for a number of Government Departments and EU bodies providing administration, management and support services for around 25 programmes in the areas of social inclusion and equality, inclusive employment and enterprise and early years education and childcare.  In 2018, Pobal issued grants totalling around &euro;695 million.  As indicated in the figures now on screen, almost 70% of the payments were in relation to childcare programmes funded by the Vote for the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  Other significant areas of grant payment related to community employment schemes funded by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and community services grants funded by the Department of Rural and Community Development.  Pobal recoups its administration costs under the terms of service agreements with the funding Departments.  In 2018, Pobal spent a total of &euro;35.1 million in administration costs and other programme supports.  This comprised &euro;21.7 million in respect of payroll and &euro;13.4 million in non-pay costs.<br\/><br\/>My audit report on the financial statements drew attention to the statement on internal control which disclosed that in 2018 Pobal incurred expenditure to the value of &euro;1.15 million on goods and services, the procurement of which was not compliant with the relevant procedures.  This mainly related to ICT and project management services required to deliver the national childcare scheme.  I also drew attention in the audit report to Chapter 16 of the Report on the Accounts of the Public Services 2018<i>,<\/i><b><i><\/i><\/b>which examines the delivery of early learning and childcare funding programmes.  This deals with Pobal&rsquo;s role in administering the schemes and in ensuring compliance with scheme conditions.

I am accompanied by Mr. Jerry Murphy, our deputy chief executive who has been with the organisation since 2005, and Mr. Brian Lehane, our chief financial officer who joined Pobal in July 2018.  I was appointed as chief executive of Pobal in August this year.  I joined Pobal from St.Michael&rsquo;s House where I was chief executive since 2015.<\/p> <p>  Pobal values the role of this committee and we are here to account for and apply the lessons of this process.  Pobal is a not-for-profit, registered charity and a company limited by guarantee without share capital.  Pobal&rsquo;s board is appointed by the Government under the aegis of the Department of Rural and Community Development.  Established in 1992, Pobal has developed in response to Government priorities over 27 years.  On behalf of Government, our work supports valuable services in marginalised communities.  Our core role is to deliver an effective programme and grant management service in order to create an inclusive society where Government and communities work together.<\/p> <p>  In 2018, Pobal managed 25 programmes, primarily for four Government Departments.  The areas, groups and communities we support are outlined in the briefing document we submitted to the committee.  In managing these programmes in 2018 Pobal disbursed &euro;694.7 million, an increase in expenditure of &euro;79.7 million over 2017.  We supported 2,500 community groups and almost 32,000 individuals through the Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme, SICAP.  We channelled funding to 4,832 early learning and care services, supporting approximately 81,899 families with reduced fees through the community subvention programme.  We also approved 19,000 participants for the seniors alert scheme.<\/p> <p>  In 2018 Pobal employed 442 staff in 2018, with 46% based outside Dublin.  We operate our programmes efficiently.  Our administration spend for 2018 was &euro;29.94 million or 4.10% of budget.  Pobal&rsquo;s budget has evolved to deliver programmes of work in line with Government policy and requirements which make a difference to people&rsquo;s lives.  Funds disbursed moved from &euro;257 million in 2011 to &euro;695 million in 2018.  This reflects changes in Irish society and the Government&rsquo;s commitment to supporting civil society with these changes.<\/p> <p>  As CEO, my vision for Pobal is to deliver a value for money service for Government and to make a difference for people and communities.  The landscape of Irish society has altered significantly, redefining who we are and how we live.  Working with community and voluntary organisations, Pobal aims to build capacity locally and to support sustainable, resilient communities.  In a world increasingly fraught with social challenges, the importance of a strong network of natural community supports is a critical component of individual and collective well-being.  It enables us to meet the challenges of the future.<\/p> <p>  Pobal is committed to ensuring our processes deliver verifiable management of taxpayer&rsquo;s money, while offering user friendly and effective support to all stakeholders.  Our supports assist community organisations to meet their legislative, governance and financial management requirements.  We also provide practical help such as helping hands workshops and managing better guides.  Where possible we utilise information technology to reduce the administrative burden on community organisations.  We have seen remarkable changes across the early learning and care and the school age childcare sector in Ireland in recent years, including the development of the First 5 strategy and the national childcare scheme, of which Pobal is scheme administrator.<\/p> <p>  We are proud of our work but we know we do not always get things right.  We welcome the oversight of the Comptroller and Auditor General and this committee.  This process is important in reminding us of our purpose and in identifying areas for improvement and learning.  The committee is aware the Comptroller and Auditor General highlighted two issues in our 2018 annual financial statements.  I accept that there is a need for improvement in our procurement processes, with non-compliance on a proportion of expenditure on goods and services in 2018.  I take this matter extremely seriously, as does the organisation.  A corrective action plan is in place with targets and timelines for completion.<\/p> <p>  The second note to the accounts relates to Chapter 16 of the 2018 Annual Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General, which examined the administration by Pobal of early learning and childcare funding programmes.  Two of the recommendations in the chapter were directed to Pobal.  However, we understand this chapter will be considered in greater detail at a future meeting of this committee.<\/p> <p>  Looking ahead, in 2020 the Department of Rural and Community Development will undertake a periodic critical review of Pobal under the code of practice for the governance of State bodies.  This is the first such review under the 2016 code.  The Department of Children and Youth Affairs has also indicated it will undertake a major operational review of all its early years programmes and the operating model in the early learning and care sector.  We look forward to both reviews and implementing any recommendations for change and improvement.  The entire team at Pobal works hard to deliver for the communities from which we come and where we live.  It is an important part of our organisational culture that we exist for families and communities who not only need the services and programmes we administer but who also, in real terms, pay for these services.  I thank the committee for the opportunity to appear today and my colleagues and I are happy to take any questions members may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019121200002#P00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Anna Shakespeare"},{"type":"speech","time":1576141200,"counter":166,"content":"<p>Thank you Ms Shakespeare.

These include significant elements of policy making, design, standard setting and oversight that traditionally lie with the Department but because of the intricacies of managing these flows of moneys to so many individual groups the decision was made that there were advantages in having a specialist organisation with the knowledge and infrastructure to do that.  Over many years we have developed staff teams with the experience of the local bodies and how things work, with experience in financial management, compliance and people who are available to interact directly with groups whether in a support role or dealing with issues such as financial compliance.

Having talked to people on the other side who engage with it, although not from the childcare perspective, I note that its services are targeted and focused on outcomes, and that it certainly puts organisations through their paces to ensure there will be good outcomes.  That is definitely a positive in Pobal's work on, for example, community employment schemes and community services.  Nevertheless, in other countries, the delivery arm of such work is local government, whereas we have a centralised, fragmented system.<\/p> <p>  As has been noted, a plethora of organisations deal with childcare.  There are not only the individual childcare providers but also the State providers.  Local authorities provide planning permission and ensure that the ratio of childcare provision in buildings is as is set out in high-level policies.  There are also county childcare committees, Tusla and so on.  It is fragmented.  It is interesting when one hears from somebody on a reception desk at a local authority that if non-Irish nationals ask for services, they expect the services to be delivered at the local authority level but they are not.  We should accept that the service is fragmented to begin with.  We are not especially good at organisation building.<\/p> <p>  How are Pobal's staff levels determined?

My first question relates to the charitable status of community cr&egrave;ches.  The witnesses are probably aware that I was going to bring this up because Revenue was in here.

Why do community cr&egrave;ches have charitable status while non-community cr&egrave;ches that engage with, and are compliant with, the early childhood care scheme cannot avail of that?  Is there a reason?  I understand the not-for-profit element.  It seems an unfair advantage.  If there was a community cr&egrave;che down the road and a private operator, it would be unfair for competition.  Do the witnesses think that all cr&egrave;ches should be granted charitable status if they want it or that the way that we are going, with community cr&egrave;ches having charitable status, is okay?  If there is a profit, do community cr&egrave;ches use surplus money to employ additional staff?  Are they eating into their profits and, therefore, having better ratios and better services?  Do they provide a better service than the person up the road who is trying to operate a business?  It is about fairness in the system.

Many of the participants are people who come from complex situations and have not managed to get employment and are given this pathway to work.  However, the scheme expires in 12 months, which is relatively short given it takes participants three or four months to become familiar with the work.  I have raised with the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Regina Doherty, a request for the scheme to be extended to 18 months or two years such that participants can remain in it and be more useful or move to another job.

The Chairman is correct.<\/p> <p>  The management board received a business case on 6 November.  As I said, two main reasons were advanced for the purchase of the Komori printing press.  First was the age of the existing equipment.<\/p><p>In 2017, the equipment we had on hand at that stage was 12 years old.  The equipment was purchased in 2004 and I believe it went into operation in 2005, so we were looking at equipment that was fully depreciated.  It was also proving increasingly unreliable so in terms of the maintenance costs we would incur on equipment of that age, we were spending probably about &euro;45,000 per year on maintenance.  In addition to that, we were incurring about &euro;20,000 in spare parts when repairs were needed.  I am advised by the print manager that it was not an infrequent occurrence to have a mechanic out repairing the two printing presses.<\/p><p> If we look at it purely in cost terms over five years and ask if the argument for buying a printing press stacks up, we note the cost of maintenance and repairs comes in at around &euro;65,000 a year.  If we multiply that by five, we are at &euro;325,000.  In addition, we were faced with a decision that if we were to continue with the Heidelberg printing presses, we would have to do a major overhaul of them because of their age.  That was expected to cost &euro;170,000.  In very round terms, therefore, the cost of retaining the Heidelberg printing press over five years was somewhere of the order of &euro;500,000.  When we look at that in the context of the purchase of a new machine, and the new Komori printing press came in at &euro;848,000, we can see the financial sense in terms of moving from the old Heidelberg to the new machine.<\/p><p> The second point to note is the volume of the printing.  We have a significant printing operation.  Last year, the Oireachtas produced, and I have produced the statistics in the report, of the order of 16 million print impressions.  The year before that it was 21 million.  If we go back to 2015, we produced 26 million print impressions, so the Oireachtas printing unit is quite a sizeable operation.  In the circumstances, we need good, robust, versatile, well-built equipment.  That was the reason we went out to tender.<\/p><p> In addition to the printing press, we needed a number of other items of printing equipment.  We produced a tender and split it into five lots.  The reason we split it into five lots was to maximise competition, and particularly to enable small and medium sized enterprises to compete for the business.  That is something we like to do as a matter of policy in the Houses of the Oireachtas Service.  The tender was published on 5 March 2018.  The records we have obtained show that 12 companies downloaded the tender documentation from eTenders so there was a fair degree of interest, naturally enough, in the contract.  That is not surprising, given the expected value.<\/p><p> The site visits during the tender period, which would be a normal activity during tendering, took place on 21 March.  At that stage, people could go and look at the print unit.  On foot of those site visits, clarifications were received on 29 March.  All of those clarifications were answered and the results circulated to all of the parties concerned.  The closing date for the tender was 5 April 2018.<\/p><p> In terms of what the request for tenders document sought in respect of the printer, the precise wording was that the tender must be able to fit into a room 12 m by 5.8 m by 2.5 m.  The most important measurement is the last one, the 2.5 m, which would have been the ceiling height of the printing unit.  We also stipulated that there needed to be an acceptable work area around the press.<\/p><p> When the tenders were subsequently received we only got one tender in, despite the initial level of interest, for the printing press.  That came from Komori.  In the tender response document, which I reviewed as part of the preparation of the report, Komori ticked the box saying that it met the minimum specification in that the printing press could fit into the room with those dimensions, with an acceptable work area around it.  Underneath the box with the minimum specifications a note was included.  The words of that note are important.  They state that the headroom from the press foot boards to the ceiling is limited.  <\/p><p> During the tender period, one of the clarifications received was from Komori.  Komori asked the print facility if there was a false ceiling and, if so, if there was a height greater than 2.5 m available.  The response they got back from the print facility was that there was a false ceiling and that there was an extra 35 cm available.  That increased the available height from 2.5 m to 2.85 m.<\/p><p> To give the members a sense of the Komori printing press, it is a big machine.  It is 7.4 m long, 3.2 m wide and 1.98 m in height.  I spoke to somebody in the print industry recently about it and asked him how he would describe this type of machine.  This would be a very experienced person in the industry.  He said it was a very versatile machine.  It is the type of machine one would buy if one is doing short runs, long runs and if one has many different types of print requirement, which is exactly the position we are in.  He also said it was a well-built machine.  He said that the company he runs has a number of different makes of printing press and that the Komori is the best of the ones he has; that is his personal view.  The third comment he made was that it is economical in terms of the purchase price of the press and that it was an economical press to run.  The evidence I have received is that it is a good, solid printing press.<\/p><p> The other point to remember about printing is that most commercial printing is a 24-7 type of operation.  A printing press like this one gives us greater capacity in that area.  At the moment, we run two shifts in the print unit but, going forward, there are other options as well.<\/p><p> Following the submission of the tenders, the evaluation team looked at them.  I have listed the members of the evaluation team in an appendix.  Would the Chairman like me to read it out for the record?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019121200002#MM01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Finnegan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1576141200,"counter":800,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019121200002#NN00200","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1576141200,"counter":801,"content":"<p>The evaluation team is the fifth group shown.  The project manager, who is basically the head of the evaluation team, is the print manager.  We had the print supervisor from the print facility.  The project sponsor was a principal officer who is the head of communications.  We had a procurement unit representative, and we also had an external procurement consultant who has done a substantial amount of work with the Houses of the Oireachtas over the years.<\/p> <p>  The evaluation team looked at all of the tenders, including the one on the Komori printing press.  As I said in my report, the evidence I got was that they missed the statement on the bottom of the page, which said that the head height was limited.  They proceeded to arrange a clarification meeting with Komori, being the single tender, which would be standard practice.  Five Oireachtas staff members attended that meeting and three representatives from Komori - the managing director, the project director and also the managing director of their Irish agent.  A variety of issues were discussed at that meeting.  I have looked at the report.  Interestingly, head height did not come up at that meeting.  At the end of the meeting, it was agreed that Komori would submit various documents by way of clarification.  Standard things one would expect in any type of procurement process would be the engineering team, the software support, the organisational chart and so on.<\/p><p>Those papers were submitted on 25 April 2018 and included among them was a drawing, which I think I have included as an appendix to the report.  Committee members can see it is a drawing by a professional engineer or draughtsperson.  It is Appendix B of the report on the machine.  I have spoken to the managing director of Komori's Irish agent who told me the submission of such a drawing would be standard during a procurement process, particularly at that stage.  That drawing recommended a minimum ceiling height of 3.16 m.  As I said in my report, that drawing was sent to the procurement unit.  I cannot find any evidence that it was sent to the print facility.  In fact, the issue does not actually turn on that, as will become evident in a minute.<\/p><p> The next stage in the process was for the Oireachtas contracts committee to meet and consider the matter.  I have listed the Oireachtas contracts committee at the very bottom of the Appendix C.  It is chaired by a principal officer who works in the committee secretariat.  It includes two assistant principal officers, one from the ICT unit and one from the Debates unit.  It includes higher executive officers from the Library and Research Service, the Finance unit and the Journal Office and the secretariat is provided by the procurement team.  The committee has a role in a number of areas.  It is charged under its terms of reference with reviewing contracts where it is proposed for exceptional reasons not to have a competitive process, and this did not apply in this instance, or where only one tender was received in response to an advertisement or invitation to tender and the contract value is in excess of &euro;65,000 exclusive of VAT.  This is the heading under which this tender was referred.  The third reason, which is not relevant but I will say it for the record, is where it is proposed not to accept the lowest priced tender.  The Oireachtas contracts committee considered the tender and signed off on it.  That day, Komori was informed by letter that it was the preferred bidder for the contract.<\/p><p> The next important event in the narrative was on 21 May when a team from Komori came in and took measurements.  I spoke to the managing director of the Irish agent who was present on that day.  His evidence to me was the issue of head height was absolutely discussed at it but everybody in the room was happy there was sufficient head height to install that printer.  He said they then moved on to other technical issues related to the installation of the printer.  He also said that one of the reasons they were satisfied with it was that 90% of the work on the printer is done from the very lowest platform and in the case of the lowest platform head height is not an issue because the 2.1 m clearance can be achieved when standing on the lowest platform.  He said in relation to the tasks that must be carried out from higher platforms they can also be done from the lower platform.  There was no real concern in the room or no sense that head height was a particular issue.  The measurements were done and a number of days later Komori sent in the drawing that was submitted on 25 April to the print facility manager.  The drawing was sent in connection with discussions being had on installation.  Essentially, this was how the new printing press would be delivered and installed in the Oireachtas printing unit.<\/p><p> The next most significant date is 31 May.  On that date the contract was signed.  The day before that, the print facility emailed our facilities unit stating it had procured a new printer, that it reckoned certain work needed to be done including removing doorframes, which would be pretty standard, and asking the facilities unit look to at the matter.  That process got under way.  On 14 August 2018, the OPW came back and said it reckoned more significant work was required because of the head height requirement.  The OPW architect at the time had done her own research and came to the view that the height available in the print room was insufficient to meet the various regulations, including machinery directives and building regulations.  At that stage, further investigations had to be done and Mr. McMahon will fill in the committee on the detail of these investigations.  From the files I have reviewed there appears to have been quite a lot of over and back.<\/p><p> The other thing that is very evident is that in parallel with what was happening in the printing unit we were also working on the historic Leinster House restoration project.  There was pressure on the time of architects and engineers and all of that had to be managed as part of the process.<\/p><p> In December, the printing press had been delivered from Japan and it was being held in storage.  A decision was made by the project sponsor that we should pay for it because we had the money set aside in our budget for 2018; there were no funds earmarked for 2019; 60% of the cost of the press was due anyway on delivery; and the delays in terms of installation were very much down to problems on the Oireachtas side.  The project sponsor went to our Office of the Parliamentary Legal Adviser and asked them to draw up an addendum to the contract which would give the Oireachtas full title over the machine.  That was done and the addendum was signed.  I received a submission on 12 December from the project sponsor setting out the issue.  When I was satisfied as Accounting Officer that there was a legal obligation to pay the money and that the title was secured I authorised the payment.<\/p><p> I should say in relation to the addendum that the expectation at that time was that the printing press would be installed at Easter 2019.  It was anticipating somewhere of the order of three months before the printing press was installed.  As it turned out, it took considerably longer than that.  The works eventually got under way in the middle of July 2019.  They were handed back to the print facility on 12 November.  In the meantime, the printing press was delivered on 28 September.<\/p><p> That brings the story up to date in terms of the issues initially of concern.  I have set out in the report where we are now.  It is pretty much as is in the report from two days ago.  We are doing our health and safety assessments.  We have a health and safety adviser who does a lot of this for us.  He is doing that in terms of his workflow and also doing some workflow assessments that were raised by the staff.  The expectation is that those assessments will be ready by 20 December, which is Friday week.  That is the objective.  Subject to everything being okay from a health and safety point of view and in terms of workflow, at that point it should be possible, in conjunction with the staff, to start the process of training and operation of the printing press.<\/p><p> As I said in my report at the end of my opening remarks, there is absolutely no doubt that mistakes were made in this project.  A series of mistakes was made.  My investigations included reviewing documents and speaking to the personnel involved.<\/p><p>In fairness to them, they were very forthcoming.  It is difficult for people who find themselves in a situation where they have made a serious error but I commend them on the way they have faced up to it.  It is my conclusion that the mistakes that were made were honest mistakes and that is the expression I used in my report.  Ultimately, the staff were trying to do their best for Members.  They were trying to improve the quality of the services that we provide to Members by upgrading the printing equipment which, as I said, was 12 years old and was going to be very costly to keep on the road.  The aim was to replace it with a new, modern, well-built and versatile printing press.  That is the narrative.  On the building side, I would have to defer to Mr. McMahon if anyone wants to know about the detail of some of the construction works.  Essentially, that is the position as I found it when I conducted my investigation and drew up my report.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019121200002#NN00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Finnegan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1576141200,"counter":804,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Finnegan for outlining the situation.

I said that there were a number of lessons that stand out and these will be addressed as a matter of priority.  The very first one is that all of the project teams must include specialist architectural expertise where a project could involve structural modifications and where appropriate, legal external subject matter and health and safety expertise.  In reality, if this project had been run the way one would have expected, we would have had an architect on the team.  Discussions would have taken place at a very early stage and those discussions would have been reflected in the nature of the business case.  The business case that was received referred to the purchase of an asset but did not make any reference whatsoever to ancillary works.  This was looked at by a range of people within the Oireachtas, not just the project team.  At the time, we had a committee that looked at business cases of this nature.  That committee examined the business case.  The committee in question is the business and strategy committee which was headed by the then Superintendent.  It also included the head of communications at principal level, a principal from committees, a principal from the Office of Parliamentary Legal Adviser, a principal from the Oireachtas Library and Research Service, the principal and head of finance of the Office of the Commission and Secretary General, the chief translator and an assistant principal at the Office of the Commission and Secretary General.  All of those people looked at it.  In actual fact, three or four of the members of that business and strategy sub-committee went over to the printing unit.  They went into the rooms where the printer was going to be installed but the issue of height never actually came up.  There was no sense at all that height was an issue.  When one looks back at the papers and the evidence, one sees that the perspective was that the project involved the purchase of an asset and the complexities around the installation of that asset were not considered at all.  It was just assumed that the asset that we were purchasing, the new printing press, could replace the old Heidelberg printing presses.  That was how it was at the time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019121200002#PP01800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Finnegan"},{"type":"speech","time":1576141200,"counter":821,"content":"<p>Deputy Munster is next.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019121200002#PP01900","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1576141200,"counter":822,"content":"<p>Mr. Finnegan said in his opening remarks that he is on the management board or management committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019121200002#PP02000","speaker":"1333"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1576141200,"counter":823,"content":"<p>I am, yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019121200002#PP02100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Finnegan"},{"type":"speech","time":1576141200,"counter":824,"content":"<p>Was he involved from the start?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019121200002#PP02200","speaker":"1333"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1576141200,"counter":825,"content":"<p>No, other than when the management board received the business case.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019121200002#PP02300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Finnegan"},{"type":"speech","time":1576141200,"counter":826,"content":"<p>Will Mr. Finnegan clarify if he works on a one-year or three-year budget?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019121200002#QQ00100","speaker":"1333"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1576141200,"counter":827,"content":"<p>Three.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019121200002#QQ00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Finnegan"},{"type":"speech","time":1576141200,"counter":828,"content":"<p>Since it is a three-year budget, is it the case that a decision was taken, because the Oireachtas Service had money left over and Mr. Finnegan did not want to hand it back to the Central Fund, to go on a shopping spree?

I looked back, just to satisfy myself, to see what was the scale of the works that were done in 2004 when the original print equipment went in.  The cost of the works in 2004 was twice the cost of the works that took place in connection with the Komori printer.  That gives some sense of the scale of what has to be done when equipment needs to be installed in the Oireachtas.  We are not an organisation that has the luxury of installing equipment in a greenfield site.  We are not Google down in the docks.

On the day Mr. Finnegan was in, he was not asked anything by anybody, he was asked a question by me specifically in relation to office equipment and ICT services.

He mentioned on the ICT side the replacement of laptops and he also mentioned the printer, which he said cost &euro;1.3 million.  Mr. Finnegan then said he could only answer the question he was asked.  The problem is if we are not given the information we cannot ask the questions.  I will get to the point in a moment.  Mr. Finnegan said there is one line in the report which said there may have been some difficulties.

The Comptroller and Auditor General educates us and has done so for a long time on the importance of business cases.  One element of a business case is the rationale.  The other element is that one lines up one's ducks and that everything is, as much as possible, anticipated.  That certainly was not done in this situation because Mr. Finnegan went on to say and acknowledged that there were serious mistakes.  It would be better in this report if Mr. Finnegan had said the rationale for the purchase was sound but that mistakes were made in relation to the business case.<\/p><p>Mr. Finnegan said there was a series of mistakes.

I would like to know not the individual or even the department he or she worked in but whether the mistakes Mr. Finnegan states were made as a consequence of human error were made by the company selling the printer, the OPW or the people who were developing the business case?

On the Monday morning when I came into work, I sent an email to the clerk of the committee.  I told him I was going to do a report and that I would aim to have it for the committee on the following Thursday, which was 28 November.  On Monday, 25 November, Tuesday, 26 November, and Wednesday, 27 November, we basically collated all the information we could in that short period.  I had a team of people working with me.  They worked incredibly hard pulling together the report.  The first report was based on the level of knowledge we had at that time.  There were certain unanswered questions that I actually could not answer at that particular time.  It was not that I did not want to answer them but I actually did not have the answers.<br\/><br\/>I obviously had more time to produce the second report.  I went through as many of the emails as I possibly could.  I had the opportunity to sit down and do a full debrief with particular individuals.  I had the opportunity to have a telephone conversation with the managing director of Komori's Irish agent.  A lot more went into that.  The additional time I had reflects the difference between the two reports and why I was able to say a series of mistakes were made.<br\/><br\/>With regard to the mistakes, from the very beginning the first and fundamental mistake was the absence of architectural input on the evaluation team.  That was absolutely critical.  If we had had architectural input on the evaluation team, in my view the issue of head height would have been identified right at the very start.  That, in turn, would have had an impact on the business case.  The second recommendation that I have is that the business cases must include an estimate of the cost of ancillary works and items.  We would have had a truer cost for these works, which would have been incorporated in the business case.<br\/><br\/>The other issue relates to issues that arose during the course of the procurement process.  Mistakes were made in terms of not picking up on the drawing that was submitted but, on the flip side of that, it would have been helpful had attention been drawn to that drawing by the Oireachtas parties.  There was just no sense of the head height issue and therefore the drawing did not trigger or ring any alarm bells.  Other mistakes that were made included the fact that the statement in the RFT response was missed.  That was a further mistake.<br\/><br\/>Unfortunately, in this project, as I said in my report, basically there was a series of mistakes.<\/p><p>As the Deputy generously acknowledged, they were honest and human mistakes.  That is what happens occasionally.  It is regrettable that it does happen.  However, as long as one has humans involved in a project, there is always the possibility of a human error.

There is a figure of &euro;1.169 million in the account that Mr. Finnegan referred to a number of times.<\/p><p>That is not the figure he has given us today for what was actually purchased.  It is out by &euro;200,000.  That is the first point I am making.  I thought we would conclude this matter today but I cannot allow that until we get an explanation for the difference of &euro;200,000.  My second point is that Mr. Finnegan said they did not pursue that issue in greater detail.  That was July.  Print equipment was listed at &euro;1.169 million: \"A delay in delivery and installing the printing equipment was due to a requirement (not originally anticipated) to upgrade the print room to meet health and safety standards which will be completed in July 2019.\"  That is the month we were here.  There is a reference there to &euro;1.169 million.  The figure Mr. Finnegan has given us today for completing all the works done, including the OPW work, is &euro;2.02 million.  That is an increase of 73%.  I know he did not have the full figures for the &euro;2 million in July but even if we had questioned that, we would only have been halfway to the figure.<\/p><p> The issue here is not that we did not pursue the accounts and the accounts Mr. Finnegan produced refer to &euro;1.169 million.  The public now knows that the final cost, which was not known to Mr. Finnegan fully on the day, is &euro;2.02 million.   The figures being quoted here today, 12 December, have risen by 73% versus those that were quoted here on 11 July.  They have gone up from &euro;1.169 million to &euro;2.02 million.  That is the issue.  There is no indication in that text that structural work is required.  The phrase \"upgrade of print room\" indicates that a new printer is coming in.  It looked a reasonable figure.  There was no suggestion it required structural works to the extent that it did.  The point is that figure is nowhere near the complete figure because Mr. Finnegan did not have it.  It is not fair to say we did not pursue it.  The figure is 73% higher today than was reported by Mr. Finnegan in July.  That is where the public have the concern.  There was a budget at the beginning and the Houses of the Oireachtas Service was within the budget at that point in time, according to this.  However, as the year progressed what was indicated to be &euro;1.169 million turned out to be &euro;2.02 million when all the other work was done.  That 73% increase is why the public is concerned.

I asked him to look at the facts of it.  His position is, as he stated back to me in response, that from his point of view, his company flagged the fact that there was limited head height in the tender response, that the company sent a drawing to us also and that, ultimately, as a company, it would take the view of the available height, which it said was 2.85 m, that it would have installed printing presses in printing works at and below that height.  He said to me that, as a company, Komori would take the view - he was careful to stipulate that he is only the agent and that I would need to speak to the managing director of Komori itself - and the general approach it would take would be that if the customer was happy, Komori would supply the machine and that the legal obligation would be on the customer.  I went back and I checked that with our legal people.  Our legal people advised me that given the warnings, given the fact that there was limited head height, and given the fact that the drawings were sent in etc., we would not be in a position to argue that Komori breached its contract.  That, unfortunately, is the reality.<br\/><br\/>I am exploring other avenues in terms of speaking to our legal advisers to see if there is a possibility that we would set out in writing what happened, the concerns, how we feel the procurement and the provision of the machine were dealt with, and whether they would be prepared on an <i>ex gratia<\/i>basis to make some contribution or gesture to the Houses of the Oireachtas in respect of this machine.

The current printer is 14 or 15 years old and was probably designed four or five years prior to purchase.  It is, therefore, 20 year old technology and quite old.  I suspect there will be long-term cost savings.  I would like the committee to receive a projection cost for the printer versus the operating cost of an inferior printer.  That will be difficult to do because only one quote was received.  However, there are other machines out there.<\/p> <p>  I understand where Mr. Finnegan is coming from in relation to his previous appearance before this committee.  I understand that he has an account of what happened and members have been provided that account.  The Comptroller and Auditor General does his thing with his office and, ultimately, members of the committee ask questions.  I will highlight the point made by the Chairman, which is a worthy one, that there are only two accountants on this committee, both of whom happen to be chartered accountants.  This makes life interesting for Secretaries General and other Departments.  It is important that when we ask a question the witness answers the question to the best of his ability and in his words, and also that he could sometimes provide us with a bit more information.  I think that in July, when Mr. Finnegan appeared before the committee, he knew some of what he knows now and, notwithstanding the fact that the note was missed, there were additional costs that were not included in the account to the reader.  I know Mr. Finnegan has said these were provided further down in the notes and the Comptroller and Auditor General has confirmed that.  Pulling everything together and providing the committee with as much information as possible is absolutely critical when a witness comes before us.  I thank Mr. Finnegan.<\/p> <p>  After the other members have spoken, it would be interesting to hear the Comptroller and Auditor General's view.  I ask Mr. McCarthy to forgive me as I was not present during the previous hearing and did not hear his commentary.

We were aware of that.  It was a charge in the 2018 account.  We were aware that there was a problem.  Our understanding of it was that it was a health and safety consideration in relation to the capacity of the floor to carry the machine.  We were not at all aware of an issue with head height.  When there was any reference to structural works we presumed it was strengthening a floor.  We would have received the financial statements at the end of March.  I reviewed them in May and that was the first I heard that there was an issue around a recognition of a capital asset.  The team had already been talking to the Houses of the Oireachtas about whether or not it was appropriate to recognise capital assets.  We felt it was not and we said that assets that are not even on the premises cannot be recognised as assets on the balance sheet.  We proposed a prepayments note to deal with a number of classes of assets.  We were aware that there might be additional costs associated with the installation of the machine as a result of the floor strengthening, as we understood it, but it was inevitably going to be a 2019 expense.  We were not thinking of it being a 2020 expense.  Therefore, my feeling was that we will look back at this when we come to do the 2019 account and if at that stage there was something that was worth reporting, we would consider making a reference in the audit certificate.  In fact, our first preference and expectation in a situation like this where it is a relatively small-scale expenditure but with a weakness in controls and so on would be that sufficient detail would be given in a note to the accounts to explain what had happened.  Obviously, however, it was all overtaken by events.  Without prejudice to whether I will report anything or encourage any further reporting in relation to the matter for 2019, it has obviously been very well ventilated here, which may mean that I do not need to draw further attention to it in the 2019 accounts or the 2020 accounts when they come to be presented.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019121200002#YY02100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1576141200,"counter":1201,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McCarthy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019121200002#YY02200","speaker":"1300"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1576141200,"counter":1202,"content":"<p>As I said earlier, I probably know 100 times more about this than I did at the start.

That was a very big issue in February, March and April of this year.  When one looks at the history of the project, from the time the OPW said there was actually more to this than we had thought to the time the works commenced, that was over the course of a year.  A lot of works took place over that year.  From looking at the documents, we can see that the floor was a big issue.  The architect brought in Ove Arup, the structural engineers, to look at the floor.  Now that the project is over, there appear to be clear dimensions to the project.  During the course of the year, however, it was actually quite unclear at stages as to what was going on.  That is just the way it was.

This is a general feeling I am getting as a politician, that politics, politicians, civil servants and public servants are playing with taxpayers' money and they do not take accountability.  This is the general feeling out there.  This is another comedy of errors that is happening, whether in Dublin or wherever, and people are very angry over it.  They are angry because we have a housing crisis, a trolley crisis and a health crisis and they see what they feel is a waste of money.  I hear it myself at meetings in my area.  They see it as a waste of money with no accountability.  I do not want anyone's head to roll but there must be lessons learned and there must be responsibility taken for it.  Mr. Finnegan named out a litany of people and various bodies involved in this over the past two years but it happened again.<\/p> <p>  I know Mr. Finnegan said there should have been an architect giving advice and that it was a mistake by someone that an architect was not brought in at the beginning.

We have heard &euro;1.169 million, &euro;1.369 million, &euro;2 million and now that the OPW is involved it has gone to &euro;2.5 million. There were figures of &euro;1.169 million and &euro;1.369 million at the beginning and now it has gone to &euro;2.5 million.  This is what people see and they ask how someone can stand over this type of an increase with all of the different things that went wrong.  Will Mr. Finnegan show where we could have saved that money that was spent because of the mistakes that were made?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019121200002#BBB01200","speaker":"1368"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1576141200,"counter":1345,"content":"<p>Before I deal with that directly I will comment on Deputy Aylward's opening remarks.

The architect would have advised the project team that a machine of the type it was purchasing would require significant architectural works.

They are the actual costs that we incurred where we should not have incurred them; &euro;112,000 is an awful lot of money, it really is.  I understand why people are very annoyed over it.  I have worked through this myself over the past three weeks.  I have been very annoyed over it myself.  I have worked through all of this process.  Ultimately, when we look at this in the round and go back to 2004 and see the costs incurred then and the costs incurred now, they are not dramatically out of line.  The cost of the equipment, I think, came in at &euro;1.8 million.  If we take out the outsourcing and storage, the costs are around &euro;1.7 million.  For me, this is a 15 year investment.  It is &euro;1.7 million over 15 years.  If we do the sums it is somewhere in the order of &euro;100,000 per year for printing.  That is probably a reasonable sum, at &euro;2,000 per week, if we were to look at what the cost would be if we were to outsource.  Let us suppose the Oireachtas did not do printing at all.  One of the other things that has come out of this is that Members have legitimate printing needs in terms of communicating with their constituents.  This is an essential and fundamental role of public representatives.  It is something we try to support Members in doing.  If Members were to communicate with their constituents via an outsource model the cost would be substantially more.  In the same way as doing an analysis of leasing versus buying, if we do a further analysis of just outsourcing instead of doing something I suspect that would be the most expensive option of all.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019121200002#BBB01900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Finnegan"},{"type":"speech","time":1576141200,"counter":1352,"content":"<p>That is acceptable.

There may be a facility to get some value out of this printer during the quieter periods when the D&aacute;il is in recess and there is not the same printing demand.  Neighbouring public bodies in the public service, or other aspects or activities of the D&aacute;il might be directed in that way.  I will throw that suggestion out there.<\/p> <p>  At this stage, I thank all the witnesses from the Houses of the Oireachtas for coming in.  Coincidentally, I believe Mr Finnegan was present at the last meeting before the summer recess and he is here now at the last meeting before the Christmas break.  I also want to thank our colleagues in the OPW, as well as the Comptroller and Auditor General and his staff.  Mr. Finnegan will be pleased to know we have finished our public discussion on this except for whatever information we have requested that might be worked through to us in the weeks ahead.
