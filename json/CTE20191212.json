This was referred to the committee on 27 November with an instruction to report back to the D&aacute;il not later than 12 December 2019.  We are hitting the last moments of that time.  Our role is to consider the Supplementary Estimate and report what we have done by way of a message to the D&aacute;il.  The purpose of this part of the meeting is to have an engagement with the Minister for consideration of the said Estimates.  On behalf of the committee I welcome the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Joe McHugh, and his officials.  I propose that the Minister make a brief opening statement, which will be followed by a question and answer session with the committee.  We will be individually considering the nine subheads which make up the Supplementary Estimate.  Some of them may overlap; subheads A.3 to A.6 relate to additional funding for teacher and special needs assistant, SNA, salaries.  We will then have some brief closing remarks.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  I remind members that in accordance with Standing Orders, discussions should be confined to the items constituting the Supplementary Estimates.

T&aacute; oifigigh &oacute; mo Roinn liom ar mo chl&eacute; agus ar mo dheis.<\/p> <p>  I thank the committee for the opportunity to speak here this morning and for its consideration of my Department's Supplementary Estimate.  Following approval by the Government, my Department is seeking a net Supplementary Estimate of &euro;68 million.  This is the lowest supplementary requirement from my Department in recent years.  It represents a variation on the Department's overall net allocation for 2019 of less than 0.7%.  My Department has provided detailed briefing on this Supplementary Estimate, but I will briefly outline the key elements for the information of the committee.<\/p> <p>  There is an additional pay requirement of &euro;52.3 million in the school sector across several subheads.  For context, the pay allocation for the schools sector is more than &euro;5.3 billion in 2019, so this represents a variation of around 1%.  The main drivers of the additional demand are in the areas of substitution, additional costs for teacher supply initiatives, demographics and some technical issues in the education and training board, ETB, sector.  <\/p> <p>  An additional &euro;19.9 million is required for school transport in 2019.  Around 90% of the additional cost relates to the provision of transport for children with special educational needs, which has been the main cost driver in the scheme over recent years.  The remaining 10% relates to general costs in areas such as increasing fuel costs and demographic increases.<\/p> <p>  An additional &euro;9.9 million is being sought for the State Examinations Commission, SEC.  As members of the committee know well, the SEC is responsible for the development, assessment, accreditation and certification of the State's second level examinations.  The SEC was required to incur a range of additional costs in 2019, in large part due to the need to implement changes to the marking process to facilitate earlier leaving certificate appeals timelines as a result of a High Court judgement.  I take this opportunity to acknowledge the work of all staff members within the SEC, who have been very proactive and responsive to these changes. <\/p> <p>  Some &euro;7 million is sought to cover additional expenditure on the rental of temporary accommodation due to a higher level of approvals required to meet immediate school accommodation needs, along with a &euro;1 million contingency for some uncertainties around the level of rental approvals before the end of the year.<\/p> <p>  Some &euro;0.4 million is sought to cover the knock-on costs in the education and training sector arising from the Government's decision to award a Christmas bonus payment to recipients of social protection payments.  A number of participants on SOLAS-funded further education and training programmes are in receipt of a training allowance in lieu of their Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection benefits.  The Government has made a decision that these participants will also receive a Christmas bonus.<\/p> <p>  The final issue on the expenditure side is &euro;9 million to provide for the knock-on costs in the higher education sector of a pay deal which was agreed in the health sector for medical consultants.  This will cover the cost of pay arrears which are due to be paid to academic medical consultants.<\/p> <p>  An estimated surplus of &euro;31.5 million in appropriations-in-aid is being factored into the 2019 Supplementary Estimate to offset these expenditure pressures.  The Department has received additional receipts of &euro;39.1 million in European Social Fund moneys over the amounts profiled for 2019.  These are reduced slightly by a &euro;7.6 million shortfall in superannuation receipts as a result of technical issues regarding the treatment of these receipts.  <\/p> <p>  I am happy to discuss these issues in more detail and I commend the Supplementary Estimate to the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2019121200002#B00600","speaker":"1290"},{"type":"speech","time":1576108800,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

One probable reason is the fact that there was always uncertainty around the number of teachers who might retire and uncertainty in the special needs area.  There is a small increase in SNA salaries.  Can the Minister explain where that is coming from?<\/p> <p>  We have a figure of &euro;19.9 million for additional expenditure on school transport, but there has only been a fairly small percentage increase in the cost of diesel.  Why has expenditure increased to the extent that it has?  Provision for children with special needs accounts for the majority of that.  Can the Minister give us those figures?  <\/p> <p>  I also wanted to ask about the medical consultants who are academics.  Is it normal for the Department of Education and Skills to fund that even though the agreement is primarily around health?  These consultants operate in hospitals and health settings as well as in academic circles.  Can the Minister provide an explanation of that?  <\/p> <p>  Finally, it may be slightly off topic, but I wish to refer to the figures for appropriations-in-aid under subhead D.<\/p><p>It concerns receipts in respect of the European Social Fund.  The figure is &euro;39.5 million, less a shortfall.  That is fairly standard.  The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund is also administered through the Department of Education and Skills.  I am aware that a factory called Molex in Shannon, County Clare, closed with the loss of 500 jobs.  Consideration is being given to applying to the fund.  This was done for a number of companies in the past, including Dell and Waterford Glass, I believe.  It could be argues there was a globalisation element to the reason the jobs were lost.  I submitted a parliamentary question to the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation and she indicated that applying to the fund would have to be done through the Department of Education and Skills.  The Minister might not have the answer today but I am interested in knowing whether, if the funding is applied for, as I hope will be the case, how it will be accounted for.  Is it under the same type of heading?  I am aware that it is a different fund but it is a European fund.  That is slightly off the subject of the Estimates but if the Minister has any information, it would be welcome.  That is all I wanted to ask.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2019121200002#B01000","speaker":"1325","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1576108800,"counter":15,"content":"<p>Subheads A3 to A6 concern teachers&rsquo; salaries.  What is very notable about these Estimates is that this is the first time since I have been elected that we have not been dealing with substantial overexpenditure on superannuation, as has been the case in recent years.  I presume the Department has managed to get the issue under control.<\/p> <p>  Subheads A3 to A6 relate to a Supplementary Estimate ask of more than &euro;50 million for teachers' salaries across primary and post-primary levels.  While the subheads are extremely large and make up the majority of the expenditure for the entire Vote, the Supplementary Estimate as a percentage of the total is quite small.  The amount in question is still remarkable, however.  I understand this is primarily as a result of substitute cover for more paid leave than was anticipated.  Does the same issue arise in the same way under each subhead?  What measure is the Minister pursuing to calculate more accurately in this regard next year?<\/p> <p>  With regard to subhead A9, on school transport, adequate school transport is an essential part of ensuring equality of access to education for all students, especially those with special educational needs.  My question on the subhead is more about the future.  What is the Minister's projection for spending on school transport in the future?  Will he outline what engagement he has had with Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment to mitigate against the rising cost of school transport?  Ensuring sustainable, clean, effective transport is not just an issue for the Department of Education and Skills because there should be joined-up thinking.<\/p> <p>  Public consultation on BusConnects closed this week.  Revision of the bus network is crucial in Dublin.  I welcome the engagement there has been on this and some of the changes over the past year.  I noticed that, with regard to the major routes, peak times are identified as being from 3 p.m. and 4 p.m. onward.  In some cases, school finishing times are not treated as peak times.  I noted this in my submissions to BusConnects last year and this year.  Rather, the focus is on the slot from 5 p.m. to 6 p.m.  Did the Minister have any engagement in the process or with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport on how our bus and other public transport services need to be working for students and on how school finishing times need to be regarded as peak times so we can have adequate service options for students?<\/p> <p>  What engagement has there been to ensure safe routes for cycling and walking to schools?  These are required, especially in urban areas.<\/p> <p>  Regarding subhead A11, additional expenditure pertaining to the State Examinations Commission is due to the High Court decision on appeals related to the leaving certificate examinations and the need to process them in a much shorter timeframe.  I absolutely welcome the fact that action has been taken on this matter.  Is the cost incurred to ensure the new system is implemented just a once-off cost?  Will the increased expenditure be necessary every single year?  Is there any mitigation activity that could be engaged in with a greater amount of planning next year?<\/p> <p>  On subhead A15, concerning primary and post-primary infrastructure, the overexpenditure seems to be related entirely to current expenditure.  It is &euro;8 million over the projected budget of &euro;19 million.  This is quite substantial.  Is the expenditure primarily on rent?  Is it due to an increase in rent or an increase in the number of properties being rented?  If both, could we have a rough breakdown?  It brings into question something I have raised before with the former Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Bruton.  Is the Department announcing schools without even having sites identified?  This causes a dilemma for principals, teachers, and parents who are trying to work out where students will be placed.<\/p> <p>  A few years ago, a school in my constituency was moved from place to place as it sought a permanent solution.  A primary school was moved to a secondary school.  A cost was incurred to make the premises suitable for a primary school.  I am aware of a school in Wicklow where the same thing is going to happen next September.  A primary school that is no longer fit for purpose has a new building built for it.  A secondary school is now going to be moved out of its temporary location to this primary school as another temporary location until the other one, the permanent location, is found.  It has to be fitted to be made suitable as a second level school.  What are the costs incurred in the circumstances?  Are they included in these figures?  I am curious about the cost.<\/p> <p>  Subhead C4, which pertains to higher education, is quite specific in regard to medical students and the High Court ruling, as the Minister said in his statement.  My only comment on this subhead concerns the chronic underexpenditure over recent years.  In 2008, State funding for third level education was just under &euro;9,000 per student.  It is not much higher than &euro;5,000 per student 11 years later.  Our higher education institutions are in financial crisis.  I feel the Government has continually delayed in engaging on the Cassells report.  This committee has pointed this out several times.  All the time, third level institutions are crippled by financial strain, and the education of their students is suffering.<\/p> <p>  We are at a stage at which we are required to meet the first benchmark of the Cassells report.  We are to be annually &euro;600 million over and above the 2015 level by 2021.  We are at a standstill, however.  I urge the Minister to take on the task of recognising the crisis at third level and to fund this vital sector adequately.<\/p> <p>  Every year, I take the opportunity as a former teacher to talk about equal pay for equal work.  This is a major issue.  I taught alongside teachers who were doing the same job as me and getting different pay.  This needs to be dealt with as a matter of fairness.  We need to value our educators right across the board.  That is not happening in the jobs they do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2019121200002#C00200","speaker":"1242"},{"type":"speech","time":1576108800,"counter":16,"content":"<p>I will pick up on two points raised by Deputy Martin, one concerning equal pay for equal work.  There is growing frustration among some of the cohorts who have not seen equalisation happen.  The Minister will be aware of that.  I hope that can be dealt with as early as possible.  There was a Topical Issue debate on this yesterday but I was not in a position to participate in it.  Will the Minister give us an update on the discussions with F&oacute;rsa and the pay of school secretaries?  Pay varies radically from school to school, depending on whether the arrangement is based on the ancillary grant or direct employment.<\/p><p>Some of them are on very low pay and their employment conditions are poor.  That issue needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency.  What is the position of the Minister and the Department in that regard?  Is he personally involved in negotiations or are his officials involved in them?<\/p><p> On further education, the number of apprentices and trainees has doubled from 6,200 or thereabouts to approximately 12,000 in recent years, which is welcome.   I would like the figure to increase further.  We need to improve the quality of our apprenticeships.  The combined allocation for the national training fund and Solas has only increased by 9% even though the number of apprentices has doubled.  Clearly, the figures do not match up.<\/p><p> I wish to flag that there are significant issues with school transport.  Every Deputy deals with them.  As I represent an urban constituency where fewer people rely upon the service, I may deal with fewer such issues than certain other Deputies.  However, I am aware from colleagues, as well as cases referred to me, that there are significant issues in this area.  People who were previously eligible for school transport are now deemed ineligible.  Often, parents of children with special needs apply to many schools in order to try to get their children child into appropriate units.  They may fail to get places in several of those schools, including specials schools.  When parents get a place for their child, they may be unable to access the school transport scheme because the child will not be travelling to the school nearest to his or her home and may pass two or three schools at which his or her needs would be met.  The refusal to grant access to the scheme disregards the fact that the child was not admitted to the schools in question.  That is a significant issue.  In general, the scheme requires significant investment and possibly an overhaul in order to increase its scope and the number of people who can access it.  Many people would like to be able to access it.<\/p><p> School traffic is a big issue in urban and rural areas.  The more children we can take out of the queues of cars outside schools and onto buses, the better.  That would be of benefit in terms of traffic, climate change and many other areas.<\/p><p> Additional funding for the State Examinations Commission would be welcome.  There were issues in respect of the junior certificate and the additional examinations this year.  I wish to flag the campaign backed by the Irish Second-Level Students Union urging greater compassion for children or people sitting the leaving certificate who are ill and who encounter difficulties in deferring their exams.  I ask the Minister to take that on board.<\/p><p> I tabled several parliamentary questions relating to DEIS during the year.  I have regularly raised with the Minister the need for schools to be given the opportunity to apply for DEIS band 2 and for the ratio to come down for DEIS band 1.  The INTO held a protest last week on the latter issue.  An opportunity was missed with DEIS band 2.  Many schools that would not qualify for DEIS band 1 were not given the opportunity to be considered for DEIS band 2, which was a disappointing failure.  There are significant advantages to DEIS band 2 - which is less expensive than DEIS band 1 - in terms of access to the school completion programme and home-school community liaison teachers who are of great benefit.  Principals have told me that they are dealing with complicated cases but want to get on with running their school.  People are not aware how difficult it is to deal with such cases.  If a school has a home-school liaison teacher, much of that work is taken off the desk of the principal.  Does the Minister plan to reintroduce DEIS band 2?  Some of the answers to the parliamentary questions I tabled stated that he is looking at the area of educational disadvantage generally and that there might be some new approach.  Is there any update in that regard?  Although only a minority of the children in certain schools may be disadvantaged, the schools still require access to home-school liaison or school completion services.  Perhaps a clustering system whereby several schools could avail of the services could be considered.  We have not heard much on the issue recently.  The general answer is that the Department is examining it.  This is very important and it could make a significant difference.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2019121200002#C00300","speaker":"1287","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1576108800,"counter":18,"content":"<p>It is to be welcomed that the amount of the Supplementary Estimate is less than in previous years.  On subhead A3, which relates to school salaries, the Minister referred to some of the funding going into a supply panel.  Such panels are always welcome.  The committee made recommendations regarding the possibility of setting up supply panels to support teaching principals at primary level.  Last Thursday, the issue was discussed with the Minister in the D&aacute;il.  It would be helpful for schools to be clustered such that every teaching principal would have one day per week to deal with the various difficult administrative burdens they have.<\/p> <p>  On school salaries, the issue of school secretaries has been mentioned.  I fully support equal pay for equal work.  Some 90% of school secretaries are employed by boards of management rather than the Department.  They are outside the public service pension scheme, many of them must sign on for social assistance payments outside term time and they do not have certainty from year to year.  That should be factored into future Estimates.<\/p> <p>  Every school should have a home-school liaison teacher.  The work they do is quite incredible.  Since the concept was introduced by Sr. Concepta Conaty, it has made a very positive difference to many schools and communities.  It may the case that consideration should be given to supply panels in that regard.<\/p> <p>  On subhead A9, school transport, the overspend is quite significant.  We must help to get our children to school in a safe and secure manner.  Every school has a problem with pinch points at school starting and finishing times.  Every school has been in touch with its local authority regarding traffic calming and money that needs to be spent to ensure that children get to school safely.  The number of cars outside schools always amazes me.  When I travel from my home to the D&aacute;il, I must go through a pinch point where there are three schools, one bridge and thousands of children.  The Minister can imagine the chaos and the number of cars at the location.  It would make far more sense to put our money into approaches such as the safe routes to school programme that was mentioned such that children can walk or cycle safely to school and that our school transport system is opened to those who live a little further away.  All Deputies deal with these issues.  Many families may not be able to afford a car or a second car.  It is wrong that families must have a second car just for the school run.  The committee should send an important message in that regard.  We need to turn the school transport system on its head and provide a space for every child who needs to access transport.  Obviously, that would also involve a cost to the family.  In this day and age, the system whereby a child must live 4.8 miles from his or her school in order to access school transport is wrong.<\/p><p>That figure may be incorrect, but it is close to the reality.<\/p><p> Obviously, additional funding needs to be provided for the State Examinations Commission under subhead A11.  The junior certificate results were released quite late this year.  They were not issued until October as a knock-on effect of the decision to release the leaving certificate results earlier in order to facilitate appeals.  All of that is to be welcomed.  We understand why an extra cost is involved.  Is it possible that we will see all State examination results coming out at an earlier stage?  When those who are going into fifth year are making their subject choices, it would be helpful for them to receive their exam results a little earlier.<\/p><p> Subhead A15 brings us back to the prefab situation.  It is very frustrating to see so much money being spent on temporary accommodation.  Would it be possible for the Department to improve its forecasting to enable pupils to be taught in non-rental or non-temporary accommodation?  Provision should be made for permanent school buildings instead.  It is particularly frustrating to see this in my own constituency.  I am sure all Deputies see it.  When commitments and promises are made in respect of schools, the timelines move out all the time for site acquisition reasons or because of other issues.  In such circumstances, more money has to be spent on prefabs, which tend to be placed in green spaces.  Many schools have quite small green spaces, so it is far from satisfactory for these to be taken over by temporary school buildings.  Surely the Department can get it right.  Its forecasting needs to be better if schools building projects are to start on time.  As the Minister will be aware, over a year has passed since he announced that there would be a new secondary school in the Curragh-Newbridge area of south Kildare.  That news was welcomed at the time, but there is no news whatsoever, even with regard to site acquisition, at this point.  There are parents who have their children on waiting lists on an ongoing basis.  There are more than 100 children on waiting lists for some schools.  There are many temporary buildings in some of these schools.  They are unable to add to their temporary stock.  This is a really big issue.<\/p><p> I will conclude by referring to subhead C4.  I echo the comments of Deputy Catherine Martin about the significant investment that is needed at third level.  I do not know how the third level sector is functioning as well as it is.  Given the likelihood of a hard Brexit on 31 January - none of us knows what will happen - we need to bear in mind that 12,500 Irish students are studying at third level in the UK.  We would not be able to absorb such a number of students back into the Irish system.  As the Minister is aware, the joint committee had a discussion last week on the granting of university status to the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, RCSI.  A motion granting such status has since been passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  I wonder whether this new status will have any impact on the moneys that the RCSI is eligible to draw down or on the Department's Estimates.  Given that this change of status relates specifically to the medical end of things, I wonder what its impact will be.  I ask the Minister to respond to our comments and questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2019121200002#D00200","speaker":"1257","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1576108800,"counter":20,"content":"<p>I acknowledge the help provided by this committee by proactively making proposals, etc.  Today's engagement is important.  As the committee examined the PISA results in recent weeks, it identified areas in which we are making gains.  The DEIS scheme has been mentioned.  It is great to see that the gap is being bridged at the lower levels.  It is getting closer.  The support we provide to more vulnerable and disadvantaged students is far in excess of other OECD countries.  I know this committee focuses on such matters.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Jan O'Sullivan mentioned the number of teachers who might retire, the special needs area and the increase in SNA salaries.  I will provide some specific figures in that regard.  An additional &euro;2.1 million is required to cover SNA salary costs, which are higher than expected, mostly because the increase in SNA posts in 2019 has exceeded the provision in the Revised Estimates Volume.  The number of SNAs will reach 17,000 by September 2020 as a result of the addition of an extra 1,000 SNAs.  This country has more SNAs than garda&iacute;.  They are doing important work.  I know that the Deputy values the role they play.  We need to ensure that we are building on the capacity, especially in the area of training.  We are working on the recommendations that came out of the SNA report with regard to a higher training authority, upskilling and ensuring they have the capacity as well.  I look forward to working with this committee in this area.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy also mentioned the provision of &euro;19.9 million for school transport.  The area of special educational needs has been identified for an increase.  Extra money has been more or less ring-fenced for these increases.  There are increases in costs, including fuel costs, as well.  We are still working on a meaningful inclusion system.  We do not want buses to be passing schools, but buses are passing schools.  I appreciate that buses have to pass schools when young people with special needs are going to special schools like Kolbe special school in Portlaoise and the Little Angels special school in Letterkenny.  They are travelling long distances to go to such schools.  There are students passing schools that do not have units.  I am trying to remind myself not to use the word \"unit\" because I am aware that parents of autistic children and children with special needs do not like it.  I would like to use this public platform to appeal again to schools in areas like south Dublin where there is a demand for special classes, and where schools have the capacity to provide such classes, to work with the NCSE and the Department to see how their fears can be allayed.  There are genuine fears about putting special classes into schools.  People are worried about resources and administration.  They fear that these young people might not get the special support they require.  We have a short history in the year that has just passed in the Dublin 15 area.  The Catholic patron, under the stewardship of Archbishop Diarmuid Martin and Monsignor Dan O'Connor, was very proactive on the ground in trying to appeal to schools about the importance of this form of educational provision as part of the inclusion journey.  I want to acknowledge all the people who were involved in making this happen.  Up to eight schools have put on additional classes.  Danu special school has also been created.  All of this has happened in a period of nine months.  I am repeating my public appeal in the awareness that this can happen.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Jan O'Sullivan mentioned medical consultants.  There is an academic responsibility on us when such people are lecturing in third level colleges.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2019121200002#E00200","speaker":"1290"},{"type":"speech","time":1576108800,"counter":21,"content":"<p>Does the Department have to pay the full amount or does the Department of Health pay some of it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2019121200002#E00300","speaker":"1325"},{"type":"speech","time":1576108800,"counter":22,"content":"<p>We contribute a percentage depending on the number of hours provided for under the contract.  I will get the Deputy more detail on this matter if she requires it.  We want to ensure we continue to have this vital voice and expertise in our third level sector.<\/p> <p>  This brings me on to our university ranking for research.  One of the fundamental factors underpinning the ranking system is the need to ensure more research is done.  I will have more to say about this aspect of the matter later when we move on to third level funding.  It is clear, from the feedback I am getting from third level colleges, that we must continue to put public funds into research.<\/p><p>I am happy to follow up with the Deputy on the matter of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, Molex and the loss of 500 jobs.  I was in the midlands recently and saw that the education and training boards, ETBs, and the likes of Athlone Institute of Technology are working together to upskill people through retraining and are engaged in capacity building in anticipation of changes in work practices.  An example close to my home, as a Donegal man, was the 3,500 affected workers at the Unifi textile plant in Letterkenny when Fruit of the Loom decided to move away from Donegal between 1999 and 2001.  We had to upskill and retrain those employees, and that capacity building and the education sector are areas I want to keep a focus on.  If there is a specific avenue through the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, I would be happy to support the Deputy on that.<\/p><p> Deputy Martin talked about teachers' salaries.  Our Supplementary Estimate is down this year.  We are not in any way complacent about that and we tried to get it down as low as possible.  One of the messages from this committee last year was to get more of a handle, for want of a better word, on projected pension increases.  I acknowledge the Deputy's role in that regard and I particularly acknowledge the roles of my officials in the Department who have worked hard on that.  The annual figure for pensions alone is &euro;1.3 billion, which is significant.  It is about getting it right, and getting the guesstimate right in advance.  I thank my officials for that.<\/p><p> Deputy Martin also mentioned getting more accurate measures for substitute cover.  It is difficult because that is a day-to-day matter, covering sick leave and maternity leave, and there are other factors involved.  Through our primary school panel, we are trying to help the system and the principals at the coalface who need that cover at short notice.  The pilot of that panel is only in its infancy for Cork, Galway, Dublin, Meath and Kildare.  We will keep an eye on that but I would like to see it rolled out further.<\/p><p> I am also conscious of constraints.  There are constraints when it comes to the demands in the greater Dublin area and there are issues around the cost of accommodation, which is a reality facing many young teachers in Shanghai, Beijing, Abu Dhabi and Dubai.  I have met those teachers and have tried to listen to where the constraints are.  That is one of the barriers to bringing them back.  We will continue to engage with them to see how we can try and help provide cover in the future.<\/p><p> Transport has been mentioned by all four of the committee members here today.  We are committed to a review and that process has started.  One of the commitments I gave in my budget contribution was that we would look at transport.  We are up to &euro;220 million, going into next year, and between the special education sector and the mainstream, we are talking about providing for more than 120,000 pupils day to day.  As Deputy Martin suggested, we need to look under this issue.  We can be smarter in getting people to educational facilities using less transportation and fewer vehicles.  There are smarter ways to do that.  It will require engagement with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  I am asking my officials to engage with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Bruton, who has overall responsibility on climate change.  Traffic congestion, as the Chairperson mentioned, is a matter of safety for children going into primary schools in rural and urban areas.  As part of the review of transport, I want to incorporate a wider element that specifically includes examining if we can have more interdepartmental collaboration and address safety aspects.<\/p><p> Deputy Martin is welcome to engage on BusConnects.  There is a piece of work that we can do through further engagement in that space.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2019121200002#E00400","speaker":"1290","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1576108800,"counter":24,"content":"<p>The peak-only routes do not include the very busy time after school has finished.

That said, we are here as servants of the people and not of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and must ensure that services are there.  We are focused on ensuring that young people have access to their schools.  I intervened for post-primary schools this summer when we made a policy change if there is a traditional route to the second closest school and put in extra finances for that.  The Chairperson also spoke about the 4.8 km policy for post-primary schools.  When we are looking at the overall review of transport, we bring everything into the mix because there are areas where acute problems remain.<\/p> <p>  Safety and safe routes to schools in urban areas were also raised.  Safety must be at the heart of this.  I acknowledge the officials at county council level who draw down CL&Aacute;R funding for safety measures outside schools.  We must go further and look at what actually happens when a number of vehicles and young people are in a populated area and traffic is passing by.  We have to look at everything, including speed between 8 a.m. and 9 a.m. and 3 p.m. and 4 p.m.  There are things we can do within this review and we can hopefully-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2019121200002#F00300","speaker":"1290"},{"type":"speech","time":1576108800,"counter":26,"content":"<p>One suggestion is for the Minister to talk to his colleague, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, and reconsider the current investment of 2% of the entire transport budget on walking and cycling when the UN states that it should be 20%.

I have heard what the Deputy has said about investing in pathways and cycle routes.  It is a different type of scenario in many rural areas because of the distance that pupils have to travel, in some instances on narrower roads.  We cannot just come up with potential solutions for urban areas.  We must take a comprehensive approach that covers rural and urban areas.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy also referenced the High Court decision related to the State Examinations Commission, SEC, and welcomed the action that has been taken.  There has been a big change and impact this year in that an extra &euro;9.9 million has been allocated to the SEC.  Once a system starts to embed, we hope we will not have to use the same amount of money every year.  Officials, civil and public servants sometimes get a hard time but this was a great example of them responding to a High Court judgment in a short time, and they did an incredible job.  I made a decision earlier this year that provided for alternative sittings of State examinations for students who experience bereavement.  Those officials worked hard on that.  More than 40 families went with their sons or daughters to Athlone in July to sit those alternative examinations.  Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire used the word \"compassion\" and the human support system that was put in place for the parents who were waiting for their children to complete those exams was incredible.  That was a difficult and sensitive time for those families and I again acknowledge the contribution of officials, civil and public servants in that.<\/p><p> Reference was made to renting prefabs and properties.  We replace 600 prefabs per year but we continue to have extra demands.  Last year, for example, demand for school places was especially acute in Ashbourne and Ennis.  This year, we are monitoring enrolments in Kilcock in north Kildare, Skerries in north Dublin, east Cork and Trim.  Every year, we are faced with new pressure points at post-primary level.  We have a geographic information measurement system.  We are monitoring and engaging with councils and trying to figure out where planning permissions are coming up and where there will be extra people.  There is constant demand for temporary provision.  This is not a position I like to be in and it is certainly not where the Department likes to be because it involves paying for temporary prefabricated accommodation until buildings are eventually constructed to replace them.  We do not like to spend money on temporary provision.<\/p><p> Deputy Catherine Martin referred to decanting in County Wicklow.

Ultimately, we want to be able to ensure we move through the system to provide a building.  Whether we are talking about Monasterevin or Newbridge, we want to ensure we get it right.<\/p> <p>  There are numerous processes involved.  Sometimes parents, teachers, principals and politicians get frustrated with the process.  We all do because it happens in our constituencies, including my constituency.  We have to go through stage 2A, stage 2B and design stage.  We start asking whether the stages unfolding in a phased out way are leading to delay.  I learned in the first 48 hours in this job that we must have those stages and processes to ensure we get it right.  We must ensure we have near-zero energy building requirements.

I know the committee deliberated on the report recently.  We have to maintain at the heart of the education system publicly funded higher level education where the burden is not on parents or students.  Decisions will have to be made, including political decisions, once the processes are finished at commission level.  The Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills, Deputy Mary Michell O'Connor, has been proactive on this issue.  A decision will be needed on funding.  As I said, having spoken to leaders in the third level education sector, I believe the whole area of research is an important area.  University rankings are an area where investment will be required.<\/p> <p>  Reference was made to equal pay for equal work, the 2011-14 cohort and value.  I met a large number of the 2011-14 cohort when I was in the United Arab Emirates.  There is anger and a pent-up frustration in that regard.  It is interesting that when I go into staffrooms it is not necessarily members of the 2011-14 cohort who raise this issue with me.  It is the other teachers because they do not believe it is right that there is inequity in the system.  Deputies will hear this from constituency visits.  This is something I was determined to make progress on at an early stage.  During the Easter conferences last year, I was able to get a commitment from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform that the inequality issue will form part of the next round of pay talks.  The next round will take place in the coming 12 months.  I know this has been frustrating but there is a commitment from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and my Department that pay inequality will form part of the discussions.<\/p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire also referred to inequality and raised the issue of school secretaries, which was also raised last night.  There is a process, which has not broken down.  I re-emphasise that point today.  I appeal to F&oacute;rsa to continue to engage with Department officials.  Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire asked me whether I was part of those deliberations.  I am not.  I am not around those tables but the officials know where I stand on the matter.

I have no wish to go over this issue again.  Next year, we will spend &euro;220 million on school transport.  The Deputy referred to school traffic, which we have also covered, and referred to the State Examinations Commission and compassion.  We have made changes with regard to bereavement.

When DEIS started in 2005 it was based on geographical grounds linked to socioeconomic disadvantage.  Life has become much more complex and geography does not now necessarily determine whether a school needs DEIS status.  We need to consider building on that.  We have a group working on class size and we will produce a report on that in a few weeks' time.  That will be relevant to all schools but particularly DEIS schools.  We have made significant progress in our analysis of DEIS and gathering socioeconomic data.  We are approaching the endgame and our next steps on DEIS.  A big conversation will be needed.  If I still hold this position in the new year &ndash; I am not going to get involved in talk of an election today &ndash; I will ensure that pioneers of DEIS, the stakeholders, the teachers and principals who were, and continue to be, involved in it from day one are part of that conversation.

After 235 years, it is now RCSI University.  I was there when the Minister of State, Deputy Mitchell O&rsquo;Connor, was seeing this change through both Houses.  It was a highly charged and emotional day for the entire team, which was very appreciative of the cross-party support in the Oireachtas.  For anybody here who went to RCSI or knows anyone who went there, graduates of the college will be changing their CVs because it does not matter when they studied there, they will be able to say they have a university degree.<\/p><p>University status is a big issue on the international stage.  As the committee will be aware, when one travels to China or India it is important to have a university degree, it is good for Ireland and enhances the reputation of the RCSI.  I wish to acknowledge Professor Cathal Kelly, CEO, and his team for their work and engagement with everybody in the Parliament.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2019121200002#H01300","speaker":"1290","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1576108800,"counter":53,"content":"<p>We played our part in that last week as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2019121200002#J00200","speaker":"1257"},{"type":"speech","time":1576108800,"counter":54,"content":"<p>Absolutely.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2019121200002#J00300","speaker":"1290"},{"type":"speech","time":1576108800,"counter":55,"content":"<p>We do not have much time for supplementary questions.

Some of my questions have been answered.  I wish to ask questions on the summer works scheme and the short-term demand for prefabs in some colleges.  Summerhill College in Sligo has capacity for approximately 1,000 pupils but its enrolment is well in excess of that now.  I welcome the recent announcement of additional rooms and laboratories for the college and when I met the principal, he was enthused about the funding.  I ask for consideration to be given in the short term to providing additional accommodation for the new students that will arrive in September. <\/p> <p>  The school transport scheme has been revised and dealt with by the Minister and his Minister of State, Deputy Halligan, but issues arise on a regular basis.  Perhaps the scheme could be readjusted or whatever.  <\/p> <p>  I am a firm believer in apprenticeships.  As I have mentioned here on numerous occasions, we must encourage more people to avail of apprenticeships because there is a scarcity of apprentices.  It is vitally important that people at all levels be encouraged to consider an apprenticeship, with which I am sure the Minister and his officials agree.<\/p> <p>  I wish to mention a parochial matter - the Ballisodare school.  I congratulate the Minister and his officials no the work that has been done at the school.  Recently, I met the principal of the school and learned that there is a lack of recreational facilities.  Perhaps the Minister will consider funding for them.<\/p> <p>  Recently an announcement was made that the Mercy College in Sligo had secured funding of &euro;3 million.  The announcement was warmly welcomed in the last couple of weeks. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2019121200002#J00500","speaker":"1343"},{"type":"speech","time":1576108800,"counter":57,"content":"<p>We are here to discuss the Estimates.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2019121200002#J00600","speaker":"1257"},{"type":"speech","time":1576108800,"counter":58,"content":"<p>Yes, but it is important that we highlight some of the good work that has been done and the moneys spent on education.

However we have expressed some concerns on the legislation.  I would like to tease out with the Minister how the scope of this legislation deals with some of the areas of concern around these fund structures.  We know that Irish funds have lobbied heavily for this legislation.  They expected it to be progressed before now.  It is now going through the D&aacute;il.  In my view there are more pressing matters we could be dealing with, but this is an issue that needs to be dealt with.<\/p> <p>  Investment limited partnerships, ILPs, are tax restructures in which multiple partners are able to carry out activity with limited liability.  That is due to the fact that the individual partners are all taxable in their own jurisdictions, some of which are low-tax jurisdictions.  Unlike normal companies, however, they do not have to publish financial accounts or statements.  There has been a huge expansion of ILPs in this State since 2014.  The number has grown from 1,000 to 3,000.  The Companies Registration Office has been quoted as saying this is abnormal.  At present, these partnerships do not register a principal place of business in Ireland, which is quite unique.  They do not make annual returns or file financial statements.  They are not covered by the European anti-money laundering directives that require disclosure of the real ownership behind structures.  That is the issue that the Minister of State has said he will address through amendments in the Seanad, which would be welcome.  Is there scope within this legislation to deal with other issues about these partnerships that concern me and others?  Has the need to register a principal place of business in Ireland been catered for in the legislation, or the need to make annual returns or file financial statements?  Can the Minister of State clarify that the aim of the amendments he is bringing forward is to ensure that these partnerships are subject to the European anti-money laundering directives by disclosing their real ownership?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2019121200002#B01300","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speech","time":1576108800,"counter":123,"content":"<p>The Deputy is talking about the Limited Partnerships Act 1907.  That is part of the package that has increased the number of higher equity funds in Ireland.  This act is not changing anything about that.  That legislation is used for purposes other than alternative investments, and the change proposed by the industry would not be limited to collective investment schemes.  They are not being taken on board.  The 1907 Act's provisions remain in place.  That falls under the remit of the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Heather Humphreys.  Her Department recently ran a consultation on the Act, which closed in March 2019.  Since then the Department has been considering the responses to the public consultation and working on developing a proposed policy response to the 1907 Act, with a view to submitting them to Government in the next legislative session.<\/p> <p>  Regarding beneficial ownership, I note that the anti-money laundering directive does not directly require the establishment of beneficial ownership registers for structures in an ILP.  We are adding that requirement.  This is a higher threshold of analysis and scrutiny, which I believe is important to the development and establishment of a better system for ILPs in Ireland.  It will not be possible to lay the charge one sometimes hears, that these are not transparent enough, at the feet of this Oireachtas because the amendments on beneficial ownership that will come before the Seanad will be stronger than what is currently required. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2019121200002#B01400","speaker":"1364"},{"type":"speech","time":1576108800,"counter":124,"content":"<p>Very well.

I am joined today by Mr. John McCarthy, Secretary General, and assistant secretaries, Ms Maria Graham, Ms Mary Hurley and Mr. Paul Lemass.<\/p> <p>  At the core of Rebuilding Ireland is the supply of new homes for individuals and families of all incomes, built in the right locations and with access to services.  Tangible progress is being made in this area.  For the first time this decade, new dwelling completions over a 12-month period have exceeded 20,000.  When Rebuilding Ireland was launched in 2016, the total was less than 10,000.  Good progress is being made in the delivery of social housing as well.  In 2014, only 419 social housing homes were built, and this year we will build more than 6,000.  This year, 27,360 housing supports will be delivered to those who need help securing a home.  Most critically, this progress is sustainable.  The measures that have been put in place to accelerate delivery and increase supply are solid and evidence-based, creating confidence for the house building sector across the public and private sectors.  When we talk about targets, whether for social or affordable homes or for overall supply, we need ambition to make the targets high and challenging, and determination to drive forward and achieve them.  Rebuilding Ireland set plenty of targets, and year on year, we are rising to the challenge.  Some are more difficult to achieve than others but we have always committed to full transparency on delivery, which is why I welcome the opportunity to address the committee.<\/p> <p>  Some commentators on homelessness, whether experts or otherwise, suggest that nothing is being done and that our policy is failing completely.  That is untrue and is unfair to the hundreds of local authority staff and our partners in the NGO sector, who are working on the front lines up and down this country doing their utmost to assist vulnerable households.  There are myriad personal, situational and financial reasons for homelessness.  It is a complex issue.  Resolving homelessness continues to be a key priority for my Department.  There are still too many people in emergency accommodation and my Department is working closely with the local authorities to ensure we can provide homes for each of the individuals and households experiencing homelessness.  While the numbers clearly demonstrate the scale of the challenge we face, the most recent homelessness performance reports submitted to my Department by the local authorities show that we are making progress.  In the first nine months of the year, 4,389 adults and their associated dependants exited homelessness to a home.  This is an increase of 17% in comparison to the same period in 2018.  The increasing delivery of social homes under Rebuilding Ireland has resulted in increased exits to local authority homes, with 873 exits this year, which is an increase of 69% on the same period last year.  There were also 691 exits to approved housing body, AHB, homes, up 46% on the same period in 2018.  Data provided by the Dublin Regional Homeless Executive, DRHE, also show increased exits of families from emergency accommodation to homes in the Dublin region.  In the first nine months of the year, 786 families exited from emergency accommodation in Dublin to a home.  This was an increase of almost 50% on the family exits over the same period in 2018.  We will continue to work hard to deliver homes for all families in emergency accommodation.<\/p> <p>  As we work with the local authorities to increase exits from homelessness, we are also committed to ensuring the individuals and families experiencing homelessness receive the supports they need to move to a home, working in partnership with our colleagues across Departments and agencies.  We are continuing to roll out family hubs to provide more appropriate emergency accommodation for families and to reduce the time spent in emergency accommodation through the provision of on-site supports.  There are now 30 family hubs in Ireland, providing accommodation for approximately 690 families.  These are not permanent solutions to the homelessness crisis, but they reflect the need to provide suitable accommodation to vulnerable families until a permanent solution is delivered.  We are also introducing new beds for single adults to ensure shelter for everyone who requires it.  A new outreach team began work in Dublin earlier this year and is working intensively with rough sleepers to encourage them to avail of shelter and supports.  These efforts are reducing the levels of rough sleeping in Dublin.  The winter rough sleeper count conducted at the end of November recorded 92 individuals, which is the lowest number since 2015.  There was surplus capacity of beds in the system on the night of the count and the DRHE and its service delivery partners will continue to work with these individuals to encourage them to avail of shelter.<\/p> <p>  The cornerstone of our policy for rough sleepers will continue to be the Housing First programme.  Housing First is being rolled out nationally and will provide housing and health supports to rough sleepers and long-term users of emergency accommodation with complex health needs.<\/p><p>Housing First will allow us to eliminate rough sleeping in many areas of the country.  For example, Waterford city has informed my Department that Housing First has reduced the number of people sleeping rough in Waterford from 20 to three this month.<\/p><p> I am sorry, I can hear Deputy Boyd Barrett talking.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019121200002#B00300","speaker":"1295","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1576108800,"counter":158,"content":"<p>I apologise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019121200002#C00200","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1576108800,"counter":159,"content":"<p>In terms of social housing delivery, we are continuing to build on the significant progress made between 2016 and 2018 in terms of supporting new households into homes.

By the middle of the fourth year of the plan, an equivalent number of households have been assisted.<\/p> <p>  Of course, we always knew that the number in need of social housing was not a static number and that additional demand would likely arise as our population grows.  That is why we planned to deliver almost 140,000 social homes overall.  We are on track not only to deliver that number, but most likely to exceed it.  Building on a strong pace of delivery in 2018, in the first nine months of this year, just under 18,000 families and individuals were helped into a social housing support across Ireland.  This includes almost 4,400 additional social homes provided by local authorities and approved housing bodies under build, acquisition and leasing programmes and a further 13,600 households accommodated under the housing assistance payment, HAP, and the rental accommodation scheme, RAS.  This is having an impact.  The social housing waiting list has reduced by over 25%, or 22,907 households, compared with the assessment conducted in September 2016.<\/p> <p>  I stated earlier that creating additional supply is at the core of a successful action plan.  Our attention in terms of social housing delivery continues to be firmly placed on accelerating new builds.  My Department is in constant contact with local authorities and approved housing bodies to achieve maximum output in this regard.  This year we have held a housing summit with local authority chief executives and seven regional events with local authority housing delivery teams.  I met with all chief executives again in September in respect of delivery matters following our last committee update.<\/p> <p>  Last year, while delivering 6% above the overall target, we achieved 97% of the national target for new build activity.  It is important to note that this progress has been delivered by a local authority sector which had effectively built no new social homes during the worst years of the financial crisis and which had been stripped of necessary expertise.  This year&rsquo;s targets are even higher.  Delivering well against those ambitions is important.  The targets are deliberately high because the local authority sector, my Department and I understand the urgency and extent of the challenge.  The Department and I have provided the necessary resources to allow the local authority sector to deliver.  I have been clear with local authorities that risks of slippage, delay and non-delivery must be mitigated.  Projects need to secure early agreement at council and must come forward to my Department for approval on a continuous basis and get on site without delay.  Crucially, projects must be carefully managed to completion so we can deliver the homes people need.<\/p> <p>  Delivery of homes is a complex issue and local authorities need expertise and support.  That is why I have agreed with the County and City Managers Association that the housing delivery office, initially launched within my Department, should transition to the Local Government Management Agency, LGMA, to become a resource embedded in the sector dedicated to supporting local authorities achieve maximum potential.  Local authorities have also increased staffing numbers in their housing departments to deliver on increased demands.  Since 2016, an additional 764 posts have been sanctioned by my Department including 217 in this year alone.  There are now almost 3,800 people working to deliver homes in our city and county councils.<\/p> <p>  Our social housing delivery in 2020 will be aided by the completion of the first homes under the social housing public private partnership programme.  Homes in the first bundle of sites will begin to become available from the second quarter, at locations such as Dunleer in County Louth and Naas in County Kildare.  Just last month, we signed the contract for the second bundle of eight sites under this programme.  Construction has already commenced on these additional 465 homes across counties Cork, Clare, Galway, Kildare, Roscommon and Waterford.  Under this model of delivery, a private partner designs, builds and manages each social housing development for 25 years; the land remains with the relevant local authority and all the homes revert to council ownership at the end of the contract.<\/p> <p>  In the 12 months to the end of September 2019, 23,554 new homes became available for use, an increase of 15% on the previous 12 months.  Taking account of leading indicators of activity, such as commencement notices and planning permissions, as well as data on economic activity in the residential sector, we remain on track to reach our targets.  The latest data for the number of new homes granted planning permission are also very encouraging.  In the year to the end of June 2019, permission was granted for almost 32,000 new homes.  In addition, our fast-track planning process is working well.  Last week, I signed an order extending the strategic housing development arrangements until the end of 2021, and my officials are working on legislation to implement a use it or lose it provision, under which planning permission will lapse if substantial construction works do not get under way within 18 months of permission being granted.  To date, 20,242 houses and apartments and 7,890 student bed spaces have been approved under this process.<\/p> <p>  The Government is committed to ensuring that the new homes are more accessible and affordable.  The target is for the delivery of at least 10,000 affordable homes to buy or rent via local authorities over the medium term.  Affordable homes to buy or rent are aimed specifically at lower to middle-income earners who are first-time buyers.  In terms of more affordable purchase properties being made available, the primary legislation has been enacted and the arrangements for the affordable dwelling purchase scheme are currently being drafted.  To date, I have approved 23 local authority schemes of priority and my Department is working with the remaining local authorities to bring this process to conclusion.<\/p> <p>  Importantly, new measures introduced under Rebuilding Ireland, including the &euro;310 million serviced sites fund, SSF, are specifically targeted at supporting local authorities to deliver more affordable homes.  Thus far I have approved funding of &euro;127 million overall to enable the delivery of almost 3,200 affordable homes for purchase under the scheme across 14 local authority areas.  I expect infrastructure works on these projects to begin as soon as possible and delivery of affordable homes from next year onwards.  I am glad to say that one of the first sites that is benefitting from SSF investment is at Enniskerry Road in Dublin, where it is supporting the development of 50 homes under a cost-rental model.  Builders went on site in this project in August and I have seen for myself that good progress is being made.  The grant support provided by Government, combined with the co-operation of many organisations, means that homes in Enniskerry Road will be made available at significantly below market prices for the area.  Lessons learned from this development and other pathfinder cost-rental pilot sites will inform the future development of cost rental in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  More recently, the sod was turned on the second SSF scheme, and the first that will deliver affordable homes to purchase, at Boherboy, Mayfield, Cork city, where 116 new energy-efficient two and three-bedroom homes will be delivered in five phases.  The first phase will be delivered next year and homes will range in price from &euro;198,000 to &euro;223,000.  It should be noted that, in addition to new homes being made available under the terms of the affordable purchase scheme and cost rental at prices which represent a significant discount on market norms, households have also been supported through other key Government affordability initiatives.  These include the Rebuilding Ireland home loan and the help-to-buy scheme which have helped addressed the housing needs of more than 16,500 households.<\/p> <p>  I would also like to take this opportunity to inform the committee of progress with regard to legislative developments in this sphere.  The Housing (Regulation of Approved Housing Bodies) Bill 2019 was passed by the D&aacute;il last week and is progressing through the Seanad.  I acknowledge the positive and co-operative engagement from members of this committee with this important legislation.  It will strengthen governance and the financial viability of the approved housing body sector.  It will safeguard the significant public investment being made in the delivery of social housing by approved housing bodies and provide assurance to tenants, the public and potential investors that the sector is well regulated.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the rental sector, the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2019 was passed earlier this year.  The majority of provisions have come into operation, with the remaining provisions requiring the annual registration of tenancies to commence in early 2020.  Following commencement of the relevant provisions, on the 4 June 2019, I designated a further 21 new local electoral areas across 12 counties using the revised rent pressure zone, RPZ, criteria.  With these designations, an estimated 68.4% of tenancies are now in RPZs.  It should be noted that it is my intention to advance a second rental Bill shortly, which will further enhance tenancies protections, including in the context of receivership situations.<\/p> <p>  In terms of Brexit, like all public bodies, my Department will continue to work with our partners across Government and the wider sector to ensure that the necessary arrangements will be in place to deal with issues that may arise.  As I mentioned in my last engagement with the committee, we have been working with the construction sector, particularly in the area of construction products and the need to have notified bodies located in the European Union for products that are subject to construction products regulation.  We will continue our preparations and work with the key stakeholders on issues arising in terms of housing provision and delivery in the context of Brexit.<\/p> <p>  I thank the committee for the invitation today.  I will, of course, be happy to address any questions that members may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019121200002#C00300","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1576108800,"counter":160,"content":"<p>I normally invite members to indicate if they wish to contribute but, as every member has indicated, I will take them in the order in which they indicated.

I note that, in his address, the Minister challenges people who say that nothing is being done.  People know that work is being done.  The challenge relates to whether enough is being done.  Are the right actions being taken and the right policy implemented?  I worked for Cork Simon Community for eight years.  I was recently in touch with the organisation and it is working flat out.  It is one of the NGOs working with the Minister and it is working extremely hard.  It only receives 50% of its funding from the State.  It works night and day, as do local authorities around the country.  The critiques are concerned with whether the Government's response to the scale of the crisis is inadequate.  People wonder whether the right actions are being taken and being prioritised correctly.<\/p> <p>  My questions relate to pillar 1 and tackling homelessness.  I am particularly concerned with one group included in those figures - children.  I do not believe the Minister specifically mentioned children living in emergency accommodation.  An estimated 3,800 children, and possibly more, are living in emergency accommodation.  Last month, there were an unprecedented two Oireachtas joint committee reports presented on the same day.  I have copies of them.  One was compiled by this committee and the other by the Joint Committee on Children and Youth Affairs.  This committee's report made 14 recommendations and the other report made 20.<\/p><p>Is the Minister planning to act on all, or any, of the recommendations in these two reports within the terms of reference of Rebuilding Ireland or other recommendations or measures available to him?  That is not clear from his statement.  The recommendations were strong and clear, and I would like to hear from him his plans in this regard.<\/p><p> Does he accept the detrimental effects and the adverse childhood experiences associated with living in homelessness?  A total of 70% of people whom Cork Simon Community has supported have experienced these adverse early childhood experiences.  The group we are neglecting today is the group that will be homeless tomorrow.  This is not just a blight on people's lives but also, ultimately, a cost to the State in the responses we must make.  Does the Minister accept that even more children in Ireland are living in cold and unhealthy environments?  Does he also accept the findings of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, SVP, report published earlier this week that a staggering 140,000 children are growing up in the cold and that 12.3% of children are living in fuel poverty, prone to ill-health and illnesses that go with living in such conditions?  This report revealed that one in five one-parent families live in substandard accommodation and 11% are in arrears with utility bills.  The impact of homelessness and inadequate housing on children's health was spelled out by the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland, RCPI, in another important report published in November.  The SVP's Growing Up in the Cold and the RCPI's report are in line with a smaller but important study, Born and Raised into Homelessness, Overcrowding and Substandard Housing, undertaken by Young Knocknaheeny, a highly successful project based on Cork's north side and promoting infant mental health but whose work is undermined at every hand's turn by the fact that families are living in substandard, unsafe, unsanitary and unhealthy living conditions.<\/p><p> Landlords are receiving housing assistance payment, HAP, money from the State for quite frankly slum conditions.  One of the reports cites the case of a family with a child with special needs living in a HAP apartment in which all three family members slept on sofas in the living area due to a large leak from the main bedroom window.  We, as a State, are giving this landlord money.  The second bedroom was damp and the storage heater did not work.  They were heating the apartment with a tumble dryer.  The child living there was under three years of age, had additional needs and was being supported by a physiotherapist and a speech and language therapist.  They could not help that much, however, because of the state of the living conditions.<\/p><p> Returning to the two Oireachtas joint committee reports on child homelessness, what is the Minister going to do about the recommendations?  Is he heeding what fellow Oireachtas Members have recommended, what doctors have recommended and what front-line workers are telling him?  Will he at the very least end the practice of one-night-only emergency accommodation, which is so very harmful to children?<\/p><p> I ask him to think about this.  What kind of effect does he think a night-to-night existence would have had on him when he was a boy?  I ask him to think about his anxiety levels and about getting to school, doing homework, playing and making friends while going from night to night and from place to place.  How would he eat properly?  How would he begin to have a decent life?  As this committee recommended, will he cease the provision of one-night-only accommodation?<\/p><p> Under pillar 1, Rebuilding Ireland commits to appointing dedicated child support workers for children experiencing homelessness.  We know from organisations working on the ground that child support workers are hugely important to the 4,000 homeless children.  The Ombudsman for Children made the same finding, and the RCPI report stated the same.  It also found that 40% of children in homelessness accommodation have clinically significant developmental, emotional and behavioural problems.  I have also heard anecdotally - I want to get to the bottom of this - that children living in emergency accommodation are not getting their vaccines because of certain issues.  I do not have the full facts on that but I will come back to it.  We are letting children down.<\/p><p>  In summary, my questions relate to ending the practice at least of one-night-only accommodation; getting the child support workers to children; and how the Minister will respond to the reports from this committee, the Joint Committee on Children and Youth Affairs, the RCPI the SVDP and others.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019121200002#C00500","speaker":"1430","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1576108800,"counter":163,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator.

Of course, we are letting children down.  If any child is in emergency accommodation, the State is letting that child down.  In my opening statement I mentioned families, but we report on children in emergency accommodation every month.  Thankfully, the number was down in October, but not by nearly enough.  We also have the new quarterly reporting.  I have met many children in emergency accommodation.  I have met them with their parents.  I have met the families transitioning from hotels into hubs, the families going straight into hubs and the families coming out of hubs and going into homes.  At every stage of this process, I get to meet families in crisis and housing insecurity, and it is very difficult for children in these circumstances.  One of the first conversations I had as Minister, which I have related a few times, was about the impact being discovered.  That was two and a half years ago.  While the research from the physicians is welcome, it is not necessarily new information.  Two and a half years ago, some of the leaders in this area were talking about the impact on children's motor neurone skills because of the types of accommodation in which they were growing up, and that is very serious.  That is a big part of the reason the hub model was developed.  I am sure the Senator has had an opportunity to visit family hubs and has been able to see-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019121200002#D00300","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1576108800,"counter":165,"content":"<p>They are not good enough.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019121200002#D00400","speaker":"1430"},{"type":"speech","time":1576108800,"counter":166,"content":"<p>I dispute that completely because, compared with a hotel, a family hub is far superior in terms of the additional space and the wrap-around supports, the Tusla workers, the supports-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019121200002#D00500","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1576108800,"counter":167,"content":"<p>They are not homes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019121200002#D00600","speaker":"1430"},{"type":"speech","time":1576108800,"counter":168,"content":"<p>Of course, they are not homes.  No one is saying they are.  They are the first response.  They should be the only first response.  We should not be using hotels but, unfortunately, we still are.  In a hub, however, there are the wrap-around supports, the supports for the parents, which are important, play spaces and homework clubs.  Most important, children in hubs spend far less time in emergency accommodation than children in hotels.  The average stay is six months.  They should not be there at all, but with the hub programme, we have been able to reduce the time families spend in emergency accommodation and to find sustainable pathways out of homelessness.  This is not about quick fixes; it is about getting people into their forever homes.  That is what we do with the hub programme.  Is what we are doing enough?  No.  It will not be enough until we have built enough homes.  That is why we talk about supply all the time and catching up with the current demand.<\/p> <p>  The matter of funding for NGOs is interesting.  Many people do not realise that many of the large NGOs get more funding from the State than from voluntary contributions.  This is because of the emphasis and the importance we as an Oireachtas and a Government place on getting people out of emergency accommodation.  This is seen in our spend on housing, which this year is the highest on record, and in the fact that we now have a Department dedicated to housing.  That was not just a rebranding; the environment function left the Department and went into the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  It is also seen in the number of new homes now being built, including by local authorities, and the number of people being prevented from going into homelessness.  It is important that they never have the experience of the children the Senator mentioned and the children I have met.  We are also seeing results in the numbers for that other element of homelessness, rough sleeping.<\/p> <p>  The Senator referred to a number of reports.  A number of very good reports with a number of recommendations are being done.  I met the Ombudsman for Children to talk through the recommendations in one of the more recent reports in the past few months to see how we could ensure that our understanding of the recommendations was the same as the ombudsman's for when we go to implement them.  My officials recently appeared before the Joint Committee on Children and Youth Affairs to talk about the recommendations in that report.  We are still reviewing some of them.  Measures such as the quality standards framework are now being rolled out nationally.  We have talked about an inspections regime.

The figure was under 10,000 before Rebuilding Ireland, so the programme is increasing supply.  We must continue to increase supply.  As I said, it is not yet enough.<\/p> <p>  As for children or families who might be experiencing fuel poverty, half the social housing stock has been retrofitted since 2014.  We have more work to do on retrofitting the social housing stock.  A number of different supports are available through the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection for families who have difficulty paying bills.<\/p><p>Housing assistance payment, HAP, households have to be inspected as part of the HAP agreement to ensure they are up to standard.  That is different from the private rental sector, although we are increasing inspections in that sector.<\/p><p> With regard to the one night only accommodation, that is not policy.  However, we must have a contingency for when a family might appear at the last minute.  We have to put them somewhere for the night so they are safe and not on the streets.  The next day we get them into something more permanent.  It is important that there is a contingency in place for that situation, but it is not policy to have one night only accommodation.  The policy is hubs.  The number of self-accommodating is down, which is good, and we have key workers in place for families who are struggling.  From speaking to some of the people working on the front line, it seems that some families who have come into emergency accommodation have difficulties that are not just about meeting the rent or finding a place to live.  Unfortunately, they are deeper than that and the families require more help and support to get them sustainably out of homelessness.  That work is taking place with those families.<\/p><p> The important thing is to have a joined-up approach across the Government.  One of the things I implemented when I was appointed Minister was an inter-agency group across the Government to ensure we have that joined-up approach.  In the case of Housing First, we make sure it has the support of the Department of Health.  When we are putting a new detoxification facility for Dublin Simon on Usher's Island, it too has the support of the Department of Health.  When we are dealing with families who are not aware of their status to remain, we deal with the Department of Justice and Equality.  When I am talking to the Ombudsman for Children, we talk about Tusla.

Will he confirm that the target in Rebuilding Ireland is 25,000?<\/p> <p>  Senator Kelleher made a number of valid points regarding family hubs.  Unfortunately, they have become a necessity.  The Minister asked where families would go if there were no hubs.  They should go to houses and to permanent solutions for them.  How many additional hubs have been planned by the Department or is it planning to develop and fund more hubs?<\/p> <p>  Bringing existing social housing stock back into use is not mentioned in the Minister's statement.  How many homes were brought back into use in the last quarter of this year since September?  The Minister might not have the figure.  With regard to Dublin City Council, is he aware that no funding was provided for voids since the start of September last and will not be provided until January next year?  Work was being done to bring existing stock back into use for families to live in, which are the solutions Senator Kelleher was talking about, but what was the position with Dublin City Council for the full quarter and how many other local authorities throughout the country were affected by that?  Is funding back in place from January next year to bring voids back into the market?  Why were we not advised about that position?  What was the reason for no further funding being given for those voids, particularly in Dublin City Council?<\/p> <p>  Regarding the Minister's targets for home delivery, he referred in his statement to 4,400 additional social homes provided by local authorities and approved housing bodies, AHBs, under build, acquisition and leasing.  How many of the 4,400 were acquisition and how many were acquisition of turnkey properties?  The Minister talks about housing needs having been met under Rebuilding Ireland.  It is important for people to know that, as part of that, three times more people's housing needs, and it is the Minister's definition of the housing needs, have been met through short-term measures such as HAP and the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, which is basically in the private rental sector through State subvention and State assistance with rent payments.  It is 13,600 versus 4,400.  That is not sustainable.  The Minister spoke at previous meetings about a tipping point where the housebuilding would overtake the new tenancies.  Is he still on target to reach that by 2021, which is the target he gave us previously?  The over-reliance on HAP and RAS sticks out like a sore thumb.  They are not sustainable solutions for families.  The Minister regularly speaks about people being transient and choices for people.  It is not most people's choice to have a 12-month lease with a private landlord where rent is being paid by the State, and he knows it.  Will the Minister say how many of the 4,400 were turnkey purchases by AHBs?  How many were purchased by local authorities?<\/p> <p>  On the housing delivery office, how many people are in that office, which he is transferring to the Local Government Management Agency, LGMA?  Are there plans to beef up the office?  How many vacancies are there in that unit?  The Minister said he is transferring it over to the LGMA and that is probably the right place for it.  What impact or effect does he think that will have?<\/p> <p>  On the issue of affordable purchase, more than 12 months ago the Minister received submissions from many local authorities dealing with the draft criteria for an affordable purchase scheme.  The Minister said in his statement that the affordable dwelling purchase scheme is being drafted.  When will it be completed and published?  Last July, the four Dublin local authorities voted on and accepted the draft criteria.  The Minister will be aware that local authorities that wish to deliver affordable purchase schemes cannot launch them in the absence of a national scheme.  I am asking for a timeframe.  While affordable purchase and affordable rental are included in Rebuilding Ireland and the Minister talks about them regularly, the reality is that we have not delivered a single home under an affordable purchase scheme.  The reason is that the Minister has not published a national affordable purchase scheme.  What is the position with that and how long more will we have to wait for it?<\/p> <p>  With regard to social housing, the Minister said 92,000 households are on the housing waiting list.  How many households are on the transfer list?  Are local authorities still removing people from the main housing list if they move into a HAP tenancy?  Do we know how many are on the housing transfer list and which local authorities are moving them off the main list and which are not?  I am aware that some have recently refused to move people from the main housing list, but what is the reason for that?<\/p> <p>  As regards rough sleepers, I note the Minister's comments about Waterford.  That is welcome.  All of us are acutely aware of the weather and the possibility of a harsh winter.  Will the Minister elaborate further on the winter plan for rough sleepers?  What additional funding will be provided by the Department and what additional resources are there for rough sleepers throughout the country?  It is not just a Dublin issue, as the Minister knows.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019121200002#E00200","speaker":"1228"},{"type":"speech","time":1576108800,"counter":179,"content":"<p>Gone are the days when we discussed it pillar by pillar.

It will not be until the first quarter of next year that we will be able to confirm whether we reached 25,000, but I believe we are there or thereabouts.  We are talking about building houses and it is not an exact science in terms of being able to say we will get to 25,000 on the dot, 25,001, or whatever it might be, but all the percentage increases we are seeing point to us reaching it.  We keep it under review and we do that by looking at commencement notices, planning permissions, completion notices and things like sentiment, although sometimes it is difficult to capture sentiment and to know exactly what it will mean for delivery.<\/p> <p>  Rebuilding Ireland contains different targets, but the main target is 125,000 new places to live by the end of 2021.  We still have to get through 2020 and 2021, but already we have delivered 64,000 new places to live since the third quarter of 2016, while there are 26,000 on site over the past 12 months and there are more than 30,000 with planning permission.  We can be certain we are going to hit that target from two years beforehand, unless there is some type of massive shock to the economy that is not foreseen at present.  Even if there were and if we look at worst-case scenarios, the funding we are providing is based on an average of 2% growth over the remaining two years, and all indicators at present show that growth will be higher than that.  Even if there was a shock, the funding would be in place to support that delivery of social housing.<\/p><p>I believe it will continue on the private side as well, given the kind of demand that is there.<\/p><p> Families should go into homes.  No one is saying anything different to that.  Until we have enough homes built, however, we must have emergency measures in place which are suitable.  We brought out the hub programme because we recognised hotels were not suitable.  We needed to get families into hubs and that work continues.  We are constantly adding new hubs.  Two new hubs have been opened in my constituency in the past few months.  There is a pipeline for around 400 new hub spaces.<\/p><p> The difficulty is that, sometimes, local authorities bring forward a plan for a hub but it will fall for different reasons.  Maybe the local authority is in negotiations with somebody who owns the land or the site.  Maybe the negotiations do not conclude in the local authority's favour.  It has been the case that in my engagements with local authorities over the past two and a half years they might have thought they had four hubs coming but only two materialise.  That is why we ask them to always have a contingency in place should something fail.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019121200002#E00900","speaker":"1295","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1576108800,"counter":187,"content":"<p>Are these 400 new spaces family or individual places?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019121200002#F00200","speaker":"1228"},{"type":"speech","time":1576108800,"counter":188,"content":"<p>That is not 400 hubs but 400 family spaces.<\/p> <p>  On voids, do we want to get into a conversation about Dublin City Council funding?

He asked a series of different questions across the entire Rebuilding Ireland programme.  I have no problem answering them if I am given the space to do so.  I have been fair in answering but he has interrupted me.  He cannot start this back and forth and not let me finish a sentence.  It is very improper in terms of the conduct of the committee.<\/p> <p>  It is important to note that affordability concerns certain parts of the country.  If one excludes the greater Dublin area, Cork and Galway, 85% of homes are sold at prices that constitute less than double-digit growth.  Why are prices in the market flat or falling?  It is because we have increased supply.  These measures that we have in Rebuilding Ireland are helping in the general affordability issue.  If we are not to make the mistakes that other cities have made, however, we must recognise the Government has to step in to the bridge the affordability gap.  That is what the serviced sites fund and LIHAF are about.  That is what we will continue to drive to get these homes open for people as they need them.<\/p> <p>  The housing assistance payment is housing support.  It is meeting a person's housing needs using taxpayers&rsquo; money to do so.  It works for many people in terms of the flexibility that is there in terms of working more hours or being able to move location more easily, depending on how their life circumstances change.  It is an important support but we should not be dependent on it to the extent we are.  I said that before.  We now have movement within local authorities regarding the housing assistance payment.<\/p><p>We also have a HAP transfer list.  More than 1,000 people have moved from the HAP transfer list to a social housing home.  They have been independent or have sought support and they have got HAP support and they are now in social housing homes.  There is a pathway through HAP into social housing as it is traditionally understood, and it is important that we continue that.<\/p><p> Regarding our arrangements for the winter period, as I said at our previous meeting we want to bring in 300 new long-term emergency beds, not the contingency cots that get rolled out during a severe weather event.  More than half of those have already been put in place.  That equates roughly to the increased number of adult males in the October count in terms of individuals in emergency accommodation.  There is a correlation there between the new beds that were bought and the increase in the number of people in emergency accommodation.  The funding is there.  That is not an issue.  The cold weather initiative has already been activated on a number of occasions so far this year because of the cold nights that we have had.  We have seen a decrease in rough sleeper numbers, which is very welcome.  It is at its lowest point since 2015.  That is not by accident.  It is because of the work that is being done by the Department, the Dublin Region Homeless Executive, DRHE, the local authorities and the NGOs.  A lot of work is happening to help people who are most exposed when it comes to the housing crisis, in particular at this time of year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019121200002#F06000","speaker":"1295","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1576108800,"counter":247,"content":"<p>I am not particularly happy with the tone of the meeting thus far.

I then tried to look at what the impact of not having it off-balance sheet would have on the delivery of housing over the next five years.  I also wish to focus on how we have failed to convert vacant private housing into use.  In addition, I wished to focus on the 59-week process and the four-stage process.  I got the quarter 2 report for 2019.  I previously expressed my frustration at having to copy it in PDF and convert it to Excel, which is still not available.  I was working my way through it in detail to ask specific questions.  I sat at the computer last night and tried to get the Minister's opening statement, and I saw that, lo and behold, the report for quarter 3 of 2019 has been issued.  The report contains 99 pages of data, so I decided I had had enough.  I sat through 12 meetings on Rebuilding Ireland and 150 committee meetings.<\/p> <p>  When I went home I asked myself what it is all about.  We are coming up to the Christmas period.  While listening to the radio on the way to the meeting I heard it said that it is the end of the decade.  A colleague asked me how this D&aacute;il would be viewed in 20 years.  I was at a commemoration in Castletown last week for Liam Mellows, where we spoke about principles and the Proclamation.  We spoke about the extract in the Proclamation of cherishing all the children of the nation equally.  When we look back at the period of this D&aacute;il and previous D&aacute;ileanna, we will look at this as a decade of neglect of the children of Ireland.  Homelessness is at the heart of that neglect.<\/p> <p>  I am not a parent.  I do not know what it is like to have children in this country, but I know about children from my life experiences and from people coming into my offices.  I think of Pam, whose son Ryan is seriously ill, and the efforts she makes to protect her son and to try to provide a quality of life for the rest of her family, but the State keeps making it harder.  I think of my own niece who went through a serious problem with self-harm, and but for the fact that she could afford private healthcare, she would have been left abandoned, because children are waiting 18 months for assessment.  Jigsaw has offered for the past four years to locate in Wicklow to deal with mental health issues but we cannot bloody well find it a premises.  A total of 215,000 are waiting for healthcare.  Families contact me every second day of the week who do not know where their children are going to go to school.<\/p> <p>  My own hotel has been used for homeless families.  I have seen them coming in and out.  I have seen children who just do not want to engage because it is not a happy experience to go to a hotel.  I have seen the other side in the hotel as well where staff are asked to intervene in families with complex needs but they are not trained to do that.  Members of my family, who are not with us today, would have been very proud that I was elected to this D&aacute;il, but I do not know whether they would be as proud of the effort I have made in trying to deal with situations like child homelessness.  I regret to say to the Minister that, politically, he will have to take the blame for this, but we are all involved in it, every single one of us, and it is up to us all to try to address this.  We are all on the bus.  The Minister might be driving it and choosing the gears but, equally, we all have responsibilities.  Solutions have been provided and they have been ignored.  The committee has provided the Minister with detailed reports and we have made suggestions ourselves, but it has to be about getting away from the noise of all the data, all the reports, all the spin, all the launches and focusing back on what it must be about, namely, child homelessness.  Let us not make another decade like the one we had for the last decade.  I am sorry, Chairman, but I am a bit frustrated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019121200002#G01000","speaker":"1357"},{"type":"speech","time":1576108800,"counter":256,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Casey.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019121200002#G01100","speaker":"1304"},{"type":"speech","time":1576108800,"counter":257,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Casey for his contribution.  He tied together a number of challenges that people and some families in particular in this country are having at the moment that are not all related to housing.  As Deputies, we all have constituents who have problems and we all try to help them in the ways that we can.  We have a responsibility nationally as parliamentarians to make sure that this country is moving in the right direction and not the wrong direction.  We have a challenge at the moment in public discourse to make sure that we do not lose sight of the importance of an evidence-based approach to policy and that we do not casually dismiss facts even though they might tell us things that we do not agree with or that are uncomfortable, such as facts about the number of children in emergency accommodation, which is too high.  It was the case decades ago that things that made people uncomfortable in society were kept hidden from the public through a consensus of politicians, media and the people at the top of the tree, as it were.  That has hurt too many people across too many decades.<\/p> <p>  One of the things I have been determined to do as a politician is to make sure that we have greater accountability for politicians and greater transparency.  It is one of the reasons we publish all the information that we do.  It is one of the reasons we give members as much raw data as they would like.  Whether they want to look at it or not is a separate thing, but we must have a transparent Parliament and Government and an accountable Parliament and Government.  We must make sure that no one tries to dismiss the challenges people have today, as families or individuals, despite the fact that other indicators tell us how well the country is doing or the number of jobs being created.  These are all very important things, but it is equally important that those who are most vulnerable in society are being cared for.  It is important that we try to protect public debate around things like what is happening and what needs to be done.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Casey talked about some of the things he was thinking about asking.  I might answer some of those questions if I may, because it is important that so far, just looking at Dublin alone, we have seen approximately 786 families leave emergency accommodation this year.  That is not enough, but those 786 families are now in a home and that is important too.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Casey asked about vacancies in private dwellings.  We have seen between 7,000 and 10,000 homes come out of private vacancy back into use since Rebuilding Ireland.  There are still more to come, but that is a lot of homes that would not have been in use were it not for the efforts that are happening in the wider economy, not just in relation to new builds but vacancy as well.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Casey referred to the four-stage process.  It is important that we should not have any unnecessary delays for people who are waiting for homes.  The four-stage process was much longer - it was a nine-stage process - and it takes 59 weeks.  As I said yesterday in the D&aacute;il, certain local authorities such as Wicklow County Council have got it down to 44 weeks.<\/p><p>The same person who worked on that is now the chairperson of the LGMA and will be involved in the housing delivery office to help reduce timelines even further in some local authority areas.<\/p><p> Deputy Casey said I have ignored solutions that have been brought to the table.  I have not ignored one solution.  I am the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government.  We spoke about this in the debate the other night.  Some Opposition Deputies think their only responsibility is to introduce Private Members' Bills or ask questions in the D&aacute;il based on what they hear in their clinics.  They see that as their job.  If that is what they think, that is fair enough.  I am the Minister every day.  I work on this every day.  There is not one proposal that has been put to me that I have not considered in detail.  Indeed I have gone back to some proposals six or 12 months later to look at them again and ask if we got things right.<\/p><p> Regarding other solutions, Fine Gael is in the minority.  If the Deputies believe that a rent freeze is a solution, for example, which I do not believe, there is a vehicle for that to progress through the Houses separately from Government.  I do not think it will, because I do not believe Fianna F&aacute;il is taking a transparent stance on this.  I have considered every solution that has been brought to me.  Deputy O'Brien introduced the Planning and Development (Amendment) (First-Time Buyers) Bill 2019.  I saw a lot of problems with that Bill. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019121200002#G01200","speaker":"1295","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1576108800,"counter":259,"content":"<p>It passed Second Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019121200002#H00200","speaker":"1228"},{"type":"speech","time":1576108800,"counter":260,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for interrupting again.

If it reaches Committee Stage, I will outline them then too.  Nothing has stopped a good idea from making it through the House.  Let us be fair to ourselves.  When we introduced the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2019 earlier in the year, positive proposals made by Deputies on all sides of the House were supported and introduced.  The regulation of the approved housing body sector, which is incredibly important given the thousands of homes it is building and tenanting on behalf of the State, moved very quickly because good ideas were accepted and carried through.  That is how we do our best work.  It is not when we are standing up in the D&aacute;il and shouting at each other or causing friction over what might be seen as petty squabbles in the D&aacute;il Chamber or in the committees.  It is when we come together on legislation, make it work, get it done and implement it.  That is when we are at our best.  We have done that in several instances with Rebuilding Ireland.  We lose sight of that.<\/p> <p>  It goes back to something that Senator Kelleher was saying earlier on.  People glibly say that nothing is happening and nothing is being done.  I see it written in the papers and I hear it in the D&aacute;il.  If we keep on saying that despite the evidence of progress in several key areas, the public will lose faith in all of us very quickly.  It is not true to say that nothing is being done or that everything is happening as quickly as we want and going perfectly.  I was not the first to say that.  Someone from one of the NGOs, perhaps Focus Ireland, said it.  We need to acknowledge where progress is being made and where more progress can be made.  We need to find solutions that we can all agree on and that can make it out of these Houses into the real world without doing more harm than good.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019121200002#H00500","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1576108800,"counter":263,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister.  His last contribution summed up a lot of things.  His job is an extremely difficult one but the facts speak for themselves.  One of the most interesting facts is that our population is growing.  It is estimated that our population could hit 6 million within the next decade and a half.  The new people coming here have to be accommodated as well.  At 11 a.m. I will be attending the launch of a report by another committee, of which I am a member, on direct provision.  Some 11,000 people are seeking asylum in this country.  We are accommodating more than 7,000 of them in emergency accommodation and direct provision centres.  The other 4,000 are finding their own accommodation.  There are huge challenges.  There is absolutely no doubt that good work is being done.  Some 50,000 people are in homes now who were not in homes in 2016.  Some 50,000 houses have been built since 2016.  That is very important and must be noted.  That said, there is a lot more to be done.<\/p> <p>  The Minister does not get enough credit for the work he has done.  There are very serious concerns, and for anybody or any child to be homeless is totally unacceptable.  However one would swear by some of the commentary that the Minister thinks it is acceptable.  I consider the Deputy one of the more genuine members of Government and he is trying to deal with this problem.  It is a difficult one.  There has to be fairness, balance and respect in the debate.<\/p> <p>  One problem I have identified is local authorities.  There is a serious problem with delivery by local authorities on the ground.  I fully appreciate the fact that the Minister's Department has made money available for them to draw down, but there seems to be a problem with local authorities scaling up and getting on with the development of housing.  I am often told that a matter is with the Department, which is delaying in replying.  I have gotten to the stage where I do not believe that.  My contention is that local authorities have not stepped up to the plate to the degree that they should have.  I welcome the fact that the Minister meets the chief executives every three or four months.  Is there anything he could do or any structure he could put in place to force local authorities to move faster?  The Minister of State, Deputy English, came before the committee last week to discuss Traveller accommodation.  One local authority was allocated &euro;850,000 in 2018 and drew down only &euro;13,000.  Does the Minister agree that there is a serious problem with local authorities on the ground delivering on the Government's housing policy and strategy?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019121200002#H00700","speaker":"1416"},{"type":"speech","time":1576108800,"counter":264,"content":"<p>That is a very important point to make.  The number of homes built in the State in 2013 was just over 4,000.  The construction sector was decimated in the crash.  We had to get to increase the number of homes being built to meet the demand that was already there, but during that time demand has been increasing because of net immigration due to the economy doing well.  This has created an additional pressure that was not there before.  The population will continue to grow.  We have hardwired a further increase in the annual output of homes into the national development plan that will come into force after Rebuilding Ireland to be more in line with the projections the Central Bank was talking about the other day.  It is important that we recognise that demand will increase, and we have to continue to drive an increase in the delivery of new homes.<\/p> <p>  We have regular Cabinet sub-committee meetings where we discuss people who are in direct provision, have been granted leave to remain and need a home.  We discuss ways to get them into homes and out of direct provision through things like the housing assistance payment, HAP.  I refer also to the refugee programme.  The really good work done by the State in helping almost 2,000 refugees into homes and communities throughout Ireland seems to go under the radar.  It is different from direct provision, because those people have been identified through a process outside of the State.  They do not come into the country through the direct provision system.  They go into homes.  That programme has been very successful and we are going to do more.<\/p> <p>  I thank the Senator for the support.  Like him, I am not here for the credit.  None of us is.  We are here to do the job because we believe we have a responsibility to do it, but I thank him for his words of support.<\/p> <p>  People are sometimes very quick to criticise local authorities.  I have defended them since day one and said they would be the primary vehicle for the delivery of social housing.  So they are, and we have hardwired that into our delivery of housing.  However, some have more challenges than others.  Slightly more than 400 social housing homes were built in the State in 2014.  This year we will build more than 6,000.  That is because of Rebuilding Ireland.  Again, people say Rebuilding Ireland is not working, but this is a fact that shows it has increased delivery.  It is not enough yet, but next year we will build more social housing homes than were built in any of the boom years, when the economy was said to be fine and houses were flying up.  Some 90,000 were built in one year.  Next year we will build more social housing than was built in any of those years.  That says something about the priority this Government places on social housing.  That does not get reported either, but that is what happens in political debate.  Some of the facts get crowded out.<\/p> <p>  Local authorities are sometime too quick to blame the Department.  One of the process changes we have implemented involves the publication of annual targets that they have to meet.  There are two areas where I believe new measures can help local authorities be more accountable and do more.  One of these is the task force approach.  We brought this to Cork, where it has been very successful.  I cannot remember the numbers off the top of my head, but the two Cork local authorities were building almost nothing as recently as 2014.<\/p><p>This year, there are approximately 1,000 homes in its pipeline, which is very impressive.  That shows how the task force model can work.  We have now deployed it to Galway as the two councils in the county have really struggled.  That will help drive delivery in Galway.<\/p><p> The big issue is the movement of the housing delivery office into the local authority sector.  The local authorities will be responsible for driving delivery, while the Department will continue to have oversight and will continue to publish national targets.  They have an impressive digital tool which can show in each local authority which projects are at stage 1, 2, 3 or 4, which are on site and which are at pre-planning stage.  It can give a very detailed understanding of exactly where we are to date in each public authority and where we will be in the next three to four years.  As that tool is delivered in the housing delivery office within the Local Government Management Agency, every local authority and councillor will be able to ask for the update live on screen and interrogate the numbers.  There will, therefore, be more accountability at local authority level for councillors.  That is also needed.  Councillors need to recognise the important role they have in ensuring that their respective local authority is meeting its targets for housebuilding and in respect of families in emergency accommodation.  When I look at the record of debate in some local authorities, I am not sure they are giving the time they should be giving to issues such as housing and people in emergency accommodation.  Hopefully, these new tools will give councillors more power to demand more of their respective executive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019121200002#H00800","speaker":"1295","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1576108800,"counter":266,"content":"<p>I will make an observation that the Minister might consider.

In October last, the number of people registered as homeless stood at 10,514, including 3,826 children.  That is very worrying.  Nearly four years on, Rebuilding Ireland is not working.  I have listened to the Minister recently.  I missed his contribution in the Seanad but I listened back over the debate.  I have also listened to him in the D&aacute;il.  I do not think anyone wants to make political points because we have past that now.  Like all members, I have people coming into my clinics crying because they have nowhere to go.  There is hidden homelessness that no one is talking about.  People are going from house to house staying on couches and they do not qualify to go on a local authority housing list.  I have asked the Minister since I became a Senator to change the income threshold for becoming eligible to apply to be placed on the local authority housing list in County Carlow.  At &euro;27,500, it is one of the lowest in the country.  It is unacceptable that there has been no review in nearly nine years.  I tabled a Commencement matter the other day and the Minister of State, Deputy English, came to the Seanad to respond.  He was very nice and he indicated a review would take place in January.  I was told it would be done in September last.  It is almost 2020 and we still do not have a review.<\/p> <p>  The Minister said he was listening but I do not know if he is.  I raise this matter with him every time we meet.  People who are working do not qualify to go on the local authority housing list because they might be earning &euro;28,000 or &euro;29,000.  They pay rent of &euro;1,000 a month and cannot afford to save.  They are caught in the net and have no supports or help.  These people are crying out for help.  We have failed them.  We have so many soup kitchens around Ireland and food parcels being given out because people are not coping.  Housing is the biggest issue.<\/p> <p>  The Minister should implement a time limit for families living in emergency accommodation.  They should be housed within five or six months.  I ask the Minister and his Department, which plays a major role in this, to do something to ensure children are not left writing their letters to Santa from emergency accommodation.  We heard yesterday on the radio a letter from a child to Santa asking if he would find the child in a hotel.  That little child, who wrote the same letter from a hotel last year, had to do it again this year.  That is unacceptable.  Six months is plenty of time, even too long.  People should not be in emergency accommodation for that long.  A timescale is needed. <\/p> <p>  On the shortage of social housing, local authorities need to start building housing again.  They are not building enough.  The Minister has gone down the route of approved housing bodies.  While that is welcome, we still need to go back to having local authorities building houses.  One of the biggest issues is that the houses being built are not the right type.  People are living longer and many have disabilities.  Three and four bedroom houses are being built.  We need to adjust the types of housing to accommodate people with disabilities.  The lack of two-bedroom houses is becoming a big issue for lone parents.  Single people cannot get a house or apartment because there are none available.  The overall build and criteria need to be reconsidered.  I encounter this issue every day.<\/p> <p>  Affordable housing is a major issue.  The Minster referred to a figure of &euro;250,000 as affordable.  That is too high.  An affordable home for a family in County Carlow would be about &euro;120,000.<\/p> <p>  People cannot buy out a house owned by an approved housing body.  That is one of the criteria and it needs to be examined in the long term.  Good families are getting these houses and with more employment coming back on stream, they need to be given the option to buy.  I could not believe the criteria that apply to tenants seeking to buy a local authority house when they were introduced last year.  The tenant must have 50% income coming into the house.  A tenant in a local authority house could win the lotto in the morning but would still be unable to buy the house if he or she is not working.  It does not make sense.  I could come in here and go on a rant and I feel like doing that but there would be no point because the Minister is under enough pressure.  However, common sense needs to apply to certain issues.<\/p> <p>  The biggest issue I wish to raise is mental health.  People with mental health issues who present to their local authority are finding that there are no services available for them.  I am dealing with two cases involving homeless people who cannot get help for mental health issues.  The Department said it will improve mental health and primary care services for homeless persons using the existing allocation, but there is no funding.  The Minister told me there are weekend services available.  I am on the ground in my area 24-7 and they are not there.  I can tell the Minister every seed, breed and generation of what is happening and I know there are no weekend services.  He also needs to address that issue. <\/p> <p>  I can say categorically that the rent pressure zones are not working.  We have a rent pressure zone in Carlow town but not in Bagenalstown, Tullow and other areas.  How does the Department distinguish between these areas?  Well over 1,000 people are on the housing list in Carlow.<\/p><p>There are three municipal districts.  One district, Carlow town, qualifies but the others do not.  This does not work.  The Minister needs to reconsider that.  I firmly believe it is not working.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019121200002#J00600","speaker":"1395","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1576108800,"counter":272,"content":"<p>The Senator has gone over her seven minutes.

Thankfully, there was a reduction in the number of families and children in emergency accommodation in October.  The increase that happened was driven by adults.  That roughly correlates with the number of new beds we put in place and also with the number of people who are no longer rough sleeping.  There has been a movement off the streets or out of unsuitable accommodation into emergency accommodation.  Obviously, we do not want to see the numbers going up, but if people are getting better care and supports and we can get them out of homelessness on a sustainable basis, it is a good thing to be able to do.<\/p> <p>  Despite what I said only moments ago, the Senator casually fell into suggesting that Rebuilding Ireland is not working.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019121200002#K00400","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1576108800,"counter":275,"content":"<p>It is not.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019121200002#K00500","speaker":"1395"},{"type":"speech","time":1576108800,"counter":276,"content":"<p>As an elected representative, the Senator must be responsible enough to be able to distinguish between what is working in the context of the plan and what she thinks is not working.  It is irrefutable - it is recorded by the CSO - that there are 64,000 new places in which to live that were not there prior to the introduction of Rebuilding Ireland.  In the past 12 months, 26,000 homes have gone into construction and there are more to come.  The number of people on social housing lists has decreased by 25% since 2016.  On social housing, approximately 400 homes were built in 2014.  Over 6,000 will be built this year.  This type of delivery is being achieved under Rebuilding Ireland.<\/p> <p>  It is regrettable and unacceptable that there has been an increase of approximately 2,500 in the numbers going into emergency accommodation since I became Minister.  However, in the same period, 12,000 households have exited homelessness as a result of Rebuilding Ireland.  The plan is working to help those families into the homes that are being built.  It is working to help get double-digit price inflation in house prices down to being flat or falling in many areas.  I accept that we still have challenges in the rental sector, but we have independent evidence showing that rent pressure zones have taken between two and three percentage points off rent inflation, which is welcome but not enough.  We need to do more which is why we changed the rent pressure zone legislation earlier this year.<\/p> <p>  Focusing on Carlow, since the introduction of Rebuilding Ireland, more than 1,500 households have been supported.  Rebuilding Ireland is working for those households.  There has been a reduction in the social housing lists in Carlow, where 519 households are now waiting for homes.  Some 485 homes are in the pipeline for Carlow.  Rebuilding Ireland is working to build those homes.  That is the distinction we have to make.<\/p> <p>  The income eligibility criteria for social housing have been examined.  The Housing Agency has done work on it.  In the past month, I have met my officials to analyse different potential ways to deal with the eligibility criteria and consider the knock-on effects and possible risks.  On the previous occasion on which I appeared before the committee I stated that we are introducing a series of reforms in respect of social housing that are based on recommendations from a number of reports published in recent years.  I want to introduce them together because they have an impact on each other.  These reforms relate to tenant purchase, eligibility criteria for social housing, succession rights and differential rents.  They are all interrelated to one degree or another.  There is also a relationship between social housing eligibility and affordability.  In my view it needs to be dealt with in the round.  I had hoped to get the matter to Cabinet before the Christmas break, but that will not now happen.  I hope to bring it to Cabinet early in the new year.<\/p> <p>  On the timeline for people in emergency accommodation, those in hubs wait for six months on average.  In general, the majority of families and children are in emergency accommodation for less than 12 months or less.  We are constantly trying to drive those numbers down.  We would like everybody to be in emergency accommodation for no more than six months.  As we get more hubs, that will help.  We need to get to a position where having a family in emergency accommodation is unique.  We cannot continue to have thousands in emergency accommodation.  At present, approximately 1,700 families are in emergency accommodation.<\/p> <p>  As I mentioned to Deputy Casey earlier, so far this year more than 700 families have exited emergency accommodation.  Families are coming in and leaving, but more are coming in.  We need to get to a point where no more are coming in so that it is all prevention and not just one in two families.  We also need to ensure that those who are in emergency accommodation today get out of it and into homes.  We will do that as we increase supply.  All the evidence under Rebuilding Ireland indicates that is exactly what is happening.  That is why I can point to more than 700 families who have exited emergency accommodation or those increases in the number exiting not into HAP-funded accommodation, but into a social housing home.<\/p> <p>  On affordable housing, the prices in the Boherboy development is &euro;200,000, perhaps a little bit higher.  At a cost of &euro;200,000, an individual earning &euro;36,000 can afford to buy that home using a Rebuilding Ireland home loan.  A couple earning &euro;44,000, for example, a garda and a nurse starting off in work for the first time, can afford to buy a home costing between &euro;200,000 and &euro;250,000.  That is what we mean by affordability.  We want to get that across far more sites than we have today.<\/p> <p>  The Senator mentioned housing for disabled people and for the elderly.  I have a list in front of me of different sites containing houses for the elderly.  We are trying to hardwire this into the local authorities so that as they develop sites, they provide houses for people with special needs and people who are elderly.  I have been on those sites.  There is a great site in Kilkenny with everything from apartments to homes to elderly accommodation.<\/p> <p>  I recently opened a housing scheme in County Kildare.  The Ceann Comhairle was present on the day.  One of the homes was built for an adult with particular special needs.  That home was built in a way that they could move seamlessly from a bathroom, which was a wet room, into the bedroom with a hoist system, wider doorways, lower kitchen levels and no plumbing under the sink so that a person in a wheelchair can manoeuvre under the sink.  All these things need to be and are being considered by local authorities in providing social housing.<\/p> <p>  Even though the numbers on social housing lists are falling, those lists contain a predominance of single individuals or couples.  As a result, the social housing stock being built needs to reflect that.  That means more apartments than have been built heretofore.  We are seeing some of that come through.  We might like to see a bit more from the housing bodies and the local authorities.  That is something that needs to be addressed and will be addressed with the housing delivery office.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019121200002#K00600","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1576108800,"counter":277,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Barry, who will be followed by Deputies &Oacute; Broin and Boyd Barrett.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019121200002#K00700","speaker":"1304"},{"type":"speech","time":1576108800,"counter":278,"content":"<p>I wish to focus on HAP.  Before doing so, however, I have two other quick questions to ask.  In September, Deputy Coppinger highlighted in the D&aacute;il the issue of landlords demanding sexual favours in place of rent.  The Minister indicated that he was in talks with various organisations about a national survey next year, not exclusively about this matter but as part of another survey there would be a question on that.  I ask him for an update on that.<\/p> <p>  A constituent of mine bought a house just before the austerity crisis.  Their partner lost their job leading to a crisis with household income.  The arrangement they had to come to with the bank was that they were bankrupt and they lost their house through bankruptcy.  The woman in question has been told that she cannot apply for a Rebuilding Ireland home loan with the council because of that bankruptcy.  She has suggested an exemption for people in her position.  Would the Minister consider that?<\/p> <p>  There was considerable correspondence in advance of today's meeting containing lots of facts, figures, graphs etc.  The growth of the HAP sector in the recent years is really striking.  Spending on HAP in 2016 was &euro;58 million; in 2017, it was &euro;153 million; in 2018, it was &euro;276 million; and, in 2019, it is &euro;422 million.  The projected expenditure in the budget for 2020 is &euro;503 million.  It is nearly a ninefold increase in four years.  This is the privatisation of social housing provision with enormous sums being given to landlords.  Some within the sector are enriching themselves on the basis of these transfers.  Some 60,000 HAP arrangements were put in place between 2016 and 2019.<\/p><p>The graphs on pages 2 and 3 of the documents we were given show there were 9,208 new builds during that period, which HAP outstrips by 6:1 or 7:1.  In the past year, there has been an increase of almost 13,000 in HAP, although it is only the third quarter of 2019, and just over 2,000 in new builds, which is also a ratio of approximately 6:1.  Will the Minister drill down into the statistics for 2021 and outline a breakdown or roadmap as to how the flip will take place?  I would also like him to drill down into the figures for new builds.  How many of the 2,003 new builds in the first three quarters of this year were local authority council houses?<\/p><p> In summary, I would like a breakdown of the 2,000 new builds under the various headings and a figure for how many of them were new council houses.  I expect that, unlike the HAP figure, the ratio will not be 6:1 or 7:1 but much smaller.  That is probably an important issue the committee needs to get to grips with.  I will leave it at that to give the Minister some time to drill down into those figures because they are important.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019121200002#K00800","speaker":"1432","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1576108800,"counter":280,"content":"<p>On the issue of sex for rent and matters that Deputies Barry and Coppinger have previously raised with me, we had meetings, which the Deputies will know because they attended them, and I had a further meeting on the matter earlier today.

There will be much information about it, but we focused on one specific aspect in the meeting earlier and did not talk about the wider survey.<\/p> <p>  On Rebuilding Ireland and bankruptcy, I cannot speak to a specific case.  Nevertheless, we have recognised that people may have had difficulties in their past.  They may have been in a relationship, for example, and might have had a home under that relationship and now be separated or divorced.  We did not want to exclude people in those circumstances from being able to participate in the Rebuilding Ireland home loan scheme.  Likewise, if someone has gone through bankruptcy, he or she will be deemed to be a higher credit-worthy risk.  He or she would not be excluded outright from being able to apply for a Rebuilding Ireland home loan but it would depend on the reasons for the bankruptcy and on whether he or she could meet the criteria for eligibility today, notwithstanding the fact that he or she will have been through bankruptcy.

By the end of 2021, we want a greater number of people to be supported to move into social housing than in HAP over the course of that year, and for that to continue as a new trend beyond the lifetime of Rebuilding Ireland.  As for social housing builds, more than 6,000 homes will be built this year, while next year will be a record year for social housing building, which is important to recognise.

By then, the number will have fallen to approximately 10,000 new HAPs and the two figures will continue to move in opposite directions from then.  We need HAP because without it, where would the people go, given that the homes have not yet built?  Until they have been, HAP will be there to support them, but from 2021, the figures will move in opposite directions.  It is important to recognise that HAP existed previously but it was just not called HAP.  It existed as a different type of rental support for people in the private rented sector.   It has done some of that heavy lifting but is currently doing too much.<\/p> <p>  On social housing builds, all the figures are outlined in the construction status report published at the end of the year.  I always publish an annual report that gives a detailed breakdown of how the houses have been delivered through each of the schemes we have.  I am a bit confused as to why the Deputy distinguished between housing bodies and local authorities delivering social housing, given that he has previously praised housing bodies in the D&aacute;il.

I appreciate it takes a significant amount of work.  This is not a criticism of the officials, whom I know are overburdened with work, but I want to express frustration that we get the information very late.  It makes it more difficult for us to properly scrutinise the material if we get it late.  Please do not take this as a criticism, because I know producing detailed reports takes a lot of time, but even if we could get this material a day in advance, it would make our jobs much easier.<\/p> <p>  As the Minister is aware, this committee unanimously agreed a report on family homelessness which we published in November and which had 14 very specific recommendations.  I would be interested to know, not only if the Minister has considered the report, but if at this stage he could commit to saying that he would support any of those.  If the Minister is not in a position to give us that information now, could he let us know if it is his intention to correspond with the committee to tell us his view on each of those 14 recommendations.  It was a piece of work that took the committee and the clerk a considerable amount of time, and I think there are some very good suggestions in there which I hope the Minister would lift from it.<\/p> <p>  One of the issues I am increasingly concerned about is the smaller number of families who are expending considerably longer periods of time in emergency accommodation.  By and large, they are families with larger numbers of children.  They could be Traveller or Roma families or just families which have larger than average numbers of children.  We have a small number of families that will spend their fourth Christmas in emergency accommodation, and for some, it will be their third Christmas.  Can the Minister tell us how many families are more than two, three, and four years in emergency accommodation?  More importantly, is it not now time for some specific intervention, tailored to the family size, to try to get these families out of emergency accommodation, particularly given the difficulty that many local authorities have in both acquiring and producing sizeable four bedroom units?<\/p> <p>  The summary of social housing assessment is a very important report.<\/p><p>I welcome its publication by the Housing Agency every year.  It shows a year-on-year change of 3,000 households, that is, a decline of the number of families on the list of 3,000.  What the report does not say as far as I can see, which it did say last year, is how many new households came onto the lists during the 12 months.  I think it is fair to say that if the overall social housing support delivery, including real social housing and subsidised private rental tenancies, is in the order of 17,000 to 19,000 in that year, and there is only a reduction of 3,000 households, we may be seeing a significant increase in the level of new social housing demand on previous years.  The reports of last year and the year before recorded approximately 14,000 new households on the list.  The figure for this year is not there but it seems to me that we could be looking at something much more significant.  I would appreciate if the Minister could give us any response to that.  <\/p><p> I want to talk about the social housing output figures.  My interest in them is not because I want to run out of here and misrepresent the Minister.  I do think this committee has a legitimate right to track the targets and ask questions, particularly as to whether those targets will be met.  In my commentary on this matter this morning on the radio, I made it very clear that we questioned this at this time last year when the Minister said he would deliver on his targets, and he did deliver on them.  My one concern is that while the Department is ahead on acquisitions, similarly to this time last year it is behind on new builds and leases.  It is in a similar position in terms of how behind it is on the new builds.  The delivery rate is about 35% at the end of quarter 3, which is exactly the same as last year.  The Minister is absolutely correct that by the end of quarter 4 last year the targets had been filled out.  However, this year, the target is greater by 2,000 new builds than it was last year.  The Minister has more visibility on this than we do.  How confident is he that he is going to meet those targets by the end of the year?  It is an important question and I would like to think that some of the pressure on the Minister and his officials does come from the work of this committee highlighting it.<\/p><p> I also think it is legitimate for us to ask questions breaking down the different aspects of the new build programme.  I welcome any real social housing, no matter what delivery stream it comes through, including approved housing bodies, AHBs, turnkey, local authority new builds and acquisitions.  However, it is concerning that despite the fact that we have some 31 local authorities, their portion of the new build still seems to be sluggish.  It is more than it was in previous years but, for example, there are only about five large approved housing bodies delivering the vast bulk of AHB stock.  I warmly welcome that stock.  The reason many of us ask about the new build figure is that it should be significantly ahead of all the others, yet three and a half years into this plan it is still very sluggish.  I am genuinely interested to know, within the local authority and AHB new builds, the number or percentage of turnkeys.  I am not against turnkeys.  I have a number of very significant turnkeys in my own constituency that are really valuable.  None of those is the kind of turnkey the Minister described.  They were all either near completion or on site when they were sold.  I am not objecting to them.  However, if local authorities are becoming over-reliant on turnkeys, that says something about their own output.  I am genuinely interested in teasing that out a little bit more.<\/p><p> I also want to talk about HAP and RAS.  I have never argued that there should not be a rental subsidy.  My concern is that the targets in Rebuilding Ireland have far too much rental subsidy and far too little real social housing.  Over the period of Rebuilding Ireland, the percentage of rent supplement transfers as the overall HAP figure is about 23%.  This year so far it is about 13%.  The vast bulk of those are people who have not actually moved property.  They have stayed in the one property but have moved from one rental subsidy to the other.  Surely we should not be including them in what is presented to us as new tenancies.  I am not trying to get into a row about playing the figures here but when the Department gives us the output figures at the end of the year, the impression is that these are all new things.  If I am living in the same property and have just moved from rent supplement to HAP as the HAP scheme has advantages that rent supplement does not, it should not be suggested that this is something new in terms of the tenancy.  I am also concerned about the impact of the growing levels of HAP tenancies on the rental market more generally.  If we have had 66,935 HAP tenancies created since Rebuilding Ireland, that is a lot of rental stock taken out of standard rental.  Has the Department done any assessment of the impact of such large levels of HAP on the rental market overall, rental prices, demand and so on?  I am not arguing against rental subsidies.  It is the disproportionate over-reliance on rental subsidies versus new stock.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019121200002#M02500","speaker":"1215","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1576108800,"counter":315,"content":"<p>I thank the members for their questions.  On the frustration with things getting late, some of the delays are sometimes with me because I just have not had a chance to sit down and read the report before it is published because of other things that are happening in the D&aacute;il or in the Seanad.  The officials work incredibly diligently but sometimes the Minister himself can be a bit of a bottleneck in terms of getting things to the committee.  It is not intentional.  I want the members to have as much information as they think they need so that we can go through these things in as much detail as possible.  I do not want information getting to the committee late.  I will do better in that regard myself.  On family homelessness and the recommendations, I met with officials after the committee had published its report and we went through the recommendations.  I was also aware of what was coming because we were given early sight of the draft.  My understanding was that I had corresponded but I will go back and look at that.  I thought I had come back to the committee, if not with a full position on each of the recommendations, to give a timeline as to when we would.  I will check that.  If we have not, it is my fault, but my understanding is that it was in train.  I have gone through the recommendations that were produced by the committee.<\/p> <p>  On the social housing assessment, there has generally been a 25% decrease since 2016.

I do not remember that.  On our targeted delivery, they are high targets.  They have increased again for this year by an extra 2,000 homes.  It is very important that the targets are getting higher each year.  Because they are programmed over the four quarters to build into the last quarter, as happened last year, new builds will catch up.  The Deputy asked about my confidence that they will catch up again this year.  I have high confidence that they will.  In all these things, we recognise that we want the local authorities to be building the houses and doing the delivery, so they are independent of me.  If we do not make it, it will not be due to a fault in the Department.  It will be because something happened on the local authority side.  That is not to shift the blame but just to recognise that we say we want local authorities delivering houses and if a local authority fails to deliver on its target, that is the local authority.  Due to the work we are doing with local authorities to help them and because of the constant oversight that we have, I have high confidence we will reach our targets.  I will be reporting on that in January.  The Deputy used the phrase \"sluggish growth\".  In 2014, 400 homes were built for social housing and this year it is more than 6,000.  I do not think that growth is sluggish.  If we were operating in the private sector and achieving that kind of growth in housing delivery, it would be quite phenomenal.  It is phenomenal in terms of what local authorities have done, coming from almost nothing to quite something indeed.  It is an increase of 2,000 on last year which will increase again next year and continue increasing.<\/p> <p>  The breakdown on the turnkeys is just coming now.  I will have it in a moment.  On HAP, interestingly, the targets for build were lower until I increased the build target by 30%.  I did increase the targets and we got the extra funding to increase them.  In fact, the ratios might have been even worse.  We will see that dependence on HAP coming down below 10,000 as the social housing stock increases above 12,000.<\/p><p>We are going to shift away from that dependency but the initial build target under Rebuilding Ireland was lower and we increased it.<\/p><p> The Deputy is correct that some of the new HAPs are going to people who are on rent supplement but going from rent supplement to HAP means something different for the tenants involved because of the flexibility and supports they have.  Unlike rent supplement, we believe it meets the household need as it is defined.  Had we not done that with HAP, the tenants in question might have been out of housing altogether.  While I take the Deputy's point that such people are perhaps not leaving the property they were in, it would have been a different scenario for them had we not stepped in with HAP.  We have always been clear and transparent about the percentage of HAPs that are going to people who are coming from rent supplement.<\/p><p> Work was done on the impact of HAP tenancies on the market.  People in receipt of HAPs represent a small percentage of the overall rental sector.  I am concerned that there might be too much of a concentration of HAPs in a particular area and what that might do to the local rental yield.  We continue to look at that on a case-by-case basis.  People have expressed concerns to me that all the new apartments that are coming online will be taken up by those in receipt of HAP.  Those people have concerns about others who have housing insecurity but they are also concerned about getting homes for themselves.  I have heard those points being made and it is something on which we are constantly keeping an eye.  We also keep an eye on the percentage of HAP uplifts, the number of HAPs using the 20% flexibility option, or a portion thereof, and the homeless HAPs availing of the 50% option.<\/p><p> Fewer than 1,000 of the 6,500 homes that will be provided for social housing will happen through the turnkey mechanism.  I do not have a breakdown of those that were commissioned from plans versus those that might have been taken later on in the process.  We tell local authorities not to compete with first-time buyers and we are quite clear on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019121200002#N00600","speaker":"1295","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1576108800,"counter":321,"content":"<p>There has been nodding from the secretariat to indicate that we have not received correspondence on the report and it would be appreciated if we could get that soon.<\/p> <p>  The Minister did not respond to the question about long-term homeless families who have been without a home for two, three and four years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019121200002#O00200","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1576108800,"counter":322,"content":"<p>I beg the Deputy's pardon.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019121200002#O00300","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1576108800,"counter":323,"content":"<p>I will make two other quick points.  I used the word \"sluggish\" specifically about local authority new builds.  I am not suggesting that turnkey or AHB new builds are in any way inferior, but there are concerns.  Many of us expected that, at the beginning of social housing output, local authorities would be behind the curve because of capacity issues and all the rest of it.  It was expected that as we get towards the end of Rebuilding Ireland, the proportion of local authority new builds would be much greater.  I am genuinely concerned that 1,000 or 1,500 of the approximately 6,000 local authority builds is a small proportion.  I am highlighting a concern not to deflect from the approximately 6,000 homes but to say that local authorities should be delivering a larger proportion.  I will reflect on that.<\/p> <p>  The Minister of State, Deputy English, was with us recently discussing the report on Traveller accommodation.  Many of us are very keen that the actions in that report progress as a matter of urgency next year.  Will the Minister give his support and commitment to assisting the Minister of State so that whatever he brings forward will get through this House?  Sinn F&eacute;in has committed to giving the Minister of State our support and this is an opportunity for the Minister to share his view of that particular issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019121200002#O00400","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1576108800,"counter":324,"content":"<p>Is there a committee meeting in January?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019121200002#O00500","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1576108800,"counter":325,"content":"<p>There is.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019121200002#O00600","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1576108800,"counter":326,"content":"<p>The Minister of State, Deputy English, is within my Department and we spoke before he appeared in front of the committee.  I am fully aware of what his intentions are, he has my full support and there is no question on that.<\/p> <p>  We will follow up on getting correspondence to the committee and I apologise for that omission.<\/p> <p>  It is interesting to consider the tables in more detail.  The programme for Rebuilding Ireland recognised that local authorities would be slower off the mark because they did not have the capacity.  I mentioned in my opening statement that more than 700 new posts have been sanctioned, which means there are now more than 3,000 local authority staff working in this area.  The profile for delivery gets better for local authorities towards the end of Rebuilding Ireland.  One of the tables shows that when the composition of the builds is broken down, local authorities will deliver the majority of them.  We will not see the 2:1 ratio this year but it will not be far from that.  By the end of Rebuilding Ireland, what local authorities will have done will be impressive.  Things do not stop with Rebuilding Ireland and there is not a cliff edge at the end of 2021.  At that point, all local authorities will have the afterburners going on housing delivery.  The housing delivery office will at that stage have spent two years with local authorities, have new guidance confirmed for the external layout for social housing and have the internal specifications.  New protocols will have been agreed on procurement and much more will happen in respect of certain local authorities implementing clustering initiatives in which they have expertise.  There will be an impressive pipeline under the national development plan.  I want to make sure that housing building and delivery are hardwired into local authorities so that if someone was to come in after me and try and unpick that in any way, they would find it impossible.  That is what we need to make sure we do so we do not repeat mistakes that were made in the past.<\/p> <p>  I will turn to families in emergency accommodation.  We still have an issue whereby we are getting better data in Dublin than in the regions, although there is much greater proportion of families in emergency accommodation than in the regions.  For those in Dublin, the majority of families have been in emergency accommodation for 12 months or less.  Approximately 187 families have been in emergency accommodation for between 12 and 18 months, 146 families have been in emergency accommodation between 18 and 24 months and 186 families have been in emergency accommodation for two years or more.  <\/p> <p>  The Deputy is correct that it is more difficult to house larger families.  I said in response to Senator Murnane O'Connor that a number of families who are now in emergency accommodation, and particularly those who have been there for two years or longer, have complex backgrounds that meant the families ended up in emergency accommodation and have been unable to get out.  In some cases, they have particular and fundamental needs that are not just about meeting the rent.  Those people require much more dedicated support to ensure that, as they move out of emergency accommodation and into a home, they will stay in that home.<\/p> <p>  There was talk about getting families out of emergency accommodation when Deputy Coveney was the relevant Minister and the intention was not to get all families out of emergency accommodation within a year because he recognised at the time that some families had much more complex needs that would take more time to be resolved.  That continues to be the case, particular for families who have been in emergency accommodation for longer than 24 months.  As I said earlier, the majority of families have been in emergency accommodation for less than 12 months and those figures are always improving, but particularly so in the past year because of the additional houses that we have available to us through delivery across the different streams.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019121200002#O00700","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1576108800,"counter":327,"content":"<p>We have 12 minutes left according to our schedule.

Things are happening but the problem, to be clear, is that Rebuilding Ireland is flawed because it relies, by a ratio of 3:1, on the private sector to build social housing and is, therefore, destined to fail.  That is my argument, to be clear.<\/p><p>A person sent me a text message this week and asked me to read it out.  I will redact the name of the person and the homeless hub that she is in.<\/p> <blockquote> \tHi Richard, my name is ... I dealt with you nearly three years back.  I was on &quot;The Big Picture - Homelessness&quot;.  Anyway I spoke with someone today and told me to get on to you about my story.  So since I met you last, I've had two more children born into homelessness.  Unfortunate, with a broken heart as a type this, my son passed away in the hub.  They moved us out after it happened to an apartment that was run temporary by Peter McVerry.  My daughter then lost the top of her finger because there were big heavy fire doors that slam in a split second.  The managers came up to check on the doors where they broke.  They were supposed to slow down before closing, but these, they didn't so then they moved us after back into a family hub, one bedroom, five of us living there, and there is more to the story if I could meet.  I want people to know this, I want to get my story heard for what the Government are putting my families through.  The council have even agreed I am homeless all my life, which is 23 years. <\/blockquote><p>That is shocking and unacceptable.  None of us can claim that things are working if that is happening.<\/p><p> As that lady indicated, she came to me three years ago and we fought to get her into a hub.  She is still there and she has had two children born into homelessness.  One passed away in that situation.  It is just unacceptable.  That story is repeated, to a greater or lesser degree, for thousands of women and families in this country.  I wanted to say that first.<\/p><p> In D&uacute;n Laoghaire, the picture is grim in the extreme, because we have the highest rents and the highest house prices.  Whatever else the Minister wants to say about targets, it is not happening in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  In the official report of the council, the target for build, acquisition and leasing for 2019 is 208.  There are 4,300 families on the housing list.  The target for 2019 was 208 and, to date, it has delivered 87.  It said it will get another 21 under those categories by the end of the year.  It will get to just over half of its target.  That target is pathetic when one considers the 4,300 families on the housing list.<\/p><p> I have gone on and on about the number of people who have been whacked off the list in that period because their earnings inched marginally above the income threshold, which the Minister has repeatedly refused to increase despite being pestered by me and others for two years.  That has reduced the number on the list, to some extent, but not the reality of those facing the housing crisis.<\/p><p> I have pointed out to the Minister that under the category \"build\" the number of council houses to be completed in 2020 in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown, which was pathetic and under target in 2019, will be two.  This is from official documents.  If I include AHBs, as the Minister is so keen that I do, that figure goes to 13.  This is not working and it is not acceptable.  Seven or eight years ago, before the Minister came into office, I publicly raised the issue of Shanganagh.  I pleaded then that council houses be built on that site but not a sod has been turned.  The reason is that the Minister insists on a mix, the LDA and on everything, except building council houses on land that is ours.  That this is not acceptable.<\/p><p> I refer to tenants, and I raise this matter again.  The tenants in St. Helen's Court in D&uacute;n Laoghaire, which was bought from NAMA by vulture funds, are facing the fourth effort by those vulture funds to evict them, and the Minister's Government made the decision to sell it to those funds.  Threshold has been helping the tenants, as have I, and it believes that this time we have run out of rope.  Ten of the tenants have left already because they have had enough and those ten units have sat empty for about a year and a half.  They are directly across the road from my office.  Of the other ten tenants, eight of them face the likelihood of eviction immediately, because to get around the Tyrrelstown amendment, they are evicting eight.  They will almost certainly get away with it unless something exceptional happens with the RTB, which we doubt.<\/p><p> If the Anti-Evictions Bill 2018, which was passed by the D&aacute;il, had been supported by the Government and had become law, those people would still be in their homes.  That is a fact.  This is because the Minister allows vulture funds to evict people on grounds of sale.  Does he not think that he should change his attitude on that issue?  If he does not, what does he propose to say to those tenants?  I want to go back to them and say that the Minister said this is the answer to their problem.  However, at the moment, they are facing is homelessness in the new year because there is nowhere else in D&uacute;n Laoghaire for them to go.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019121200002#O00900","speaker":"1238","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1576108800,"counter":330,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Boyd Barrett, and call the Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019121200002#P00200","speaker":"1304"},{"type":"speech","time":1576108800,"counter":331,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his contribution.  When he says the plan is flawed, he is saying that, as he admitted, from an ideological point of view.  He thinks it is flawed because it is over-reliant on the private sector.  It is not that the plan is flawed in terms of increasing the output to the degree that it will increase it - for example, by increasing the stock of social housing by more than 50,000 homes, which it will do, or getting 125,000 new homes by the end of 2021.  It is not flawed in those respects.  Deputy Boyd Barrett is saying it is flawed based on how much it is weighted towards the private sector.  What I would say to the Deputy on that, although again it is an ideological position, is that the social housing programme, which is under way and which will increase the stock by 50,000 homes, has not been seen in decades in this country.  We need to provide housing for everybody in this country, including social and affordable and private housing.  We have responsibilities to every one of our citizens and that is what the plan intends to meet.<\/p> <p>  Stories in this crisis are very important.  We hear a lot of stories and we are moved by them.  The story Deputy Boyd Barrett told is horrific.  It is very hard to imagine what that family is going through at the moment.  I do not know all the details of the story.  I am not going to seek to undermine it in any way.  It is very difficult to hear those stories.  However, reasoning from the basis of stories, one story or a number of stories, does not undermine the evidence that we have for the supports that are being given.  I refer to the stories of the 2,500 people in emergency accommodation since I came into office, and the stories of the more than 12,000 households that have exited homelessness since I came into office.  There are lots of stories in this.<\/p> <p>  There is also lots of evidence of how our plan is working.  The plan is not finished.  The problem is not solved.  There are still huge challenges out there.  The housing sector is not fixed.  We were very honest about this.  We said it would take five years to get from almost nowhere to a point where we had delivered more than 100,000 homes.  In tandem with that we have dramatically reformed our rental laws, changed the types of homes we are building, and brought about a new vision for housing delivery that was planning-led rather than developer-led.  All of those things are now happening or are in train.  They are all part of this plan that we have.<\/p> <p>  House prices are falling in D&uacute;n Laoghaire, because of the increase in supply that is happening generally.  Cherrywood will deliver about 9,000 new houses.  They put in all the infrastructure first.  The parks, the football field and the AstroTurf facilities are there.  Houses are now being built and it will have a huge impact on that area.  Enniskerry Road, our first cost-rental scheme is being built, with apartments to rent from &euro;1,200.  On Shanganagh, the planning permission will go in in January, but even before then, the LDA will publish what it intends to submit as part of its transparency initiative, because it is the State developer.  We are going to see social and affordable houses there.  For the people who live there, that is going to be a huge benefit for them as well.<\/p> <p>  In terms of D&uacute;n Laoghaire's actual targets, it has 658 homes in its pipeline for build at the moment.  It has delivered 330 new build homes to date.  The social housing list is falling in D&uacute;n Laoghaire to just over 2,600.  Progress is being made in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  As the Deputy knows, D&uacute;n Laoghaire is a very particular area in terms of affordability issues, so we have to do more there to drive affordability.  We have to make sure people do not get in the way of delivery in terms of objecting to housing.<\/p> <p>  Tenancy laws are there to protect tenants.  Threshold is Government-funded and is there to help tenants, as is the RTB.  This is not to prejudge the outcome of particular cases, but as I said not everything is perfect.  I have been very open about considering every solution put to me, including the anti-evictions Bill.  I had a number of round-table discussions with the NGOs on this, including the CEOs of the NGOs.  The Taoiseach was also involved in those discussions.  We have looked at this Bill.  First and foremost, it is unconstitutional so we cannot get around that.  I cannot get around being told by the Attorney General that a Bill is unconstitutional.  The only way to do so is by way of a referendum.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019121200002#P00300","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1576108800,"counter":332,"content":"<p>Has the Attorney General told the Minister that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019121200002#P00400","speaker":"1432"},{"type":"speech","time":1576108800,"counter":333,"content":"<p>Yes.

Even if one restricted it more, as has been proposed by some NGOs, and said that people would have to remain<i>in situ <\/i>until the home was sold, then all one would be doing would be forcing the new person buying to evict them so they could live in the home they bought.

I do not know the details of it.  If, for example, each of the approved housing bodies, AHBs, received &euro;100 million of private financing tomorrow morning, which is &euro;1.4 million or &euro;1.3 million, that would form part of the fiscal space.

On the off-balance sheet issue for housing bodies, I met the Irish Council for Social Housing, ICSH, earlier in this term and I met the Housing Alliance, which represents the large tier 3 housing bodies, I think, in October of this year.  What we have is a EUROSTAT decision which, as the Deputy knows, is a classification issue for balance sheet purposes.  We do not want that to interfere with delivery from the housing bodies, and I have made a commitment that it will not.  To date, the classification issue around it, in terms of the accounting treatment, has been led by the Department of Finance.  My understanding from the Department of Finance is that even if one was to see such a development - we want to see more private finance coming in through housing bodies for housing delivery - the impact on the fiscal space would be almost negligible, even at the amounts the Deputy is talking about.  However, we want to get through this in the way the UK got through this, which was a reclassification of the balance sheet.<\/p> <p>  I made a commitment to the Housing Alliance during those meetings that we would try to progress some of the proposals it brought to the table in terms of opinions it has around the interpretation the CSO has made, and to see if we can make progress with the CSO.
