The transitional LEADER programme also runs until the end of 2022, with &euro;65 million available to local action groups who deliver the programme and approve projects at local level.

Following publication of the report, the Department organised a workshop, &quot;Where will the Philanthropy of Today lead us tomorrow?  Charting a course for the development of an Irish National Policy on Philanthropy&quot;, in association with the European Research Network on Philanthropy.

As he rightly outlined, the existence of a vibrant and thriving philanthropic community is a very important element of civic society.  In recent years especially, we have seen outstanding philanthropic work from individuals and organisations.  Even at times of such difficulty and constraint Irish people have always managed to find the time and means to think of others.  This is something we should be very proud of as a nation.  Annual philanthropic giving to registered charities amounted to &euro;108 million over the period from 2017 to 2018.  However, research by Indecon notes that outside of Ireland there has been a decline in annual levels of philanthropic giving by international philanthropists.  There was a decline of approximately &euro;65 million from 2014 to 2019.  How do we address this international shortfall?

There have been some proposals in this regard from foundations working in the area, whereby we should encourage a localised form of philanthropic giving.  It is already happening but it is certainly an area of huge untapped potential in the country.  There are many good people and businesses who want to make a contribution towards improving society.

We know the regulatory and fiscal frameworks vary between countries.  There is no single example of best practice in this regard.  One aspect is, of course, Government support for philanthropic endeavour through providing tax or other incentives.  The OECD has indicated there is no single accepted rationale for the preferential tax treatment of philanthropy.  This is because it is such a complex area.  It is critical that any tax incentive is used effectively and not in any way exploited.

It is worth citing the top five things that motivate philanthropic giving as listed in the Indecon report.  These are care about the cause, people believing they can make a difference, people believing we all need to help solve social problems, trusting the organisations being donated to and wanting to help people who are less fortunate.  These are very good intentions that we want to support more.  While there is a reasonable level of philanthropic giving in Ireland, compared to other European countries of a similar level we are quite low.  It is an area of untapped potential and we will be deciding this year, through the national policy development process, how we facilitate more of these people who want to do the things that we do in government also.  There will be a challenge because much philanthropic giving is very personal and there is a balancing act in trying to encourage it to align to some extent with government priorities also.  It is a delicate balancing act.

The Deputy focuses on rural issues in his question.  I might address city centres, towns and villages in my second response.  My thoughts are with the victims of the most recent horrific attacks.  This happened in their own home.  It should never happen to anybody.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is conducting a criminal investigation.  I hope the Deputy appreciates that I will not comment specifically on individual cases.  However, I know that I speak for everyone in this House in condemning these senseless and cowardly attacks and the belief that the people responsible need to be brought to justice.  We support the garda&iacute; in their work in that regard.  Although rare, incidents like these are terrifying not only for the victims themselves but for their families and the wider community.  Home is the one place we should all feel safe in, and fear in one&rsquo;s own home is something that can never be tolerated.  I assure the Deputy that my Department is committed to ensuring we have strong, visible policing right across both rural and urban Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the management and administration of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  As Minister, I have no role.  I will outline much of the work that the Commissioner and his team are doing.  This year&rsquo;s winter phase of Operation Thor was launched by garda&iacute; in October 2021 and is designed to tackle burglaries and associated criminal activities, which often increase in the darker winter months.  They intend to do that through targeted enforcement and crime prevention activity and information.  We all see that and work closely with our crime prevention officers in our own counties and constituencies.  This annual focus from Operation Thor has proven highly successful in tackling property related crime since its inception in November 2015.  Looking at the figures, in 2015, more than 18,800 residential burglaries were reported.  By contrast, in 2021, just over 6,000 residential burglaries were reported, a reduction of over 66% or approximately 13,000 less residential burglaries.  We have obviously seen a decrease with Covid in the last year, but we know that in the years before 2021, that number was also decreasing.  I think we can attribute much of that to Operation Thor as well as the increased number of garda&iacute; on the beat.  While the Covid-19 pandemic was clearly a factor in some of this reduction, there has been a marked and consistent downward trend since Operation Thor was introduced.<\/p>  <p>  The budget provided by Government to the Garda Commissioner continues to increase to unprecedented levels, with an allocation of more than &euro;2 billion for 2022, which is an increase of one third compared with the funding in 2015.  I hope that highlights how much of a priority investment in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is.  The recruitment of up to 800 additional garda&iacute; opened last week, as well as recruitment for 400 Garda staff.  This significant investment demonstrates our commitment to increasing the Garda workforce to enable the organisation to keep our communities safe.  The Deputy will be aware of a recruitment competition that we opened last week.  I thank the many people who highlighted this and the significant number of people who have come forward to express an interest in joining An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to new recruits, the roll-out of the new Garda operational model will support the redeployment of garda&iacute; from non-core duties to front-line policing across the country.  The new model will see larger divisions with more resources, increased Garda visibility in communities, a wider range of locally-delivered policing services and a strong focus on community policing.  It is the five divisional model.  There will be one with a specific focus on community policing.  I think Members can all appreciate, recognise and acknowledge how important it is to have community police officers and how much engagement they have with older communities to reassure and work with them to make sure that they can keep their homes safe.<\/p>  <p>  Budget 2022 also allocated &euro;12 million for investment in the Garda fleet, which is extremely important for rural Ireland.  It means we have more high visibility policing in our towns and cities, as well as rural parts of the country.  This continued investment is to ensure that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has a more fit-for-purpose fleet and it can be mobile, visible and responsive on the roads.  There are many small back roads in Ireland that we have to cover too.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021700012#K00700","speaker":"1502"},{"type":"speech","time":1645093800,"counter":132,"content":"<p>I understand that it is a difficult task, particularly in rural areas, where there is a large geographic area that garda&iacute; are trying to patrol to keep people safe.

When an incident such as this happens, it heightens that sense of vulnerability.  I acknowledge that, in Ireland, we generally have safe communities.  We need to say that too.  People generally are safe and feel safe.  The case of Tom Niland in Sligo was an extreme example.  It worries and alarms people.  They wonder what can happen next.  They are fearful when they hear a car, when there is a knock on the door, or when anything like that happens.  We have to ensure that we put measures in place to protect people in their homes.  We also have to look for measures which will be greater deterrents and to have better detection to assist garda&iacute;.

It is horrifying and terrible for the people it happens to and we need to make sure that those who perpetrate it are brought to justice.  We also need to make sure that we speak to our communities, that older people do not feel vulnerable in their homes and that there is communication within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in local areas to make sure that it links in with those who are vulnerable and living on their own.<\/p> <p>In that regard, the more garda&iacute; we have in our divisions and the more we have out policing, away from desk duties, the more they can engage with people on the ground.

A reduction in the number of reports of burglaries to just over 6,000 last year is a significant reduction, and we can refer that back specifically to Operation Thor.  There is always more we can do, however, and there is an onus on us as public representatives to reach out to our communities and to make sure that where there may be a lack of information or engagement on the ground, we play our part.

There have been others in a similar vein.  Many people, particularly those in urban areas, tell me there is great fear out there and that when they ring 999 they do not get an answer.  That is, I think, one of the issues that has really frightened many people on another side of this issue.  We know now, from some of the research that has been done, of a number of cases.  In one case a woman was raped and was afraid the rapist would come back.  She rang 999 and got no response.  The seriousness of that incident and others like it is really damaging to people's confidence in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and their confidence that the justice system will respond and work for them.  There is a big job of work to be done to restore that confidence and to ensure not only that people will get responses to 999 calls but also that they feel that the Garda will be there for them when they need it and that they are not just an emergency service but a service to protect them all the time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021700013#L00200","speaker":"1607"},{"type":"speech","time":1645094400,"counter":136,"content":"<p>In response to the Deputy's last comment, I think that, more in the past two years, people have seen just how proactive An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is, including in responding to emergencies and crimes as they occur and in the proactivity with which it has responded through Covid-19, reaching out to communities and looking at domestic violence.  It is a fact that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na actively went back to people who had been victims previously to make sure they were okay.  It is very clear that the work the Garda does is not just responsive but proactive engagement.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to reassure everybody that if they call 999 they will get a response.  Issues arose that have clearly been highlighted in recent reports, and structures are being put in place to make sure that incidents involving callbacks and so on that occurred do not happen again.<\/p>  <p>  To comment on the focus on towns and our city centres, Dublin alone, through Operation Citizen, has seen an increase of 500 garda hours per week on top of the garda&iacute; who were already patrolling the streets at the weekend.  We have more than 100 garda&iacute; patrolling in that regard, and that is directly in response to concerns people have raised during Covid-19, when there were fewer people on the streets, people were more visible and assaults and other incidents may have been happening.  In response to that, the Garda has responded very well.  Of course, there will always be issues that arise but, in general, people need to have confidence in the Garda, and I genuinely believe they do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021700013#L00300","speaker":"1502"},{"type":"speech","time":1645094400,"counter":137,"content":"<p>I understand that, and there is general confidence that people will get a response in time, but that is shaken when incidents such as I have described happen.

That is a serious issue that needs to be dealt with.<\/p>  <p>  The broader issue here is down to having more community garda&iacute; on the beat and making sure that there is a quicker response time, that we have better detection, that we have better deterrents in place and that we have protection in place for people in their own homes.  We also need to have protection for people travelling on public transport, which is another issue I have raised with the Minister before and which I keep hearing is one of the key problems people have when they are at a DART station, on the Luas or in places like that.

The Garda is responding to concerns that are being raised.  I have said to the Deputy before that where issues persist or where the response is not strong enough, the Garda Commissioner is always willing to look at where he can expand and strengthen the work already being done.  In general, however, the response is about more garda&iacute; and greater visibility.  The 800 additional garda&iacute; we will have this year, on top of the 400 civilian garda&iacute;, will open this up and allow more front-line garda&iacute; out on the beat.  There is also the investment in cars, bicycles and other types of equipment, which is extremely important in addressing many of the issues the Deputy has raised and in making sure that people not just are safe in our towns and villages but feel safe, because often part of the fear and the concern is that they do not feel safe.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021700013#L00500","speaker":"1502"},{"type":"speech","time":1645094400,"counter":139,"content":"<p>I accept that much is being done, but the issue is that people's experience when an incident happens can often be quite negative and they do not feel that there is fast enough a response.

At weekends, in some of our provincial towns, where we are reopening up the economy, including the night-time economy, there are stresses and serious pressure on the Garda to be there to provide an adequate service for everyone across the community.<\/p>  <p>  The real issue of my question is adequate resourcing.

Balancing the right to protest with protecting the public and upholding the rule of law is a complex task, and the Garda reviews its actions and responses in that regard regularly.  I am assured by the Garda Commissioner that members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na receive detailed training based on a \"human rights first\" approach to any protest.<\/p> <p>This approach was acknowledged and commended by the Policing Authority over the course of its 16 reports on policing performance during the Covid-19 pandemic.  This balance and emphasis on human rights is also reflected in the relevant statutes governing the right to protest and criminal damage, respectively the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 and the Criminal Damage Act 1991.  There are no plans to amend the Criminal Damage Act to incorporate a defence of protest.  <\/p> <p> As the Deputy will be aware, the enforcement of the law, including governing protest and criminal damage, is a strictly operational matter for the Garda Commissioner.

If everything has changed in the way the Minister has said it has, then that will stand up through an inquiry and be vindicated.<\/p>  <p>  It is important that we highlight this matter.  Apart from anything, how can we hold other countries to account for what they are doing and raise issues of this kind through the Council of Europe, for example, when we have this legacy hanging over our selves and this State?  Equally, in the North, we are talking about measures that must be enacted there in respect of how the Royal Ulster Constabulary, RUC, behaved when we have this matter hanging over us.

The crux of the problem here is that not only the Garda but the State, the Government and everybody else turned a blind eye to these activities and allowed them to continue.  Free rein was given to the Garda to allow that to happen.  If nothing else were to result, hopefully an investigation and inquiry would ensure that nothing like this happens again in future.  I say that because I believe the potential is still there for it to happen and that is the crux of the problem.  We must address this situation and ensure there is no potential in this regard.

The right to be forgotten affords individuals the ability to exercise control over their personal data.  They can decide the information about them that is accessible to the public through search engines.  While it gives people the right to seek the deletion of their data, what it does not do is guarantee this will happen.  The court established in the Google Spain case and subsequent cases that the right to be forgotten should not apply in cases of information that is relevant to the public interest, including previous convictions.  It is important to stress that there has to be a right for individuals to apply and, as set out clearly in the Google Spain case, it is not an absolute right.  In cases where there is a public interest element, including previous convictions, that request may be refused.  The court ruled that the companies processing the data must determine in each case whether it is in the public interest to retain the data.<\/p> <p> I want to be very clear in saying that the general data protection regulation, GDPR, does not give convicted sex offenders an automatic right to have their previous convictions deleted from search engines.  While it is not open to me, as Minister for Justice, to change the application or, indeed, interpretation of the GDPR rules, I understand the Deputy&rsquo;s concerns and I am determined, as in so much of the other work I do, to prevent serious criminals from hiding their pasts.  The Sex Offenders (Amendment) Bill, which, as the Deputy is aware, is progressing through the Oireachtas, will ensure that the system for monitoring sex offenders is robust.

As I said earlier, this is an increase of one third on funding provided in 2015.  It specifically includes provision for the recruitment of up to 800 garda&iacute; and 400 Garda staff this year.  Many of the 800 garda&iacute; to be recruited will be drawn from this competition.  I am pleased to note that there has already been great interest from the public, with 3,425 applications received last Thursday and Friday alone.  I anticipate those numbers will increase.  It is important to note that for the first time there has been a significant increase in the number of women, members of new Irish communities and people from minority groups who applied compared to the last competition and that is very welcome.

This has included changes to Garda uniform policy, as we saw recently, the establishment of the Garda national diversity forum, and representation from diverse and minority communities in the Garda Reserve.  In the coming months, the Commissioner will set out his plan for Garda Reserve recruitment for this year.<\/p><p>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is working to produce a combined internal and external equality, diversity and integration strategy early this year.

One of the issues about which most of us as public representatives receive representation from individual garda&iacute; is transfers.

It is reflected in the programme for Government, the Government&rsquo;s action plan for insurance reform, which the Deputy has just mentioned, my justice plan for 2021 and my justice plan for 2022, which I will publish shortly.  This is a whole-of-government effort.  I am pleased to say that, of the 66 actions contained in the action plan, 51 have been now completed.  Twenty-six were completed by my Department.  Data from the Personal Injuries Assessment Board indicate that award levels have reduced by around 40% since the introduction of the personal injuries guidelines last April, which I hope the Deputy will agree comprise a significant step in meeting our commitment to making insurance more affordable for consumers, businesses and community groups.  We have all seen a reduction in our car insurance premiums in the past year alone.  In addition to the bringing into operation of the guidelines, the enactment of the Criminal Justice (Perjury and Related Offences) Act 2021 last June has been a key element of work in my Department.  We have also examined changes to reduce insurance fraud, including penalties for insurance fraud, in consultation with relevant agencies.  The Insurance Fraud Coordination Office was opened by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in July.<\/p>  <p>  In accordance with the action plan, my Department has completed a review of the occupiers&rsquo; liability legislation, including the duty of care and notices and waivers.  Under that review, we considered relevant current legislation in Ireland and other common law jurisdictions, in addition to notable Irish case law.  Subsequently, my Department identified several options regarding occupiers&rsquo; liability, which the review has recommended pursuing.  I submitted these options to the Government last April.<\/p>  <p>  We are considering reform in two areas.  First, we are considering introducing provisions to ensure that ordinary common sense is brought to bear on personal injuries cases.  This usually leads to a dismissal or a reduction in the award granted.  We are essentially codifying what is already happening in many or some instances in our courts.  This is in line with recent superior court rulings. <\/p>  <p>  Second, and probably more significantly, we are considering the introduction of a provision to allow for the voluntary assumption of risk whereby those who willingly place themselves in circumstances they know might result in harm cannot bring a claim against the other party.  This is what many people are looking towards.  This recommendation was made previously by the Law Reform Commission. <\/p>  <p>  To set out the timeline, my Department is currently engaging with the Office of the Attorney General on proposed amendments to the Occupiers&rsquo; Liability Act.  My intention is that, on receiving advice, the proposals will be progressed and included in the civil liability Bill.  The intention behind that will be made known in the coming months. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021700018#Q01200","speaker":"1502"},{"type":"speech","time":1645097400,"counter":210,"content":"<p>Our economy and communities will be unable to bounce back sustainably from the pandemic unless all sectors and businesses of all sizes can resume activity in a stable and supportive environment.

The personal injuries guidelines adopted last year saw personal injuries awards fall by 50% within three months of taking effect, yet we all know that insurers are not passing on those types of savings to customers.  I urge the Government to support my Judicial Council (Amendment) Bill, which would monitor insurance companies and pressure them to pass on savings.<\/p>  <p>  Rebalancing the duty of care is crucial to bringing greater certainty and underwriting capacity in the insurance market.  Given that the Minister stated insurance reform is a key priority and that there is a whole-of-government approach, I was shocked that she has not only missed her own two self-imposed deadlines but has also not included the legislation to reform duty-of-care arrangements, by way of amending the Occupiers&rsquo; Liability Act, in the spring legislative programme.

We are engaging with the insurance companies in order that we can identify where fraud its taking place and that we can have a better and closer relationship to try and reduce those numbers over all.

She talked about bringing proposals to Cabinet in April, and she cannot still give us a date, a year later, of when the legislation is going to be produced.  The Minister has stated that she will not bring forward stand-alone legislation because it would take too long, although if Government had really gripped the issue, it would have been done and dusted by now.  I ask the Minister to at least publish the amendments in order that we can see whether the Government understands what is really required in the context of balancing the duty of care.

This includes funding for the recruitment of up to an additional 800 Garda members and up to 400 Garda staff.  It should be noted that many of the Garda members to be recruited will be drawn from the Garda recruitment competition which opened last week.  More than 800 Garda members have also been redeployed in recent years from administrative duties - working in offices but doing important work - to front-line policing duties where their expertise can be utilised fully.  The civilian Garda staff are taking over those roles.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, in accordance with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the management and administration of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which includes decisions on the deployment of personnel among the various Garda divisions.  I am assured by the Commissioner and his team that they keep the distribution of resources under continual review in the context of policing priorities and crime trends, to ensure their optimum use.

I have no doubt that when the 800 new recruits are deployed across the country, those changes in populations and demographics will be taken into account, as will issues that arise in certain areas.

The Bill has three purposes: first, to provide a legal basis for the deployment and use of body-worn cameras by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na; second, to provide for the extension of the circumstances in which CCTV may be authorised, taking account of the general data protection regulation, GDPR, and the law enforcement directive; and, third, to provide an updated legal basis for the deployment of automatic number plate recognition technology by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. <\/p>  <p>  My Department has engaged extensively with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Garda oversight bodies and strategic partners during the preparation of the general scheme, as well as the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner, the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission and the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, ICCL.  Following Government approval, the general scheme was sent to the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel for formal drafting.  That drafting is continuing at this stage.  The general scheme was also submitted to the Oireachtas Committee on Justice for pre-legislative scrutiny.   The report of the committee was received in December 2021 and is currently being examined by officials in my Department.<\/p>  <p>  This legislation is a significant priority for me and my Department, as I know it is for the Deputy.  I am working intensively with the Attorney General to ensure the Bill can be published by the end of March.  I hope that, when complete, it will pass through the Oireachtas as soon as possible.  I hope it can be enacted later this year. <\/p>  <p>  Although it is not an excessively long Bill, I am aware the issues that need to be addressed, such as privacy rights and data protection, are particularly complex.

Workers and families face a cost of living crisis.  Rising prices are reducing the living standard for low and middle income households and many families are being forced to make choices they simply should not be making.  Those choices include cutting the amount of food they buy, whether to turn on the heat or for some it is even both of those.<\/p>  <p>  Figures released by the Central Statistics Office today show that prices have increased by 5% in the last year and as I have repeatedly said to the Minister and other Ministers, inflation does not affect everybody equally.  Lower and middle income households spend more of their money heating and lighting their homes than those on the top do.  The measures the Government came forward with last week abjectly failed to meet the needs of those many families.  For example, the Government handed out the same level of support to millionaires as it did to low and middle income households through the electricity credit.  It will spend &euro;12 million to give financial support to over 60,000 holiday homes.  This makes no sense.  Sinn F&eacute;in proposed a package of measures that would have been more focused and that would have offered greater support to those in low and middle income households.  It would have done so through, for example, a direct cost of living cash payment, as has been done elsewhere.  However, the Government did not listen and it simply would not go there.<\/p>  <p>  Today&rsquo;s figures show that electricity has gone up by 22% in the past year.  The price of gas has gone up by 28% and, staggeringly, the price of home heating oil has gone up by over 50% in the past year and it is continuing to rise.  This is the method one third of the population uses to heat their homes and two thirds of the population in the Border region of Cavan, Monaghan, Donegal, Sligo, Leitrim and Louth use home heating oil to keep themselves warm at night.  Despite soaring energy prices, this Government is determined to increase those prices further with a hike in the carbon tax coming into effect on 1 May.  The Government needs to get a grip on this and come to planet Earth and to where people really are.  So many people are struggling, every euro counts and every single bit makes a difference.  Pushing ahead with the carbon tax is wrong, it lacks common sense and it should not go ahead.<\/p>  <p>  The measures announced by the Government last week were criticised, not just by Sinn F&eacute;in and the Opposition but by the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, the lone parent organisation One Family Ireland, Social Justice Ireland and many more.  More importantly, they were criticised by ordinary people who know what it feels like to have a Government that is ignoring them and does not get where they are at.  All of those comments were valid.  At the same time we have the bizarre comments of the Taoiseach warning that increasing the disposable income of struggling families risks making matters worse.  Could the Government be more out of touch?  The T&aacute;naiste is calling on the ESB to act in a way that many recognise will damage our economy and threaten jobs.  The Government needs to wake up, get real and understand what is happening out there to ordinary workers and families.  Will the Government cancel the planned hike in the carbon tax which is due in May and will it introduce targeted measures to support workers and families to deal with the cost of living increases?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021700021#T00400","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"speech","time":1645099200,"counter":239,"content":"<p>We are introducing targeted measures; that is exactly what we did last week.  A 20% reduction in public transport fares is targeted and real and will affect people every day.  It will be introduced at the end of April and that will make a real difference to people&rsquo;s everyday lives and their cost of living.  The Deputy is right that people are exposed to these high fossil fuel prices, which are due to international factors and it is a signal that we have to rid ourselves of our dependency on that.  An 80% grant to put in attic and wall insulation, which could be done quickly, is the best approach and the best targeting.  That cuts the average energy bill by about 25% and combats the price increases we are suffering because of international factors and that is real.  It improves health, homes and addresses the issue.<\/p>  <p>  I fundamentally disagree with the Deputy and with Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s position on this because the measures we are introducing are socially progressive.  There is no other tax like carbon tax in that the Department of Finance has guaranteed that we will give all of it back to the people and that it does not go into the Exchequer.  Some 30% of it goes to increasing social welfare provision, which brings about real and targeted improvements for those most in need.  This includes those on the living alone allowance, qualified child allowance and fuel allowance, which target the poorest.  In the last two budgets when we have done that the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, and others have done immediate and detailed analysis showing that it is progressive and that those on the poorer side of our society benefit most.  The other 55% is going to improve people&rsquo;s homes, while cutting emissions.  If the Deputy is asking what planet we are living on it is the one we want to protect, the one we want to stop burning and the one where we do not just talk about climate change but do something about it.<\/p>  <p>  No alternative funding is being presented for that sum of &euro;9 billion.  Where would we get the money?  Where would that &euro;9 billion we will get through this mechanism and give back to our people to protect them come from?  What other spending would be cut instead of that or would Sinn F&eacute;in stop providing the grants?  Would we not provide the 80% grant or the increase in the fuel allowance?  Those are the questions I have to put back to the Deputy.  This is not easy or particularly popular but it is the right thing to do for social justice as well as for environmental protection and I am convinced of that.  If there is an alternative I would love for the Deputy to come back and say Sinn F&eacute;in would raise the &euro;9 billion somewhere else.  That would be a good debate and then we could have a real analysis.<\/p>  <p>  To say that this is the source of the problem is incorrect.  The source of the problem is our reliance on fossil fuels and the damage they are doing to our immediate health as well as threatening the future of our children on this planet.  We have no choice but to respond to that by acting now in a quick way and with a just transition.  I am convinced by this approach, which has been analysed by academics for decades, which says this is the way to do it, to give the signal but protect people at the same time.  We will do it again next year - increase fuel allowance and increase the social welfare package and that will continue to be beneficial in helping those who need those supports most.  That is targeting and that is the right approach.  What is the alternative?  Where would the money come from?  It cannot be an easy answer that everything comes from general taxation.  That means we might have to cut spending in health, education or social welfare and I do not want to do that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021700021#T00500","speaker":"1465"},{"type":"speech","time":1645099200,"counter":240,"content":"<p>I agree with the Minister that the Government is targeting and its targets are ordinary workers and families and that is the problem.  The Minister may shake his head but I will say this.  Despite the fact that the cost of home heating oil has increased by over 50%, the Government&rsquo;s decision is to increase it further on 1 May.  Despite the fact that the cost of gas has gone up 28%, the Government will bump it up further on 1 May.  That makes no sense and that suggests to me that the Government does not get it.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister asks what the alternative is.  To abandon the increase in the carbon tax in May would cost &euro;32 million.  The Minister and his Cabinet colleagues in government signed off on a cut in the bankers' levy to the tune of &euro;63 million this year.  That is where the alternative funding would be but that requires being on the right side of workers and families instead of being on the side of the bankers.  The Minister can stand there and justify to me why the Government will take an additional &euro;32 million out of the pockets of these families, which are already crucified by high energy and home heating costs and at the same time give double that amount of cuts to banks in this State.  There are always options but the Government has to be on the right side and it has to get where people are at.

For many people this will be a welcome sign that we are leaving the pandemic behind us.  However, many unions representing workers in transport and retail, particularly Mandate Trade Union and the National Bus and Rail Union, NBRU, have concerns.  Ms Patricia King, general secretary of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, has called for the rules to be kept for a short period.  As the Minister knows, there will be a lot of anxiety for staff and people who are vulnerable.  This will impact especially on those considering using trains, buses and other forms of public transport.  Encouraging people back onto public transport is essential to meet our climate targets.  Emissions were up 11% at the end of September compared with 2020.  What advice does the Minister for Transport have for people concerned about mask rules on public transport being changed?<\/p>  <p>  As part of the budget, &euro;25 million was announced to cut fares in half for young people between 19 and 23 years old.  The Labour Party called for the fares to be free but, in fairness, the Government met us half way.  This will make a real difference for young people struggling with the cost of living and will encourage lifelong use of public transport.  However, when will it be a reality?  Was no work done in advance of the budget to get this in place or was it thrown in at the last minute?  All we are being told is that it will be mid-2022.  When exactly will it be put in place?  Has the Minister given a deadline to have this delivered?  My colleague, Deputy Nash, uncovered this week that there are no plans yet to provide this youth fare reduction on commercial buses.  The Budget Statement said quite clearly that this would apply across the transport network.  Many young people, especially in rural areas, will not have access to cheaper fares because they will not be available.  No timeline could be provided by the Minister to Deputy Nash as regards when this will be in place.<\/p>  <p>  With more people working remotely or part-time in the office after the pandemic, there is also still no flexi-taxsaver ticket in place to reflect the changed work practices.  When will that be delivered?  There is much talk about tackling the cost of living, but a concrete measure that would encourage more people to use public transport and reduce costs is delayed.  The Minister made a lot of announcements and I have outlined many of them.  However, we are getting very little about definitive dates for when the measures in respect of public transport will be implemented.  Again, a 20% reduction in fares was announced last week as part of the cost-of-living package.  However, we hear that it will not come into force until May.  If the Government is serious about encouraging more people to use public transport, these proposals would be a priority.<\/p>  <p>  What is the Minister's and the Government's position on mask wearing on public transport and in retail settings for workers who have concerns?

I look forward to seeing its advice.  My view, which I am happy to share, is that we should start immediately by removing the requirement for schoolchildren to wear masks in school.  It was introduced for good public health reasons, but there are also good reasons for them not having to wear masks, for the health of children in a wider context.  I hope that can be done straight away.<\/p>  <p>  I have the same view with regard to retail and public transport.  I believe we should go from a mandatory system towards a public health guidance to continue to wear masks.  It makes good public health sense.  I would advise anyone to continue with it for the immediate future because we still have Covid-19 at quite a scale.  However, the time for mandatory conditions is part of the unwinding.  I will listen and heed.  Obviously, we will take NPHET's views into account, but my view is that we should further the loosening of the restrictions in place.  I listen with respect to the teachers unions and the public transport and bus workers unions, but my view is that while I expect the vast majority of people will continue to wear masks for the immediate future, we should not continue it as a mandatory system.<\/p>  <p>  We want people back on public transport.  The numbers are back to about 60% of pre-Covid levels.  It varies across the country.  The long-distance commuting numbers are not back.  It will be no surprise to hear that.  Some of the regional cities' numbers are back.  Some of the new services in Louth and Navan and some of the other services are up way beyond what the expectations were.  The cost-of-living measure introduced last week of cutting public transport fares by 20% was not just for cost-of-living reasons, urgent as they are, it was also to try to give public transport a boost at this time, so we will not see the road space taken up by people going back to cars.  We want to encourage people back onto public transport.  It is safe and we want to get the numbers back up.<\/p>  <p>  I had a meeting last week with the chief executive officers of Dublin Bus, Bus &Eacute;ireann, Irish Rail and the National Transport Authority, NTA, to impress on them the need for us to be quick on this.  The end of April is the timeline I was hoping would see both the introduction of the new 50% reduction in youth travel fares and the 20% reduction in the public service obligation, PSO, public transport measures.  The CEOs say, and they are the experts in the area, that it typically takes six, eight or ten weeks to change all the ticketing machines and all the tariffs.  I told them we have to do it and that I want them to do it by the end of April.  They assured me they will do everything to deliver it in that timeframe.<\/p>  <p>  It is more difficult with the commercial operators because we do not set, monitor or regulate their fares in the same way.  That presents a significant difficulty in how we implement both the PSO and the youth travel card.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021700022#U00900","speaker":"1465"},{"type":"speech","time":1645099800,"counter":250,"content":"<p>I asked the Minister a number of questions.

I had to clean up a mess that lasted eight and a half years, under the last Government involving the Green Party and the previous Fianna F&aacute;il Government, in respect of the Leap card and finally introduce it.  There is always a lead time with changes in technology, and I understand that.  However, the Minister has given us various different dates and commitments regarding the four schemes I mentioned.<\/p>  <p>  As regards commercial services, I am one of the people who opposes this urban-rural divide.  The Minister has to deliver as much for commercial services and for providers who are operating in rural areas as in urban areas.  If he wants people to use public transport in rural areas, as he keeps saying, he will have to deliver for them on timelines as well.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, the Minister did not give a commitment on when the flexi-taxsaver travel ticket will be delivered.

I agree with the Deputy that the transformation of public transport has to be for the whole country.  We could introduce a new flexi-ticket within the urban Dublin area, for example, very quickly because we have the Leap card and the swipe-on, swipe-off on the Luas.  The difficulty is that we do not have that with the longer distance commuting services.  I have to listen to the reality that the officials meet, which is that they have a difficulty in adapting when they do not have that swipe-on, swipe-off facility in the rural train or bus stations.  Similarly, I believe rural public transport will be key.  The Connecting Ireland new rural public transport system will also be key.  However, I have to be honest with the Deputy.  We have to face the reality before us.  We do not regulate those non-PSO services.<\/p> <p>We do not monitor or manage those non-PSO services or have control as to how they manage cash or other ticket systems.  This presents real difficulties which we are looking to resolve.

I sought a commitment from the Minister that once a decision was made by An Bord Plean&aacute;la to go ahead with the project that top priority would be given to putting in place a scheme, without delay and regardless of subsequent legal or judicial challenge, to enter into negotiation with any householder affected by this who wished to sell and move on but was caught in limbo.  Not all householders want to sell.  Some are willing to wait until the process is complete.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister expressed sympathy for the plight of these people whose lives have been put on hold for the past seven years since the preferred route for the current ring road plan was published back in 2015.  Since then, the owners of 44 homes to be demolished and a further ten homes to be bought to facilitate the ring road project have been caught in limbo.  They cannot sell a house pencilled for demolition.  This meant neither could they move on with their lives and set up a new home elsewhere.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister promised that subject to a decision of approval he would encourage Galway County Council through its negotiation strategy to assist these householders who have been affected.  He said he understood that Galway County Council had already established and advanced the negotiation strategy for the road project . He stated all affected householders were invited to participate and he encouraged Galway County Council as I have outlined.  He also stated the Government would do everything it could in this regard to assist the householders who have been affected.<\/p>  <p>  The decision in favour of the Galway city ring road has been made by An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  While three High Court actions have been taken challenging the decision, we cannot leave these homeowners linger in limbo for years.  The most recent proposal would mean a total of 14 years.  They deserve to be allowed to try to move on with their lives.  The time for this is now.

He has been raising this issue privately and publicly consistently with me over the past two years.  He has raised a very valid concern for the 54 families in a very difficult position.  I absolutely understand and see the argument in the case he is making on their behalf.  This is a controversial project that has been long delayed like many other transport projects in the country.  It is particularly sensitive with regard to habitat issues and climate issues.  Three cases for judicial review have been taken.  I understand these are due to a variety of interests, including local property interests and the climate issue regarding the particular project.  It is not possible to take the course the Deputy suggests because the High Court has issued a stay against any such action by Galway City Council.  By order of the court, it is not possible to progress with what we would presume would be a compulsory purchase order system.  This is a High Court decision.  We are all subject to these.  It will have to work itself out.  The process has to be allowed to take its course.  In the interim, I encourage the local authority to engage with the householders so that subject to the issues being resolved they can act quickly.  It is not a significant sum.  For the householders, it is a hugely important issue.  Their engagement with the council may at least shorten the process, depending on what the final outcome will be.  We cannot ignore an order of the High Court.  It would not be appropriate or right.  We have to await the outcome of it.<\/p>  <p>  The project still has to go through a business case to be prepared and presented to the Government.  Our process for assessing projects is very long and drawn out.  We would all agree it is in need of reform and shortening.  The whole issue of planning concerns and consent needs to be reformed.  The Attorney General is doing this.  It is important we retain central to it protection for the environment and support the rights of those who want to do this and protection for the ability of people to develop and for the State to be able to act in introducing infrastructure.  We have to get the balance right.  Our current systems are not fit for purpose.  Our planning laws are not working well.  This is why the Attorney General is engaged in major reform.

Eight householders were caught in the previous project.  This has been going on for more than 22 years.  Is the Minister telling me these 54 householders have to sit and wait until a judicial review has taken place before they can sell a house?  Many of these people are moving on in years.  They want to downsize.  They want to leave a bit of money to their children or grandchildren.  They cannot sell the biggest asset they have.

Nobody in this House would like to be affected whereby they could not sell their properties on the open market because nobody would buy it due to a decision by the Department that it wants to put a ring road around Galway.

The Minister often told me about his green policies.  Fifteen years ago when development was being done around Dublin people driving lorries - they called them hackers - would get ten loads to the tips in Balally, Dunsink and other places.  Today these lorries go to Longford, Westmeath, Monaghan and various parts of the country because of the problems with tips.  Ironically enough, if we are stopped at traffic lights in Dublin and watch the shears taking down the buildings the rubble comprises concrete, mortar, gravel and cement.  Throughout the country, be it Galway, Dublin, Cork, Limerick, there is a lot of what we call \"muckaway\" being shifted.  In Dublin alone there are 3,000 to 4,000 loads per day.  One third of everything being taken out is concrete, stone and cement.  If this is brought to a tip it has to be buried with everything else.  The Minister is overlooking this.  This one third could be used on greenway roads or making roads.  I am well aware of mica and I understand the situation but there is not the same effect with tar.<\/p> <p>Consider farmers' roads, when they develop their farms around the country.  One third of this could be saved in the re-use and recyclable situation.  Article 28 is guidance on end-of-use waste, which is from the Minister's Department, but people are trying to get around the hoops at the moment, for example in trying to screen topsoil, whereby one makes topsoil available for green areas or for around houses.  They are trying to recycle this stone, but then someone will come in from the council and say \"If I catch you at that we will take your tip licence off you.\"  For God's sake, as the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, and especially as a Green Party Minister, will the Minister, Deputy Ryan, go into his Department and sign a regulation so that cement or concrete, which is basically sand and cement, or stone that has been used, can be recycled for certain projects?  I am not saying that it would be put under houses or used under factories, but there are plenty of uses that could be made by the person who is thinking of the environment.  Instead of a lorry going with it to Longford, Westmeath or Monaghan, this material could be reduced by one third.  Will the Minister do that?  It is a very simple question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021700023#V00800","speaker":"1508","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645101000,"counter":261,"content":"<p>Yes.  We intend to introduce a circular economy Bill, which will have a whole range of provisions to help to reduce the amount of materials we are dumping or seeing going to waste.  I fundamentally agree with Deputy Fitzmaurice.  When I was originally a city councillor in Dublin, I remember the shock of realising that one third of our landfill then was demolition waste.  It was often very good, expensive, and carbon-intensive products, which we need to reduce, reuse and recycle.  It is going to be at a scale beyond compare.<\/p>  <p>  The waste action plan has been introduced.  It includes 200 measures that are very practical, very deliverable and we are systematically delivering.  The Minister of State with responsibility in the area, Deputy Ossian Smyth, is delivering on this.  We are starting to see it happen in how we recycle more.  All soft plastics, for example, can now be put into the green bin.  Demolition waste is an area that often would not get the same attention because it not household waste.  I agree with exactly what Deputy Fitzmaurice is saying.  We need to switch so that the materials used in building are recycled, reused and reduced.<\/p>  <p>  I will give an example of the scale of the change that needs to be made.  I had a meeting with Dublin Port recently.  One measurement shows that some 97% of Ireland's roll-on roll-off port traffic comes in through Dublin Port.  It is huge.  So many of the goods we consume come in through that route.  Dublin Port has said that Ireland will go from 35 million tonnes up to 70 million tonnes of imports.  I asked myself what it was that we would be consuming twice the amount of?  How is it that in this inexorable world there is a 2% or 3% expected growth every year in the use of materials?  I said to them we need to review it and need to look again at the whole strategy of this ever-increasing growth in materials.  We need to dematerialise development.  In the building sector in particular we need to look at recycling and using materials, in a safe way and subject to proper environmental standards that saves us money, reduces the amount of waste, reduces the amount of imports and reduces the carbon.<\/p>  <p>  \"Yes\" is my answer to the Deputy.  Deputy Fitzmaurice is exactly right about the direction we need to take.  I look forward to working with my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth, and the Department, to introduce the sort of measures that Deputy Fitzmaurice has spoken about.<\/p>  <p>  It is not just about using the same materials.  In building construction we need to switch to wood.  I believe that laminated timber will allow us to replace a lot of the concrete and cement.  It is not just about reducing the use of existing materials.  It is also about changing the materials we use.  That would be another way we could change from this big consumption and never-ending use of resources to switching to better ways.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021700024#W00200","speaker":"1465"},{"type":"speech","time":1645101000,"counter":262,"content":"<p>With due respect to the Minister, the first thing we must do is knock the building before we could switch to the wood that he is on about.

I know one person who has taken the initiative of screening topsoil and screening stone out of the loads of muck that comes in.  It is fine if it is boulder clay because everyone will use it on the roadways that they are making, and it is perfect stuff.  One can put lime into it and it makes a perfect job of a roadway.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister talks about legislation and looking at this.  Why is there not a regulation, signed by the Minister immediately, to say that for farm roadways or for a greenway, for example, which there would be no problem with, concrete material or stone that is crushed and tested could be used, or that topsoil could be screened out of a load of muck that comes in?  Currently, it is all being dumped.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister speaks about legislation.  I welcome his answer and I am not saying that I do not welcome it, but getting legislation passed in here is like pulling teeth.

In 2018, we came very close to drought in Dublin.  There is undoubtedly a real issue with water supply in Dublin.  I was in Shannon and Ennis last week and I also have long held the view that we need better balanced regional development.  A lot of water use is industrial.  People do not see it or notice it, but it is huge.  If that is where the water is, would we not move industry there, rather than shipping everything somewhere else?  There is imbalance in this country.  I mentioned earlier that 97% of roll-on roll-off traffic comes in through Dublin Port and 95% of air passengers come through Dublin Airport.  Some 75% of new houses are in the greater Dublin area, that is, Dublin and surrounding counties from where people are commuting into Dublin.

In addition, the many parents who cannot afford a car will benefit most from a cut in the cost of public transport.  It is very expensive to pay for fares for adults and children, and that starts to hit home.  More fundamentally, what was done last week was an adjunct to last October's budget.  To go back to my earlier discussion with Deputy Doherty on the framing of the carbon tax, we deliberately designed measures to try to target lone parents, qualified children and the living alone allowance.  The fuel allowance is not the only payment that was included.  Using carbon tax to pay for some additional targeted measures in the social welfare Bill is one way to help those categories of people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021700025#X00400","speaker":"1465"},{"type":"speech","time":1645101600,"counter":275,"content":"<p>We are all aware of the controversy surrounding the decision of the National Women's Council of Ireland, NWCI, regarding its platform for the International Women's Day protest on 5 March.

Flexibility is required.  I will make a point that is central to this issue.  The primary reason for our high electricity prices is our dispersed population and grid connection.  If we ask any expert analyst why Irish electricity prices are high in comparison to other European countries, it is largely due the fact that we have a different model of development.

I appreciate the chance to outline some of the measures which Government announced last week.  I am glad our officials are here.  They are responsible for much of the good work that has been done, particularly in the last year or two, to get us into position to launch this national retrofit scheme.<\/p>  <p>  I will put it into wider context before going into some of the details of the various schemes.  This is central to the climate change challenge we face.  We have to stop the use of fossil fuels within three decades.  We have to stop burning oil, gas, coal and peat to warm our homes, to power our transport system and in our power generation system.  It is a huge challenge. <\/p>  <p>  There are precedents.  I was thinking about whether anything like this has been done and I am old enough to remember the early 1970s, when we switched to central heating.  It became all the rage and, over two or three decades, we went from the open fire to central heating systems.  It was an improvement and a better system.  Some 97% of Irish houses now have central heating systems.  We achieved that change and we need to make a similar leap in the next three decades.  We will be using many of those central heating systems, maybe slightly bigger and with different radiators but it is the same concept.  However, we will be using heat pumps rather than gas or oil boilers to heat our homes.  This new heat pump technology has a huge advantage in the innate efficiency gain within it, as it converts the temperature differential between the air outside and inside the house through heat exchange to heat radiators to provide water for the home.  That energy efficiency gain would be lost if the house was not also efficient at keeping the heat in.  That is why we are looking in this three-decade challenge to bring our entire housing stock to B+ standard, so houses are well insulated, the heat pumps work efficiently at low cost and we reduce emissions. <\/p>  <p>  This work was done cross-party.  It does not belong to any one party.  We all agreed this was a central objective in our climate plans going back a number of years.  We will do it in a systematic way.  We will do 500,000 houses this decade, 500,000 the next and 500,000 the one after that.  We will be using district heating as well as retrofitting schemes.  District heating will have a crucial role so it is not just these measures.  Between the two, we need to halve emissions this decade, going from 7 million tonnes in our domestic heating systems to 3.5 million.  That is what this plan and investment starts to do.  It involves 500,000 homes and 400,000 heat pumps.  It is about moving from shallow retrofit, which involves doing a bit of the job here and there, to deep retrofit, where the whole job is done.<\/p>  <p>  The benefits of that are not just in climate.  There will be huge benefits in the balance of payments for the country.  At moments like this when international fossil fuel prices are high, we will be protected because we will rely on our local electricity rather than imported fossil fuels to heat our homes.  Whatever happens on distant shores will have less consequence for us.  It will be of huge benefit in employment, as I think Patricia King of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions acknowledged.  I was at a conference that congress organised a number of years ago where it estimated that 27,000 workers or so would be needed.  Good, well-qualified, well-paid, union-type jobs are expected to deliver this all over the country, distributed in a way that will benefit rural as well as urban Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  It will have a huge health benefit.  One part of the national retrofit plan we are working on is analysis of a large number of homes to see the health benefits of living in a home that is well insulated in this way and is not burning fossil fuels, which create all sorts of air pollution problems globally with climate emissions, locally in terms of air quality standards and in the home.  The analysis is not complete yet but will be shortly.  It is showing huge health benefits.<\/p>  <p>  I have the good fortune that our house moved to this system a few years ago.  We were able to do it when we were doing up our house.  Living in a warm, well-insulated house that is heated without burning anything is an incredible quality of life benefit that is hard to describe until you know what it is like.  You come down in the morning without fear that the house might be cold.  It holds its heat.  There is none of the hassle.  I have not had to touch the heat pump for the last three years.  It has been working away the same way a fridge works.  It is similar technology.  Fridges do not break down and heat pumps, similarly, do not require huge maintenance or cleaning and do not involve the same problems one gets with boilers and, certainty, open fires, where there is all the scraping, cleaning and hauling things in and out.  This change will transform our country.<\/p>  <p>  I know people are sceptical.  I read Fintan O'Toole in one of the papers yesterday saying this could be the next mica scandal.  I do not believe it will be.  The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, has been at this for 22 years.  We have been learning as we have been doing how to get the building energy rating, BER, systems right, how to check that the quality of the work is good and how to register contractors.  I am confident that we have learned in those 22 years.  We are not arriving at this without experience or backup.  The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland has real skill and capability.<\/p>  <p>  This is one of the things for which I am proud of the Government.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, has been a supporter of this cause.  I went to him last year saying the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland would need an additional 50 staff and he agreed straight away.  They are in place now and another 50 will be employed this year.  That is not an easy thing in government.  Anyone with experience will know it is not easy to get agreement for staff in agencies or Departments.  It was the same story in our Department.  There was a huge increase in the staffing in this critical area of climate, energy and energy poverty alleviation.  To allay Fintan's concerns, we are learning as we are doing, we have good people and this has been thought through at length.  It is not a heat of the moment response to the energy price crisis but something that has been worked on for ages.<\/p>  <p>  I did not hear it so I have to be careful but I think Tom Parlon from the Construction Industry Federation was on the radio asking if the Irish people would buy into this and suggesting the construction industry may not be interested in it.  On both points, we may prove him wrong.  The public response since our announcement last week has been beyond compare.  There was something like a 13-fold increase in the number of emails we were getting.  The SEAI website crashed when we announced this, such was the unprecedented volume of public interest.  This is improving people's homes.  There is nothing closer to their hearts than that.<\/p> <p>The public will buy in, particularly when the grants we are introducing overcome one of the big obstacles in this regard, namely, making the maths work in order to enable this to happen.<\/p> <p> Similarly, Mr. Parlon was concerned that the industry might not be interested in this change over.  I do not agree.  We have seen a similarly positive response in this regard.  What we got wrong in the past 20 years was that the initiatives undertaken were all stop-start in nature.  Grant allocations were provided in February, contractors worked through the summer and then downed tools and waited to see what money they might get the following spring.  That is no way to build up and develop a good contracting business, so those involved rightly stayed small.  Now, however, they know that the funding is available year-round and that it is guaranteed for the next ten years.  It is guaranteed because we know that &euro;5 billion is going to be made available for these grants to help make this happen.  It is stitched into law as a revenue stream, and the contractors know the Government is serious about this undertaking now and that the funding will not be stop-start.<\/p> <p> Equally, people raise concerns regarding whether the workers will turn up.  The Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, came to me yesterday and stated that there was concern about this but that his experience is that there has been a major take-up.  Not only was there an increase in calls on the consumer side when this scheme was announced, but the same was the case regarding the apprenticeship programmes the Minister is setting up throughout the country.  Young people and old are seeking to retrain and upskill in order to be good at retrofitting.  A PhD is not required.  It is not a seven-year process.  Grants, such as the 80% scheme for attic and wall insulation that we are introducing, will allow people to start learning the basic skills required for this type of work.  Their abilities can evolve from there.  Once they have mastered the basics, people can move on to learning the skills required to work on exterior insulation, heat pumps and the other technologies that are part of this scheme.  I am confident, therefore, that we can and will deliver the ambition of retrofitting 500,000 homes and improve them to the extent where they will be fundamentally transformed and made fit for purpose and healthy.  Equally, the upgraded homes will be more efficient to run and protected against fuel poverty through this investment.<\/p> <p> I will go through some of the details and then let Deputy Leddin contribute.  I start with the key elements of what is new.  The first aspect is the national home energy upgrade scheme, which involves moving to a building energy rating, BER, of B2, or above, which is a higher standard.  It applies to any house constructed before 2011.  Any house built since then should and will be at or above these standards already.  There are several elements to this initiative.  The first aspect is increasing the grants.  The average grant levels were 30% to 35%.  To get this scheme kick-started, it was decided to go up to 45% to 50%.  It will vary.  The grants are set at a certain level for particular technologies.  For example, there will be a set grant for a heat pump, and for each element of the scheme.  The benefit of this approach is that if people decide not to do a full retrofit, they will get the same grant for the element of the job they do undertake.  Equally, if people are part of a community energy scheme, which is a concept that is really taking off and people are coming together on it, they will all know the collective grant amount.  Even though there will be different situations in each house, they will be able to work out what the supporting benefit will be.  This aspect then is concerned with increasing the grants to make the maths and economics work.<\/p> <p> The next facet is the establishment of one-stop shops.  Much work, time and thought has gone into this initiative.  We expect about 21 such one-stop shops to start up in the weeks to come.  Operators will bring together a range of services to make it easier for households to do this work.  The one-stop shop, especially in the context of a deep retrofit, is the best way of getting the process right.  It is a complex venture.  None of us here know much about whether a heat pump is the right one or the right size or has the right energy performance.  These one-stop shops will give householders the ability to undertake retrofit projects in a way that is regulated, checked and performed properly.<\/p> <p> Turning to the warmer homes scheme, it has been operating very efficiently and effectively in the context of those houses at risk of fuel poverty and receiving fuel allowance payments.  It is important that we have a social policy dimension to this and that we are targeting those at risk of fuel poverty the most.  In total, we have &euro;267 million from our budget this year.  That will increase next year and every year, given the revenue becomes available from the carbon tax, and &euro;85 million from the budget of the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage that will be targeting social housing.  Between the two, approximately 58% of the overall budget, some &euro;203 million, is going to be spent on grants for 100% of the cost to address the issue of fuel poverty.  That is in addition to the range of other measures that we must undertake.  The warmer homes scheme is greatly popular because of the 100% grant.  Who would not want to avail of it?<\/p> <p> We have built up a backlog.  In the region of 7,000 households that have committed to and signed up to the scheme are waiting.  We are going to clear list that in the next 18 months to two years.  The backlog built up because of the impact of Covid-19 because it was not possible to go into people's homes.  The registrations were coming in, but it was not possible to get out to do the work.  We will clear that backlog, however.  We will go from completing 177 houses a month up to approximately 400 a month and clear it that way.  We will then focus on those houses built before 1993.  The building standards went up in 1991, and from then onwards we would expect most houses to be at the standard of BER D or above.  We want to get to those houses with ratings of E, F and G, which are typically older houses.  That is where the issues of fuel poverty and health impacts are at their worst, and we really want to get in and do those.  As a result, we will be targeting that area.  We will also be widening the conditions for eligibility.  The disability allowance is now being allowed as a qualifying category for the scheme and that will allow us to target such households.  As well as broadening the areas eligible, we are also increasing the funding.  The warmer homes scheme has an allocation of &euro;108 million this year to allow us to clear the backlog.  As I said, that figure will increase again next year.  It will keep going at a steady volume so that the people carrying out the work will know that this business is going to keep growing.<\/p> <p> There are other elements to this initiative.  One key aspect is a response to the situation where we find ourselves with very high gas and oil prices.  This is an 80% grant.  It is targeted at those houses that might not have the funding to do the big retrofit, but that might be suffering from particularly high bills.  I refer to projects such as deep insulation of the attic, as well as work on the cavity walls of a house, where gaps in the walls are injected with insulation and filled in.  It is a relatively straightforward, quick and not that expensive job.  It will vary from house to house, but it might cost &euro;3,000 or so between both upgrades.  The energy experts tell us that the benefits reaped are a quick reduction in energy needs.  It could be up to 25%, and that would counterbalance the increase in prices that we have seen over the last year.  We do not expect these prices to run into next year, but even if they did, this project will allow people to cover the costs of this type of project and give them some protection.  It would be an initial step in the direction towards better homes and the other schemes available.<\/p> <p> Other measures are coming and happening.  The community energy grant scheme is the key one.  I was out in an estate in Clondalkin where about 40 houses came together.  When this type of project is undertaken collectively, it works really well.  It is possible to get the costs down, to swap notes and to access expertise.  That street in Clondalkin was able to retrofit the local community centre at the same time as they did their houses.  They were doing the community buildings as well as the homes.  Being able to place an order for 40 heat pumps rather than one makes it possible to start achieving real efficiencies and cost savings.  Most of our houses and estates, and even houses in country areas, were built to common designs.  That means it is possible to use aggregation, to bring everyone together and to get all the retrofitting done at the same time.  People can learn from each other how the process works and what the benefits are.  In that context, this community energy grant scheme is critical.<\/p> <p> The other key innovation which is coming, and it will be happening in the third quarter of this year, is a new loans scheme.  It will be particularly applicable for households opting for deep retrofitting and where they are providing some of the funding.  Typically, it is half the funding.  The thinking behind this came from the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland.  It has been applied already in the context of Brexit, particularly for small businesses and farmers as a way of taking the risk out of a loan.<\/p> <p>The concept is simple enough.  They provide a certain capital.  In this instance the capital will come from the European Investment Bank, EIB, and the European recovery and resilience fund.  We targeted this as one of the uses of that European funding.  We will create a mechanism whereby the risk of default will be covered for, let us say, the first quarter of the loans.  That lending will be provided by that EU fund.  The remaining loan may be provided by a variety of different lenders, such as An Post, credit unions or banks.<\/p> <p> The beneficial and attractive aspect of this is that when a loan like that is de-risked, when the risk of default is removed, the interest rate is lowered.  Typical interest rates are 6.5%, but how about if we could bring that rate down to 3.5% because this is such a large capital job and the payback timeframe will probably be 10, 15, 20 years?  A low interest rate has a significant transformative effect in making the maths work, as I said earlier.  That lending facility will be in place later this year.  As it works, we could scale it up as well as use it in other applications.  It is quite groundbreaking and it has taken time to set it up.  The EIB has, as far as I understand having spoken to it, never been involved in a scheme in which it is involved with a householder.  With European systems and funding, there are all sorts of checks required.  We have to make sure it is spot on in terms of regulation and to ensure all the systems are in place.  That is why it has taken us a few months to get it up and running, but we will get it up and running.  It is critical due to the scale of this transition.  In the national development plan, we allocated a total of &euro;8 billion towards this.  It is only a fraction of the amount of money we will have to spend.  It is not just our housing.  We have to retrofit our public buildings, our schools, Garda stations, nursing homes, and commercial buildings.  There is a huge project in this.  Starting with and getting it right in our homes is key.<\/p> <p> I will say one final thing  I have taken up pretty much all the time allocated.  I will leave Deputy Leddin enough time for his contribution.  The most important part in getting this right is the public response.  Years ago, I had the great fortune to meet a brilliant Danish parliamentarian through EUFORES, the European parliamentarians for renewable energy and energy efficiency organisation.  If Members wish to join EUFORES, it is still in existence.  My colleague Ciar&aacute;n Cuffe MEP is chair of the organisation.  I had the good fortune to meet the Danish parliamentarian in the early 2000s when she was working on policy in this area.  They were probably the leading thinkers in this area.  She made a simple point.  She said that this subject is very difficult because, by definition, it cannot be seen.  If you invest in building insulation, you do not want it to be seen.  This new exterior insulation, which works well, gives the effect that it is a new building.  It creates a deeper alcove for the windows and it looks very clean.  One would not know it was there.  How do we get the political will and the public instinct on board, because it is not easy to take this leap by investing in this?  Once insulated, we can forget about it.  It is in the home forever and a day.  It is, therefore, a better home.<\/p> <p> We need to win over the public who believe it is a hassle or who say that they do not have the money or that borrowing is risky.  It is about getting across that public initiative.  I am of the view that we cracked it in the past week.  I have never received as great a response from past initiatives we have done, as this initiative.  People are realising that at a time when they are exposed to fossil fuel prices, this is the right thing to do.  At a time when we want to be a part of tackling climate change, this is the home front and the front on which we can win.  At a time when it is difficult for many people to get a home, a critical and significant crisis, could we not retrofit some of our older vacant buildings that are not being used and in doing so bring them back to life?  Part of the town centres first plan is the restoration of old buildings that are underutilised.  We can do both at the same time.  For so many reasons, this is the key, brilliant project that we can all own.  It belongs to every party.  We need to get our constituents, and others, to fill in the form, go to the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland's website, look at and pick whichever options are right for them and make it happen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021700028#EE00200","speaker":"1465","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645104600,"counter":334,"content":"<p>I want to address the reasons as to why this retrofitting programme is so important.  Why do we want to do this?  There are many reasons.  We want Irish people to live in warmer, healthier and more comfortable homes.  In the context of health, asthma symptoms are reduced in warmer homes.  Mould conditions increase the severity of asthma and retrofitting, particularly the ventilation aspect, reduces the conditions for mould to grow.  Retrofitting results in less outdoor pollution and, therefore, fewer hospitalisations caused by strokes and heart attacks.  The WHO says that improving indoor air temperature decreases mortality rates.  More than &euro;109 million of the Department's &euro;267 million budget this year, is allocated to the warmer home scheme, which provides free energy upgrades to people who are in receipt of a social welfare payment, such as the fuel allowance, carers allowance, or working family payment.  Some &euro;84 million is dedicated to retrofitting 2,400 social housing homes this year, 50% grants are available for deep retrofits and 80% of the costs can be recovered on individual energy upgrades such as attic and cavity wall insulation, as the Minister said.<\/p>  <p>  Another primary reason we should undertake this ambitious plan is because we want to reduce our dependence on imported energy.  At present, 88% of our energy is imported and much of this is used to heat our homes.  Reliance on imported energy leaves Irish people vulnerable to the vagaries of international energy markets, to geopolitical events over which we have no control.  We are seeing that happen now on the other side of the European continent in the Ukrainian crisis.  This escalation of military activity is driving the cost of natural gas to levels never seen before, and Irish people are paying these costs when heating their homes.  We need to protect Irish people from this price volatility, not just this year with the &euro;200 payment relating to electricity costs and the increased fuel allowance but we want to reduce the costs forever and for everyone, including the elderly, families, homeowners, and people in rented accommodation.<\/p>  <p>  We must do this for critical environmental reasons.  The planet is burning.  Global temperatures are rising to levels never seen before and this will continue.  Climate change is happening right now and it is causing catastrophic impacts throughout our world.  It is set to get worse.  It is set to threaten all life on this planet in the coming decades, within the lifetimes of our children and grandchildren.  Climate change is caused by the burning of fossil fuels, such as natural gas and oil, to heat our homes and our buildings.  The by-product of burning these fuels is the release of vast amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and trapping heat within it, thus causing the planet to heat up.  In Ireland, about 7.5 million tonnes of carbon dioxide are released every year in this way.  We must reduce that amount by half within this decade and bring it to nought by 2050.<\/p>  <p>  Retrofitting is fundamentally about reducing and removing, in as far as possible, the need for energy to heat our homes.  Homes that are built now are required to be built to the near zero energy building, NZEB, standard.  Many new homes have gone further than this and have been built to the passive house standard.  These standards for new homes are not enough to achieve what we need to achieve.  We have to look at the existing housing stock and address energy dependence within it.  That is what retrofitting is about.  By reducing imported fossil fuel energy, we will take real and substantial action on climate, improve people's lives, reduce costs to our people and our country and we will protect ourselves from external shocks.  It is a win-win-win situation.<\/p>  <p>  There are 1.2 million homes in the State that need to be retrofitted.  This plan will kick-start that enormous task.  We will retrofit 500,000 homes this decade to B2 standard or higher.  When a home is retrofitted, in most cases there will still be a requirement for energy, although the need will be greatly reduced.  This residual energy demand in homes will be provided by renewable electricity, some of it through microgeneration such as solar panels on the roofs of homes, but most of it through our national grid as Ireland harnesses its vast renewable energy resources.<\/p> <p>Home heating in new and existing homes will be electric, renewable and clean.  The immense retrofitting challenge brings immense opportunity.  We will need about 17,000 workers in this sector.  Young people leaving school should think seriously about this path.  We will need engineers, tradespeople and other construction workers.  Those already in the workforce contemplating a change in career should consider this new, rapidly evolving sector.  There is opportunity everywhere.<\/p> <p> Retrofitting is about addressing the demand side of energy; the other side of the coin is the supply side.  To fully address the challenge of climate change we should be and are looking at both.  There are vast opportunities on both sides.  Everybody in this House should understand that and the message should go across society.  Ireland has shown itself to be a world leader in renewable electricity development.  We will be world leaders in all aspects of energy, including retrofitting.  This is an exciting plan which points Ireland to a cleaner and better future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021700030#GG00200","speaker":"1594","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645105200,"counter":336,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the recently launched national retrofit plan.  The plan restates the 2019 Climate Action Plan target of 500,000 deep retrofits and 400,000 heat pumps by 2030.  It directs a majority of State supports to those with private means.  Delivery since 2019 has been miserably slow.  The Government's new, redesigned programme recognises something we have been saying for years, that the deep retrofitting scheme is way out of the financial reach of most individuals and families.  The Government refused to accept or acknowledge this, but the figures do not lie.  A parliamentary reply I received last month showed that just ten private deep retrofits were completed last year, not 10,000 or 50,000 as is needed each year.<\/p>  <p>  Now, the Government has recognised that its original plan was failing and has sought to change course.  While some of these new changes are welcome, others are not.  I welcome the fact the SEAI&rsquo;s \"no second visit\" rule has been removed.  That was an unnecessary barrier that prevented many households making incremental improvements to their homes, as their financial means allowed.  I also welcome the attic and cavity wall insulation programme.  This is something we had raised, albeit in a slightly different way, by saying people should be supported carrying out lesser works such as replacing windows and doors, as we recognised most people cannot afford major works.<\/p>  <p>  While these two aspects are welcome, the national retrofit plan as announced has significant and major flaws.  The programme, as designed, will not direct sufficient resources and support to those most in need.  Instead it disproportionately advantages those with means, with cash at hand or with the ability to pay back a medium-term loan.  This is a massive transfer of wealth.  Working families who earn too much for the warmer homes scheme but do not earn enough to afford major improvements will have the choice of taking on considerable levels of debt or continuing to live in a cold house.  The plan is silent on renters, both on improving the energy efficiency of their homes to try to reduce their bills, and on the protections needed to ensure they are not evicted by unscrupulous landlords using retrofitting as a cover.  It fails to address how the huge backlog on the warmer homes scheme will be tackled with appropriate haste.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of the transfer of wealth, it is very clear that this plan significantly benefits those with means and prioritises ability to pay over need.  Those who have the means can now get &euro;50,000 worth of work done to their home and only have to pay half of that, with the taxpayer coughing up &euro;25,000.  Is it equitable that the taxpayer should be funding the retrofitting of a millionaire&rsquo;s home, for example?  I do not think so.  Taxpayer-funded grants should be targeted to provide financial assistance to those who really need help paying for energy upgrades.  There is no income cap or sliding scale, and for what return?  What reduction in emissions?  With the one-stop shop scheme we have a very likely scenario that much of our better housing stock will be retrofitted first.  Retrofitting will not take place in order of need, BER or income.  An income cap and a sliding scale of grants would have been more appropriate.  They would target financial support at those who need it.  A parliamentary reply I received yesterday stated that \"imposing new additional income limits and means testing were not considered as part of the design of the new upgrade scheme.\"  They were not even considered.  The Minister might clarify if and why this was the case.<\/p>  <p>  For most working families who do not have &euro;10,000, &euro;20,000 or &euro;25,000 available to them to carry out a deep retrofit under the 50% scheme, they have three choices.  They can take on considerable debt via the new loan scheme, although many are simply not in a position to do this.  They can tip-toe along on the up to 80% scheme but this is limited.  We will have a scenario where Mary and Tom living in number 25, working hard on a low income and can only get shallow work done on their BER G rated house.  Around the corner in number 30 M&aacute;ire and Tom&aacute;s, working hard on a middle or high income, have a BER C rating and a warmer home, and they can afford to get a deep retrofit.  The third option is to continue living in cold, damp houses.<\/p>  <p>  The level of funding for the plan is welcome.  It does not match Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s commitment but with it, the Government had options.  If it had opted for a sliding scale of grants, less money would be granted to those who do not need the same financial help, freeing up additional resources that could be allocated for working families on lower incomes.  In a time of rising energy costs, it is a major disappointment that this plan is so weak in this regard.  It does not sufficiently direct the resource to areas of most need.  It fails those on lower incomes.  It fails the equity test.  There is no other way to say it.  Social Justice Ireland agrees with me in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  It fails renters, too.  Some 25% of the population are renting.  Most are paying high rents, often for substandard accommodation.  I was very disappointed but not surprised to see they were forgotten about entirely.  Many tenants are living in poor quality homes and apartments.  Despite charging exorbitant rents, many landlords will not invest in energy efficiency, leaving tenants with massive heating bills each month.  They talk about the so-called split incentive; the landlord does not pay the ESB bill and does not get the benefit of retrofitting, so why would he or she retrofit?  The split incentive is a red-herring, a misnomer.  Government has the means to push or entice landlords to retrofit.  It can introduce mandatory standards, for example, but it will not and will only hint that something might be done after 2025, when Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Green Party may be out of government. <\/p>  <p>  In respect of those landlords who want to use retrofitting or home improvement works as a means to change tenants, there is no additional protection for renters from eviction.  When I look at the scheme presented by the Government, I predict most renters will go on living in cold homes while others face the prospect of their landlord using retrofitting as an excuse to evict them.  The national retrofit plan can be added to long list of ways this Government has failed renters.   The new plan also seeks to continue the warmer homes scheme, now the free energy upgrade scheme.  This scheme provides full retrofits for those on the lowest incomes and elderly homeowners.  The eligibility criteria have been slightly expanded to those on disability allowance.  However, the scheme is being massively restricted on the other hand from pre-2006 builds to pre-1993 builds.  This is a massive restriction.  It has not received much attention but it surely will when people go to apply for these supports.  In addition, there is an incredible 26-month average waiting time from application date to works completed.  That is the average; it is far longer in many areas.  There are over 7,000 on the list.  The Government says it will complete in the region of 5,000 this year.  That is a big commitment far beyond anything that has ever been achieved, but it still leaves 2,000 waiting as well as anyone who applies this year.  I hope many will apply but perhaps the 1993 restriction will put paid to that prospect.<\/p>  <p>  How the Government intends to address these backlogs and long waiting times is not at all clear.  We do not have enough tradesmen and women and we have even fewer who are suitably trained.  There is the real prospect that the expansion of other schemes such as the one-stop shop scheme will only increase competition for contractors and could result in these waits getting even longer.<\/p>  <p>  Those who are eligible for the warmer homes or free energy upgrade scheme are the most vulnerable to energy poverty.  These are people on the lowest incomes, elderly people living in cold homes, people on social welfare payments who have to choose between food and fuel.  These people should have been prioritised, but it seems they could actually fall down the queue due to the structure of this plan. <\/p>  <p>  The national retrofit plan aims to invest &euro;8 billion of taxpayer&rsquo;s money.  For a plan with such a massive budget, the Government has provided very little background information for critical analysis.  There are very serious questions that need to be answered.<\/p> <p>Are we getting bang for our buck?  What emissions reductions will we achieve?  Are we targeting State resources in the best way?<\/p> <p> Important information examining the assessment of this policy and other climate policies is not being published or shared with Members.  For example, in 2021 the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications spent &euro;924,525 of public money on reports, economic analysis and modelling from McKinsey.  I believe McKinsey is driving Government thinking on climate policy - even more so than the Climate Change Advisory Council - but, unlike the council, its proposals are hidden.  I believe that to be the case for climate action plans for both 2019 and 2021.  We have asked to see the content of those reports but the Government is refusing to share it with us.  There is a host of unanswered questions in this area.  It is simply not good enough. <\/p> <p> We need a national retrofitting programme.  We need it to improve the fabric of people&rsquo;s homes and the quality of their health and lives and to reduce their dependency on fossil fuels for heat.  The scale of the Government&rsquo;s ambition is significant, even if it does not match Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s.  We differ - it is a significant difference - on how we fund it and how the programme is targeted.   The Government&rsquo;s programme fails the equity test in its funding and design.  It will fail the equity test in its delivery.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021700031#HH00200","speaker":"1507","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645105800,"counter":338,"content":"<p>The Government&rsquo;s track record on retrofitting has left Irish homes behind when it comes to energy efficiency.

Three years on, we are still looking at the same press releases with the same numbers.<\/p>  <p>  The scheme falls well short of what is required.  Sinn F&eacute;in has been raising the cost-of-living crisis for months, and the Government had to be dragged kicking and screaming to admit, in the past couple of weeks, that there is an issue.  Then the Government announced a scheme whereby one needs to have to up to &euro;25,000 lying around or take on more debt.  On the one hand, the Government is saying it understands people are struggling to make ends meet and heat their homes, but on the other it is asking people to fork out thousands.

Commitments were made years ago to insulate the flats at Glover Court but that never happened.  As Members know, flats such as those at Glover Court and Rathmines Avenue, in addition to those in the vast majority of Dublin City Council flat complexes, are in desperate need of regeneration.  After years of neglect, it is vital that residents living in public housing have a decent home to live in.  Residents living in council-owned flats have been neglected for long enough.  They have effectively been abandoned by the State.  Residents in council-owned houses and flats have long dreamt of having their homes insulated to a modern standard.  With the new scheme, they have been left behind once again.  I have not heard any of the previous contributors mention flat complexes.  The tenants are sceptical, which is understandable.  The council&rsquo;s long track record speaks for itself: it will not spend money to get rid of the rats and infestation and clean up the bin areas, nor will it spend money to remedy the dampness, water and sewage leaks, and broken windows and doors.  Bin storage areas in flat complexes are mostly unacceptable and only encourage the gathering of rats and seagulls.  To residents, having their homes insulated by the same landlord that has neglected them for years seems like a distant aspiration.  The council has plans for insulation but it also had plans to fix the defects and dampness, but this never happened.  Therefore, it is easy to understand why residents in flat complexes would be cynical and sceptical.<\/p>  <p>  Having a well-insulated, warm, dry home seems like a faraway dream when there is overcrowding to the extent that it is impossible to keep dampness and condensation away.  It is all very well discussing insulation when there are three or four children sharing a tiny boxroom and the mother or father is on the couch.  Insulation is welcome if it happens.  I have not heard a real commitment that flat complexes will be insulated properly, funded and prioritised.  They have been abandoned and neglected for long enough.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021700032#JJ00300","speaker":"1555"},{"type":"speech","time":1645105800,"counter":340,"content":"<p>Like many urban constituencies, particularly in Dublin, mine, Dublin North-West, has a mixture of modern and newly built housing in addition to old stock built decades ago.  Areas such as Ballymun, Santry, Whitehall, Glasnevin and Finglas have seen a huge growth in population and corresponding growth in the number of housing estates.  A substantial number of these estates were built in the period up to the 1970s and 1980s, having started in the 1950s.  This was a time of great expansion in these areas.  Houses of this period, which in most cases were structurally sound, are difficult to heat.  Their primary heat source was a fire in the living room, which often had a back boiler linked to radiators around the house.  In the past, they did not even have that; they just had fires.  While this was the traditional way to heat a house, it was, and is, inefficient.  These days, new housing estates are generally built to a high energy standard.  It is for houses that were built decades ago that retrofitting is essential and does a lot to improve energy efficiency.  In their current state, they do not retain heat.  Excessive heat loss in a home is inefficient and costly to the residents.<\/p>  <p>  The longer a house can hold heat, the less fuel that is needed to keep it warm.  Therefore, there is an urgent need for old housing stock to be brought up to a satisfactory building energy rating of at least B2.  The old houses will require a deep retrofit to bring them up to an acceptable energy standard.  Many of the residents of the houses have raised families in them and are now senior citizens.  They are also the people who are most in need of upgrading their houses to make them more energy-efficient.  They cannot afford what it costs to deeply retrofit an old house.  That is why a national retrofit plan is so important.  However, to be successful it needs to target those most in need.  While I welcome the national retrofit plan, I regard it not as a solution to our current energy-rating problems but as another step in the process of bringing our old housing stock up to an appropriate energy rating.  Unfortunately, the national retrofit plan is constructed in such a way that it does not go far enough to include those who are most in need of a deep retrofit of their homes but who can least afford it.<\/p> <p>It does not go far enough to include those who are most in need of a deep retrofit on their homes and who can least afford it.  Dublin City Council's retrofit programme for its tenants is working very well.  It is magnificent.  I have seen the results of it in Finglas south and across the constituency, but it needs to be accelerated.  It is quite clear that the council does not have enough money.  That is something that needs to be urgently addressed with the local authorities.  The SEAI has stated that new forms are coming out.  They must be made available as quickly as possible.  For people who were applying for a second fit, the time will not be taken into account to look at those.  That is unfortunate because over many years a lot of people had applied to get other works done.  Some got an attic done or otherwise.  The second fit will be done and instructions have been given, because the Minister told me this the other day, but I worry that they will not be dealt with quick enough.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021700032#JJ00400","speaker":"1470","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645106400,"counter":342,"content":"<p>I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on the national retrofitting scheme and to very much welcome it.  I think there is a broad welcome for the scheme.  It is undoubtedly a win-win to see a national retrofitting programme.  Many of us on the Opposition benches had indeed been looking for this to be rolled out for some time, so it is most welcome.  I thank the Minister and his officials for the briefing last week with Opposition spokespersons, which I certainly found very useful.  Clearly, there are enormous benefits and opportunities in a national retrofitting scheme.  There are environmental benefits, without a doubt, and also social and economic benefits.  I was struck by something the Minister said about the scheme on retrofitting which was that perhaps the biggest benefit is that of public health and the health of individuals and families.  That is a crucial point, too.  In the context of the dual crises of climate change and the cost of living, clearly, retrofitting can offer a long-term opportunity to ensure that both can be tackled and that we will see environmental benefits and economic and financial benefits for those who are experiencing real fuel and energy poverty.  Indeed, I know all Members will have received harrowing emails and contacts from constituents across the country who are experiencing that real fuel poverty.  Energy efficiency and measures to increase energy efficiency are clearly very important to address the root causes of energy poverty.  Therefore, I very much welcome it.<\/p>  <p>  However, I must say that having just come back from canvassing around Sandymount and Irishtown, I have heard the local residents express intense frustration about the cost of living and, in particular, the cost of home rental and home ownership, the lack of any homes to rent or own in the local area, and a scepticism about Government capacity to deliver real change on that big cost of living issue and, in particular, on delivering on homes.  I mention that because I think it is at the core of this debate about retrofitting.  What I am hearing from many is a concern, if not a scepticism, about whether this will make that real difference in tackling both cost of living and climate change for many households.  For the Labour Party, there is a real concern about inequality and a lack of targeted funding.  It is clear, from my reading of it, that households that can afford a deep retrofit and have savings of &euro;25,000 or that can pay for 50% of the cost will reap greater benefits than households that can only afford the more minor works and do not have that upfront money.  I am aware that the Minister has stated that there will be a financing package.  Indeed, it sounds really positive.  We have heard that it will be available this year, and that in the meantime there is an anticipation that households that have accumulated savings during Covid, and some have, undoubtedly, will be able to commence work on the retrofit.  However, there is a difficulty in that those households that may have accumulated savings may need a greater incentive to spend that money upfront.  I was interested to hear at the briefing that research shows that people need to see at least a 50% subsidy or injection of funds from Government in order to incentivise retrofit.  I think it is more than that.  People also need to know, for example, that they are going to be living in a house long enough to be able to gain the benefit of the savings on fuel bills over a period of time.  That may simply not be the case for many households.  It is not just that financial incentive; I think we also need to look at how we incentivise people to take the step to engage in the sort of deep retrofit that this plan wants to encourage.  There may be more radical ways to do it.  Providing upfront grants of two thirds of the cost, combined with low-cost loans, might offer a more attractive solution to many households.  We need to be very creative about how we look at incentivising households and families to take this step.<\/p>  <p>  The lack of targeting is also a problem.  We need to better support households that do not have savings and those that, even once the financing scheme comes in later this year, simply cannot afford to borrow.  We know the gap in an energy bill for a house with a rating of G or F, relative to a house with a B2 rating, is approximately &euro;3,500 per year.  We know that energy prices are increasing, so that figure is sure to increase.  We really need to target Government subsidies and supports in retrofitting for households that are most in need of that upgrade to bring them up to the B2 rating.  <\/p>  <p>  As we introduce retrofitting measures that are crucial to ensuring households are being taken out of fuel poverty on a long-term basis, rather than just through temporary stop-gap measures, we need to ensure that money goes to all low-income households and not just to those dependent on social protection funding or in social housing.  The nature of the housing crisis - and we are all hearing about it everywhere - means that many families outside of the net of State assistance are really floundering.  Again, just today, I heard from a household where somebody getting a new job means that they are going to be removed from the social protection net.  We are all very aware of these real circumstances.  For many people, they will be left behind by this scheme.  The Labour Party alternative budget referred to a targeted retrofitting programme limited to households with incomes of less than &euro;50,000.  In addition, it was stated that houses would have to have a building energy rating, BER, of less than B2.  What we sought, therefore, was a targeted scheme that was targeted not just on income but also on those who are more at risk of fuel poverty.  I ask the Minister to look at a more targeted and equitable approach to funding the scheme, and indeed at more radical measures like the idea of upfront funding to a greater extent than the 50% that is generally anticipated.<\/p>  <p>  There are also concerns around equity for renters.  The issue has been raised already in the debate.  Indeed, I raised it with the Minister at the briefing last week.  There is a real concern, which I have expressed, as has the Labour Party housing spokesperson, Senator Moynihan, that there is a lack of protections for renters in situations where their landlord may seek to engage of a deep retrofit or a retrofitting of a type that will necessitate the renter moving out of the home.  What we do not want to see is the retrofitting process being used as an excuse to raise rents or evict tenants.  We must ensure that there are strong protections for renters and that renters will also be able to reap the benefits of retrofitting.  To reiterate, retrofitting offers immense benefits for anyone whose home is currently cold, badly-insulated or damp.  However, we want to see stronger protections for renters.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to raise an issue in regard to the warmer homes scheme with the Minister, which I raised with him last week at the briefing.  I also previously submitted a parliamentary question to the Minister to ask about amending the SEAI rules on the one home-one visit restriction in the warmer homes scheme to allow homeowners to reapply for works that were no supported by grants in the 2014 scheme, such as external wall insulation on houses on which the walls are solid, and to consider loosening the problematic ten-year limit.  In his reply, the Minister stated that there are no plans to ease the burden on lower-income households which are particularly vulnerable to energy poverty, but my understanding of this new scheme is that an applicant with a BER of E or below can now reapply with some scope for certain homes with a D rating.  I see the Minister nodding.  That is a very welcome development.  I am glad that the position has been reversed.  There is still the concern about the warmer homes scheme and delays in the process.  I know that others have pointed out that there is a 26-month national average delay between application and completion. <\/p>  <p>  That brings me to a final point that has been expressed to me by many constituents and others.  There is a frustration or scepticism about the possibility or capacity to deliver in a situation where there are insufficient numbers of people with the necessary skills in construction.  We need to see a significant ramping-up of apprenticeship programmes for young women and men in construction skills.  We need to see Government committing to fund great programmes like the St. Andrew's programme that is run by the resource centre on Pearse Street.<\/p> <p>It runs a really positive construction skills course.  Those sorts of courses need to be significantly funded because, otherwise, even the homeowners who have the funding and wish to proceed with a deep retrofit, are really incentivised to do so and are going through the one-stop shop may find it very difficult to do so in practice because of that serious skills shortage.  We need to see joined-up thinking in the context of the retrofitting scheme, with a much greater commitment to enhancing the numbers of apprenticeships.  I have also raised this issue with the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris.<\/p> <p> I have been contacted by a constituent whose property has a G building energy rating, BER, and who was delighted at the announcement of the scheme but then discovered he was not eligible for the scheme as it pertains to windows and floor heating as those grant amounts can only be drawn down through the one-stop shop scheme.  I ask the Minister to examine the matter to ensure that people will be eligible to apply through the one-stop shop for those sorts of measures.  I refer to people who live in older and draftier homes and wish to engage in retrofitting, but perhaps not the deeper retrofitting model that is most incentivised.<\/p> <p> There is great interest in and enthusiasm for a national retrofitting scheme.  The challenge for all of us, as legislators, is to ensure the scheme is sufficiently targeted to bring people out of poverty and to address both the climate and cost of living crises.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021700033#KK00200","speaker":"1698","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645107000,"counter":344,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for being in the Chamber and facilitating this debate.  The recently announced national retrofitting scheme is, thankfully, at a level of significance to make a real impact in modernising Ireland's housing stock.  It is an incredible investment with the potential to bring the energy rating of thousands of older homes up to a much more pertinent BER of B2, leading to significant energy cost savings.  For instance, the new national home energy upgrade scheme and the 2030 target encompass 30% of the housing stock, which is very welcome.  This is among the most ambitious retrofit programmes worldwide in terms of underpinning climate policy, the scale of ambition and the of commitment of Government funding, which I understand will come from ring-fenced carbon taxation.<\/p>  <p>  The benefit for upgraded households will be increasingly important, given the spike in energy prices.  Coming from a rural constituency on the Wild Atlantic Way, I expect the literary musings of the many writers living in the Clew Bay area will shift from references to whistling howls in their homes to descriptions of a warm and cosy surrounding.  That should be put on record.  The reality is this retrofitting scheme is the type of targeted funding that protects those who are spending most heavily on energy costs.  The significant increase in the number of free energy upgrades for those at risk of energy poverty is the smart thing to do in this instance.  I would like to see more than 400 homes per month being retrofitted but I recognise it is up from an average of 177 per month in 2021.<\/p>  <p>  I would appreciate clarity from the Minister in respect of the one-stop shops.  The one-stop-shop model is key to ensuring people considering the scheme have access to a hassle-free start-to-finish project management service, including access to financing.  Will these one-stop shops be pop-up arrangements or will they be online?  I believe the in-person element will be required, particularly for older people who may have a high interest in availing of funding under the scheme but may not be willing to pursue it online.  I ask the Minister to send me a note on that issue, if possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021700034#LL00200","speaker":"1601"},{"type":"speech","time":1645107000,"counter":345,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to discuss this scheme.  Contrary to its name, retrofitting is a modern and progressive move for us, as a Government, to be making.  In light of constraints relating to energy and electricity, along with a growing need to address the climate emergency, this scheme is so welcome.  Nationally, we are seeing a culture change with regard to energy efficiency and our desire to be climate conscious in all the decisions that we make.  Whether it is buying an electric car or a hybrid vehicle or retrofitting one's home, the appetite for measures such as this has never been greater and that is a really welcome change.<\/p>  <p>  However, as all present are aware, making the effort to reduce one's carbon footprint, be more energy efficient or have a climate-conscious home does not come for free.  Far from it.  If we want to make the changes necessary to address the climate emergency, we certainly need to bring everyone - people of all financial means - along with us.  We need to make it a viable decision for everyone to introduce climate change mitigation measures.  The measures in the national retrofitting scheme will help to address the barriers in undertaking energy upgrades that so many homeowners experience, as well as the barriers experienced by those working in the industry.  They also reflect the step-change needed in pace and scale of delivery in order to achieve that target of 500,000 home energy upgrades by 2030.<\/p>  <p>  I really welcome the range of measures the scheme will seek to introduce.  These are measures aimed at driving demand for retrofitting, expanding the size and capacity of the supply chain and making retrofits more affordable, which is crucial.  It is important that people understand the return they can get from retrofitting their home and how quickly they will begin to see those returns.  In the context of the 80% grant for attic and cavity wall insulation, I understand people will make their money back and begin to save on their investment within two years, which is really great.<\/p>  <p>  A criticism I have heard from various constituents relates to the vast cost difference between the shallow and deep retrofits.  I have heard many arguments for an extra scheme somewhere in the middle of the two which might provide for a greater level of retrofitting than the shallow retrofit but be less expensive than the deep retrofit.  I do understand that in some cases there is little merit in updating the windows in a home, as such, if the walls are letting out a large amount of heat, for example.  For many people, however, doing all of this in one go is simply not possible, so I very much advocate for individual window grants under the national retrofitting scheme as windows are an issue about which I am contacted a lot in my office.<\/p>  <p>  I know many people who are vulnerable or on lower incomes have benefited from the Better Energy, Warmer Homes Scheme and, indeed, the one-off exceptional needs payment when heating is an issue.  I welcome the free energy upgrades the scheme will provide for those at risk of energy poverty.  However, these schemes do not necessarily help the squeezed middle.  I refer to the people who are earning average or very good wages but finding it difficult to make ends meet because of the rising cost of living.  More needs to be done to help these people to invest in their homes and proof them against climate change.  More needs to be done beyond attic and wall insulation.  As I stated, I really welcome the scheme and the range of provisions in it, but I would like to see more in the way of specific window grants and more for middle-income earners.  I hope this is something the Minister and his Department will consider going forward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021700034#LL00300","speaker":"1566"},{"type":"speech","time":1645107000,"counter":346,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister for this discussion of what is one of the most positive schemes this Government will do in the coming years.  I laud the scheme.  There are so many positives in it, despite the negativity that initially greeted the Minister after he spoke.  We should be discussing the positives here, which far outweigh the negatives, but it is not surprising to hear that at this stage.<\/p>  <p>  This retrofit scheme will provide multiple benefits.  People will have warmer and more comfortable homes that are cheaper to run.  It will help alleviate energy poverty in the medium to long term and improve the health and well-being of citizens, particularly elderly people.  It will improve the asset values of properties across the country and create economic activity and high-quality jobs.  It will give everybody the ability to heat their home using electricity generated through renewable energy projects.  There is a lot to be positive about in the scheme and I look forward to seeing it rolled out in the coming years.<\/p>  <p>  The scheme will produce the one-stop-shop model that will provide an end-to-end service for homeowners.  This includes surveying the home, designing upgrades, managing the grant process, helping with access to finance, engaging contractors to deliver the work and quality assuring the work at the end.  It will also provide grant support under the Better Energy Homes scheme for homeowners who want to take a step-by-step approach to upgrading their home.<\/p> <p>The grant for heat pumps, for instance, has increased from &euro;3,500 to &euro;6,500 and the rate for external wall insulation will increase from &euro;6,000 to &euro;8,000.  Up to now, many people were excluded from the SEAI&rsquo;s schemes if they had previously availed of one.  That will now also be removed.  <\/p> <p> The budget that the Minister is providing for this will support an increase in the number of free home upgrades from an average of 177 per month in 2021 to 400 per month this year.  As previous speakers have said here, there is concern about lower-income and middle-income families and how they will access the scheme and this is something we need to be conscious of as the scheme is rolled out.  <\/p> <p> In his closing comments, I ask the Minister to clarify the flexibility and responsiveness of the scheme.  I am assuming there will be some kind of review undertaken periodically on aspects of the scheme and the process that perhaps are not working to the optimum and which might be amended over time.  Such a review, and the ability of the Minister to review the process as we go would be welcome.<\/p> <p> We also need to consider the added implications that growing inflation will pose.  Will the terms of the scheme be reviewed as the programme is rolled out to take those factors into consideration?  It is well documented that cost of living inflation is causing a significant problem at the moment.  If many of the jobs that are to be costed in the coming years are far in excess of that &euro;50,000 limit, I wonder will there be flexibility for the scheme to possibly grow with inflation, if that continues to be a considerable problem.  <\/p> <p> My main concern is around the apprenticeships and whether we will get the volume of qualified apprentices we need to do these jobs and undertake these schemes.  That is where I see there might be a significant pinch.  My other concern is on the SEAI&rsquo;s capacity to deal with what is coming down the tracks in terms of the workload it will have.  This undoubtedly will be a very significant undertaking and I hope the authority will be provided with the resources it will require to ensure that this scheme is administered appropriately and is used to the maximum benefit of all of our people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021700034#LL00400","speaker":"1521","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645107600,"counter":348,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to have this discussion today about the Government's retrofitting programme.  As I listened to the Minister's speech, there was a great deal on which I would agree with both him and with Deputy Leddin in what he said about the fundamental need for an ambitious retrofitting scheme and the improvements it could potentially mean for people's homes, health and finances, as well as the need from a climate, environmental and energy security perspective.  We have seen the increasing importance of that over the past number of weeks.  I also agree that this will come down to winning over the public because much of the time, people cannot visualise what it would be like to live in a warm, comfortable home that does not cost you money to keep running.  The question for us here today is whether the retrofitting scheme as proposed is sufficient or ambitious enough.  Unfortunately, I do not believe that it is.  There are some fundamental flaws with the scheme in how it was designed and developed and I will go through them now.<\/p>  <p>  I have previously spoken to the Minister about the Government's ability to meet the retrofitting targets that have been put in place.  I understand that over the past number of years and previous to that there has never been a target that has actually been met.  The issue which has been raised by participants is timelines, with a 26-month average waiting time.  I have spoken to the Minister before about a constituent of mine who was waiting for two and half years for an inspector to come in.  I understand that Covid-19 was an issue and caused delays but these were very significant delays and I do not believe that they could all have been put down to Covid-19 reasons.<\/p>  <p>  My other concerns relates to the capacity of the scheme to meet the targets due to the particular market model that is being employed in this programme and in respect of the quality and availability of labour required.  The Irish housing stock uses 7% more energy than the average European home and pumps out 60% more carbon dioxide.  We are already starting at a particularly low base.  It makes the scheme automatically costlier, requiring greater numbers of deeper retrofits just to bring us in line with other European housing stocks.  <\/p>  <p>  The scheme provides a grant of 50% of the cost of retrofitting a home to a B2 energy rating and requires homeowners to provide 50% of the funding for a deep retrofit, or 80% to any homeowners for a simple retrofit of attics and walls.  Unfortunately, with the rising cost of living, inflation and rising energy prices, people are already pinned to their collar, paying for mortgages and high childcare costs along with everything else.  Fewer people will want to take on another loan, regardless of how low the interest rate will be and few people will be in a position to take on a loan of that type.<\/p>  <p>  The significant amount of feedback from the public about which the Minister has spoken shows there is a great deal of interest and that many people want to do this.  The feedback I am receiving is that many people will not be able to afford to do it unless they are particularly wealthy or financially comfortable.  People feel that to do this, they will have to take on yet another unaffordable loan or live with rising heating costs.  They feel that they are being stuck in the middle with this and are worrying that they will continue to suffer as the cost of living puts many of these choices out of reach. <\/p>  <p>  Rising inflation will also mean that the cost of materials to facilitate retrofitting on this scale will continue to rise as well.   When asked how the Government will ensure the scheme will remain affordable for people and for the State, trickle-down economics is referred to.  I have been hearing the phrase from Government circles that these measures reflect the step change needed to deliver on the retrofitting target of half a million homes by 2030.  The general principle is that once the private sector engages in the scheme, over time the cost of retrofitting will go down.  In the meantime, this scheme is primarily targeting those who can afford to deep-retrofit their home. <\/p>  <p>  Once again, these measures are not targeted at those who need retrofitting but rather it is targeted at those who can already afford it, to attract more investment from the private sector while the Government hedges its bets that prices will go down enough in order that everybody at some stage will be able to afford a deep retrofit in future.  <\/p>  <p>Meanwhile, low-income households are waiting up to 24 months to get their home retrofitted through the SEAI better warmer homes scheme.  I understand the Minister has announced an expansion of the scheme and proposes to deliver 400 units a month.  Last year, in 2021, 177 homes a month were retrofitted under this scheme.  The target was actually 5,500 and only 2,126 were retrofitted.  That means about 4,800 homes will be retrofitted in 2022, which is nearly 1,000 less than last year&rsquo;s target.  If I have those figures wrong I would appreciate an email to that effect but that is my reading of the figures that we are receiving through the replies to parliamentary questions.<\/p>  <p>  When we look at this scheme it seems to us that the Government is targeting the wrong cohort of people.  We need to target those who have a greater need to reduce their energy costs and who cannot afford to take on another loan. <\/p>  <p>  What is the solution and the alternative?  The Social Democrats have cited a pay-as-you-save scheme instead of a national retrofitting loan scheme.  This would enable homeowners to get the finance up front and then pay off the costs as they save on electricity bills over time.  This was a policy mooted by other, previous Governments since 2011 but has never really formed any serious policy.  It is something that is, however, possible and that the Social Democrats believe should have formed the basis of this retrofitting scheme.<\/p>  <p>  Berlin has been a front runner of success in this model.  It began its Berlin Energy Saving Partnerships with the Berlin Energy Agency in 1996.  One key to the success of the programme has been its financing, which relieved the owners of investment costs.  Renovations have been paid for via loans, after calculations by accredited energy systems companies of the possible energy cost returns.  The investments in Berlin have paid for themselves within ten years.   In the 2000s these so-called energy performance contracts have become an established model for financing around the world and there is no reason why a similar model could be done here.  The Social Democrats believe that this is the preferable model.<\/p>  <p> When it comes to the cost of this, I will refer quickly to the matter of the carbon tax, as I know it has been a matter of a great deal of discussion lately.  There is much misinformation about this tax and unfortunately it is being used by some parties to create an environmental bogeyman.  The Social Democrats believe that the entirety of the carbon tax should be ring-fenced and applied to this retrofitting programme and not just the tax increase.  I find it interesting that there are many Ministers and Deputies who, when talking about the carbon tax, continually say that the carbon tax goes towards retrofitting.<\/p>  <p>It does not.  It is the increases we have seen over the last number of budgets that have been ring-fenced and go towards retrofitting, but the bulk of the carbon tax does not.  We believe that if the Government had taken the entirety of the carbon tax and put it into this retrofitting scheme, to provide an upfront payment so householders can get the retrofitting done and not have to worry about taking out loans but pay it back over the following years, it would have been a much more appropriate, urgent and ambitious way to deal with the retrofitting programme.  It is unfortunate that the discussion is now coming down to the carbon tax being at fault for all our ills at present.  That will not do us any favours at all and it certainly will not do any favours for any of our climate actions or ambitions for meeting our targets.<\/p> <p> I have some concerns about the quality and availability of labour for the retrofitting scheme.  The Minister referred to the scheme as a signal for the construction industry to ramp up the number of workers skilled in retrofitting.  However, there is such a dearth of skilled workers in the construction industry at present that we will face serious challenges in getting a sufficient number of skilled workers into the sector.  There was already a need for an extra 27,000 construction workers before the retrofit plan was announced.  There will have to be significant ramping up of these numbers to keep the scheme sustainable in terms of quality and availability.  Furthermore, the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science promises a range of options will be made available from short courses to full-time or part-time courses, but those schemes have not been ramped up sufficiently either.  There are only 104 students enrolled on nearly zero energy building, NZEB, schemes in 2022, so there has to be a great deal more focus on that.  In fact, I have been doing a deep retrofit on my home in the last year, which is still not finished, and we have had serious problems getting workers on-site.  We found that we might have a team of workers in to do the insulation or whatever, they could be there for half an hour and then they get a text message and go off to a different site.  We could be left for days not knowing when they would return.  Construction workers is a major issue that has to be examined.<\/p> <p> We also must examine the issue of quality control.  I am running out of time, but we cannot run the risk of being in a position where we will have to retrofit retrofits.  If there was some quality assurance or quality control put in place as part of this programme, it would be very welcome.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021700035#MM00300","speaker":"1627","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645108200,"counter":350,"content":"<p>While the plan to retrofit more homes is welcome, we have been in this position previously.  The Government, of course, has prioritised the ability to pay over need, which means that those who need it most will get it last or not get it at all.  Sinn F&eacute;in in government would have grants based on income and people's ability to pay.  We would introduce a dedicated scheme for households with children living in energy poverty.  Under the Government's plan, people who have a spare &euro;25,000 lying around will be able to get up to &euro;25,000 in grants.  These grants will be funded by ever-increasing carbon taxes.  Basically, ordinary workers and families who have been hit the most by the increase in the cost of living will be paying to retrofit the homes of those lucky enough to be able to put up the initial &euro;25,000.  The Government's solution for ordinary working families is for these families to go even more into debt.  On Leaders' Questions today, my colleague, Deputy Doherty, offered the Minister a solution, which the Minister ignored in his response.<\/p>  <p>  At a time when home heating has increased in price by 50%, gas by over 20% and ordinary workers and families are being crucified daily at the petrol pumps, the Government is going to increase these prices by introducing an increase in the carbon tax.  We have implored it not to do this.  The &euro;32 million that it expects to raise with the carbon tax could be raised in different ways.  For example, as Deputy Doherty outlined, the Government cut the bankers' levy this year at a cost of &euro;63 million.  That was a political choice.  The Minister said we are running out of time with regard to climate change.  I agree that we must act, but we must act in a fair and just way.  I put it to the Minister that the Government is running out of time and out of ideas, and measures such as this show how out of touch it is.<\/p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in would target those who are most in need earliest, including those in social housing.  Current energy saving criteria and measures for public homes have to be examined.  I will discuss an issue in my area.  I have been contacted by numerous residents from a public private partnership development in the area.  The development is beautiful, shiny and new and one can see solar panels on the roofs of the homes.  The residents who contacted me have disclosed that the solar panels are connected to a converter but no batteries for the converters have been provided.  In real terms, this means no energy is being stored.  As the energy is not stored it is therefore wasted.  The system also provides for instant hot water when the residents run their hot taps, but because no energy is stored the water from the hot taps is automatically heated by gas.  As we know, gas prices are going through the roof, so this is resulting in even higher than normal gas bills.  We now have the bizarre situation in my area where an energy saving scheme is actually using more energy and hitting the residents hard in their pockets.  Residents have reported to me that they feel the solar panels have been placed just for show and in order that the development can achieve its BER rating.<\/p>  <p>  There is public housing in the Foxdene and Balgaddy areas in my constituency.  The architectural plans for Foxdene Avenue, M&eacute;ile An R&iacute;, T&oacute;r An R&iacute; and Buirg An R&iacute; in Balgaddy won major awards, but the plans did not match the reality on the ground.  Four years after a damning European ruling on the state of the local authority housing in Balgaddy, little progress has been made on improving conditions.  Ireland has been found to be in breach of human rights by the European Committee on Social Rights because of the development in Balgaddy.  The estate is just 15 years old, but residents contact me daily about damp, mould, leaks and rotten windows.  I first became a public representative in 2016 and there has been no let-up in telephone calls from the residents, who are absolutely desperate.  The council has tried to carry out some works in the area, but it is done in a piecemeal way as its budget allows.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister talks about a national retrofit plan, but the people in Balgaddy feel they have been left behind again.  The basic environment a person has is his or her home.  A home is one of the basic needs we have as humans.  If the Minister wants to make environmental changes to homes, I suggest he start with housing schemes such as Balgaddy where people are living in substandard homes.  These are substandard homes that have been provided by the local authority on behalf of the Government, so the Minister owes the people an explanation and a chance to get them fixed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021700036#NN00200","speaker":"1469"},{"type":"speech","time":1645108200,"counter":351,"content":"<p>Much as I respect my fellow county man, Deputy O'Rourke, there is a strong smell of cynicism when I hear Sinn F&eacute;in saying that this measure fails the equity test.  It meets the equity test on two very strong standards.  It provides free retrofitting for all the families who live in local authority homes, the low paid at work, carers, people on disability allowance with young children, people on jobseeker's allowance with young children and people on the fuel scheme.  This is very targeted at people who are at risk of being in fuel poverty.  It also meets the equity test in that it is linking the polluter-pays principle, namely, people pay a carbon price for the damage that carbon does to their home, to the long-term transformation, starting with those who are least well-off.  That is what this is doing.  It absolutely meets the equity test.  It is helping to transform this country for a better future, not only for today's generation but also for future generations.<\/p>  <p>  As with much of the climate agenda, this is asking people to change the habits of a lifetime.  Many of us are used to the open fire and poor insulation.  People are living in poor conditions in some ways and they are going to have to change.  It is unfamiliar.  One of the things we will have to do is win the hearts and minds of people to recognise that this is a patriotic call to make changes in the building stock we have inherited, so that there will be a better life for people today, particularly older people who need that comfort, and for people in the future by having a better climate and better environment.  We have to use trusted advocates to demonstrate that this is something we need.<\/p>  <p>  It is not just we, as politicians, who should be advocating but the many people who recognise that we are building the environmental assets of the future by making this type of transformation.  We must embed this in both personal and collective initiative.  The sustainable energy communities, of which there are now 600, can be at the heart of helping people to make this change because a lot of it does not come easily to people.  It is asking people to disrupt their homes.  We can enlist volunteers within communities to do it on an area-by-area basis.<\/p> <p>This should start with the oldest homes where the greatest risk of fuel poverty and bad energy conditions exist.  The Minister should invite people to sign up and give them a year or 18 months to do so with supports that can be put in place.  We should really tap into making it area-based and use communities.  We need to make it easy and the one-stop shop is a great step forward.  We should also have other measures.  In the UK, when an attic clearance service was added to the installation package, there was a dramatically bigger uptake.  People had been thinking about the disruption that would be caused.  A very simple measure transformed the take-up.  We need to be innovative in how we help people to do this.  We should be rewarding the sustainable energy communities that perform best so we champion, recognise and reward people making the effort to transform their communities and make them climate resilient for the long term.<\/p> <p> We should continuously trial new approaches.  I know the officials are very committed to doing this.  Many initiatives have been taken in this area.  An example is the VAT rebate during the depths of the economic crisis.  It got a lot of people to do work that otherwise would not have been done.  This could be very attractive for people.  It helps to have the Revenue Commissioners also on the side of making these changes.  We need to step up the obligations on the energy sector and on producers of energy products in order that they will also participate in what is a national mobilisation.<\/p> <p> I wish the Minister well.  I thank him for the effort that has gone into bringing it to this point.  The low-interest loan element with the one-stop shop all in one piece is vital.

In addition, the level of work that will be undertaken on homes at risk of fuel poverty will increase from 120 last year to 400 per annum, which is extremely welcome.<\/p>  <p>  For those who find it difficult or impossible to borrow there are interim measures they can take.  For instance, the 80% grant for those who wish to address their attic space or their cavity walls.  This will almost pay for itself in one year.  This is pretty fantastic when we consider the 25% saving in energy costs associated with the work that will be undertaken.  It will leave a bill of approximately &euro;500 for the homeowner to pay.  If homeowners go through the one-stop shop that is to be established shortly, they will not have upfront costs.  This is an excellent initiative which I commend.<\/p>  <p>  We have an enormous amount of work to do to properly address the more than 1 million homes in the State that are not efficient in terms of the heat they retain or the manner in which they were built.  It is incredibly important for us to recognise that targeting 500,000 homes in the next five years is extremely ambitious.  There are funds being provided by the Department with responsibility for further and higher education to support the work of the education and training boards throughout the country.  I have just come from a meeting with representatives from the education and training boards who referred to approximately &euro;70 million capital funding per annum to invest in every county throughout the country to bolster the training courses available.  This is to ensure the additional funds from the Department of approximately &euro;31 million are provided to the sector for the near zero buildings of the future and all of the associated training courses.  This will enlarge the number of individual builders who are capable of carrying out the work towards the 17,000 mark over the course of the next nine years.<\/p>  <p>  In further recognition that it costs a lot of money to deep retrofit a home the State is stumping up 50%.  In saying this, approximately &euro;25,000 is a lot of money.  This is why the delivery of the low-cost State-backed loan due to come on stream in the third quarter of this year cannot come soon enough.  It is imperative the SEAI, as Deputy Bruton mentioned, is tasked with selling this.  There are opportunities throughout the State to show great examples to people who might be sceptical about what it is like to live in a home that has near-zero heating bills.  They have to cough up the money and find it somehow.  Of course there are those for whom this might not be possible in the short term, but that might change in the near future.  This is a nine-year plan.  We will not be able to retrofit all of the homes in Ireland over the course of the next nine years.  Clearly, there will be some who will be unable to avail of the deep retrofit.  As has been mentioned, they can look at the other options available.<\/p>  <p>  Oversight of the works that will be completed in this 500,000 home project over the next nine years is incredibly important to me.  I have mentioned this to the Minister and he mentioned it in his opening contribution to the debate.  Will all of the additional 50 staff he mentioned whom the SEAI will hire in the coming years be charged with delivering on the project or will they be inspecting?  It is imperative we have confidence given the unfortunate legacy of the previous boom.  The legacy on building standards must not find its way into scepticism about near-zero energy buildings, heat pumps and the like.  I very much look forward to seeing the project being delivered.  I commend the Minister and the Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021700037#OO00200","speaker":"1562"},{"type":"speech","time":1645108800,"counter":354,"content":"<p>I fully support the very ambitious programme the Minister has launched.  There will be major challenges in delivering it.  We are speaking about more than 500,000 homes benefiting over a period.  It is important that we look at the existing structures and the defects that exist to make sure we can deliver in a timely manner.  Recently, I spoke to someone who applied to the SEAI more than two years ago to get approval for work they wanted to do in the house.  It was not until two years later that the house was inspected and they could start the work.  There is a need to have a review every six months on what progress is made on inspections and the delivery of projects.  If there is a need for changing some aspects of the programme we should not be afraid to do that to meet the challenges that will be posed by it.<\/p>  <p>  We have a challenge with the workforce and the availability of people to deal with it.  This morning I had a call from someone trying to get a wheelchair ramp put into a house.  I know this is a slightly different area.  I have gone through quite a number of contractors and no one is available.  The individual has approval for a grant but no one is prepared to do the work at present because of the schedules they have.  This is a problem we need to address.  How can we bring more people in to carry out this work?<\/p>  <p>  There is also an issue with houses built prior to 1970.  They do not have cavity walls but cavity blocks.  This is a huge problem.  They were built between 1959 and 1970.  There is a big challenge in trying to provide heat insulation.  Work must be done on the outside and some work can be done on the inside.  It is a challenge.  I have come across estates where all of the houses have been built in that way.<\/p> <p>As a result there is no heat retention whatsoever.<\/p> <p> I also wish to raise with the Minister the issue of houses that were built by housing agencies 25 or 30 years ago.  I have come across a number of cases where elderly people are living in these houses.  Very little retrofitting work has been done to them by the housing agencies involved.  I ask that the Department engage with those housing agencies to see what can be done around getting work done, especially where there are elderly people involved.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021700037#OO00300","speaker":"1523","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645109400,"counter":356,"content":"<p>While the plan to retrofit homes is of course welcome, this plan will predominantly benefit people with means.  Struggling working families will be encouraged to take on more debt if they want warm homes.  There are aspects of the scheme that are very welcome, such as the SEAI no-second-visit rule being removed and a step-by-step scheme of small works will be supported.<\/p>  <p>  There are, however, serious concerns that it will result in a three-tier programme.  On the first tier, there will be grants and immediate work for those who are able to pay.  On the second tier it could be delayed works for those in local authority housing or those on the warmer homes scheme.  Under third tier there would be minor works or no works at all for renters and those on low incomes. This has the potential to be deeply regressive.<\/p>  <p>  Under this plan, people who have &euro;25,000 on hand, for example, will be able to get up to &euro;25,000 in grants, funded by the ever-increasing carbon taxes.  Meanwhile, for working families who are struggling to get by, the Government's answer is to take on more debt.  Those on low incomes are once again being left behind.  The plan is prioritising an ability to pay over need.  The plan could have been more equitable.  It could have included graduated grants based on income and ability to pay, targeting those most in need earliest in the delivery, and including those in social housing.  The Government could have incorporated a dedicated scheme for households with children who are living in energy poverty.<\/p>  <p>  The warmer homes scheme is under-resourced.  There are currently approximately 7,000 houses awaiting work on the scheme work programme.  The local authority scheme is also under-resourced.  It is expected to deliver only 2,400 retrofits out of an estimated 27,000 energy-efficiency upgrades this year.  Private tenants have been forgotten in the plan.  Many tenants are living in cold and poorly insulated homes.  There is nothing in this plan to address this.  There are no incentives for landlords to make energy-efficient changes.  It will leave renters having to continue to pay huge and rising heating bills.<\/p>  <p>  Taxpayer funded grants should be targeted to provide financial assistance to those who really need help paying for energy upgrades: those least well off in the coldest houses.  Sinn F&eacute;in allocated &euro;75 million more than the Government in our alternative budget in 2022 to achieve just that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021700038#PP00200","speaker":"1513"},{"type":"speech","time":1645109400,"counter":357,"content":"<p>As my colleague just stated, it is always welcome when there is any scheme put into place that will improve the situation for people out there.  It is very welcome that there is a scheme.  It is making an effort.  All of us recognise, however, that when we have a scheme such as this, there is an opportunity to try to get the most in need dealt with first.  This is the criticism all of us have of this scheme.  We are not here to be critical, we are here to be constructive.  This is a missed opportunity on the part of the Government to try to reach those people most in need, who have the most hardship, and who have the most difficulty in that regard.  It could have been done in the way that many other grant schemes are done such as grant schemes for older people that are run through the local authorities.  This is where one gets a larger grant if one is on a lower income, and as the income bracket goes up then the level of the grant would fall.  It would make sense to most people.  This is what should have and what could have been done.  That is one of the big issues with the scheme.<\/p>  <p>  A number of people have also come to me on another issue, and perhaps the Minister would clarify this at some point.  It concerns those people who have homes that they may have inherited.  I know one man who inherited an old house from his uncle ten or 15 years ago.  Nobody has lived in it in years.  It is sitting there, out in a rural area and he wants to know will this grant will work for him or will it not, or will he have to wait for some other grant to come later.<\/p>  <p>  Of course it is not good to be getting people into debt in these circumstances, but a new loan scheme is proposed - it will hopefully involve low-interest loans - for people to avail of.  We have the grant coming now and then the loan later on.  Many people will have to wait to see if they will be able to apply for or even qualify for loans.  People already have mortgages, car loans and other commitments.  One of the things that seems to be missing in all of this is an understanding that the people who need this most are those who are already under pressure and who find that the cost-of-living crisis is biting hard.  To say to them that they would have to go out and borrow another &euro;25,000 or more just does not work.  They will say that they just cannot afford to do that.  They are not in a position to do it.<\/p>  <p>  I raised with the Minister earlier the case of a man who has cancer and who cannot afford to get health insurance.  He said to me that he would get health insurance after he had paid off his mortgage, which will be in another ten or 12 years.  That was when he could afford to do so but, unfortunately, cancer got to him sooner.  It is the same with people who need to get their homes retrofitted.  They would love to get their homes retrofitted but cannot afford to do it.  They cannot afford to take more loans until their mortgages are paid.  These are the people that the scheme could have targeted much better.<\/p>  <p>  There is always time to make adjustments and changes.  I encourage the Minister to take on the criticism, if he wants to call it that, or the constructive message that the Opposition is giving to him to the effect that there is an opportunity to make changes.  As the Minister moves forward to finalise the scheme, there is an opportunity to put measures in place that will target those who are most in need.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021700038#PP00300","speaker":"1607"},{"type":"speech","time":1645109400,"counter":358,"content":"<p>I put it to the Minister and Minister of State that there is no debate about the importance of the retrofitting programme.  It is a key step to Ireland reducing its emissions in the dramatic and radical way required.  The technical possibility exists for us to have huge cuts in emissions caused by home heating.  Like the possibility of free public transport, for example, there are other huge benefits to society and to ordinary people, not least the warmer and energy-efficient homes that can also reduce the prevalence of respiratory illnesses and the deaths associated with those.  We can improve air quality dramatically, and we can improve good quality and decent-paying jobs and apprenticeships for decades to come.  Most importantly, we can cut the need to use oil, gas and coal.<\/p>  <p>  It can also help us to change the debate around climate change for once and for all, from one where ordinary people are consistently asked \"What are you prepared to sacrifice?  What are you as an individual prepared to do to change your behaviour and change your lifestyle?\", to one where we offer a vision to people for a fossil fuel-free future that is better, healthier, and more equitable, and a more compassionate place to live than where we are now.  Nobody could have a problem with the Government's big effort around a retrofit programme.  We have known this for the last few years, as the crisis is accelerating, and we know that the need to cut fossil fuel use is more and more urgent.<\/p>  <p>  The Green Party and the Minister entered office on the basis that only with the Green Party in government could we deliver the radical change that is needed to stop the worsening of the crisis.  Yet, what do we see with this retrofitting programme and with practically every other practical policy?  This is not a huge ambition or a huge step forward.  In 2019, the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Bruton, announced, in a PR flurry, a retrofit plan for 500,000 retrofits of homes and the installation of 400,000 heat pumps.  This current scheme is not a dramatic improvement in what has already been announced, and which is now being regurgitated three years later.<\/p>  <p>  Moreover, my issue with structural problems around the scheme remain the same as those echoed by Deputies here.  If a person is not included in the group that qualifies for the warmer homes scheme, not on fuel allowance or living in poverty and social welfare, not in the group that has the capacity to borrow &euro;20,000 or &euro;30,000, then that person remains in the same that he or she will always be in.  Let us be clear, that this is the vast majority of ordinary working people in the State.  Most of them will face the same issue of not being able to take steps they need to reduce their emissions, and to improve the efficiency of their homes.<\/p>  <p>  Like other Deputies, I could cite example after example of people coming to my clinic who are just a few euro above the threshold relating to the fuel allowance.  They do not fall into the pretty inadequate category the Government has set in the context of energy poverty and, hence, do not qualify for the allowance.  That is not good enough.  The matter needs to be reviewed and we need to take in a bigger cohort of people who cannot afford to borrow but who do not fall into the category of being poor enough to be supplied by the State.<\/p>  <p>  Before I hand over to my colleague I want to deal with one other issue.  I received a reply to a parliamentary question yesterday on issues to do with this retrofitting scheme.  The much-lauded spending of &euro;1 billion per year between now and 2028 turns out to be no such thing.  Like the carbon budgets and the targets relating to reducing emissions on an annual basis, the figures are totally backloaded to a time when neither the Minister nor the Green Party were in government.<\/p> <p>We do not know what is going to happen after 2025, but it is not until 2027, 2028, 2029 or 2030 that the billions will start being spent.  It is very frugal up the point.  We are backloading the responsibility of reducing emissions and reaching the targets required of us by the Paris Agreement, our own climate legislation and the programme for Government.  Everything is being backloaded to a time when the Minister may not be sitting here at all.  Who will be held accountable?  Where is the responsibility?<\/p> <p> The Act may do that but this is one Government passing to the next the legacy of the backloading of targets.  Let us be honest with people.  This is not &euro;1 billion per year.  Rather, it is an average of &euro;1 billion per year over the next eight years.  It is nothing like that between now and 2027.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021700038#PP00400","speaker":"1486","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645110000,"counter":360,"content":"<p>We all know the urgency of retrofitting homes that are badly insulated to protect the climate and lift the financial burden being imposed on families by rising energy costs.  As usual with Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and, most sadly, the Green Party, the way the scheme is designed means it is, once again, a scheme where the suffering of the poor will subsidise improvements in the lifestyles of the rich.  That is what is going to happen.<\/p>  <p>  What I mean by that?  The financing for all of this is dependent on regressive taxes being imposed on people who are absolutely crucified at the moment by rising energy costs.  In 2020, we collected &euro;494 million.  I understand an additional &euro;148 million, or in that realm, was collected as a result of the increase in 2021.  As Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith found out this week, we raised &euro;481 million in VAT on energy last year.  Over &euro;1 billion in regressive forms of tax that disproportionately hit the least well-off have been raised, and next year the Government will give us &euro;267 million, a fraction of which is for retrofitting.  However, the people who will be most able to access it are rich and can afford to make up the gap between the maximum amount for retrofitting, which is &euro;25,000, and the actual cost of a deep retrofit, which is, in reality, &euro;50,000 or more in many cases.<\/p>  <p>  This is the reverse of Robin Hood.  It is the working people subsidising a grand scheme that will mostly benefit the better off and which they will not be able to access.  The idea that the just transition to a better climate future is about impoverishing even more the poor and least well-off is, frankly, sickening.  That is what is going on.  If anything is going to turn people away from the climate agenda, it is that sort of policy that will do it.<\/p>  <p>  Given that we are talking about energy, I cannot help but comment on the mantra being used by the Government to justify the increase in energy costs that is happening, namely that it is all to do with the international market and we have no control over it.  The Government has control over carbon tax, VAT and PSO levies, which is why our energy costs are 15% to 20% higher than the rest of Europe.  That is the fault of the Government.  <\/p>  <p>  Something else that has not been injected into the debate is the fact that most of our gas comes not from international sources but from a private company in Corrib because the State gave it away.  Most of our electricity, up to 85% on many days, comes from wind produced on land in the country.  All of the prices are charged at international market rates, which is an important reminder of something we have often said.  Even if we develop loads of renewable energy privately and for profit, it will not make a damn bit of difference to ordinary people in terms of the cost of energy they are being crucified with.  That will continue unless the sector is under public control.<\/p>  <p>  Obviously, we need to retrofit people's homes with funds raised, not by crucifying the least well-off and subsidising the well-off, but by putting that investment into retrofitting social housing and the homes of tenants and the least well-off and actually providing grants and supports which are genuinely affordable.  That could easily be done by taxing some of the profits made by energy companies in this country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021700039#QQ00200","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1645110000,"counter":361,"content":"<p>I welcome the scheme.

I sat and listened to your rhetoric and I ask you to allow me to lay down some facts.<\/p>  <p>  I have acknowledged the part Mr. Paul Kenny has played in this.  I do not think there is anybody better out there to recommend and advise the Minister on this scheme, which ticks all of the boxes of sustainability and sustainable development.  The three pillars of sustainability are economy, community and environment.  I will try to outline why I believe that to be so.  <\/p>  <p>  In terms of economy, this scheme will create thousands of jobs, and we all know that.  We are recruiting people, setting up centres of excellence and increasing the number of apprenticeships available.  My nephew recently started an electrical apprenticeship with a solar company and asked me for advice as someone who served an apprenticeship many years ago.  I told him to be careful on the rooftops installing solar panels and that he had decades of good, well-paid and clean work ahead of him.  That is also the case for the thousands of plumbers, electricians, carpenters, plasterers and general builders we will need not just to build 33,000 homes per year but to retrofit the 500,000 homes that the Government will fit.  <\/p>  <p>  A range of schemes will be applicable to everybody.  Nobody will be left behind, because that is key to the Government's message on climate action.  This is climate action.  We will leave nobody behind.  A range of measures are available.  The Department has significantly increased the number of homes that will be addressed under the warmer homes scheme.  Deputy O'Rourke did not get those facts right.<\/p>  <p>  Economically, this scheme stands up in terms of the work that will be created.  We will harness offshore electricity from our wind power.  There are steps in place to do that, and the Government is firmly committed to that and will meet our targets.  We will electrify our heating systems and transport in this country, and we will create thousands of other jobs in those areas, apart from the retrofitting scheme.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of community, this scheme stands up.  Many people across the country are living in cold, damp and draughty houses.  Our standards in building were not great for many years.  Ventilation in houses was provided by draughty poor workmanship for many years.  We need to tighten that up and ensure that those people are looked after first, including those in fuel poverty and whose health is being damaged year after year by living in cold, damp and draughty houses.  We will address that. <\/p>  <p>  There is a 100% grant in place for people in receipt of certain social welfare protections.  <\/p> <p>We will meet that target and make those houses fit, habitable and comfortable for people to live in.  That is the community aspect of this.  The environmental aspect is clear to everybody.  We rely so much on imported fossil fuels in this country.  We see the geopolitical situation which is driving energy prices through the roof.  The smartest thing that any Government can do is to think beyond the five-year electoral cycle and to think ten, 20 or 30 years ahead, and about what we can provide for the children who are coming after us.  We should provide a housing stock so that those children grow up in healthy, warm, comfortable housing, where the bills are not so high that parents cannot afford other things for their children.  The Government is laying out a long-term sustainable plan, which is what the Greens do.  We think ahead.  We do not think about the next two or three years and what is popular or not.  We think long-term.  We think about sustainable energy and retrofitting, which is exactly what we are doing with this scheme.  Despite all the criticism, it is a good scheme, which will work and will deliver.  It is backed by finance.  It will offer low interest loans for people who wish to avail of them.  There is a range of opportunities for every household to avail of warm, energy-efficient, cost-efficient, comfortable, healthy housing for themselves, their children and future generations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021700039#QQ00500","speaker":"1626","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645110600,"counter":365,"content":"<p>I often think when I am here about The Frames' song, &quot;Star Star&quot; and this lyric:<\/p> <blockquote> \tCause I don't understand these people<br \/><br \/>Who say the hill's too steep<br \/><br \/>Well they talk and talk forever<br \/><br \/>But they just never climb <\/blockquote>  <p>The hill is steep.  The targeted emissions reduction that we have is as steep a hill as anyone has ever faced.  This retrofit scheme is part of us climbing that hill.  Rather than moving around the Opposition fridge magnets of missed opportunity or such, this is us getting on with the exceptionally important job in front of us.  It is one that provides huge opportunities.  We are funding this retrofitting scheme into the future in an ambitious way.  We are leveraging some private wealth to do it, which Deputy Boyd Barrett should welcome, since we are unlocking that wealth and putting it to work productively in our communities.  We are providing certainty for the future, so that jobs and structures can be created.  I am thinking of regional structures such as the Waterford Energy Bureau.  It knows the job that it has in front of it for the next decade.  I am also thinking of small businesses, because this is not work that can be outsourced to the Far East.  They include small businesses in Waterford such as Enerpower, Sunstream, which is a solar energy company, and Redfoot Roofing.  These are all small businesses that employ people in the community.  They put the skills that Deputy Matthews outlined to work in the community.<\/p><p>I am thinking of regional training centres, such as the Waterford Wexford Education and Training Board.  It led on the centre of excellence for retrofitting.  There is a regeneration opportunity in the centres of our towns and villages for older building stock.  I am thinking of places in Waterford like Ballybricken or Mount Sion Avenue, where my mother grew up.  Housing there dates to the mid-1800s.  We can bring that up to a modern standard.  I think of places where I went to school, including Lisduggan and Larchville.  There is 1970s social housing that would be brought up to the modern, liveable standard, to provide a better standard of living for the people in it.<\/p><p>Deputy Whitmore highlighted the challenge with the number of workers.  It is absolutely a challenge, but it is also an opportunity.  This is good, clean work with solid jobs that will exist into the future.  I was speaking with the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, at the Joint Committee on Social Protection, Community and Rural Development and the Islands.  He raised the possibility of people on community employment schemes or the rural social scheme being involved, for example.  Not all of these jobs need to be carried out by highly-trained individuals.  The 80% energy grants could be for attic insulation.  A person can be trained to provide attic insulation in a short time.  That is a good job.  Somebody who is maybe distanced from the labour market could move into that area.<\/p><p>Deputy Ward said that this scheme will reach those who need it most last.  That is patently untrue.  Deputy Bruton put paid to that.  The warmer homes scheme will be expanded.  It will be targeted at people who most need it, who live in lower-performing houses.  They will have access to this retrofit scheme free of charge.  We know there is a fuel poverty dividend for people who are at the lowest end of the socioeconomic spectrum.  There is a health dividend too.  Generally, the housing stock for people who live in these communities performs poorly.  If one walks through those areas on a still evening, one can feel it in the air.  People get cleaner, healthier environments both inside and outside their homes.  It is tiered.  It provides for those people who can afford to pay for it out of pocket.  It leverages that private wealth and puts it to work.  It also provides for full grants for people who cannot afford it.  There are steppingstones in between, with the State-backed low interest loan, which is extremely important, and the 80% grants for people who might not be able to face into taking the full job on.<\/p><p>I agree that there are some issues with rented accommodation.  We need to make sure that we are not creating intergenerational issues by pulling up the ladder behind us.  There is a commitment in the Housing for All programme to implement minimum building energy rating standards where feasible.  We need to follow up on that and be ambitious with the timeline.  Putting that concern to one side, this is very ambitious.  It gives certainty to a sector to allow it to scale up with confidence.  It creates local jobs.  It capitalises on our renewable energy resources.  The Greens are in government and we are walking the walk, delivering the manifesto that we presented to people and the type of climate action that we promised in a meaningful and ambitious way.

Since being elected two years ago, I have asked three times when the guidelines will be updated, and each time I have been told that the public consultation ended in February 2020, and that the new guidelines were being prepared.  A previous Deputy spoke about the hill being too steep to climb.  It must be steep for him as well because this is not good enough.  How can councillors who are working on county development plans plan for ordinary development in the absence of these guidelines?  The Government must get the finger out, ensure that our scenic areas are protected and that industrial-sized wind turbines are kept a safe distance from family homes.<\/p>  <p>  The retrofit plan announced by this Government is inequitable.  It is an inequitable use of taxpayers' money and it leaves renters and those on low incomes behind.  It channels money to people who already have the means to carry out work.  Sinn F&eacute;in has called on the Government to consider the eligibility income cap to try to make this more equitable and allow more money to be directed to those on lower incomes or who are living in energy poverty.  Many people come to my office whose fuel allowance is wiped out by inflation and carbon taxes.  They isolate themselves in one room to conserve heat and cut down on food shopping in an effort to balance the household budget.  Imagine having to do that.  More must be done to help these people.  People come to me who were awarded grants under the warmer homes scheme over two years ago and they are still waiting for a contractor to be assigned.  I do not know what is going on.  Maybe the Minister does.<\/p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in provided &euro;30 million more to do this than the Government in its alternative budget for 2022.  We provided for graduated grants based on income and ability to pay, prioritising those most in need.  The Government retrofit plans are funded by the highly regressive, punitive and unfair carbon tax, whereas Sinn F&eacute;in has more ambitious plans that are funded fairly.  There is a fairer way.  The Government must listen to it or stand aside and let others do it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021700040#RR00300","speaker":"1588"},{"type":"speech","time":1645110600,"counter":367,"content":"<p>I welcome the changes regarding the SEAI, getting rid of the no second chance rule, and minor works on attic and cavity walls.  Unfortunately, this is a plan that could have done so much good and it is actually just more of the same old thing.  I acknowledge that it will reduce carbon emissions, but for whom will it reduce them?  The retrofitting scheme as planned is a bit like the SSIA scheme of old, where the more one has, the more one will be able to make out of this scheme.<\/p> <p>If you can put your hands on &euro;25,000, you will be able to get an extra &euro;25,000 in grants.  If you cannot, the Government recommends you take on more debt.  In that sense the scheme is truly a transfer of wealth geared at the governing parties' voter base, people of means, while people who are barely getting by are effectively passed by.  This is particularly so in the case of people who are renting and already paying heart attack-inducing rents, often for properties that are damp, cold, draughty or mouldy.  An Teachta Leddin mentioned mould in his contribution.  In my constituency office in north Kildare we are experts on mould.  We see so much of it in photographs from homes on which taxpayers are lashing out money in the housing assistance payment, HAP, to landlords who, in theory, are supposed to rent decent properties but, in practice, do anything but.  That is another transfer of wealth.  There is no incentive in this scheme for landlords to do the decent thing by their renters.  As my colleague, an Teachta O'Rourke, pointed out, the plan reheats the 2019 target of 500,000 deep retrofits and 400,000 heat pumps by 2030.  Sinn F&eacute;in allocated &euro;75 million more than the Government in our costed alternative budget to do just that.  The Government's scheme directs a majority of publicly-funded supports to people with private means, just like in health, where fast access is decided according to what you can pay, not what you need.  The retrofitting scheme is the same.<\/p> <p> We need to retrofit the whole housing system.  I could not get up to speak without mentioning the heartbroken mother in north Kildare whose children could not sleep last night.  They were sleeping in a caravan and were terrified it would topple over and be blown away.  They are desperate for a home but have nowhere else to go.  The mother's little boy could not go to school today because he was up all night petrified that his mammy and the rest of his family would be blown away in the caravan.  They could not sleep last night for raw fear.  How does the Government sleep at night?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021700040#RR00400","speaker":"1585","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645111200,"counter":369,"content":"<p>The vast majority of people do not underestimate the urgency and the necessity to address climate change.  Protecting the earth for future generations is not just something we choose to do; it is something we are obligated to do as responsible citizens.<\/p>  <p>  The concept of the national retrofitting scheme is smart and ambitious.  The positive impact of a reduction in emissions if up to 70,000 households were to avail of the retrofitting scheme between now and 2030 would be something Ireland could be justifiably proud of on the world's climate stage.  The potential for this scheme is enormous in many ways.  It is, however, a double-edge sword in crucial areas, and we have to be realistic about it.  The scheme has a vision to bring about great benefits on one side but its capacity to deliver is stymied by major obstacles that will prove difficult, if not impossible, to overcome.<\/p>  <p>  One significant obstacle is that availing of this much-needed cost-saving opportunity may not be a possibility for many families.  The initial outlay would push their household budget to its limit.  For many, that limit is already stretched.  It is a time of financial struggle and a time of trepidation and fear about family budgets.  The message I am getting from Tipperary households is that very few have surplus money.  While they need and want to retrofit their home, the chances of that actually happening are slim.  It is highly unlikely they will be able to afford 50% of the cost of carrying out this work, even though they are acutely aware of the long-term benefits of it.  Lending institutions will not entertain them, and low-interest loans at 3.5% from the Government still involve regular repayments, a commitment many cannot undertake.  The promise of future energy savings will not feed a family in the intervening weeks and months.<\/p>  <p>  Another major issue of concern is the serious shortage of skilled workers in Tipperary and across the country.  Thousands of skilled workers of all ages left Ireland during the recession.  Some have returned but a large majority have settled in other countries and may never return within their working lives.  A retrofitting scheme with a duration of eight years will not entice those workers to uproot again to come back to Ireland.  We have lost those invaluable skills as other countries scrambled to employ our carpenters, electricians, scaffolders and plumbers.  At present it is impossible to engage skilled trades.<\/p>  <p>  There is also the unprecedented need to provide housing at this time.  That task requires many of the same skill sets retrofitting projects do.  How will the shortage of skilled workers be met to carry out all this work?  This is a glaring obstacle.  The skilled workers are simply not available, and no number of ambitious plans for building or retrofitting can change that fact.  During the boom times in Ireland it was possible to build 90,000 houses in one year.  Irish and overseas tradesmen and workers made that possible.  If we were to attract tradesmen and workers from outside of Ireland, how would we accommodate them when people already living here cannot find or afford accommodation?  What realistic incentives could we offer them outside of work?<\/p>  <p>  The scheme, if a sufficient number of tradespeople were found to work on it, would be a godsend to apprentices across the country.  It has proven increasingly impossible for apprentices to get placements with the trades to undertake the on-the-job training that forms part of their qualifications.  This scheme could encourage more to enrol for apprenticeships, resulting in a win-win situation for both the present and the future of trades in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  Overall, the concept of the retrofitting scheme is good, but important obstacles need to be thought through and overcome before it is fully fit for purpose.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021700041#SS00200","speaker":"1609"},{"type":"speech","time":1645111200,"counter":370,"content":"<p>As we appear to be exiting the Covid pandemic, our next challenge as a society is the rising cost of living.  Everyone is aware that the cost of day-to-day living is now rising at an unprecedented level.  Whether it is the cost of our grocery shops, the cost of light and heat in our homes or our transport costs, everything is on its way up.  From my experience, and from dealing with my constituents in Louth, the dramatic rise in heating and energy costs is most alarming.  Many of those I have spoken to have experienced massive increases in their heating bills since last year; in some cases they have doubled.  This is unsustainable and will lead to fuel poverty if nothing is done about it.  I welcome the recent announcement by the Government on support for homeowners to improve the energy efficiency of their homes, although I fear the devil could be in the detail when homeowners begin to access the scheme.<\/p>  <p>  Before we speak about the Government support scheme, it is important we discuss why there has been such a dramatic increase in the cost of heating a home.  The Government, along with its colleagues in the EU, must address the reasons energy costs have increased so dramatically and seem set to continue to rise.  There is no doubt but that we have to address the issue of home energy efficiency, but we also have to address the root cause of costs rising so quickly.  This affects not just heating costs but also all businesses, which now face unprecedented energy cost increases, which, unfortunately, will have to be passed on to the end consumer.  That is the same consumer we are trying to help with energy supports.  What would happen if a consumer were to invest in the energy upgrade but his or her other bills, such as grocery or transport bills, continued to increase and eventually wiped out the gains made?  Furthermore, the cost of building materials has increased dramatically in the past 12 months, and the question must be asked, are all these increases justified?  The cost of insulation and timber, in particular, has increased dramatically.  Is this big rise in costs justified?  As I said, we have to address the root cause of these increases.<\/p>  <p>  Getting back to the recent Government announcement, I welcome any initiative that will help a homeowner to improve the energy efficiency of his or her home.  It is important that a person's home is comfortable and easy to heat.  The last thing we want is for someone to be afraid to turn on the heating because of its cost.  We have to eliminate fuel poverty.  The Government announcement stated that the Government intends to have 500,000 homes upgraded to a BER rating of B2 by 2030.  The announcement stated that measures included a new national home energy upgrade scheme, providing increased grant levels of up to 50% of the cost of a typical deep retrofit to a BER B2 standard.  I welcome this but I have some serious concerns about it.<\/p>  <p>  The main thrust of the scheme seems to be encouraging homeowners to invest in heat pump technology.  While I welcome that, we need to discuss how practical that will be.  Heat pumps use electricity as their fuel.  The first question I have is on how we will generate the electricity to satisfy the massive increase in demand from heat pumps.  It is no secret that we are running very close to full capacity in respect of electricity generation at present.  What will happen when the demand on the grid suddenly increases because of all these additional heat pumps on the system?  Has anybody done a study on that to see how the grid will cope with that?  This applies to electric vehicles as well.  How will the grid cope with an additional 1 million electric vehicles on the road by 2030?  The other question we must address is on how we will generate our electricity.  What would happen if all these homes were to use increasing amounts of electricity in a more-than-efficient manner yet electricity continued to be generated in a manner that is bad for the environment and not cost-effective?<\/p>  <p>  The other thing we must consider are the skilled tradesmen who will be required to carry out these works.<\/p> <p>At present, it is almost impossible to get tradesmen to do work as they are all so busy.  Where will the new tradesmen come from?  We are targeting 500,000 homes to be upgraded by 2030.  By my calculations, they will have to upgrade an average of 1,300 homes every week from later this year until 2030 to meet the targets.  I fear this is unachievable unless we have the skilled workforce to carry out the work.  I would like to hear the Government's response on this.  For these schemes to work, we need to see real and verifiable results.  We do not want a box-ticking exercise leading to no improvement in homes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021700041#SS00300","speaker":"1600","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645111800,"counter":372,"content":"<p>There are 1.4 million houses in the State in need of insulation and, according to the Construction Industry Federation, 130,000 non-residential buildings in need of same.  In 2012, I detailed a costed plan that would have seen the deep retrofit of these homes.  It would have cost &euro;14 billion in 2012 to do so.  It would have brought the energy efficiency up to a C1 rating.  At the time, an investment of &euro;10,000 into a home, according to IIEA, would have brought the average household a saving of &euro;1,496 per year and have helped Ireland reach its 20% energy efficiency target by 2020.  The Government plan, if extrapolated to the same level of homes, will cost the State &euro;24 billion.  That is &euro;10 billion extra to be paid by the taxpayer because the Government refused to listen to the good advice of an Opposition Deputy.<\/p>  <p>  When I launched my deep retrofit plan ten years ago, tens of thousands of construction workers were leaving Ireland for Canada and Australia.  Implementation would have meant we kept those skilled workers in this State at a time when we needed to have them ready for the housing crisis that was about to come.  The Government's plan is to quadruple the number of skilled workers from 4,000 to 17,000 by 2025, at a time when there are radical skills shortages and wage inflation in the construction sector.  The lack of skilled workers and proper regulation will be among the biggest challenges.  This country is already dealing with a crisis of mica for many people.  We are paying &euro;1 million per school because of defects in 40 schools built by one builder.  Just under 200,000 houses were built during the Celtic tiger years and it is estimated that half of the apartments built have defects in fire safety and structural problems.  We are in a situation where we do not have the necessary skilled workers, are seeking to ramp it up and trying to do it so as to make sure the crises of the past ten years do not happen again.  <\/p>  <p>  A constituent of mine gave an example.  She applied for a deep retrofit grant in 2019 and moved out of her house in August 2020 for a 12-week period.  She and her family are still outside of their home and dealing with a disaster of a builder who was listed on the SEAI website as a contractor to carry out deep retrofits.  There are already families suffering from the inability of some to deliver what they are meant to.  Everything done to her house was substandard.  She has contacted the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, a number of times and had meetings with the CEO of SEAI but is getting nowhere.  They are at the end of their tether.  I predict that under this Government we will see many people in her situation.<\/p>  <p>  I support deep retrofit.  It is low-hanging fruit.  It saves energy and is by far the best way to reduce our carbon footprint, save money and make homes warmer and more comfortable.  Saving energy is the most important thing we can do.  It is better than producing new renewable energy and we could be more far more ambitious with regard to saving energy in this State.  I drive past the justice building in Navan every day and it looks like Las Vegas with many blinding lights lit up through the night.  The Government is glacial in rolling out the retrofit programme.  My worry is the Government had a target of 50,000 homes per year and has not once hit 20,000.  Even in 2020, only 18,400 were hit.  The Government is making promises about what it will deliver on targets it has not met so far.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021700042#TT00200","speaker":"1504"},{"type":"speech","time":1645111800,"counter":373,"content":"<p>Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v is sharing time with Deputies Carey and Cowen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021700042#TT00300","speaker":"1562"},{"type":"speech","time":1645111800,"counter":374,"content":"<p>I welcome the scheme.  It is a huge step forward.  It is a no-brainer.  We all recognise that capital expenditure of the past looks cheap, but in the future and the present it looks dear.  If we delay this, it only gets dearer.  I hope we have learned our lesson.  I spoke last night about a pier that had planning permission in 2008 and was costed at &euro;7 million.  The budget estimate now is &euro;20 million for the same pier with the same planning.  In 14 years it has doubled, so let us get on with the job.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the scheme and think the targets are laudable.  I particularly welcome the enhanced scheme for those who want to do a limited amount of work.  We have to look at whether these need to be extended.  There is an issue I will raise with the Minister of State and he might raise it with his senior colleague.  The Minister of State will understand why I reference that colleague.  It is because when that colleague was Minister previously and there were schemes on energy, etc., the islands got a higher rate of grant and had higher ceilings because the cost of doing building work on an island is higher.  I ask the Minister of State to remind the Minister, as I will, of what he did before, how well it worked on the islands and the huge success of energy schemes on the islands, and ask him to put the same process in place for this scheme.  That would be important.<\/p>  <p>  I understand the turnover of the company doing it has to be &euro;1 million.  For island companies doing it on an island, that is unachievable.  Companies need to be solvent and capable of doing the job because we do not want the kind of situation Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n spoke about, but small builders often deliver better.  We know of all the one-off houses built around the country to high standards by small builders contracted privately.  It is important that SEAI has high standards in terms of accreditation but, particularly in dispersed rural areas and most particularly on islands, turnover is not the only measure.  Sometimes small is beautiful.  The Green Party used to always preach that gospel.  <\/p>  <p>  I have seen in the last 14 years scheme after scheme announced with great fanfare, huge targets, money put aside and the whole thing but because of small rules that did not get tweaked when the scheme was not working, we did not get delivery.  When there was a problem, instead of tweaking it and doing keyhole surgery, they had a big review that took a year or two and made a few hundred recommendations.  By the time they got around to changing it, many opportunities were lost.  This has to be kept under constant monitoring and whatever is holding it up has to be examined and quickly fixed and changed.  If that is done, the targets will be achieved.  I have no doubt problems will arise and small quibble clauses will be found that are making the scheme unattractive.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the one-stop shop.  I think that will be a big help but if it is not delivering, change it and make sure we deliver.  It can be done.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021700042#TT00400","speaker":"1575"},{"type":"speech","time":1645111800,"counter":375,"content":"<p>This is an ambitious plan in that the retrofitting programme aims to make at least 500,000 homes warmer, more environmentally friendly and cheaper to run over the next eight years or so.  This will be the largest infrastructural investment this decade, with the State investing &euro;8 billion and a similar amount spent by homeowners.<\/p> <p>This programme will need to achieve 50,000 to 70,000 retrofit completions each year to reach its goal of retrofitting 500,000 homes by 2030.  Last year, only 18,000 homes were retrofitted in Ireland.<\/p> <p> Residential emissions account for about 11% of Ireland's total greenhouse gas, GHG, emissions and generate 7 million tonnes of carbon dioxide every year.  Irish homes use 7% more energy than the EU average and pump out about 60% more carbon dioxide.  Affordability is going to be one of the biggest stumbling blocks for the project.  We must incentivise homeowners to complete the full programme of works to obtain at least a B2 BER rating.  I call on the banks to provide a special package tailored to this scheme to provide low-interest term loans for homeowners who wish to invest in their homes.  According to official estimates, a deep retrofit will cost a maximum of &euro;66,000, which means that the State will invest &euro;25,000.  This leads to a net overall cost of approximately &euro;40,000 for those going from the lowest energy BER to the highest.<\/p> <p> The retrofitting of homes is not only to make life much better, cheaper and less damaging to our planet; it can even be a matter of life and death in respect of securing warmer homes for families and especially for older people.  It can also increase the value of our homes.  The ESRI has suggested that every point a house moves up the 15-point BER scale adds 1% to the value of the house.  To put this another way, for every euro spent on retrofitting, two euro is added to the value of the property.  People are therefore investing in their homes to make their lives more comfortable, as well as adding value to their homes.<\/p> <p> Some concerns have been expressed to me at a local level.  These include the role of the one-stop shop and its management of the entire project.  It has been suggested that there will be too much bureaucracy, as there has been in past projects.  Concerns have also been expressed that the entire cost of the home energy assessment is borne by the homeowner.  Perhaps some of this cost could be grant aided, if a project is completed.  Another possible issue is whether enough contractors with suitable workforces will be recruited.  The training of staff should not be too onerous and costly.<\/p> <p> Regarding my constituency of Clare, there are 43,348 households in the county, according to the most recent census of 2016.  Of these, 40,000, or 92%, were built before 2010, which means they were constructed to a lower level of insulation and energy conservation.  Some 93%, or just over 40,000, of these households in Clare live in a house or bungalow, while 5%, or 2,703, of households are living in houses rented from the local authority.  If we are to achieve these ambitious targets, we must front-load the process of retrofitting these homes by providing funds to the local authorities in the next two to three years.  There are 23,500 one or two-person households.  Many of these people are elderly and may need further assistance to partake in this programme.  More than half, or 25,640, of the homes in Clare are heated by oil-fired systems.  A further 15,000 homes are heated by gas, coal, or peat-fired systems.  Retrofitting these homes would lead to a dramatic reduction in Clare's carbon emissions.<\/p> <p> To review the progress of this programme, I would like to see a monthly update being provided by the SEAI.  I refer to something like what is provided in the context of the national broadband plan, NBP, in respect of the website showing information on how that project is progressing.  I would like to see similar information on retrofitting being supplied for every local authority area in the country.  The information should include the numbers at application, design and construction stages and those completed, as well as the BER rating achieved.  The framework for change has been set out.  We are now planning the work and we must endeavour to deliver on the plan.  The fewer steps we take now, the more we will have to take in future to meet our targets for 2030 and 2050.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021700042#TT00500","speaker":"1517","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645112400,"counter":377,"content":"<p>I welcome the scheme that has been presented to the House.

It is the first real tangible link that has been made for households between the carbon tax revenue and their transition, beyond the existing warmer homes scheme, and we welcome the improvements announced to that scheme as well.  I am particularly conscious of the 80% grant for works costing up to &euro;3,000 to accommodate endeavours such as attic insulation, cavity insulation and draughtproofing of windows and doors.  It is essential that an incremental option has been included for people to allow them to improve their retrofitting in a piecemeal process.  This measure can allow the achievement of initial savings of 30% in heating costs and a 25% reduction in carbon emissions.<\/p>  <p>  I am conscious there is provision within the initiative for a cross-party steering group to be established to monitor the progress of the scheme.  I ask that it be conscious of the targets being set concerning the 50% grant, which has a maximum amount set at &euro;25,000 for overall spending of &euro;50,000.  In the event of that measure not realising the ambitious outcome it seeks to achieve, I ask that there be an option for the increase in the 80% grant to a greater amount than &euro;3,000.  I ask that it be increased to perhaps &euro;6,000, &euro;7,000 or &euro;8,000 to accommodate the replacement of windows and doors.  I also ask that the Government now move to address the issue of hydrotreated vegetable oils, HVO, and for them to be classified and designated as sustainable fuels, as they are in the UK and in the North.  They are also having an impact on the reduction of emissions in households, at the expense of a couple of hundred euro spent on the alteration of oil burners.<\/p>  <p>  I again acknowledge the ambition contained in the programme for the electrification of heating and the provision of many household heat pumps.  I am also conscious, of course, that we have an energy crisis now.  Equally, I am conscious that 40% of our renewables are accounted for by land-based wind generation.  When the wind does not blow, then great pressure is placed on the system.  Wholesale energy prices rise severely in that context.  Prices are also of course impacted because of our reliance on international gas supplies.  We are aware of the pressure in that regard and the impact it is having on inflation.<\/p>  <p>  The Government should now begin the process of moving urgently towards the provision of an offshore wind supply.  The IDA should be directed to realise the ambition of harnessing the abundance of potential wind energy that is available off our shores to create what could be a European supergrid.  Off our south and east coasts, we have the potential to generate 15 GW of energy; 1 GW provides enough energy to power 750,000 homes.  We have up to 100 GW of potential energy off our west coast.  Floating turbines would make up 75% of that total.  There is potential here to generate an industry over the next 20 to 30 years which would be worth &euro;300 billion, which is the size of our economy today.  We could potentially be at the start of a pipeline providing energy.  This would be in addition to the southern parts of Europe, which have an abundance of solar power.  <\/p>  <p>  This is the sort of initiative we need to ensure we will not be sending out the message that data centres, for example, are compromising this country.  We cannot, on the one hand, be attracting the best in technological expertise and companies while, on the other hand, saying they cannot store their data in this country.

Are they doing so because they are fundamentally opposed to the idea of making their homes warmer and more energy-efficient?  Of course they are not.  These are some of the many people for whom the cost of retrofitting is prohibitively expensive and out of their reach.  This plan will be of particular benefit to people with the financial means to avail of it but it leaves out the working families and renters who are struggling to get by daily.  The way it is designed basically facilitates the transfer of wealth.  Many people in society are paying a disproportionate level of carbon tax, compared to their income, because they are unable to afford the required retrofitting.<\/p>  <p>  What are they going to get in return?  They will get far less than those with greater means, despite their contributions.  Under the Government's plans, the people with less and who are being hit hardest with the increased cost of living and fuel costs, are going to be asked to take on more debt to make their homes energy-efficient.  This is not an equitable way of rolling out this scheme.

I have been made aware of works carried out in Tipperary that another contractor has found to be substandard.  The work, which included windows and heat pumps, was signed off without the owner's consent.  The SEAI reinspected the house last October and has not done anything to help since then.  The family is now faced with spending at least &euro;20,000 to rectify the problem but has been refused any assistance by the SEAI or the original contractors.  I will contact the SEAI and the Department about this because it cannot be allowed to continue.  This is a serious issue and there must be some recourse for homeowners who are in this situation.  I would appreciate if the Minister would get in touch with us in regard to this case and to outline to the House the level of oversight that will be applied to any works carried out under this scheme in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021700043#UU00300","speaker":"1613","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645113000,"counter":380,"content":"<p>I have been interested in the significant number of over-and-back exchanges and the conversation in respect of this issue.  Even from Government benches, there has been an acceptance that there is a need to look at this scheme.  As is the case with every scheme, it is about seeing what works and what does not.  I echo what my colleagues said in that what we wanted was a scheme that was more graduated.  It seems that the serious advantages will be for those who can afford to put money on the table.  That will not apply to a significant number of people at this time because people are struggling with the cost-of-living crisis -and the cost of absolutely everything - and that relates to the cost of housing and renting.  Many have said that renters have been left out of this scheme.  We accept that steps need to be taken in the correct direction on climate change and reducing emissions.  People want to live in houses that are cheaper to heat.  Everybody accepts and wants that.  We welcome how people can improve their homes incrementally and that a second visit will not be required, which is a definite improvement.<\/p>  <p>  I refer to the attic and insulation issue.  That is something we welcome but we need to look at it further.  I know a significant number of people who would have difficulty.  Sometimes it comes down to windows and doors.  People are coming at this from different places.  I would like to think that considerable work is being done to ensure that we will have people with the necessary skill sets, that individuals are being trained, that we are considering where and when we will need them and that the actions required will be carried out.<\/p>  <p>  In Dundalk, we have major housing maintenance difficulties and an insufficient budget.  We need to revisit this issue.  It may require communication between the Department and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  We need to look at regeneration schemes that have been shelved.  We need to facilitate local authorities in carrying out more retrofitting.  We must also look at where we can get the best bang for our buck and what exactly we are trying to achieve, because sometimes deep retrofits are not necessary.  In some cases they are required.  Dunleer Sustainable Energy Community has stated that previous works it carried out on many buildings would not fit the current criteria, although it provided substantial improvements.  We need to look at and reassess these issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021700044#VV00200","speaker":"1498"},{"type":"speech","time":1645113000,"counter":381,"content":"<p>I call on Deputy O'Donoghue who has a ten-minute slot.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021700044#VV00300","speaker":"1562"},{"type":"speech","time":1645113000,"counter":382,"content":"<p>I will do my best.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021700044#VV00400","speaker":"1499"},{"type":"speech","time":1645113000,"counter":383,"content":"<p>I am sure you will.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021700044#VV00500","speaker":"1562"},{"type":"speech","time":1645113000,"counter":384,"content":"<p>I sat in on the launch of the retrofit programme with the Minister before it was announced.  Many people were there and we discussed many of the different aspects of retrofitting.  I have been involved in construction my whole life.  I know nothing but construction, bar politics.  I want to deal with the here and now.  During Leaders' Questions yesterday, I asked the Taoiseach why the cost of a barrel of oil, which was $162 in 2008 and we were paying &euro;1.30 for a litre of petrol and &euro;1.42 for a litre of diesel, while the cost of a barrel of oil in 2022 is $93 but we are paying &euro;1.64 for a litre of diesel and &euro;1.76 for a litre of petrol.  He said the reason for the rising cost of fuel in this country is due to the price of a barrel of oil.  I only received second level education but my second level education tells me that $162 minus $93 leaves $69 worth of a difference.  It costs $69 less to buy a barrel of oil now.  The problem people have is with the rising cost involved in doing the retrofitting.  There is no value for money.<\/p>  <p>  The SEAI gave a presentation on the same day as the launch.  When the SEAI representatives brought out the programme, I asked them about the example provided of a three-bed semi-detached house.  They told me that it was based on the cost of doing the house last year.  They said it would cost &euro;50,000 to carry out a retrofit on a three-bed semi-detached house.  They said it would cost the householders &euro;26,500 and they would receive a grant of &euro;23,500.  However, they forgot to mention the 17% increase in the cost of insulation since last October.  The latter drives the price of the job up while the grant stays the same.<\/p>  <p>  Since this was launched, contractors have been telling me that there will be a lot of work going on but that they have to sign up with the SEAI.  The SEAI told me it had 1,700 people who can be contacted to retrofit houses.  We asked about the type of people who would retrofit the houses, male and female, and we were told about the different trades that would be needed in certain parts of the programme.  I was very concerned when the SEAI said that the lesser end of the scale would be the people who would be doing the attic insulation.  Those were the words used.  The most important people doing the attic insulation are those whom you would want to have considerable experience.  Anyone knows that if the person doing the attic insulation does not fit it properly, it can result in the roof rotting.<\/p>  <p>  I also asked how the SEAI knows the contractor retrofitting a house is capable of doing the work.  I used an example of a house in County Limerick that was retrofitted.  Insulation was pumped into a super-warm structure, which should not be done because it causes the house to sweat.  They have tried to cover this up.  They put in a ventilation unit to take condensation out of the house.  It has not worked.  I sat in that house and saw how the walls went black.  I went to the local authority, which sent out engineer after engineer who said they were doing something wrong in the house, when, in fact, it was caused by pumping insulation into the walls of a super-warm structure during the retrofit.  This was done because of the inexperience of the people and different contractors who carried it out.<\/p>  <p>  We know there is a massive shortage of skilled trades people in this country.  This happened since 2008, when the Celtic tiger economy crashed.  Following this, people attended third level and went to other places because there was no work in the construction industry at the time.  We have a ten-year gap that was caused by people not returning to the trades.  When we were hit by Covid, people who were working in the trades on jobs that were closed down, went on to work in factories and different areas.  People left the sector for jobs in which they can work from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. or 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. and because they wanted to get in out of the weather.  Many people left construction and now we are seeking to retrofit houses from the autumn of this year.<\/p> <p>There is another increase in the price of insulation and labour this month.  There will be one next month and the month after.  The costings on retrofitting are not going to be value for money until things equalise out.<\/p> <p> Two people in a household who are working are the worst-off people in the country at the moment.  They are trying to make ends meet.  They do not qualify for anything.  They have to pay for everything.  The worst off in this country are the working-class people.  Those who are not working get something and qualify for different things.  Those who are working and are &euro;2 over the threshold get nothing, no reliefs.  These are the same people who are trying to feed their children, pay a mortgage or pay rent.  If they have only one person working in the house, it is the same scenario.  They are the worst-off.  The only people this will benefit are those who have the extra cash reserves whereby they can do this themselves or those who will get it done through their local authorities.  The officials in Limerick City and County Council said they are only going to retrofit 60 this year out of 5,347.  That is their target.  They know they do not have the labour to deal with the issues that are going to be in front of them.<\/p> <p> We have people being told false information that it was the price of a barrel of oil that was driving up the price of fuel.  In 2008, it was $69 dearer to buy a barrel of oil; we are paying less for oil now.  We are now going to tell people the truth that it is carbon tax, taxes, VAT and customs and excise that are driving the price of fuel up.  It is nothing else.  While we need a certain amount of it, do we need the amount the Government is taking?  Since 2020, the Government has been taking in &euro;8 billion a year of an increase on the tax on fuel because it is using a percentage model.  There is the barrel of oil, the Government puts on its percentage.  That is the system.  I have asked why the Government cannot reduce the price of fuel and it is saying it cannot.  It has just said so.  It is using the money it has to do a retrofit scheme to put more pressure on a system that is all oil based, to retrofit houses.<\/p> <p> The Government is squeezing the population and 1 million people are below the poverty line.  It is squeezing them because of the way it is taxing them.  I am asking this be addressed now.  A barrel of oil cost $162 dollars in 2008 and costs $93 now.  The Government must give the people a chance to breathe.  Yes, we need to retrofit but people today need to live and feed their families.  They cannot save.  They are lucky to make their rent.  Let us look outside the box and see that we can help everyone, not only those who are in the local authority houses.  We need to help the people who are working class as well.  They cannot afford to do a retrofit because the rising cost is too much.  I am asking for the Government to look at all people in this country and help them now, not in the future, saying that we need to do this.  I want the Government to give me a commitment that it will look at all people and if there are couples who are in a financial position that they cannot retrofit, even though both of them are working, they need to be helped more.  The people who qualify; that is fine.  The people who have the money to do it, well, they have the money to do it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021700044#VV00600","speaker":"1499","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645113600,"counter":386,"content":"<p>I think this is an energy upgrade scheme, as distinct from a retrofit scheme.  I raised this in the D&aacute;il with the Minister on 20 January.  My issue at that time was the anomaly whereby someone on the free energy upgrade scheme was only entitled to apply once.  Someone who might have applied prior to 2018, before double-glazed windows were part of the scheme, could not apply a second time after the windows had been included in the scheme.  That has now been rectified, which I very much welcome.  Now under the free energy upgrade, which was previously known as the warmer homes scheme, people who applied before 2018 can apply again to get the double-glazed windows.  That is a huge factor for people.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the fact that the Government is looking at increasing the numbers who would get the free energy upgrade scheme, which I will call the warmer homes scheme, to 400 per month from 177 per month in 2021, and that it is going to look to double the number of upgrades.  It needs to be looked at even more carefully on a number of levels.  This particular launch states that looking at houses and upgrading them for energy is a central plank of our climate action plan.  It reduces the cost for the homeowner.  It clearly advances the agenda of getting our carbon footprint down and meeting our carbon targets.  <\/p>  <p>  I have a number of suggestions.  There is a 26-month waiting time on the warmer homes scheme.  While I know we are doubling the numbers we are going to deal with per month, I ask that this be looked at again to see if we can expedite it even more.  I refer to what is available across all the schemes.  The warmer homes scheme or free energy upgrade scheme is the free upgrade scheme and people have to be in receipt of the fuel allowance or other social welfare payments to qualify for it.  Then we have the better energy homes scheme, which is a grant scheme for individual houses; and the one-stop shop scheme.  The difference between them is that under the better energy homes scheme, the applicant picks a contractor and does the work, and does not necessarily have to reach a B2 rating.  With the one-stop shop scheme, which is more comprehensive, the SEAI deals with it from cradle to grave.  It appoints a contractor and the property reaches a B2 rating.  We need to make certain across the three schemes that the same measures are available.  Certainly looking at it, they are slightly different, not significantly different.  It may be something to look at.<\/p>  <p>  Some 80% of the cost is going to be made available for attic and cavity wall insulation.  We need to find a way that we can fast-track this.  That is the grant scheme.  It does not place a huge burden on people.  If they are going for more to get to the B2 rating, the costs involved are going to be up to about 50%.  If the Government could fast-track that scheme, more people could get on it and it could make a significant difference in the context of rising energy prices when it comes to reducing costs for those who are under financial pressure.<\/p> <p>Is there a way to fast-track the element of the scheme in question in order that the cost will not be prohibitive and people can get their attic insulation and cavity walls done?  Afterwards, when they feel they can afford it, they can opt for the other measures for which they will get a grant of only 50%.  That would be a practical measure.<\/p> <p> Overall, this is a welcome scheme.  It is a question of take-up and delivery.  Fundamentally, we need to determine how we can get the craftsmen to do the work.  That is a big challenge.  A body of work is under way in this regard.  For me, the anomalies are now gone from the free scheme, which is important and which means that people can apply twice.  It means everyone will now get access to the double-glazed windows.  An applicant before 2018 would not have been able to do so.  This is very relevant.  There should be consistency in respect of measures available across all schemes, including the free scheme, the two grant schemes, the one-stop-shop scheme and the warmer homes scheme.<\/p> <p> Personnel must be in place to deliver on the scheme.  I want to see the waiting times for the free scheme coming down, if possible.  The Minister of State needs to find a way to fast-track the scheme for insulation and the scheme for cavity walls.  I am not certain whether those with the necessary skills in this area are more available than others.  I will follow up on this with the Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021700045#WW00200","speaker":"1593","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645114200,"counter":388,"content":"<p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it.

Beidh pr&aacute;inn ann &oacute; thaobh an one-stop shop.  Sin an rud is m&oacute; anois.<\/p>  <p>  I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth, for the work he has put into this scheme.  It has been worked on quite comprehensively in recent months.  The most important thing now is to get the tendering sorted for the one-stop shop.  Already our offices are receiving calls from people who were involved in previous schemes, including insulation schemes.  They have the information but do not have the authority to give accurate information because they need to go through a tendering process.  That is critical.<\/p>  <p>  There is another element that also needs to be considered.  It concerns those in receipt of domiciliary care and the carer&rsquo;s allowance, who would qualify for the scheme.  However, there is an issue with the BER.  There is an anomaly whereby those whose houses have a C rating will not qualify; I think it has to be a D rating.  The anomaly lies in the fact that many of the houses would have got their attics and walls insulated.  It is important that they not be precluded from the 80% grant owing to the showing of initiative in recent years.  Even though the windows and back door may be hanging off, the BER will be a key consideration if we are not to discriminate against people who find themselves in this position.<\/p>  <p>  On another issue I wish to raise, could the Minister of State clarify the position?  The original criterion referred to houses built before 2006 but the year has now been changed to 1993.  That will affect many houses.<\/p>  <p>  I presume we are ready to roll out the tender process for the one-stop shop.  It must be initiated as a matter of priority.<\/p>  <p>  May I raise the issue of the mica scheme, which I realise I will be raising in the next hour as a topical issue?  There is a great opportunity to incorporate the retrofit scheme into the schemes for houses with mica and pyrite.  Many of these houses were built in the past couple of decades.  If the householders did not have a problem with mica, they would be going out to replace their windows and doors.  There is a hard-to-believe argument that the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications is trying to push for people to build houses under the old criteria, or the 2007 standards.  The 50 mm of insulation required in 2007 has changed to 100 mm.  Expecting homeowners who are to rebuild their houses or do the outer leaf to go back to 2007 standards does not make any construction sense or common sense.  There is a way of assimilating the retrofit scheme into the mica scheme to cover circumstances where you are building a new house or replacing the outer leaf.  I appreciate that the Minister of State, Deputy Malcolm Noonan, and the Minister, Deputy Darragh O&rsquo;Brien, have set up a working group to investigate this issue.  What needs to come out of that is that we do not impose unnecessary bureaucracy on the mica homeowners, who are going through a very difficult time dealing with the stress.  We need to give them a win such that the equivalent of whatever they would get under a retrofit scheme if their house did not have mica would be made available to them, without the bureaucracy, hardship and frustration associated with having different rules for different Departments.  We are looking for collaboration and cross-government support on this issue.  I realise I will be getting into this in more detail in the next hour with the Minister of State, Deputy Malcolm Noonan.<\/p>  <p>  Ar&iacute;s, gabhaim aitheantas don Rialtas f&aacute; choinne na sc&eacute;ime seo.

If the very ambitious targets are achieved, it will make a huge difference to energy bills and people&rsquo;s health and reduce carbon emissions.  However, there are serious questions as to how the target of retrofitting 50,000 to 70,000 homes per year will be met and how the target of retrofitting 500,000 homes can be met.<\/p>  <p>  Despite the grant of up to 50% of the cost of a deep retrofit, there is a genuine issue with requiring homeowners on low to moderate incomes to come up with &euro;20,000 to &euro;25,000 from their own resources to avail of the scheme.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to local authority housing, last year local authorities were given the rather modest target of upgrading 2,400 homes under the energy efficiency retrofitting programme and the midlands retrofit programme.  However, just 1,500 properties were retrofitted, with the remaining 900 to be completed by the middle of this year, they hope.  The latest Housing for All progress report attributed the significant delays to the pandemic, citing &ldquo;reduced capacity in the construction sector and related COVID-19 protocols for surveyors and contractors, given the homes retrofitted under these programmes are occupied&rdquo;.  However, that is not the only reason for the hold-up.  A report from Dublin City Council to its housing committee has stated that, with funding at the current rate, it will take 12 years to carry out its retrofitting programme.  I am sure that is replicated across the country.  The meeting was a special policy committee meeting.  Those concerned were advised to have the information in writing.<\/p>  <p>  The second issue is the construction industry&rsquo;s ability to carry out the works to a high standard.<\/p> <p>There are serious questions about an industry with poor regulation that is dominated by subcontracting and awash with bogus self-employment.  Of 100,000 apartments, almost two out of every three built in the Celtic tiger years had serious defects, such as fire safety issues, leaking roofs and balconies.  As highlighted earlier, 40 schools built by the same construction company all had serious defects which cost the State &euro;1 million each to rectify.  It seems to me that there are a lot of builders with the first name Gerry operating in the industry.  Shoddy building work, a lack of qualifications, zero numbers in apprenticeships in many trades and a lack of upskilling are a consequence of the shift from direct employment to the casualisation of construction work.  Construction firms are employing five subcontractors for every one tradesperson who is directly employed.  The industry now claims there is a shortage of 27,000 workers to meet existing demand before the retrofit plan even gets under way.  The consequences for the wet trades most relevant to retrofitting, that is, bricklaying, floor and wall tiling, painting, decorating and plastering, have been dire.  Between 2012 and 2020 there were no apprentice floor and wall tilers registered in Ireland.  In 2020, members of the Construction Industry Federation were employing, as tilers, zero apprentices, 50 people with full-time jobs and 693 causal subcontractors.  <\/p> <p> There was a long-established tradition of family involvement in certain building trades, such as bricklaying, plastering, carpentry, etc., but if you talk to construction workers today, very few would advocate their trade to their children.  Why would they, when they are forced into self-employment with fewer rights, poor conditions and no security of employment?  The Joint Oireachtas Committee on Social Protection, Community and Rural Development and the Islands produced a report on bogus self-employment, which, I must say, has received a good response from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  However, there needs to be a speedy implementation of the proposals in the report.  That would be a good start towards the necessary reform of the industry required to make it fit for purpose.  A failure to reform the industry could well result in the national retrofit programme becoming the pyrite and mica scandal of the future.  To come back to the issue of affordability, the proposed loan fund is welcome and is a recognition that large numbers of households will struggle to avail of the scheme.  The Minister, in his opening remarks, made great play of the number of inquiries from the general public in relation to the scheme.  Of course, given the huge increases in energy prices and the general cost of living, people will be interested in a scheme that will cut their energy costs.  However, inquiring about the scheme and having the wherewithal to avail of it are two separate things.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021700046#XX00300","speaker":"1569","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645114800,"counter":391,"content":"<p>I welcome the statements made today by Members of the House.  The changes announced by Government last week represent the most significant reform of the SEAI schemes since their establishment.  However, these supports are just part of our overall national retrofit plan and I would like to take this opportunity to highlight some other aspects.  As mentioned by the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, the national retrofit plan was published in November 2021 and it sets out the Government strategy for meeting our 2030 retrofit targets.  The plan is designed to address barriers to retrofit across four key pillars: driving demand and activity; financing and funding; supply chain skills; and standards and governance.  Successful implementation of the plan depends on ensuring that effective policy action is taken and balanced progress is made under each pillar simultaneously.  For instance, there is little point in driving demand when the supply chain is not sufficiently developed to satisfy this demand.  For that reason, developing the retrofit supply chain and workforce will be a key priority this year.  Building up capacity in the sector from the current levels to a point where it can deliver approximately 75,000 home energy upgrades per year will require the right initiatives to stimulate and support the market to invest and attract new entrants.<\/p><p>The national retrofit plan has already provided certainty to the sector in terms of the commitment by Government to support residential and community retrofit.  The budget of &euro;8 billion and clarity on the annual allocations to the end of the decade will provide confidence to the sector to grow due to the resulting large and stable pipeline of work that it will support.  The commencement of new SEAI grant schemes and the expansion of the local authority retrofit programme will also allow year-round working.  This, in itself, will greatly increase the capacity of the sector to deliver increased numbers of retrofits because it will transform a six-month industry into a year-round industry.  I expect that the range of measures in the national retrofit plan will encourage new entrants to the retrofit market, as well as incentivising existing market players to grow.  However, new and expanding businesses in the retrofit sector can face challenges as they expand.  For that reason, the SEAI will work with these businesses to encourage them to avail of the range of supports available though the local enterprise offices, LEOs, including financial supports, training programmes and mentoring.  <\/p><p>As the retrofit industry transforms to accommodate much higher levels of output, the quality must be maintained at a high level to sustain customer confidence and demand.  Standards and the existing quality management model will need to evolve to cope with a much greater scale of activity.  For that reason, new standards and guidance documents will be introduced.  This includes the publication of new guidance for the retrofitting of traditional buildings, as well as a certification scheme for energy efficiency retrofit of dwellings.  The network of one-stop shops will also play a central role in maintaining and enhancing the quality of retrofits delivered.  <\/p><p>I will now turn to the issue of retrofit careers.  Retrofitting homes is a highly labour-intensive sector.  As such, it has the potential to produce high-quality sustainable jobs in local communities throughout the country.  The report of the expert group on future skills needs, which was published at the end of last year, indicates that we need to increase the number of full-time equivalent workers in the sector from 4,000 to 17,000 by the middle of the decade.  This points to the substantial number of career opportunities in the green economy and the important role that retrofit will play in our economic growth and development.  Crucially, my colleague, the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, has provided &euro;22 million for the green skills action programme this year, and &euro;17 million of this budget provision relates to the retrofit and the nZEB skills expansion.  That will provide for an additional 2,660 places, bringing the total number of places to 4,550 by the end of 2022.  The Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science is also supporting two retrofit centres of excellence, with three more to be in place later this year.  This will further enhance upskilling and reskilling capacity.  The Action Plan for Apprenticeship 2021 to 2025 provides a roadmap to a single apprenticeship system that will fully embed apprenticeship as a mainstream route to skills development for employers and prospective apprentices.  A number of apprenticeships have also developed and transitioned elements of their programmes to include provisions for green skills.  The target of doubling annual apprentice registrations to 10,000 new registrations by 2025 provides a clear opportunity to support the development of the skill sets necessary around the retrofit industry.  Figures show that the apprenticeship population has increased to 24,212, with a record 8,607 new registrations in 2021.  In November 2021, the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science announced enhancements to the CAO website to include further education and apprenticeship options for school leavers.  There will also be information and guidance on national apprenticeships on <i>cao.ie<\/i>, with information on how to become an apprentice, what you will learn while you learn, and the qualifications that you will achieve.  These enhancements to the CAO website ensure that school leavers will have improved visibility of all their options and pathways, including further education and training and apprenticeships provided by the 16 education and training boards, ETBs.  <\/p><p>I will now turn to the private rental sector.  In line with the design principles of fairness and universality, there is a need to ensure that all housing types and consumer cohorts can participate.  Specific measures to stimulate retrofit activity among households vulnerable to energy poverty, approved housing bodies and in the private rented sector were included in the package of measures announced by Government last week.  The residential rental sector poses a particular challenge.  In this sector, the incentives to invest in energy upgrades are misaligned between landlords and tenants.  This impacts negatively on the energy performance of the sector.  It is a complex problem that is seen in many countries, and is referred to as the split incentive.  In order to address the issue, non-corporate landlords are eligible for the new grant supports under the national home energy upgrade scheme, the better energy homes scheme and the community energy grant scheme.  It is intended that non-corporate landlords will be able to avail of the planned low-cost loan scheme for retrofit when it is announced later this year.  <\/p> <p>A further key step associated with addressing this issue will be the introduction of a minimum building energy rating requirement for rental properties.  The Housing for All strategy, which is being led by the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, includes a commitment to introduce this requirement from 2025.  Collectively, these measures will mean the national housing stock is upgraded and tenants get lower energy bills and a more comfortable place to live.<\/p> <p> My Department will be working with the SEAI to separately consider the best approach to dealing with apartment buildings that are multi-unit buildings with common areas, rather than individual units.  This will be investigated in 2022 to consider approaches to support whole-building solutions.  I note that grants are now available to apartment dwellers on the website of the SEAI.  That is another innovation in the recent announcement. <\/p> <p> Approximately 36,500 local authority homes will be retrofitted in the next decade under the local authority retrofit programme.  This programme of work will not only benefit local authorities in assisting them to upgrade and maintain their housing stock, it will also directly benefit householders with an enhanced level of comfort and lower fuel costs.  In 2022, the energy efficiency retrofitting programme will see approximately 2,400 local authority homes nationally being upgraded to a B2 or equivalent standard, with a significant increase in funding to support local authorities to &euro;85 million.<\/p> <p> Some Deputies claimed the new plan fails to address the backlog in the Better Energy, Warmer Homes scheme.  However, the number of homes being addressed under the scheme is doubling.  It was 177 per month but is moving to 400 per month.  This will reduce the number in the backlog.  It is to be prioritised towards those with homes in categories E, F or G, but those who are already waiting will not be taken off the waiting list.  The list will be shorter as a result of these actions and people will get their upgrades sooner.<\/p> <p> It was stated by some Deputies that this is a massive transfer of wealth to richer homes and that it is unfair.  In fact, 58% of the &euro;352 million that has been allocated in the budget for this year is to go towards people who are either local authority tenants or living on welfare payments.  <\/p> <p> A Deputy claimed that only ten deep retrofits were carried out in 2021.  However, the numbers I presented to the Select Committee on Environment, Climate and Communications last week are that 4,600 B2 deep retrofits were completed last year.  This year, we expect to complete 8,600 deep retrofits to B2.<\/p> <p> Deputy McHugh asked about the mica scheme.  The retrofit scheme will be available to those with mica homes.  The two schemes will work together.  That is confirmed and the Deputy can contact my office for further information in that regard.<\/p> <p> As outlined, the Government has set ambitious targets for Ireland for the end of this decade.  These include almost halving greenhouse gas emissions from the residential sector by 2030, upgrading almost one third of the building stock to a building energy rating of B2 or a cost-optimal or carbon equivalent and installing 400,000 heat pumps in existing homes to replace older and less efficient heating systems.  This represents one of the most ambitious retrofit programmes worldwide and, for that reason, the implementation of the national retrofit plan and the new measures announced by the Government last week will be grounded in robust governance, oversight and evaluation.  A cross-departmental steering group will be established in the coming weeks and chaired by the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications.  This group will oversee and monitor progress against our national targets and develop new initiatives as required.

My experience of the process has been shocking, to be honest.  I have been dealing with a case in which, one year later, the person making a protected disclosure is still waiting for anything to happen.  Complaints were made to the Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Council, the HSE, the Health and Safety Authority, public health and HIQA, yet not one of these groups would take the case because a private Covid-19 testing centre had no statutory body looking after it.  I will give a brief overview of what was disclosed to the health committee through a protected disclosure process.  The disclosures included hazardous waste being stored incorrectly, staff failing to change personal protective equipment, PPE, face masks being worn after excessive use, a lack of cleaning equipment for swabbing areas, staff using hand sanitiser instead of changing gloves, a lack of general PPE, toilets not being cleaned properly, swabbing bays not being sanitised periodically and laboratory staff collecting kits from dirty swabbing areas.  It goes on and on.  The list was endless.  This person was horrified by the conditions within the testing centre.  I set the process in place and we sent emails and made the connections.  One year later, we still have had absolutely no word back in respect of that protected disclosure.<\/p>  <p>  I struggled to figure out what I was supposed to do and with whom I was supposed to connect, so Members can imagine what it would be like for a member of the public to try to figure out how you do this.  One of the really important pieces of the Bill is in section 9, which inserts a new section 6A, dealing with internal reporting channels and procedures, into the principal Act.  I absolutely welcome the establishment of channels for receiving reports.  This will ensure there is a designated person with whom one can connect and who will be able to support the person making the disclosure through the process.  The designated person will be able to go back and look at the evidence and try to collate all of that to help the person make the protected disclosure.<\/p>  <p>  I like the fact that an acknowledgement has to issue with seven days.  As I stated, we are a year down the road in the case I mentioned.  I connected with the person today and it is about six or seven months since the last connection was made in that regard.  The designation of a person is essential to ensure no disclosure falls through the cracks.  I welcome the establishment of the office to co-ordinate the protected disclosures process, as well as the fact that a person making a protected disclosure will have a designated person who will decide whether there is merit in the claim.<\/p>  <p>  This is really important legislation.  It will be amended as time goes on.  It is so important because persons making a protected disclosure are putting their job, and sometimes their career, at risk.  They are not just risking the job they are in; in some cases they will also be risking their career or that pathway because some areas of employment are very small and everybody knows one another.  If persons making a protected disclosure do not have that support, they feel completely and utterly isolated.<\/p> <p>The reason we have these protected disclosures is that we hear of these incidents, like the one I have outlined, which was a catalogue of horrendous failures by a company providing a very important testing service during the Covid-19 pandemic.  We were relying on those data, information and people to do their job properly, to be open, to be honest and to ensure that all of the data being processed was correct and safe.  Unfortunately, it was not.  <\/p> <p> This is very important legislation and I look forward to it being implemented.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021700048#ZZ01300","speaker":"1476","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645116000,"counter":406,"content":"<p>The Minister has asked me to thank Members for an informed and thoughtful discussion.  He is grateful for the broad support the Bill has received.  While he expects there will be some areas where we will have to agree to disagree, he also thinks there are opportunities here for all of us to work together to make this Bill as good as it can be.<\/p><p>Before I respond on his behalf to some of the specific issues raised in the debate, he and I would like to acknowledge in particular those contributions that highlighted specific cases of workers who have suffered the worst consequences for doing little more than follow their conscience and try to right a wrong.  It makes for uncomfortable listening but is a stark reminder to us all of the necessity for this legislation.  It is by listening to the lived experiences of these brave people that we can face up to and learn from the mistakes and injustices of the past and do our best to do right by those who will find themselves in similar positions in the future. <\/p><p>Turning now to some of the specific issues raised, understandably, a number of Deputies raised concerns about missing the transposition deadline.  The Minister very much regrets that this legislation has not been enacted on time.  It is essential, however, that a Bill of such importance as this is done correctly as the consequences for whistleblowers when legislation intended to protect them fails to work as expected can be devastating.  Many examples of this were given during the debate last night.<\/p><p>Deputy Michael Collins asked about fines arising from infringement proceedings.  We will face infringement proceedings for failing to meet the transposition deadline and a notification from the EU has been received to this effect.  The precise form such sanctions will take are not yet known.  The publication of the Bill and its reading in the House this week shows that Ireland is serious about transposing the directive and is making progress in this regard. <\/p><p>Deputy Mair&eacute;ad Farrell and others raised concerns about the cap on awards that applies to complaints of penalisation made to the WRC.  There are statutory caps on awards that can be made at the WRC under sections 11 and 12 of the principal Act but not on any awards the High Court may make if a person pursues a tort action under section 13.  The maximum that the WRC can award under the Act is five times an employee&rsquo;s annual salary.  This compares with the norm of twice salary in ordinary grievance cases and reflects the special status the Act gives to whistleblowers. <\/p><p>The Supreme Court took into consideration the fact that the WRC is limited in the amounts of compensation it can award when it considered the constitutionality of the WRC in the Zalewski case last year.  The Minister is advised that, taking into account the Supreme Court&rsquo;s ruling in this case, it is not possible to allow the WRC to award unlimited amounts of compensation.  It is in effect a body of local and limited jurisdiction like the District and Circuit Courts.  If a person suffers such serious consequences that the maximum award available at the WRC is not sufficient to repair the harm done, they should instead make a claim for damages under section 13 of the Act, where there are no limits if the case is brought before the High Court. <\/p><p>Many Deputies have raised the matter of the threshold of 50 employees that applies to the obligation to have internal reporting channels.  Implementing the requirements as regards internal reporting channels will create a compliance burden for industry.  The European Commission&rsquo;s impact assessment of the directive estimates that the costs for a typical small to medium-sized enterprise, SME, would be more than &euro;1,000 annually.<\/p><p>Blanket imposition of the requirement to have internal channels to all employers would be disproportionate, particularly given the impact of the pandemic and Brexit on the SME sector in Ireland and could be unworkable in many situations, such as microenterprises, for example.  It is hard to see what benefit there is in imposing these elaborate requirements on the local sweet shop, on a plumber and his apprentice or, indeed, on a Deputy's constituency office.  It could also create a compliance burden for some voluntary or member-led organisations with a small cohort of employees, particularly in the areas of sport, heritage and the arts.  <\/p><p>The Minister recognises, however, that some sectors involved in certain high-risk activities could benefit from being subject to this requirement.  Deputy Cronin raised a concern about the application of this threshold to the financial services industry.  In this regard, the directive and, therefore, the Bill, provide that the 50 employee threshold does not apply in the areas of financial services, aviation safety, and oil and gas safety. <\/p><p>A number of submissions from regulators during the public consultation on the general scheme of the Bill identified other areas where there may be benefits in lowering or abolishing the threshold.  The Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg, for example, suggested that operators of premium rate phone lines should be put within the scope of this requirement.  A number of suggestions were also made at the pre-legislative scrutiny hearings regarding certain accountancy firms and some technology firms.  Deputy Shortall mentioned certain smaller companies that handle very large volumes of personal data.  <\/p><p>There may be merit to these suggestions.  For this reason the Bill provides for a regulation making power to lower or remove the threshold for certain firms or categories of firms subject to a risk assessment and a public consultation.  It is the Minister&rsquo;s view that this targeted approach towards certain high-risk activities is fairer and more reasonable than a blanket lowering or, indeed, an abolition of the threshold.<\/p><p>I should also clarify in this regard comments by Deputies Nash and Shortall that the protection that applies to a worker who reports to their employer applies, just as it always has, regardless of the size of the organisation or whether that organisation has internal reporting channels.  The obligation on some employers to have internal channels and procedures is an administrative requirement separate from the right of workers to report wrongdoing to their employer. <\/p><p>On the scope of the Bill, Deputy Shortall raised a concern about the exclusion of interpersonal grievances.  The purpose of the Protected Disclosures Act, as set out in its Long Title, is to protect persons making &ldquo;certain disclosures in the public interest&rdquo;. Similarly, the directive states that its purpose is to provide for the protection of persons who report breaches of EU law that are harmful to the public interest.  Matters of private interest, such as personal grievances between a worker and their employer or a co-worker, lie outside of the scope of this legislation. <\/p><p>This is not to say that personal grievances are not important but we must recognise that such matters are to a large extent protected by the significant corpus of employment law, much of which existed for many decades before the Protected Disclosures Act.  It was never the intention that the Act should be an alternative avenue for the airing of personal grievances but in practice there have been some problems in this area.  <\/p><p>This issue has now been cast into sharp relief by the judgment of the Supreme Court last December in the case of Baranya <i>v.<\/i>Rosderra Meats.  The court agreed that the intent of the protected disclosures legislation was to protect persons who report wrongdoing in the public interest but found that the Act, as worded, allowed for a broader interpretation that included private grievances.  In his ruling in the Baranya case, Mr. Justice Charleton states that the wording of the Act &quot;does not conform with what the ordinary understanding of the protection of whistleblowers requires and, furthermore, it may not be sensible&quot;  The Minister agrees and, accordingly, is providing in this Bill under section 6, by way of the insertion of a new section 5A into the principal Act that a matter is not a protected disclosure if it solely affects the reporting person and no other person. <\/p><p>Of course, the Minister recognises that there are situations where the line between a protected disclosure and a personal grievance can be blurred.  The wording of this provision is important, so that it is not interpreted too widely and that reports of matters that may be genuinely harmful to the public interest are not ignored.  In this regard, the wording of this provision in the Bill means that an isolated incident of, for example, bullying between a manager and an employee would be a private interest and not, therefore, be a protected disclosure and would be dealt with under employment law.  However, a report or a series of reports that suggested a wider culture of workplace bullying in the organisation would be protected disclosures.<\/p><p>Staying with the scope of the Bill, Deputy Mair&eacute;ad Farrell also mentioned the application of the legislation to journalists.  The inclusion of third parties within the scope of section 13 of the 2014 Act provides protections for facilitators and other persons such as friends, relatives, business partners and co-workers of the reporting person, and should include any retaliatory action taken against a journalist who assists a reporting person.<\/p> <p> Deputy Boyd Barrett asked about the availability of statistics regarding protected disclosures.  My officials will provide the Deputy with the information they have as regards the numbers of protected disclosures made in the public sector and on the number of cases heard in the WRC and the courts, as well as statistics on the number of calls made to Transparency International's helpline and the number of clients it has assisted.<\/p> <p> Deputy Mair&eacute;ad Farrell and her colleagues also mentioned supports, including legal aid, for whistleblowers.  There is no entitlement in Irish law to legal aid for persons who take cases to the WRC, but it is possible to access civil legal aid in cases before the courts.  However, the thresholds are low, at a disposable income of less than &euro;18,000 per annum.  It should be noted that, in general, the private solicitors market deals with most civil litigation and cases with merit are accommodated through conditional fee arrangements, such as no foal, no fee.  Although it does not provide the full suite of services that might be available through legal aid, the Exchequer does fund Transparency Ireland to provide free legal advice to workers who have made protected disclosures or are contemplating reporting.  It is not the Minister&rsquo;s intention to make any changes to our existing legal aid rules at this time.  Deputies will be aware, however, that the Minister for Justice has launched a review of the civil legal aid system and it is in that context that the Minister believes this issue can be given further consideration.<\/p> <p> The provision of mental health supports is a discretionary option under the directive.  Currently only a few countries, such as the Netherlands and Norway, provide such supports.  As raised at pre-legislative scrutiny, the referral of a person for counselling or other mental health treatments is a means by which whistleblowers can be penalised and can be used to call into question their state of mind.  There is a need, therefore, to be careful in how such services are presented to and accessed by whistleblowers.  The Minister thinks further research into what could be provided in this area is needed, which could help inform consideration of future initiatives in this area.<\/p> <p> Finally, I refer to the question of the retrospective application of the Bill, which many Deputies raised as a concern.  I will restate what the Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, said in his opening statement.  He is open to making some provision to address how protected disclosures made prior to this Bill coming into effect should be treated.  A number of questions on this matter have been referred to the Attorney General for advice.<\/p> <p> In conclusion, strong legislation is an important component in any ecosystem designed to support and protect whistleblowers.  However, it is also crucial to have the right organisational culture that will encourage workers to speak up without fear of reprisal.  This will do more than any legislation, policies or procedures to support and protect whistleblowers.  Driving cultural change in organisations is challenging.  The House will be aware of the initiatives that are ongoing within the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, across sectors and across the civil and public service.  These initiatives are aligned to support public bodies in their development to be modern, fit-for-purpose and inclusive organisations which support their staff in delivering efficient and effective public policies and services.  The Minister and I thank all Members for their involvement in this debate and we look forward to the further deliberations on Committee Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021700049#AAA00300","speaker":"1479","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1645116600,"counter":408,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Protected Disclosures (Amendment) Bill 2022: Referral to Select Committee","time":1645116600,"counter":409,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021700050#BBB00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1645116600,"counter":410,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThat the Bill be referred to the Select Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach pursuant to Standing Orders 95(3)(a) and 181(1). <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021700050#BBB00400","speaker":"1479"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1645116600,"counter":411,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Saincheisteanna Tr\u00e1th\u00fala - Topical Issue Debate","time":1645116600,"counter":412,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021700050#BBB00600"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Defective Building Materials","time":1645116600,"counter":413,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021700050#BBB00700"},{"type":"speech","time":1645116600,"counter":414,"content":"<p>Ba mhaith liom aitheantas a thabhairt don Aire St&aacute;it as a dh&iacute;ograis agus a thiomantas maidir leis an sc&eacute;im seo.  Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas freisin leis an Aire, an Teachta Darragh O'Brien, as a thiomantas.  I welcome the Minister of State.  It is our fourth time to discuss this Topical Issue.  I will make five points and perhaps when I make my next contribution I will be able to elaborate on them.<\/p>  <p>  The first point is that facilitators are needed on the ground in Donegal with immediate effect to disseminate information and to fill a communication gap that exists at present, which is very difficult for homeowners.  They are trying to navigate their way through this torture.  It is a torture, and it is continuing.  That is important.  Ms Ann Owens of the Mica Working Group has been very consistent on this appeal.  Commitments were made last summer.  The Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, mentioned the outreach from the Housing Agency that is in operation, but people need to see this happening and to see people on the ground with immediate effect.<\/p>  <p>  Second, I was delighted to hear the comments of the Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth, regarding the retrofit scheme.  We have talked about this off-campus as well.  While I welcome the retrofit scheme being assimilated into the mica scheme, it is very important that we do not add another layer of bureaucracy to what is already a quagmire in some people's eyes, making it impossible to pedal their way through this scheme.  If the retrofit scheme is going to be done in unison, let us work into it that it is not an extra agency or Department trying to seek different rules and criteria.  This has to be part of the one scheme.<\/p>  <p>  The third point I wish to raise is the homeowners who have paid the engineering fees.  On the last occasion, I mentioned a mother and daughter in Donegal who have taken out a loan of &euro;12,000 from the credit union.  That is a lot of money.  The mother is not earning and is on a pension while the daughter is a carer, so they do not have money to pay back this finance.  Basically, that money has to be paid back as a matter of urgency.<\/p>  <p>  The 17% holding back on the payment is too high.  In fact, some people believe it is actually as high as 25%.  It has to be reduced, and I know there are conversations to that effect taking place.  It is important that this is addressed as a matter of priority.<\/p>  <p>  The point of raising this matter tonight with regard to the Society of Chartered Surveyors of Ireland, SCSI, is that I believe the Department made an error in what it did over two weeks ago.  It drew up the terms of reference in consultation with the SCSI but did not include the voice of the homeowners.  That was a mistake.  It has eroded confidence in a process that is already at a very vulnerable level.  It has really got the homeowners' backs up that they were not part of that as well.  I know this has been addressed in terms of trying to have a better stakeholder representation, but the danger here is, with the SCSI feeding into the Department on the terms of reference, whether that door is closed or ajar for the homeowners, who incidentally are meeting with the SCSI today.  Can they still have their voice heard and be part of the terms of reference?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021700050#BBB00800","speaker":"1548"},{"type":"speech","time":1645116600,"counter":415,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Teachta as an gceist seo a ard&uacute;.  We have discussed this previously and I will try to address some, if not all, of the issues the Deputy raised and, perhaps in closing, the retrofit part of it specifically.<\/p>  <p>  Again, I thank the Deputy for consistently raising this issue on behalf of his constituents.  It is critical that we get it right for the communities that are affected by this.  The Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien brought a memorandum to the Government on an enhanced defective concrete blocks scheme on 30 November 2021.  It included an unprecedented suite of improvements to the current scheme which removed the financial barrier to entry to the scheme by simplifying and streamlining the application process, increased the grants available from 90% to 100% of allowable costs and the maximum grant level from &euro;247,500 to &euro;420,000, provided for a second grant in certain circumstances, introduced an independent appeals process and strengthened the certificate of remediation available to homeowners.<\/p> <p> The Government approved the enhanced scheme, which is estimated to come in at approximately &euro;2.2 billion.  The revised grant calculation methodology will be based on the size of the existing home using a cost per sq. m.  Up-to-date construction costs are an important consideration in this regard.  Accordingly, the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland has agreed to produce a report on up-to-date construction costs for the type of remediation works carried out under the scheme on a variety of home types under the defective concrete blocks scheme.  The SCSI will be independent in its work but in the interest of fairness, it has engaged with the Department on the matter and has agreed to hear a submission from homeowners on construction costs in the north west.  This relates to the final point the Deputy made.  The specific grant rates that will be implemented will be set by the Department after the SCSI provides its independent advice.  Construction costs in the SCSI report will be reviewed annually to reflect construction cost changes.  They are changing rapidly as we are all aware.<\/p> <p> In relation to implementation of the enhanced scheme, the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, recently wrote to the PRO of the Mica Action Group on these matters updating him on work undertaken to date in regard to implementation of the enhanced scheme.  It is important that homeowners have the opportunity to engage on implementation of the scheme.  In this regard, John O'Connor, former chief executive officer of the Housing Agency, was recently appointed to act as liaison between homeowners and the Department and its expert group on implementation of the enhanced scheme.<\/p> <p> The Minister fully understands the level of anxiety and apprehension around the scheme given the scale involved and homeowners' experiences of the devastation caused by defective concrete blocks.  I reiterate, on behalf of the Minister, his commitment to urgently build a grant scheme which is fit for purpose with grant rates based on the independent work of the SCSI that covers the real costs involved.  I will provide more information in my next response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021700050#BBB00900","speaker":"1512","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645117200,"counter":417,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.  The response is consistent with the information the Minister has been sending to me.  I will focus on several elements.  The word \"independence\" was used a number of times in the reply.  This independence has been somewhat tarnished by what has happened in the past two weeks.  It is very important that whatever submission the homeowners make is not just seen as a listening exercise but also that they have something to contribute.  It has to be done in a proactive way.<\/p>  <p>  Since 2014, when the then Minister of State, Paudie Coffey, and I sat in a room with officials from the Department with responsibility for the environment, there have been many false dawns and timeframes.  Many months have been mentioned.  We have been told that this will be done and that will be done in the next few weeks.  We are all coming out of lockdown.  People who are fortunate enough to have homes have spent two years in them.  Mica homeowners have spent two years in houses that are falling down.  They need a timeframe that is honest and upfront.  The Minister has said in response to me this will be completed at the end of the spring and the legislation will go through.  The Attorney General and his team are working very hard on this.  They are making it a priority.  They are meeting twice a week.  It is very important that we stick to whatever timeframe we give and it does not drag on.  According to the old Gaelic calendar spring starts in Ireland on 1 February.  It is argued that in the northern hemisphere spring starts on 1 March.  We need to be very careful about throwing out timelines that will not be met.  We have to help people navigate their way through this.  The most important thing that needs to happen today is that people who are owed money for engineering costs need to be repaid.  We need facilitators on the ground as a matter of priority.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021700051#CCC00200","speaker":"1548"},{"type":"speech","time":1645117200,"counter":418,"content":"<p>I take on board the points made by Deputy McHugh on independence and on taking on board the submissions in a proactive way.  We will take on board the specific point on owners who have paid engineering costs.  We are moving towards a full and better resolution.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy McHugh specifically asked about retrofit.  It is important to clarify a number of aspects of the parameters of the scheme.  Foundations are being considered as part of the National Standards Authority of Ireland's review of the IS 465 standard.  Any future change to this will be integrated into the scheme.  The scheme is based on legal advice on a like-for-like remediation grant.  Remediation options will adhere to building regulations.<\/p>  <p>  In respect of home upgrades, I can confirm that homeowners will be eligible for the newly revised SEAI retrofit grants on the same terms and conditions as other homeowners.  This was clarified earlier by the Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smith.  Significant work is under way to make immediate improvements to the current scheme in parallel with legislating for and implementing the enhanced scheme.  Amending regulations are being finalised to provide for immediate recoupment to homeowners of engineers' fees and the introduction of allowable costs for essential work for immediate repairs to the value of &euro;5,000.  There is also an increase in the value of stage payments that can be drawn before the final grant payment.<\/p>  <p>  An expert group has been established to advise the Minister on technical issues for purposes required in the legislation.  These include, for example, damage threshold for entry into the scheme, an independent appeals process, second grant conditions, certificates of remediation, engagement with and resourcing of local authorities to continue the work of the scheme and the role of the Housing Agency in an enhanced scheme and transition.<\/p>  <p>  It is important that people accessing grants under the scheme are able to avail of the national retrofit scheme in a way that delivers a seamless customer experience.

Cariban is the first stage in the treatment algorithm for hyperemesis in our national guidelines but it is unlicensed in Ireland and unavailable for reimbursement, with treatment costing more than &euro;3,000 in some cases over the course of a pregnancy.

I am taking this matter on behalf of the Minister for Health, Deputy Donnelly.  The Minister appreciates that hyperemesis is a debilitating condition for women and is anxious that our health service should support women with this condition in every way possible.  Improving women's health outcomes is a key priority for the Minister and this Government.  We made a strong commitment to promoting women's health in the programme for Government and are fully committed to the development and improvement of women's health services.  As part of the women's health agenda, officials supporting women's health in the HSE and the Department of Health are working with urgency to identify all of the available options to better support this cohort of women.  In the coming weeks, the Minister for Health will be bringing a women's health action plan to Government.  It will set out a wide range of initiatives to support women's health, including maternal health.<\/p>  <p>  On the question of access to medicines to treat the condition, unfortunately the situation is not straightforward.  As the Deputy is aware, the HSE has statutory responsibility for medicine pricing and reimbursement decisions under the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013.  Under the Act, only items that have been granted market authorisation by the European Medicines Agency or the Health Products Regulatory Authority can be added to the reimbursement list.  The Minister for Health is advised by the HSE that the product Cariban, which is regarded as a beneficial treatment for hyperemesis, is classified as a food supplement rather than a medicinal product.  It does not have a marketing authorisation from the European Medicines Agency or the Health Products Regulatory Authority and, therefore, cannot be added to the formal reimbursement list under the 2013 Health Act.<\/p>  <p>  However, the Minister for Health understands that some hospitals prescribe and dispense Cariban free of charge to patients with severe nausea and vomiting in pregnancy.  The prescribing of an unlicensed product in a hospital setting is solely at the discretion of the treating clinician.  Two other products, Navalem and Xonvea, are authorised by the Health Products Regulatory Authority for the treatment of nausea and vomiting in pregnancy in women.<\/p> <p>However, a pricing and reimbursement application has not been submitted to the HSE for Navalem.  The HSE also advises that in late 2021, the company responsible for Xonvea advised that they are not in a position to launch the product in Ireland at this time.  The HSE has developed a national framework for access to medicinal products not currently on the reimbursement list through discretionary hardship arrangements in exceptional cases.  As Cariban is considered to be a food supplement rather than a medicinal product, it cannot be considered for reimbursement as an exempt medicinal product under the General Medical Services, GMS, scheme and community drug scheme, or reimbursement under the discretionary hardship arrangements.  For this reason, the HSE's own internal medicines management programme was asked last month to review the clinical evidence available on Cariban, and to make a recommendation on the appropriateness and feasibility of an exceptional patient-specific process for access to the product.  The Minister for Health is advised by the HSE that this evidence review has commenced and the results of the review, along with recommendations, should be completed in a matter of weeks.  The Minister for Health appreciates that this is a worrying time for women suffering with hyperemesis and is hopeful that the HSE can arrive at a positive outcome with respect to Cariban and its availability under the community drug scheme in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021700051#CCC00500","speaker":"1484","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645117800,"counter":423,"content":"<p>I sense the Minister of State's frustration in the response.  When I give my response back it is not aimed at the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, it is aimed at the lack of urgency in addressing the issue.<\/p>  <p>  When the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, was in opposition in 2018 he raised this very issue.  Back then he would have brought it to the Heath Products Regulatory Authority much quicker than last month.<\/p>  <p>  The effects of hyperemesis are not insignificant for pregnant women.  It takes an extreme toll on the mental and physical health of the pregnant person.  I want to thank the work of Hyperemesis Ireland and everyone who has shared their story on just how debilitating, isolating, and needlessly financially devastating this condition can be.  I acknowledge also the domino effect that this on our health care system.  In 2019 there were 3,237 day patients and inpatients as a result of dehydration and for hyperemesis treatment.  In 2020, at a time when maternity services, like all health care services, were severely impacted a result of Covid, the figure was 3,007.  How many women would not have needed such hospital intervention at the height of the pandemic had Cariban been available to them?<\/p>  <p>  I will come off script now and say to the Minister of State that I believe there is a shared need for urgency around this issue.  The Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly made a statement last that was picked up in the media, captured attention and got people excited.  Can we please just bring some finality to this?  Women are suffering as a consequence of an absence of action on the issue.  This medication costs more than &euro;45 per week and people just cannot afford it.  Let us get some urgency behind it.  It does not have to be an issue of the Opposition versus the Government.  I believe we share the same goal in this regard.

I just hope that some progress will be made there with regard to providing additional funding for the treatment of scoliosis and similar conditions.<\/p>  <p>  I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, for coming to the House to take this issue.  I wish to raise the necessity to fully reopen the National Driver Licence Service, NDLS, centre in Ennis to members of the public to provide a normal level of service.  Some weeks ago in the Chamber we held a discussion on banking.  It was slightly off topic but it was raised by the Minister of State's colleague from Carlow-Kilkenny, Deputy Phelan, and the discussion concerned the lack of services provided to elderly people by banks now.  I completely and wholeheartedly agree with Deputy Phelan.<\/p>  <p>  There are situations where such people are on the telephone and there is an option to dial 1 to wait for 15 minutes, dial 2 to wait a further 15 minutes, and dial 4 for your call to be terminated.  It is leading to huge frustration for people and citizens across the State.  It is bad when banks are doing it but these are private entities, although we bailed them out and so on.  It is inexcusable and unforgivable when Government agencies and agencies of the State are providing that level of service.  This is what is happening with the National Driver Licence Service centre in Ennis.  It is located in what is commonly called the Tesco shopping centre across the road from Cusack Park in Ennis.  People must book online and if a person cannot do so, they must use a particular telephone number.  There are many people in the State who for one reason or another cannot book an appointment online.  Then they must ring a telephone number.<\/p>  <p>  I will give the Minister of State examples of a couple of experiences that have been brought to my office.  One man of retirement age had to get his grandchild to make an online appointment for him as he could not walk into the centre.  He received his appointment and attended the NDLS centre with his paperwork on Tuesday.  The form was completed and signed, and his photograph was taken.  Then, on Thursday of the same week he received a form in the post to be signed.  He returned to the NDLS centre with the form but they would not help him.  He was told that they were not in a position to help him so he had to email that for.  Like other Deputies, I have a constituency office in Ennis.  The man came to my office and we scanned and emailed the form.  In my view, however, he should not have to do that.  It was as simple as leaving a form in the door but they would not accept it.<\/p>  <p>  In another case, a man from the west of the county took time off work to attend his appointment in the NDLS centre and he had his paperwork in place.  He was told that they would not accept cash due to Covid.  Now, everybody else is getting with it but the NDLS centre would not accept cash and this man did not have a card.  He telephoned his wife and his wife gave him the card number but the centre would not accept that payment either because his wife was not present with him.<\/p>  <p>  In another case, a woman in her 80s called to the office to say that she had been one and a half hours on the phone, that is, 90 minutes, trying to get an appointment.  Eventually the call was terminated.  Obviously I was not there with her and I do not know that she was a full 90 minutes on the phone but she has no reason to make it up.  I also wish to give the details of something else, which I can verify.  A woman of retirement age who does not have a laptop or a computer required her licence to be renewed.  She was unable to contact the NDLS on the number given, which was the correct number.  She called to our office, a member of my staff rang the number and was a full 45 minutes from 9:45 a.m. until 11:30 a.m. on the phone waiting to get through and eventually could not get through to make an appointment.  I put it to the Minister of State that this is not good enough.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021700052#DDD00500","speaker":"1518"},{"type":"speech","time":1645117800,"counter":427,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter today.

Services resumed on a phased basis on 8 June 2020.  All NDLS centres are operating as normal to the public nationwide.  Appointments must be booked to attend an NDLS centre and are made available through the booking system, as the Deputy has outlined, which is accessed online at or by telephone at 0818 919 090.  Appointments are available currently up to 26 March 2022.<\/p><p>The walk-in service previously available was originally discontinued to ensure social distancing and compliance with occupational and public health requirements.  Since then, maintaining an appointment-based service has facilitated the management of demand and capacity.  Appointments are booked in ten-minute slots and customers can be assured of the service within their allotted time.  Accordingly, the current NDLS contract, which was put in place with the front-office service provider in 2021, no longer offers a walk-in service.<\/p><p>The NDLS office in Ennis has always operated a two-booth capacity.

What she has just told this House is that a temporary reduction in services as a result of Covid is being used to introduce a permanent reduction, which is what we have accused the banks of doing.  The RSA, an agency under the remit of the Department, seems to be happy with this.  It is outrageous that people can no longer obtain access to a normal service.  Covid is being used to downgrade services.  That is all very well and good for those who can do their business on line, which is many us.  What about those who cannot?  Something else that is outrageous is the state of distress that people come out of that office in.  I challenge the Minister of State to stand outside those offices.  Elderly people feel there is absolutely no sympathy for their plight and they come out of the office in a state of distress.<\/p>  <p>  I note the very high level of no-shows.  I find that highly suspicious because I have heard numerous anecdotal accounts of people who have showed up two or three minutes late, still within their ten-minute slot, and who have been told they are late and have to go.  That is not good enough.  Of course people should show up on time, but life intervenes.  Sometimes Ministers do not show up here on time because life intervenes.  We try to get on with things and facilitate business, but it seems to be no willingness to do that in the NDLS in Ennis.<\/p>  <p>  I am worried that the stance the Department is taking is to state the service was temporarily downgraded and that is wonderful, because, like the bank of Ireland and AIB, it is going to use it as an excuse to permanently downgrade the service it offers without any cognisance of the impact that is having on elderly people's lives.  I brought my father to get his last driving licence and distinctly remember it.  I am happy he received a good level of service, but then and now are two very different things.

In his reply, the Taoiseach stated that there was no issue with resourcing ASD units, that extra classes are being opened and schools needed to apply for ASD units.  At the end of last week, parents were informed that it is not as easy as the Taoiseach made it out to be.  An application made by Gaelscoil Charraig na Si&uacute;ire was unsuccessful.<\/p>  <p>  Last September, people locally were forced to set up a campaign group to highlight the need for the service, given the difficulties they faced in securing places for their children.  One parent highlighted to me that she had looked outside of the local area for an ASD unit to which she could send her daughter.  She applied to three schools that had these units, all of which were outside of the area.  Each told her that despite booking a place two years in advance, they could not guarantee that she could get one.  It has since emerged that in the three or so years previously, as many as 20 people were found to have secured services outside of their area.  However, the availability of spaces has dried up and the need for a unit in Carrick-on-Suir has never been more pronounced.<\/p>  <p>  As stated, I raised this matter with the Taoiseach who told me there was no issue with resourcing ASD units.  An application was made by the local Gaelscoil last Friday.  It was told that current demand appears to be met from the current established classes in the surrounding areas.  The school and parents were heartbroken and outraged by this because the reason given for the decision is clearly not based on the reality of the situation.<\/p>  <p>  I have been informed that Piltown has 19 children on a waiting list.  Portlaw also has a waiting list.  Mooncoin and Carrigeen are full.  There is no provision in Clonmel.  Carrick-on-Suir and Clonmel combined have a considerable population, yet are meant to make do with the services provided in smaller communities elsewhere.  The truth is that to say the requirement for Carrick-on-Suir will be met by existing ASD classes is simply wrong.  I have also been told that, when asked, one of the people who signed the letter that turned down an application could neither name nor identify where the additional capacity they referred to was.  This is an outrageous way to treat a community and indicates that the system is clearly broken and children have to suffer as a result.

I want to show the Deputy the progress that has been made before getting into the detail of what he asked about.<\/p>  <p>  Some 1,900 special classes are specifically dedicated to autism which, as we know, is growing exponentially not just in Ireland but internationally.  The National Council for Special Education, NCSE, and the Department have worked extensively over the past two years to make sure that we have a streamlined approach.  It is important that there is short, medium and long-term planning in order to take population demographics into account, as well as the percentage of school going children that will have an additional need, to ensure that capacity is in place for the future.<\/p>  <p>  This year, 229 special classes opened, which will provide 1,800 additional special class places.  From this September, 287 new special classes will come on stream, providing 1,700 places.<\/p> <p>We will have a total of 2,400 next year.  We are making significant progress all the time.  We will have more than 19,000 special needs assistants by the end of this year, which is an increase of 81% since 2011.  That is the general view.  I do not want the Deputy to be under any illusion that we are not making progress.  On this particular issue, in Tipperary, we have 95 special classes.  Some 72 of those are for autism, 24 are attached to mainstream settings in south Tipperary, and 12 are at primary level, including two early intervention classes, and 12 are at post primary level.  Four new special classes are being opened this year, with two at primary level and two at post primary.  From September, there will be five new special classes, with four primary and one post primary.  There are also eight autism special classes in the bordering counties, with six primary and two post primary classes in Kilkenny and Waterford, which border Carrick-on-Suir.  They are within a 20 km radius of the town.<\/p> <p> I will talk about the Gaelscoil etc. when I come back in a second time if I do not get to finish it now.  Education is a right under the Constitution.  We endeavour to provide that education to all of our children, especially children with additional needs.  It is not always possible to provide special classes, special schools or indeed a mainstream class within a particular area, but we endeavour to do so.  The Department made site visits to many primary schools in Carrick-on-Suir.  We were told that no space was available in those primary schools.  The Deputy mentioned Portlaw National School and Carrigeen National School.  I understand that they have six places each.  They are in the catchment area for Carrick-on-Suir and Waterford.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021700053#EEE00600","speaker":"1472","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645119000,"counter":435,"content":"<p>The level of demand for autism spectrum disorder units will probably increase in the near future because of the backlog in assessments and diagnosis.  There are children currently in mainstream classes who have no choice but to be there because their needs have not been formally diagnosed yet.  I appreciate what the Minister of State says about extra classes.  There are none in Carrick-on-Suir or south Tipperary.  She can tell me about the 95 in Tipperary, but I do not think the Department realises how big a county Tipperary is.  It is grand to say 95, but it is the biggest inland county in Ireland, so 95 is not enough as far as we or the parents are concerned.<\/p>  <p>  In one case, a family is trying to make preparation for their daughter's education and they need finance to do so because of the delay in getting a formal diagnosis leaving them in limbo.  It is another mess.  I appreciate that the pandemic has caused backlogs, but it cannot be used as an excuse for everything that is going on.  The Minister of State needs to look at the future and prepare for the increasing demand and the responsibility that will fall to her and her colleagues in the Department.  I appeal to the Minister of State to put Carrick-on-Suir on her agenda.  As far as I can see, it has been left behind either out of convenience or because the system is broken.  The reply the Gaelscoil received indicates that the system is indeed broken, because the reasons for the refusal had no basis in reality and are factually incorrect.<\/p>  <p>  Our children should be served better in Tipperary and around the country.  Many have been through an incredibly difficult time during the pandemic.  The Minister of State has a responsibility to them and their families, to listen to their needs, to address their demands, and to provide for them.  I am not laying the blame with the Minister of State.  Carrick-on-Suir has already been let down by the health system, the Department of Health and the Minister for Health, with St. Brigid's hospital closing.  I ask the Minister of State to address the issue of ASD classes in that area and to at least give the people of Carrick-on-Suir some hope.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021700054#FFF00200","speaker":"1613"},{"type":"speech","time":1645119000,"counter":436,"content":"<p>The Deputy is correct that I do have a responsibility to meet the special education provision needs of people in various places around the country, including in Carrick-on-Suir.

She is aware of it and I understand that she has cleared 70% of the backlog.  It is important that we work well together so that those assessments are made before children avail of their educational placements.<\/p>  <p>  The National Council for Special Education has been engaging with the Gaelscoil, particularly about its medium of instruction and the interaction and integration of students in mainstream settings.  That is a possibility.  I mentioned other schools, including Portlaw National School and Carrigeen National School.  Piltown National School also has one space for September.  Additional school accommodation can be provided where there is no existing capacity in a school to cater for children.

Aont&uacute; has been developing this Bill for a long time.  We want to see it pass through the Oireachtas as fast as possible.  Car parking charges are having a critical effect on families across the country.  Anybody who has had a diagnosis of cancer, heart disease, stroke, mental health issues or any serious, life-threatening illness will know that those diagnoses are life-shattering.  They affect the individuals who are diagnosed and their families.  Most people do not know that those diagnoses also have the effect of placing massive additional costs on those families.  Information provided by the Irish Cancer Society estimates that there are between &euro;800 and &euro;1,200 in additional costs for a patient who is diagnosed with cancer.  Those costs could include travel to and from hospitals, extra medical costs, staying in bed and breakfast accommodation or hotels, or childcare costs experienced by the patients.  People who have serious illnesses suffer a reduction in their level of income.  On average, a person who has cancer will see a fall in income of &euro;1,400 a month.  If the two are added, there is typically a gap of &euro;2,200 for a person who has had a serious health issue.  It is bad enough to be told that one has a life-threatening illness but to also be told that one's family will be put into serious financial difficulty is difficult.<\/p>  <p>  Over the years, in an effort to fill their funding gap because the Government is not funding them properly, hospitals across the country have searched for ways to raise money.  One way that they have done that is by introducing car parking fees.  Almost every hospital in the country has car parking fees.  One or two thankfully have special deals for patients.<\/p> <p>What this has meant, however, is that there are big additional costs on families.  It is estimated that a person who has cancer pays &euro;60 a month in car parking fees.  That adds up to &euro;700 a year for that person.  I know of people who go to the housing estate next to the hospital to park the car and walk, sometimes with great difficulty, to the hospital to be seen.  Of course, that creates major problems in those housing estates in that they are constantly dealing with significant traffic and cars parked there.  We know that some hospitals, such as Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda, charge up to &euro;25 a day for car parking.  We know from parliamentary questions I have tabled that &euro;12 million in car parking fees was collected in 2020.  Now, 2020 was not a normal hospital year because most of the hospital services were closed because of Covid, but that is an incredible figure.  We also know that on every single day in 2017, &euro;60,000 was collected through car parking fees in public hospitals.<br\/><br\/>We in Aont&uacute; believe wholeheartedly that the public health service should be funded through taxation.  From the late 1700s, progressive taxation has been worked out as the best way to raise funds to pay for public services.  Why?  The more you earn and the better your ability to pay, the more you pay.  However, what we have in car parking charges is, in effect, a tax on illness.  What such charges say is that the more ill you are, the more you will pay; the less you earn, the more you will pay; and the higher your health costs are, the more you will pay.  That is what is happening throughout this country, and it is the bane of so many people's lives.  It is incredible that a Bill such as this, which deals with only about &euro;12 million or &euro;20 million of State funding in a health service that is sucking up &euro;21 billion, would have such an effect on the psyche of people across the country.  I ask that the Government look closely at the Bill and make sure it is serious about pushing it through.<br\/><br\/>As the Minister of State can imagine, if people go to chemotherapy or radiotherapy or get scans of their skin for skin cancer regularly, or if they need MRI scans because they have had strokes, the cost of all that adds up and puts pressure on people.  These are significant costs on the people who can least afford them.  My frustration in this regard is that we have had political promises on this issue to beat the band for years.  The great Simon Harris carried out a review of hospital car parking charges in 2018.  A review is the staple diet of governments that do not want to do anything.  It is funny - I think the best way a government can say no is actually to say yes and then just to carry out a review and to let nothing happen.  For ten years I have been in the D&aacute;il.  I go out when there is a campaign at the gates of Leinster House and see Government Deputies put their arms around campaigners, smile for the photographs, pledge support and come in here and spend five years doing nothing about whatever that serious issue is.  It is a very cynical way in which politics is delivered in Ireland, unfortunately.  The report Deputy Harris had commissioned has not even been published yet.  There are hospitals that have reduced the costs for their patients, but nobody can find out the exact information.  There is no portal on which to see which hospitals are involved and what the charges involved are.  One could go in and out of a hospital 20 times a year and not know that it has a special deal on hospital charges for people who are very sick.<br\/><br\/>We have to get to grips with this issue.  Every single political party represented in this Chamber stated in its manifesto for the 2020 general election that it would get rid of hospital parking charges.  Now is the time to let that happen.  I have listened to radio reports on the Bill today and it is reported that the Government will not stop it from progressing.  However, will the Government push it through or simply say it has its own plans in the programme for Government that it will get around to implementing some sunny day?  Will that be the Minister of State's answer, or can the Government not use this vehicle, which very clearly works out a solution?  This has been worked out with stakeholders and patient advocates, including the Irish Cancer Society.<br\/><br\/>Put simply, the Bill seeks free parking for the first three hours of an outpatient appointment.  Incredibly, in University Hospital Galway there is 20 minutes free parking.  Does the Minister of State know what people do?  They leave the waiting room after 20 minutes, go down to the car park, drive their car around and re-park it for another 20 minutes.  That is the system that is running in probably the biggest hospital close to where the Minister of State lives.  Put simply, this Bill seeks three hours of free parking, which would normally cover most people's outpatient appointments if they are very ill.  The reason I have limited it to three hours is that I do not want someone from the other side saying that if <i>carte blanche<\/i>free parking is given to everybody, nobody will be able to manage their car parks because people will be parking their cars and going off shopping down the town after their hospital appointments.  That will not happen in this situation.  There is minimal cost involved.  The Bill would allow hospitals to manage their car parks to make sure that they are not overused and that real people with real illnesses can still access them.  It would allow the person driving the car or the patient free parking for those three hours.  The Bill also allows for a system whereby if a hospital wants to reduce parking charges further or to widen its approach, it will be allowed to do so, and I would wholeheartedly encourage hospitals to do so.  I would have gone that far in the Bill, but even pushing this door can be difficult at times.<br\/><br\/>This is a very simple Bill.  It will make a significant difference to the financial implications of serious illness.  It will pass Second Stage, and I thank the Government for at least not opposing it.  It will get to Committee Stage soon.  Sometimes a Bill languishes on Committee Stage for a while because it may not be a certain party's Bill.  On this issue, however, can we not just be blind to party politics and the differences that exist between us, recognise that this is a simple solution to a serious problem and all get behind it?  The frustration I have heard from people making phone calls and sending emails and WhatsApp messages to me about this Bill over the past week is real.  I implore the Government to support the Bill.<br\/><br\/>Is Bille simpl&iacute; &eacute; seo.

The Bill seeks to provide for an entitlement to parking free of charge for outpatients attending public hospitals.  The question of car park charges for those attending hospitals and the financial burden this can place on patients is well recognised and has been spoken about in this House recently.  I acknowledge the spirit and intent of the Bill in seeking to ease the financial burden on those attending hospital and the difficulties that may be faced in paying car parking charges by those with no alternative to using their car.  For these reasons, the Government does not intend to oppose the Bill at Second Stage.<\/p>  <p>  The issue of hospital car parking charges is under active consideration.  Programme for Government: Our Shared Future, makes a commitment to introducing a maximum daily car parking charge for patients and visitors at all hospitals, where possible, and to introduce flexible passes in all public hospitals for patients and their families.  That is a reflection of the Government's appreciation of the financial challenge that can be faced by people in meeting these expenses, in particular, as the Deputy said, where they are frequent users of hospital services.  Consideration is being given to how best to ensure this commitment is addressed, taking account of existing arrangements.<\/p>  <p>  There is a good deal of variation in such arrangements and it will be useful to set out the overall position across the country.  The most recent information provided by the HSE indicated that the majority of acute hospitals charge for parking, although there are reported to be nine acute hospitals which provide free parking.  The HSE does not have in place a single contract to provide parking services at all hospitals; instead, each hospital has its own arrangements, which vary depending on the circumstances.  Data gathered by the HSE on this issue in 2018 showed that 16 hospitals used a third party provider to manage their car parks, although the car parks may still be owned by the hospital in question.  Some hospitals have a third party to service parking meters, entry and exit barriers and security.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to say that the HSE has been clear that hospitals that charge car parking fees are cognisant of the financial implications of parking costs.  With that in mind, many hospitals have already introduced concessionary arrangements of one kind or another, in particular to assist long-term patients and visitors for whom the payment of the full rate would cause hardship.  The HSE has confirmed that all hospitals that charge for parking already have a maximum daily rate.  That rate is &euro;10 or less in 27 out of 34 hospitals which charge for parking.  I believe Roscommon University Hospital and Portiuncula Hospital Ballinasloe are the only hospitals to offer free parking, though I am open to correction on that.<\/p>  <p>  Almost all hospitals are reported to have some form of exemptions or concessions in place.  A small number have the option of flexible day passes or multitrip entry passes for regular hospital attenders.  The vast majority offer concessions based on the type of inpatient.<\/p>  <p>  In examining this issue in recent years, the HSE acknowledged that the concessions in place were not necessarily widely advertised, as the Deputy stated, and were often only communicated to the patient or family member via the ward manager or ward staff, or through the hospital's social work department.  There is undoubtedly a need to make sure there is clear, straightforward information that is well advertised and easily found.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to know how much is raised in car park charges and how that money is used.  The HSE has reported that over &euro;17 million was generated from parking charges at HSE hospitals in the past two years, comprising &euro;12 million in 2019 and &euro;5 million in 2020.  Of course, 2020 was an atypical year in our hospitals so it is likely the 2019 figure is a more accurate reflection of charging income year by year.   The HSE has indicated that parking revenue is used for a range of purposes.  This might be maintenance and re-investment in parking facilities, including repayment of loans obtained for upgrading such facilities, or investment in security.  It may also cover the cost of parking provision more generally, with any additional income being used to contribute to the general hospital budget for provision of care or research.<\/p>  <p>  That means that if less money is to be raised from car park charges, the shortfall in hospitals' income will need to be met from another source.  That might be from the Exchequer or by charging some groups more and others less.  One consideration is how to ensure that car parking concessionary rates are targeted at those who need them and not at occasional users.  In that respect, while I welcome the spirit of the Deputies' Bill, I wonder whether a blanket elimination of charges for outpatients is the optimal approach.  It does not make any distinction between someone who arrives for a first outpatient appointment and is then discharged back to their GP, and someone who is attending for a series of outpatient appointments.  Neither does it address the needs of other hospital users, such as those visiting, collecting inpatients or arriving for day case procedures.  There are also people who may arrive at emergency departments, whether with a family member or on their own.  While these are outpatients, they would not have a letter or message in relation to an appointment as a means of verification, even if they had letters of referral from a GP.  I appreciate that the Deputies will have considered all of this as fully as possible, but it is clear that in examining how best to address the commitment in our programme for Government, we will need to take account of all car park users.<\/p>  <p>  There is some evidence that removing car park charges can make it more difficult for patients to find parking.  Where car parking charges were eliminated in other jurisdictions, that led to an increase in demand for car parking spaces, resulting in full car parks and further frustration for users.  In areas in Wales and Northern Ireland, hospitals had to introduce measures to prevent people abusing free car parking amid concerns that patients were struggling to park, including in some cases the re-introduction of charges or penalties.<\/p>  <p>  It is clear that any car park charging regime will need to be cognisant of how to ensure that car parking spaces are available to those who need them.  That will be core to the Government's consideration of how best to implement our commitment in the programme for Government.  I appreciate that the Deputies have sought to acknowledge this possibility in their Bill by proposing an arrangement to revoke free car parking when hospitals are full.  This would mean that some users who arrive expecting free parking suddenly have to pay.  This will be more of a problem for some than others but, in general, having the potential for someone to be faced with a surprise charge may not be the optimal way to manage this issue.<\/p>  <p>  I assure the House that the needs of patients, accompanying persons and visitors must be core to consideration of the Government's commitment to easing the financial burden of car park charging and ensuring the full implementation of the programme for Government commitment as consistently as possible across our hospitals.  In particular, those who are frequent users of hospital car parks, whether due to recurring treatment or longer stays, are more financially impacted by charges than those who may be ambulatory outpatient attendees.  It is important to reflect this.<\/p>  <p>  It has been the general principle and policy that future car parks should be self-funding so as not to divert money from patient care.  That is not to suggest that previous policy cannot be replaced, but it will be important to have an appropriate balance in ensuring that public funding is used in the most appropriate way.  In easing the financial burden on users of hospital car parks, it will be important to, as much as possible, direct public funding towards those who need it and not those who are infrequent users of the hospital car park or are otherwise in a position to bear the cost of car parking with some ease.<\/p>  <p>  All of these issues will be considered as we implement the Government's commitment to ease the financial pressure on patients, in particular, in relation to car parking.<\/p> <p>I share the Deputy's views.  Often, when going to visit people the cost of car parking could be &euro;10.  It is a high charge, and it would be good to see some mechanism put in place to address these charges.  It is certainly an issue that many of my constituents have complained about, Sligo hospital being one of the locations mentioned.  We all share the view that this must be done.  While I have indicated some limitations with the Deputy's Bill, the Government is happy to acknowledge the spirit and intent this legislation sets out in seeking to ease the financial burden on those attending hospitals.  We will not oppose the Bill on Second Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021700056#HHH00100","speaker":"1608","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645120800,"counter":443,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Teachta T&oacute;ib&iacute;n as an reachta&iacute;ocht seo a chur os &aacute;r gcomhair.

From my wife's experience in St. James's Hospital, I know there was a 20-minute period for people to get into the car park, go up the stairs, get their bloods done and then get back out to the car park and out before charges kicked in.  The system for giving blood was that good.  What did the hospital car park regime do then?  It lowered the allowable time to ten minutes, which means there is no hope in hell of getting in and out that quick.  That was done just to ensure that everybody using the car park ended up being penalised.  It was stupid, especially since most of the people managing to get in and out within ten or 15 minutes were the first people in at 8 o'clock in the morning.  It was a great use of time, but now these people are being penalised.<\/p>  <p>  The car park at St. James's Hospital is full to the brim.  It is causing traffic chaos, including blocking buses using the hospital, because the car park entrance is full of cars waiting to go in once other vehicles have vacated a space.  These cars are just sitting there.  People going to outpatient services have nowhere else to go because the car park is full.  I am not sure if that is because of the workers on the building site of the national children's hospital, NCH, or hospital staff taking up spaces.  It is the same experience in other hospitals.  The same is true at St. Vincent's University Hospital, which is completing, or has just completed, the building works for a new car park.  The hospital is obviously confident the project will pay for itself.  The car park was full when my father went into St. Vincent's for a visit, so he parked in a church across the road.  He ended up being in hospital for seven days and his car was clamped in the church car park.  Those are the consequences that arise when patients cannot park next to a hospital.  We could have gone to collect the car if my father had managed to get a message out to us.  We went later and found that the car was missing.<\/p>  <p>  Turning to Children's Health Ireland, CHI, at Crumlin, anybody who has tried to visit the car park of that hospital on the Drimnagh Road will have seen the same problem.  Every visitor's car is parked in the local neighbourhood.  We are talking about people bringing sick children to hospital.  The car parks are not good enough and then there is also the matter of the charges.  No provision has been made for people in this situation, despite the suggestions we have made to add additional car parking, not paid car parking, to facilitate people bringing children to hospital.  The result is that people are parking on local streets and further and further away from the hospital entrance.  When the national children's hospital was being planned, I met members of the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board, NPHDB.  They had great plans for staff parking off-site elsewhere, being bussed in, encouraged to use the Luas, etc.  That approach does not seem to be working at the rate it should to ensure the car park will have free spaces for the patients.<\/p>  <p>  As I mentioned, the major problem is that patients often do not know when they go in to hospital, for dialysis treatment, for example, whether they will get their own slot.  They might be in hospital for half a day.  We are lucky in Dublin because a bus comes around or a taxi can bring people to their appointments.  Not everybody has access to those services.  People coming up from the country to some of the main hospitals for an outpatient's appointment or an appointment with a specialist could be in the hospital for half the day thinking about the car parking charges ramping up throughout their stay.<\/p>  <p>  Car parking can be made free.  There are practical solutions to this issue.  I heard what the Minister of State said about there being chaos when parking was opened previously.  There was chaos before the parking charges were introduced in some of the hospitals I mentioned because people were parking and then walking to work.  It is the same anywhere in those localities where there is free parking.  People will abuse something that is free but that does not prevent us from having an app which would allow parking to be pre-booked.  To give the example of hotels, I was in one hotel in Galway - it was probably three years ago - where there was no attached parking and the hotel used a nearby car park.  Guests were given a card, which they validated at the reception desk, and that enabled them to avail of free or discounted parking.  It is a very simple process and is done everywhere else in the world.  Why can we not do something like that?<\/p>  <p>  I have a parking app on my phone which means I can pull up at any parking space along a street, type in how long I am going to be there and the money is taken out of my account.  We do not want money taken out of people's accounts but when patients are making appointments, the staff in the hospital should be able to ask them what time they will arrive and book them in for that time in the car park based on the car registration.  People going to Dublin Airport in the morning who have paid in advance will pull up to the car park barrier, where the camera will read the car registration number.  Up goes the barrier, in goes the car and back down comes the barrier.  The charge accrued is docked when the vehicle leaves the car park.  The same type of principle can be applied to anybody.  This kind of approach would allow people to go up to the reception desk on the way out of hospital, after what may have been a traumatic day, and give details of their car registration number.  It could just be typed into a computer system.  This is not rocket science.  There are practical solutions to the problems that have been pointed out about free car parking in hospitals.  This is about getting real.<\/p>  <p>  There was a hint in what the Minister of State and the Deputy before him said about what some of this is about.  The hospitals have become reliant on the income generated from parking charges.  This just shows the state of our funding for hospitals, which are reliant on penalising patients through car parking fees to meet their running costs.  That needs to end.  I have absolutely no problem with cars being clamped and towed away if there is abuse of parking spaces, such as in the cases I mentioned of people leaving their cars and going to work.  There is no reason on earth, however, why we cannot devise a system to facilitate patients who are regular visitors to the hospitals.  We are talking about those going to outpatient services in particular.  God love the people who end up in accident and emergency departments.  They often park, abandon their car and run straight in to the hospital.  Hospitals are usually sympathetic in those cases and move the vehicle to one side or whatever.<\/p>  <p>  I am referring to people who regularly attend appointments in hospitals.  It is not possible for all patients to get the Luas to St. Vincent's or Tallaght hospitals.  Not everybody can afford to get a taxi to an appointment.  People from outside Dublin are especially reliant on car parks.  Hospitals in rural Ireland may be in places where there are no bus, Luas or DART services.  In such circumstances, people are dependent on their cars.  They may drive to the hospital themselves but often a neighbour will drive them and he or she will have to park and wait around.<\/p>  <p>  A move must be made on this issue and there need to be practical solutions.  This is not a political issue or a matter of this side versus that side.<\/p> <p>This is about patients.  This is about relieving a burden that should not be on people when they are ill.  They need to concentrate on getting better and the fact that they are going to see a doctor who will, hopefully, make them better so that they come out the other side, rather than thinking that the appointment is taking too long and that it will cost them another &euro;3 because they have gone into the third or fourth hour parking rate.  That is absolutely crazy.  I know that is what happens.  When patients are being treated and the doctor is explaining something to them, they are distracted by hoping the doctor will shut up soon because they have gone into the next hour.  We have not even touched on visitors going to see people who are in hospital.  That is another issue.  Most visitors attend at night when the car parks are relatively empty.   The question is whether we make car parking free or make it a nominal sum.  It should never be for profit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021700057#JJJ00200","speaker":"1485","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645121400,"counter":445,"content":"<p>I welcome the Bill and commend Teachta T&oacute;ib&iacute;n for bringing it forward.  My party has supported free car parking in public hospitals for many years.  In fact, in the North, Sinn F&eacute;in introduced a similar Bill in the Assembly recently that seeks to abolish similar charges.  I would do the same if I were the Minister for Health or if Sinn F&eacute;in was in government in this State.<\/p>  <p>  We must decide whether we will agree to the principle of free car parking in hospitals and move away from it being a revenue raiser for hospitals and whether we consider the removal of car parking charges as being part of reducing the cost of health care.  That is the first question that has to be asked.  If we agree with that principle, the difficulties and challenges and the unintended consequences the Minister of State spoke about, some of which were referred to by Deputies T&oacute;ib&iacute;n and &Oacute; Snodaigh, would not be insurmountable and could be resolved.<\/p>  <p>  Let us consider people who are sick and have to attend hospital.  If they are on a very low income, they may not be able to travel to the hospital by public transport.  This also affects people who visit patients in hospital.  Some people can get to the hospital using public transport but there are many others who cannot, particularly those who have mobility problems and have to be driven to the hospital to see a relative.  It could be an older person whose husband or wife is in hospital.  There is a cost in that.  If a person is in hospital for a number of days or weeks, the cost can become quite significant.  We have all seen examples of it.  People complain to us about it because it adds to the burden of somebody who is sick and of people visiting those who are sick.  In my view, it simply is not fair.<\/p>  <p>  I have seen it a number of times when I have visited University Hospital Waterford and St. Luke's General Hospital, Kilkenny.  It is very costly.  When attending St. Luke's hospital, people can buy a ticket that will, technically, do them for the day.  However, if they have to leave for some reason and return in the evening, they have to find a Portakabin where the ticket can be put through a machine to make sure they can leave and come back again.  Sometimes nobody is in the Portakabin.  People are left hanging around waiting for a person to do this for them.  It adds to the inconvenience that visitors and, sometimes, patients are put through.<\/p>  <p>  We are creating a difficult situation for many patients simply because we want to charge people for going to hospital.  Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh gave an example of how we could get around what the Minister of State said might become a difficulty if we make car parking free in hospitals.  Some people, depending on where the hospital is located, might use it to park there for other purposes.  That is a possibility and we would need to take it into consideration.  The vast majority of hospitals are not located in city centres or areas where there are shops and restaurants and so on.  They are located mainly around residential facilities.  I gave two examples of hospitals.  I cannot see why people would park in St. Luke's hospital.  There is no benefit in doing that unless they were going to the hospital.  It may be more likely in University Hospital Waterford, but I do not believe many people would go to the hospital simply for parking.  There may be some hospitals where that may be an issue.  I am not sure why people would park at St. James's Hospital for the day unless they were working nearby, then that might be an issue.  All hospitals could be gone through and an analysis of them could be done.  The way around that is to use the technology that is available.<\/p>  <p>  By way of an example, and I am sure the Minister of State has had to do this as has an Teachta T&oacute;ib&iacute;n, as a Member of the Oireachtas I have to occasionally meet senior management in University Hospital Waterford.  When attending, I park my car in the car park and take my ticket.  When the meeting concludes, I am offered a ticket that has already been put through a machine that allows me to leave the car park without paying.  I discard the ticket I took when coming in and I use the one given to me by the hospital when leaving the car park.  I do not always take the ticket.  Sometimes, I pay because I want to and do not want to take the ticket.  That is a system that could be put in place.  It could be linked to visiting a patient whereupon the patient's name is given and the ticket is then validated and the visitor can exit without charge.  There are many options we can look at to get around the notion that there may be an abuse of the system.  When I hear that, I hear it as an excuse.  Yes, it may be a problem, but I would say it is in very few hospitals.  I do not believe it is the biggest barrier - pardon the pun - to the lifting of car parking charges; the biggest barrier is the fact that far too many hospitals have become dependent on car parking charges as a funding stream.<\/p>  <p>  If the Minister of State were to abolish car parking charges, hospitals that use the revenue from those charges as part of their overall budget would need that money replaced.  The cost of doing it would not be significant in the context of the HSE budget.  To abolish the car parking charges, my understanding is that it would cost less than &euro;13 million.  I am not saying it is an insignificant sum but in the context of a &euro;22 billion budget in healthcare, it is not significant.<\/p>  <p>  Oireachtas Members collectively made a decision regarding Sl&aacute;intecare.  We have had many lively and robust debates, including the Acting Chair, Deputy Durkan, who, as a member of the Joint Committee on Health, met with senior officials of the Department of Health and the HSE yesterday in regard to commitments in healthcare reforms that were promised.  Many of the reforms that were promised are too slow in coming on stream.  There is a perception from some that there is a bit of pushback against some of the promised reforms.  We promised that we would look at reducing the cost of healthcare, and removing car parking charges is one of those issues.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, I would like prescription charges to be abolished.  I would also like further changes to the drugs payment scheme threshold.  By the way, I welcome the cut introduced by the Government as part of the cost-of-living measures.  The monthly threshold was reduced from &euro;100 to &euro;80, and in last year's budget it was reduced from &euro;120 to &euro;100.  We are going in the right direction and I welcome the changes.  We still have in-patient charges in hospitals, which can be quite difficult for some payments to pay.  There is also the big promise of universal primary care and, in particular, universal GP care.  We are a long way away from that happening because we are simply not doing the planning.  There is no strategy from the Government as to how to do it.  We all agreed we would do it.  There was the Sl&aacute;intecare programme.  As is the case in the programme for Government, when car parking charges were agreed to be a part of it, there is no plan on how to deliver it.  We are waiting and waiting.  I had hoped to hear from the Minister of State that the Government had a plan on how to do this, not excuses as to why it will not do it.  I had hoped to hear a plan that sets out what we are going to do.  We cannot, forever and a day, offer excuses as to why we cannot do it when we know the consequences can be overcome.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the fact that Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n has given us an opportunity to have this discussion, to again put this issue on the agenda and to put pressure on the Minister of State and the Government to move on this.  Let us do the planning.  Let us not come back to this in a year, or two or three, or go into another election where we will make the same promises again regarding healthcare.<\/p> <p>People are sick to their back teeth of hearing about reports, promises, reform and all of the things politicians say they will do when it comes to healthcare that do not get done.  It erodes confidence and shores up the public's view that these politicians are simply not interested in making changes in healthcare that make life better and easier for patients.  When there are simple things like this that can be done, even when there are some consequences that can be worked out, we should do them and send out a clear message to the public, patients and their families that where we can, we will reduce the burden of the cost of healthcare.  I have given many examples of where we can do that.  One very clear, straightforward start would be to commit the funding and deal with the practicalities to make that difference to patients and their families.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021700058#KKK00200","speaker":"1615","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645122000,"counter":447,"content":"<p>The list of speakers is completed.

The Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, and I acknowledge the spirit and intent of the Bill in seeking to ease the financial burden on those attending hospital.  It is important to acknowledge that hospitals are already aware of the financial implications of parking costs, and do have various concessionary arrangements in place.  Separate to reviewing and improving on these arrangements as needed, it is essential to ensure the current arrangements are clear and readily communicated to all.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is more than aware that hospital car parking charges may represent an additional financial burden at a difficult time for people, and that this can simply add to the anxiety and stress of hospital visits and admissions.  We have heard that patients and their advocates consider that parking services in some hospitals are inflexible and not patient-centred and we know that there are some groups of patients who are much more affected by this issue, people who have to attend regularly for the treatment of chronic conditions, as Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n rightly pointed out, such as cancer patients and patients undergoing dialysis, for example.  That is why the Programme for Government, Our Shared Future, agreed in 2020, explicitly addresses this issue.  To restate our commitment, it is to introduce a maximum daily car parking charge for patients and visitors at all hospitals, where possible, and to introduce flexible passes in all public hospitals for patients and families.  We are moving to implement that commitment.  In considering how best to do that, we will strive to take account of all users but in particular those who are most affected.  Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n outlined the cost to cancer patients.<\/p>  <p>  A lot of people will take another way out.  Nobody wants to pay car parking charges.  I do not want to pay them myself.  I grew up in a town and a county that does not have car parking charges.  In Roscommon hospital there are no car parking charges.  It is difficult.  Irish Rail has car parking charges at certain stations and people will just go up the line to another town where there are no charges.  We see the same thing in Maynooth, Hazelhatch and places like that as the Acting Chairman will know.  There are issues there.<\/p>  <p>  It was stated here that about &euro;17 million was generated.  I am not sure if that was profit or money generated.  I would think by the time one pays the various attendance and all the hospital charges, I am not sure if it is really value for money.  That is only my view.  In Sligo hospital I think the charge is &euro;3 up to four hours and &euro;6 for between five and 24 hours.  It is not uncommon and I have done it myself that if I get a 12 or 24-hour ticket but leave the car park after two or three hours, if I see somebody coming in I might wind down the window and give them the ticket so they can save &euro;6.  It is in the spirit and I do not think it is breaking the law.  We do not like to see other people paying car parking charges.  That is just my opinion.  Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh rightly said that this is not a political issue.  There are practical solutions.  Deputies Cullinane and T&oacute;ib&iacute;n said that the issues are not insurmountable.  Technology will play a huge role.  We have to look at all the options from a climate change perspective.  Sometimes if something is free, it can be abused.  We need to look at that.  <\/p>  <p>  I believe there are limitations to this Bill, as I have outlined earlier, but I am happy to reiterate that the Minister acknowledges the spirit and intent of the Bill in seeking to ease the financial burden on those attending hospital.  This is a goal that we all share and that is reflected directly in the programme for Government.  The Minister does not intend to oppose the Bill on Second Stage.  I thank Deputies T&oacute;ib&iacute;n and Berry for bringing in the Bill which I fully support.  I hope we will be able to work together to get practical solutions on car parking charges.<\/p>  <p>  It was an own goal in St. James's Hospital when it reduced the free parking time from 20 minutes to ten minutes.  I think it was wrong.  When people are in the hospital they have to keep track of how long they are parked, if they are there three hours, if they need to send somebody out again.  Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh's father's car was clamped.  It is a barrier to people attending hospitals.  I think we can work together to reduce or get rid of the charges.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021700059#LLL00500","speaker":"1608"},{"type":"speech","time":1645122000,"counter":451,"content":"<p>There is an awareness and agreement, at least among the contributors, that there is a significant problem here.  Citizens who can least afford it are carrying a significant burden that they should not be carrying.  Unfortunately what we have got from the Government is a nebulous maybe; they might have a look into it, review the situation, think about it for a little bit longer.  On one side of the scales we have a crisis in many people's lives who are suffering a life and death situation; on the other we have a Government with no real intent to do anything about this at all.  If we are brutally honest with each other, as we should be here because we should not mess with people's minds when it comes to this sort of stuff, there is no intent from the Government to grasp this nettle in any way.  There is no intent on its part to back the Bill, either.  If it does not make it through, we will be going into the next election in three or four years' time with people putting this issue on their manifestoes again.  We will be going to the people and knocking on doors saying we will do this.<\/p>  <p>  I always think it is funny how when a political party is speaking before an election it knows the problem and the solutions.  Then when it gets into government, it has to do a review and a study of it and work it out.  I listened to the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, on the radio talking about the review and study they are doing on the accommodation for women suffering from domestic violence.  We do not need a review to tell us about the problem.  The problem is as plain as the nose on my face and known for years.  A review is a method not to do something.  It is a form of political procrastination and a strategy for inertia.  It is written right over this Government in so many ways, which is a major pity.  As I said in the other debate on the cost of living, the only thing warm in this country at the moment is the Government's hands because it is sitting on them so often.  That is the truth.  It is terrible because the Minister of State has this special, once in a lifetime opportunity to actually make a difference.<\/p>  <p>  I spoke to a former Fine Gael Minister who told me that when he went into Departments, he was surrounded by people with PhDs, degrees and masters who had been in those Departments for years.  They could think of 100 reasons something should not be done.<\/p> <p>However, nothing changes if people think of a hundred reasons something should not be done.  The people who make a difference are not those who think of reasons something cannot, may not or should not happen; the people who change things are those who forget about those issues and find solutions every time they need to. <\/p> <p> This Bill may not be perfect, although I believe it is very good.  Much of the rhetoric I have heard about the potential for this or that problem to arise does not reflect the reality.  The three-hour limit does not allow for a free-for-all in a car park.  The technology exists to measure people&rsquo;s use of car parks.  People may have to get their tickets stamped at the reception desk in the department in the hospital they are attending.  There are many options.  Things are changed by people who can find solutions.<\/p> <p> There are a couple of other points I want to make.  There are third-party organisations that are running car parks under contract from hospitals.  The M3 is being run by a private company under contract for public use.  Every time there are not enough cars going through the toll bridge on the M3, the Government puts its hands in its pockets and gives money to that company.  That is how it works.  Where there is a public private partnership, the Government normally enters an arrangement whereby, if there is a fall-off in the income going in one direction, it will provide it.  Where contracts are locked in for five or ten years and there is a fall-off, the solution involves the Government making sure the income is provided.  There is no doubt about it.<\/p> <p> I do not like discussing my personal experience in the D&aacute;il regularly but about two years ago I was told by a doctor that I had skin cancer.  I remember the conversation well.  I was on the phone; the meeting was not in person.  The doctor told me about the length of the lesion and a great deal about the condition.  I remember distinctly that, after talking for about two minutes, he asked whether he could speak to my wife.  I asked why and he said he was not sure whether I was taking it all in.  He was right because I was not.  We are asking people to have such conversations and then fidget around with a credit card, find a booth, pay for a ticket and then get the hell out of the place on time.  That is not a fair and humane way to treat people who probably have the darkest cloud of their lives hanging over them on the day.  They are stunned into confusion and do not know what side is up.  The Government needs to say, \"Let&rsquo;s just fix this.\"  This is a really important issue that needs to be considered.<\/p> <p> The Bill can be improved.  That is why there is Third Stage and why there is a committee that gives an opportunity to the great unwashed in this Chamber to fix Bills.  There will be a list of amendments as long as your arm if my Bill gets to Third Stage, which I hope will happen.<\/p> <p> Those are the main issues.  We have to focus on the key issue.  The key issue concerns the patient, the person suffering significantly from ill health, which on many occasions is life-threatening.  The patient also has to suffer a kick in the shins financially.  We have a choice: wash our hands of the matter and say it is not our problem or help fix it.  The choice is the Government&rsquo;s.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022021700059#LLL00600","speaker":"1504","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1645122600,"counter":453,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1645122600,"counter":454,"content":"<p>Cuireadh an D&aacute;il ar athl&oacute; ar 7.15 p.m. go dt&iacute; 2 p.m., D&eacute; M&aacute;irt, an 22 Feabhra 2022.\r\n\r\nThe D&aacute;il adjourned at at 7.15 p.m. until 2 p.m. on Tuesday, 22 February 2022.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
