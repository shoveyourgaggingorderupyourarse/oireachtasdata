We proposed measures to end the sweetheart tax deals that these funds have been gifted by Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael, but, time and again, Government has voted against these proposals.<\/p>  <p>  Last week, the Taoiseach came to the D&aacute;il and expressed his shock that funds are snapping up family homes in bulk.  He said that this was a new development and it was not Government policy.  Of course, none of that is true because it is Government policy to attract these investment funds which it does by giving them cushy tax arrangements, which see them pay virtually no tax at all.  Last weekend we learned that it is also Government policy to invest in these funds.  Money that should have be used for affordable and social housing was being used to push ordinary buyers out of the market, to push up house prices and rents.  Far from being shocked, the truth is the Taoiseach knew what was happening and his claim that it is not Government policy to support these funds is absolutely bogus. <\/p>  <p>  Ordinary working people will struggle every day to save for a deposit, they will pay extortionate rents, they will find themselves locked out of home ownership, and, all the while, these investors snap up homes from under their noses and their Government is boosting these funds with their taxes.  You could not make it up. <\/p>  <p>  The Government knows it is faced with enormous public anger in the face of a housing emergency.  Yet the measures we have heard reported in the media seem to be a case of far too little, far too late.  If the Government does not set the stamp duty at a high enough rate, it will not stop these funds buying up homes ahead of first-time buyers and others.  For example, the Tories in Britain set the rate at 15%.  They discovered even that rate was too low and they have had to raise it again.<\/p>  <p>  If the Government's proposals exclude apartments, we will also have a big problem there because apartments are family homes and cannot be excluded.  The reality is that half of all homes built in County Dublin last year would be exempted under the proposals speculated on in the media.  Six out of seven homes in the city would be exempted. <\/p>  <p>  The Government cannot wave the flag of surrender and abandon whole communities to investment funds not just in Dublin city but in Poolbeg, Cherrywood, Clonburris, Cork city and beyond because this would consign an entire generation to paying extortionate rip-off rents long into the future, unable to buy their own homes as these funds increase their profits.<\/p> <p>Stamp duty needs to be increased.  The Government needs to understand that these funds will spread the cost of this over their long-term investments.  The Government, therefore, also needs to tax their profits.  It must shut down all the sweetheart tax arrangements enjoyed by these investment funds.  These deals, designed by Fine Gael and continued by this Government, need to be brought to an end.  That is the only way we can ensure that this generation of workers and families will stand any chance of securing an affordable home.  Will the Taoiseach outline for the D&aacute;il and, more importantly, for those caught up in this housing nightmare what measurements his Government will now bring forward to stop these funds?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051800003#A00200","speaker":"1466","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621343100,"counter":8,"content":"<p>First, I have to repeat to the Deputy that the Government&rsquo;s fundamental aim is to provide unprecedented funding to facilitate the largest social housing programme in the history of the State over the next five years.  That is the anchor of the Government&rsquo;s housing programme.  We want to provide 50,000 social homes over the next five years.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to that, we want to provide affordable homes through a variety of initiatives which the Minister has undertaken, not just in shared equity, or indeed where the State is now going to get involved in a new scheme to support State-built affordable homes, but also by way of the first-ever national cost-rental scheme, which is being introduced by the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, in addition to a range of other initiatives.  The bottom line is that we are not building enough houses or apartments in this country to meet the needs of ordinary people and working people.  The Government does not believe that funds should be competing with owner-occupiers or first-time buyers in buying up houses that have already been built.  They should not be competing with first-time buyers for badly needed properties.  We believe in supporting first-time buyers and owner-occupiers.  That is why we have expanded the help-to-buy scheme.  Sinn F&eacute;in opposed that scheme, which was availed of by 22,000 homeowners.  Deputy McDonald seems to believe ordinary people should not get the help-to-buy scheme at all.  She opposed it.  Sinn F&eacute;in also opposed the Land Development Agency Bill, the shared equity scheme, and 16 out of 21 housing developments on Dublin City Council.  These are homes that could have been built for ordinary working people.<\/p>  <p>  The flaw in Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s proposition is that it sees no room at all for the private builder or the private sector.  The State is now the main actor in housing - of that let there be no doubt - in terms of building and in terms of supporting agencies.  We also need to get going as well.  This has nothing to do with funds.  This is to do with getting private builders to build privately so that we can get the level of housing we require.  We need up to 400,000 new houses by the end of this decade.  That is not all going to be done by the State on its own, yet Sinn F&eacute;in seems to think it is the only option.<\/p>  <p>  The proposals that the Ministers, Deputies Darragh O&rsquo;Brien and Donohoe, will be bringing forward will deal with the issue of investment funds competing with first-time buyers and owner-occupiers.  Further discussions will take place later on some of the proposals.  We will need the support of parties in this House to facilitate the passage through, most likely tomorrow, of the decisions that the Government will take on this matter.  We want to see the legislation through tomorrow.  I hope we can count on the support of Sinn F&eacute;in in that regard.<\/p>  <p>  The Government perspective is very clear.  Housing is a number one issue.  We need to provide more and more houses.  We need more supply.  I do not see in the Sinn F&eacute;in policy any substantive, coherent approach to increasing that supply.  Our Government&rsquo;s entire effort and objective is to solve this problem.  Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s objective is to exploit it for its own electoral and political gain.  I see nothing constructive coming from that party, either at local or national level, in terms of getting houses built at a significant scale out there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051800004#B00200","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1621343100,"counter":9,"content":"<p>The reality for the Taoiseach is that he caused this problem.<\/p> <p>He caused this crisis and he is sustaining it.

They are attacks on the most vulnerable in Irish society.  Patients are already struggling with never-ending waiting lists that have been worsened by Covid and ongoing restrictions but shockingly, on top of this, key life and death treatment is again put on hold due to this odious crime.  The Government has a duty of care with regard to safeguarding and protecting the health of citizens and their personal data.  This responsibility is particularly important in Ireland as we are a data island.  Some 30% of the data that exist in the EU are located here.  If one is going to mine data, the place to go is Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  What is the record of the Government with regard to protection from cyberattack and safeguarding personal data?  According to a reply I received this week to a parliamentary question, Tusla, for example, had 362 breaches in the past year, which is practically a breach for every day of the year.  Incredibly, the National Cyber Security Centre, NCSC, has been rudderless for the past year, with no director put in place.<\/p> <p>The NCSC is also homeless.  It does not even have a permanent residence from which to operate.  The Government sees the role of the director of the NCSC to be so important that it has set the wage for that individual lower than a backbench Opposition Member.<\/p> <p> The former chief executive officer of the HSE, Tony O'Brien, stated this week that the HSE's expenditure on IT security is approximately a quarter of what would be expected compared to other health systems.  That is a phenomenally difficult thing for any Government to have to deal with.  The person who was head of the HSE in recent times is saying that the Government is spending a quarter of what it should be spending on cybersecurity.  The NCSC has been given a budget of just &euro;5 million.  Let us think about that.  Last year, the Department of the Taoiseach spent &euro;16.5 million on PR alone.  The NCSC has a staff of 25, with no dedicated premises or director and a budget amounting to one third of the Department of the Taoiseach's budget on PR.  How can the Government claim to be fulfilling its duty of care with regard to Ireland against cyberattack?  After the British NHS suffered a similar attack in 2017, it cost that government &pound;92 million directly to deal with the cost of the attack.  It also cost the British Government &pound;210 million to strength its cybersecurity in the three subsequent years.<\/p> <p> When will patient treatment return?

Like other Deputies on the left, I have raised it continuously any chance I get.  I have participated in every debate on housing to bring to the Taoiseach's attention what is happening.  I will attempt to do that in the next two minutes.  I ask the Taoiseach not to come back and tell me, as he told the leader of Sinn F&eacute;in, about rhetoric and bluster.  I am allergic to it.  I want an acknowledgement that the support of the previous Government and, going back further, Fianna F&aacute;il-led governments, has led to the housing crisis.  If the Taoiseach has had a moment on the road to Damascus, I welcome that.  If he now says we need public housing on public land as an integral part of the solution to the housing emergency, I welcome that.<\/p>  <p>  The Simon Communities of Ireland Locked Out report for April 2021, 18th study, provides a three-day snapshot.  Of the areas studied, six had no properties available.  Galway city had two within the limits of the housing assistance payment, HAP, scheme.  The Government's policy, and that of the previous Government, is predominantly HAP.  Galway has a major housing crisis.  People are waiting 15 years.  A task force was set up in April 2019 and, notwithstanding good updates on Galway,  it has not produced a single comprehensive report to say what the problem is and what is needed.  We have any amount of land in Galway up to 2023, when it will run out.  In the meantime, all those parcels of land are being developed by developers.  We have the docks, maximising the value of the land there.<\/p> <p>There is 17 acres that they are going to sell off to the highest bidder or to the Land Development Agency.  We have Ceannt Station, with valuable land in the middle being developed by a developer.  We have the Dyke Road.  We have land at the airport.  We have land at Nuns' Island.  They are all being developed without a master plan.  Can one imagine that?  Each developer is developing its own site with a little tiny bit of social housing or affordable housing but no master plan or recognition of the emergency.  There is so much that I could say but I will stick rigidly to my time.  I am telling the Taoiseach that there is a housing emergency in Galway.  I am telling him that the market-based approach is not working.  We need a commitment to public housing on public land as an essential ingredient in a solution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051800007#E00500","speaker":"1577","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621344600,"counter":54,"content":"<p>First, I am allergic to bluster and political rhetoric as well.  There is sometimes no shortage of it on Deputy Connolly's side of the House either.  Furthermore, I have been committed to public housing all my life.  All of my political life I have supported the provision of public housing in whatever capacity I have served, and in building local authority houses.  In this Government that was formed in the past ten months there is a very strong commitment to a large social housing programme.  The funding has been provided, with &euro;3.3 billion alone provided in this year's budget for housing.  The issue now is to get the houses delivered and to get them built and in addition to get affordable housing built.  N&iacute;l aon amhras ach go bhfuil g&eacute;arch&eacute;im uaf&aacute;sach maidir leis sin.  Admha&iacute;m &eacute; sin.  Is &eacute; sin an f&aacute;th go bhfuil s&eacute; ina ch&eacute;ad aidhm ag an Rialtas i bhfad n&iacute;os m&oacute; tith&iacute;ochta a chur ar f&aacute;il n&aacute; mar at&aacute; againn anois mar n&iacute;l a dh&oacute;thain &aacute; t&oacute;g&aacute;il againn faoi l&aacute;thair.  Supply is a key issue.  The council in Galway has responsibilities in terms of working towards the creation of a master plan.  The whole purpose of the Land Development Agency is to create a facility whereby we can use public land for the provision of housing.  Deputy Connolly's view seems to be that it should be 100% public housing.  I do not necessarily agree that it should be 100%.  I have no issue with mixed development on any housing site, either State-built or State-supported affordable, which should be facilitated on public land.  Overall, we need to get more houses built than we are currently building.<\/p>  <p>  Last year about 20,000 houses were built, the majority provided by the State.  This year the target was about 25,000, of which 12,750 are to be provided by the Government.  There is no great private sector out there at the moment.  It seems the majority of private sector housing built last year was stand-alone single units across the country.  There is a fundamental issue of getting more houses built overall across the mix between public sector housing, public provision and private sector provision.  I do not mean funds or anything like that: I mean in the normal traditional way where houses were built that were affordable for people to buy as well, because I believe in home ownership.  I do not know whether Deputy Connolly does, but I believe in home ownership and people's right and aspiration to be able to purchase houses at affordable prices.  That is something I support.  That is a huge challenge right now.  It seems to me the fundamental problem facing the country is one of supply.  To that end, the Government is committed to housing being the number one priority as we emerge from Covid-19 and to applying the same type of approach that we applied to Covid to get this housing issue sorted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051800008#F00200","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1621344600,"counter":55,"content":"<p>The fundamental problem is that the Government and previous Governments have commodified housing.

In Galway the task force has told us that the rent crisis has risen 97%.  The Taoiseach should listen to that.  It is more than 97% higher than in 2012, and we have two units, to use the language of the Government, available within the HAP limits.  The Government's policies and ideology have led to a housing crisis from as far back as 2009 when it stopped construction.  I was in Galway when we stopped construction.  Many devices were introduced to keep things off the balance sheet, as opposed to saying housing is a fundamental human right.  We need 100% public housing on public land.

It is my commitment; it is my philosophy.  The Deputy has falsely presented my ideology.  My ideology is not the marketplace and it is not to commoditise housing.  I have just said we are committed to providing unprecedented funding to try to create the largest social housing programme in the history of the State.  That is what our objective is as a Government.  In addition to that, we are providing affordable housing for people who aspire to buy their homes.  We will support them through the State supporting it through a variety of initiatives that the Minister has announced.  We are also providing the first national cost rental programme, which will provide housing for rent at 25% below the market rate.  These are important initiatives for people but to make it all happen, we need more supply.

The people in Kilcummin have been trying to progress this scheme since 2000.  Work was to begin around 2006 or 2007 but the contractor was found not to be able to deliver.  Thus, Kerry County Council decided to tender it out again and a new form of tender was demanded by the Department.  Kerry County Council was unsure, the contractors were unsure and, anyway, the Department of Finance stopped it and withdrew the scheme in 2008 because the country was gone bust, as the Taoiseach knows well.<\/p>  <p>  Promises were being made continuously, year after year, to deliver this scheme.  There was money available to upgrade the road, but the road up to Kilcummin could not be resurfaced because it was anticipated the sewerage scheme would be coming down any week or any month.  As it was supposed to happen very soon, the road resurfacing kept being deferred until last year, when, for the first time, the truth was told that the scheme would not go ahead in 2020, even though it was promised.<\/p>  <p>  To go back to 2013, the Government of the time, including Labour, promised &euro;1.2 million for that scheme.  Promises were again made in early 2019 but I have told the Taoiseach what happened in 2020.  Lo and behold, Irish Water announced last Thursday that the scheme would go ahead in late 2022, with tenders going out at that time but the sting was in the detail because three roads, involving almost 40 houses, are to be cut out of the scheme.  The reason Irish Water gave was that these people did not apply for the scheme.  Nothing could be further from the truth as they were never asked to apply.  It gave another reason, that costs have increased, which is the truth.  There is no point in it trying to blame the people.<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach is here in his bubble every day, talking about building houses with one policy or another, and he is saying that funding is not a problem, and telling people to build in villages or towns, and not to build one-off houses out the country.  The planning regulators are putting every obstacle in their way.  Kilcummin is the largest parish in the country, with all streams and rivers from this area going into the lakes of Killarney.  There are two nursing homes and 210 houses being accommodated, leaving out 40 houses.  There are several villages in Kerry without sewerage schemes - Kilcummin, Currow, Scartaglin, Castleisland and Beaufort.  Several schemes need to be extended or brought up to standard at Castleisland, Brosna, Kenmare and Fenit.<\/p> <p>Commercial or housing developments are being halted because of these inferior schemes. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051800009#G00300","speaker":"1580","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621345500,"counter":60,"content":"<p>Please, please, we cannot have the litany of the saints.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051800010#H00200","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1621345500,"counter":61,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue, particularly for the residents of the area and those who stand to benefit from the Kilcummin sewerage scheme.

The Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, was very keen to allocate substantial resources to waste water treatment plants and to water infrastructure more generally because it is an important infrastructure for house construction as well as for water quality.  It has been a long journey, as the Deputy has outlined, but the scheme has now been sanctioned.  It has got the green light.  The Deputy has said that the tenders will go out in 2022.  I read about this in terms of the exclusion of 40 houses from the tender.  I think it was raised at Kerry County Council recently or by local councillors.  I will engage with the Minister and Oireachtas Members.  I know that the Minister, Deputy Foley, will also be interested in this.  We will talk to Irish Water to get submissions from the residents and see if something can be done here because when we put in infrastructure we want to make it comprehensive.

Hamas should cease firing rockets into Israel and Israel should desist from what I would describe as its wholly disproportionate response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051800014#M00800","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1621347900,"counter":138,"content":"<p>Will the Government expel the ambassador?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051800014#M00900","speaker":"1565"},{"type":"speech","time":1621347900,"counter":139,"content":"<p>The Taoiseach shares my regret at the decision by An Taisce to object to and appeal the planning permission for a continental cheese factory at Belview, near Waterford, a move that is damaging the economy of the south east.<\/p> <p><i>3 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p>  <p>In An Taisce's observations, it does not query the water treatment on site but, rather, it appears to be signalling its ideological resistance to any intensification of the dairy sector in Ireland.

Many Deputies in this House and anybody who pays attention to what goes on at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment will have heard me talk about the issues that are contained in the Bill.  Since the onset of the Covid crisis several issues have arisen for workers who have been laid off or are on short time, such as those in receipt of the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP.  Some workers are unsure whether they can undertake new employment and still be entitled to receive a redundancy payment when the emergency period eventually ends.  Others have outlined how their employers have tried to make them declare themselves as having resigned and thereby involuntarily forgo their redundancy payment.  We are hearing of increasing cases of that happening which is deeply troubling.<\/p><p>Many are concerned that they have lost up to a year of reckonable service for the calculation of any future redundancy payments due to the time spent on PUP.  Thankfully, with the help of the Office of Parliamentary Legal Advisers and the Bills Office, I have managed to combine solutions to these matters into the Redundancy Payments (Lay-off, Short Time and Calculation of Reckonable Service) Bill.  I admit that title does not exactly trip off the tongue, but it is a very important Bill which does a very important job.<\/p><p>In the main, the Bill seeks to deliver a fair calculation of reckonable service for workers on the PUP who may lose significant sums of money in future redundancy payment due to a loophole in the law.  I will further examine this point shortly.<\/p><p>The Bill also seeks to insert a declaratory provision to remove any doubt that where, during a period of lay-off or short time, a worker takes up employment with another employer, that worker will not lose their entitlement to their redundancy payment.  This provision will offer clarity and assurance for many workers who have been offered new employment but are afraid to take it up in case they lose their redundancy entitlements.<\/p><p>The Bill also seeks to make it an offence for an employer to treat an employee as having resigned and thereby forgo their redundancy entitlement.  While this is anecdotal evidence, it is important, nonetheless.  We have heard of cases of people saying that their employer is just assuming that they will not be coming back and assuming that they will forgo their right to any redundancy.  That needs to be tightened up.  The situation has been raised with me by workers, specifically those working in sectors that tend not to be highly unionised.  I take this opportunity to say that the very best protection workers can get in any workplace is to join their trade union and be active in their trade union.  This is not an issue that is exclusive to areas where trade union density is low, but it seems to be a particular issue in that area.<\/p><p>Workers have outlined how unscrupulous employers have tried to con them into making themselves redundant unbeknownst to them and against their wishes.  This would have had the result of these workers losing their redundancy entitlement.  In the main, the Bill seeks to ensure that time spent by workers on lay-off and working short time, such as those in receipt of the PUP, is calculated as reckonable service for the calculation of redundancy entitlement.  I am conscious that the legislation that was introduced was intended to be temporary, but it has now been in place for a long time.  There is an added complication for those workers and it behoves us to deal with that issue.<\/p><p>As it currently stands, due to a loophole in the law, workers could lose out on significant sums of money because the time spent on the PUP is not counted towards their entitlement.

Both sides should stop - both Hamas and the Israeli Government - in the interests of innocent civilians.  From any humanitarian perspective, what is going on is shocking.

It was set up to avoid some of the serious political and logistical differences that were beginning to emerge.  Is it a formal group?  Is it constituted formally or is it just an informal group?  We are hearing today that the vaccine roll-out is moving to those aged between 45 and 49, which is very welcome.  They will be offered the option of receiving AstraZeneca or Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson.  If they do not want one of those vaccines, they may have to wait for an mRNA vaccine.  I welcome this but it is a departure.  I am not saying it is a negative departure, but it is a departure because, obviously, an option is being given to people.  Has this been thought through as regards knock-on effects?  I believe, like the Taoiseach, every citizen should take the vaccine that is offered to them.<\/p><p>I am the most pro-vaccine person one could ever meet but I have to admit there are people, for instance, in the 60 to 70 age group, who did not take the AstraZeneca vaccine as they wanted an option.  I am not saying that is right; I am just saying it is reality.  Some people did not take it because of the 16-week gap between doses of AstraZeneca but now another group is being offered an option.  The Taoiseach can see where others will go with regard to this issue.  Has he thought about this?  Which age group does he expect will be receiving their vaccines by the end of June in order to reach the 82% target and the 55% second dose target?  I presume it will be those aged 25 and up.  <\/p><p>What consideration has the roll-out group given to our contribution to the international effort to get as many people vaccinated as possible?  Has where the State is going to go in that regard towards the end of the year in terms of giving vaccines to other countries been projected and planned?<\/p><p>Finally, I refer to a very important question that I do not think has been raised.  At the beginning of May, the European Medicines Agency, EMA, started to evaluate an application by Pfizer to extend the use of its vaccine to the 12 to 15 age group.  At the start of May, Canada became the first country in the world to approve its use for those aged 12 and up, followed by the United States a week later.  Are we planning for this?  If so, where are we planning for it?  Is this group looking at it or is there a timeframe in place with regard to being able to vaccinate those aged under 16?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051800019#R01600","speaker":"1610"},{"type":"speech","time":1621350600,"counter":224,"content":"<p>I got my notification that I will get my vaccine tomorrow in the Aviva Stadium.

If the Taoiseach wants proof that Israel is an apartheid and racist state, not a normal state, its vaccination programme is a perfect demonstration of that.

To restate the obvious, none of us are protected until all of us are protected.  The crisis in India has not abated.  In fact, the Indian variant is now causing significant worry throughout the UK.  Does the Taoiseach think it is good enough for the major companies such as Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson, Pfizer and AstraZeneca that have paid out $26 billion in dividends to their shareholders in the past nine to 12 months, creating a new wave of vaccine billionaires, which is enough money to vaccinate the entire continent of Africa, not to be willing to share the intellectual property rights?  Will the Taoiseach, as Leader of the Government, along with Joe Biden, going by his indications thus far, go to the World Trade Organization, WTO, or instruct our representation at that organisation or in the EU to go to the WTO and state that the companies must relax the patents on the intellectual property rights over these vaccines?  We must do so because, otherwise, this is vaccine apartheid.  One in every five people in the richer countries have had a vaccination.  Guess how many have been vaccinated in the poorer countries?  It is one in every 500 people.<\/p> <p>That is vaccine apartheid.  We are guilty of supporting it unless the Taoiseach speaks up and instructs our representatives in the EU, and wherever we can make representations in foreign affairs or on the UN Security Council, to state that we support the people's vaccine campaign.

The most recent meeting I had took place on 15 April last when I met with the leaders of the all-island Christian churches, including the Roman Catholic Church, the Church of Ireland, the Presbyterian Church, the Methodist Church and the Irish Council of Churches.  We discussed the ongoing contribution to peacebuilding and the work the churches undertake on an ongoing and daily basis at community level in Northern Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  We had a very constructive discussion on Northern Ireland, which included a shared and grave concern at recent incidents of violence on the streets.  We agreed that the causes of the recent violence are complex, but it is essential that calm, measured and positive leadership be exercised at every level, political, civic and community, for all the people of Northern Ireland.  We also discussed the complexities and sensitivities around the consequences of Brexit and the commitment to uphold the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts.  The church leaders and I recognised the 1921 centenaries as profoundly important and sensitive moments in engaging with the shared history of these islands and agreed it will be important to promote a sensitive, inclusive and respectful approach in the marking of those centenaries still to come.<\/p> <p>I welcomed the church leaders' St. Patrick's Day message reflecting on the centenary of partition and of the formation of Northern Ireland, which highlighted the valuable opportunity they provide to recognise different perspectives on our history in a way that explores what can be learned for today and contributes to reconciliation and healing on the island.  I briefed the church leaders on the Government's shared island initiative.  The church leaders and I recognised the importance of dialogue, engagement and respect for all communities and traditions on these islands.  The church leaders and I agreed the pandemic has posed challenges for all our citizens in terms of mental health and well-being, recognised the importance of faith to the spiritual and mental well-being of many people and communities and looked forward to the time when church services and other in-person activities could resume.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051800020#S03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1458","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621351800,"counter":262,"content":"<p>Is this Questions Nos. 11 to 15?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051800021#T00200","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1621351800,"counter":263,"content":"<p>It is myself, I think.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051800021#T00300","speaker":"1610"},{"type":"speech","time":1621351800,"counter":264,"content":"<p>Are we doing Nos. 5 to 10?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051800021#T00400","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1621351800,"counter":265,"content":"<p>It is No. 11.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051800021#T00500","speaker":"1610"},{"type":"speech","time":1621351800,"counter":266,"content":"<p>Yes.

The question of the national maternity hospital is hugely important to women in this country.  If men could get pregnant, it might have been answered by now, but it certainly has not been answered.  On 25 May, it will be three years since people voted overwhelmingly - more than two thirds - to allow women make a choice on the question on termination of pregnancy in their own country, once and for all.  The legislation that came in after that allows for limited access to abortion.<\/p><p>On the question of the national maternity hospital, I will quote Archbishop Eamon Martin and ask the Taoiseach for clarity on the statement, because he was recently speaking to the church leaders.  He said &ldquo;the carrying out of abortions or morally illicit medical procedures at the [national maternity hospital] would be repugnant&rdquo; to Catholic teaching and &ldquo;regardless of the eventual outcome of the proposed transfer, the church will remain clear in its public statements that there is no place in a maternity hospital for abortion[s].&rdquo;  If that is a statement of the church leader, where does the Taoiseach stand?  What was the point in the long campaign over many decades to repeal the eighth amendment, successfully have a referendum and implement legislation?

Nowhere in the world do Catholic-controlled hospitals provide contraception or perform IVF, surgical sterilisations or abortions.<\/p>  <p>  On top of that, the Minister said there would be private outpatient clinics in this new public hospital and one in six of the consulting rooms would be private.

The Religious Sisters of Charity received conditional permission from the Holy See to transfer their shareholding to the new company established to facilitate the provision of health services.  The conditional permission cites Canon Law, which is astonishing and totally inappropriate.  It has previously been reported that the Vatican initially opposed the Religious Sisters of Charity's decision to transfer their interest to the new company and the former Archbishop of Dublin, Diarmuid Martin, played a critical role in securing the conditional permission.  Has the Taoiseach discussed this matter with the new Archbishop of Dublin, Dr. Dermot Farrell, or raised the omission of a public interest director from the board of the new company?

The existing situation in terms of women's health in the National Maternity Hospital, Holles Street, is not what it should be.

We need to keep that in mind as we continue to debate this issue because it seems to me that over the past five to six years it has been exhaustively engaged in by a variety of contributors.  There is a necessity, an imperative, to get this modern facility in place.  The decision to move to the St. Vincent's campus in the first instance was a clinical medical one in order to have a maternity hospital adjacent to a tertiary hospital for the betterment of women and newborns, to allow for health interventions that might be urgently required.  The most successful example of that is CUH where the maternity hospital is on site.  I was Minister for Health when that maternity hospital was constructed on the grounds of the hospital, and we have not had a similar example built since.  That was in the 2000s.  We do need to get on with it.<\/p> <p> I fully accept the points that have been made about the independence of the new hospital and that all State policies would be followed through without question in the policy of the hospital and the operational working of the hospital.  That is something that I would not just be very keen on, but insistent on.  I will revert to the Minister for Health on the issues people have raised with a view first to conveying their views but also seeking to get a resolution once and for all because the current situation is not at all optimal in terms of women&rsquo;s health.

The road to that moment had been a long and arduous one, but at its end was a profound and historic truth.  Each of the ten was innocent.  Each was unarmed.  Every rumour or allegation about the victims being anything other than ordinary, decent private citizens was powerfully and categorically dismissed.  The ten people who lost their lives in August 1971 were innocent victims, civilians, community members, who were either in the wrong place at the wrong time or in a number of cases, were unable to pass by and turn a blind eye to someone in distress or wounded who was calling out for their help.<\/p>  <p>  The days and months that followed the launch of Operation Demetrius on 9 August 1971 are some of the darkest in the history of this island.  The families of the Ballymurphy victims battled not just with the overwhelming grief that comes with losing a loved one but also with the false assertions and rumour that accompanied their deaths, which Mrs. Justice Keegan definitively dispelled last week.  She told the world what each of those families had known all of the time.  The bravery, determination and dedication of the Ballymurphy families in their dogged pursuit of justice in the face of persistent adversity is an example to us all.  Throughout this process, successive Governments have worked with the Ballymurphy families and supported them in their campaign to establish the facts of what happened.  The time I spent with them on the ground in Belfast while I was Minister for Foreign Affairs stays with me to this day.<\/p>  <p>  On behalf of the Government, I extend my deepest condolences to the Ballymurphy families for what happened during those terrible days in August 1971 and for the grief they have suffered.  There is no better tribute to the families' work than to highlight the findings of last Tuesday's report following an inquest that lasted almost three years and to read it now into the record of this House.<\/p>  <p>  In her report, Mrs. Justice Keegan reviewed the ten deaths as part of five \"incidences\" that took place between 9 and 11 August 1971.  The first incident concerned the deaths of Fr. Hugh Mullan and Francis Quinn on 9 August.  Both were innocent and unarmed.  There was evidence that Fr. Mullan was waving a white item as he came to the aid of another man who had been shot.  Mrs. Justice Keegan used the word that those who knew Fr. Mullan have repeated time and again over the past 50 years: he was a \"peacemaker\".  She determined that both had been shot by the British Army and that the use of force had been \"clearly disproportionate\" and unjustified, given that the soldiers were firing from a protected position, that there were civilians fleeing from the violence, and that Fr. Mullan was waving a white flag.<\/p>  <p>  The second incident involved the deaths of Noel Philips, Joan Connolly, John Murphy and Daniel Teggart.  All were innocent, unarmed and posing no threat.  Mrs. Justice Keegan was satisfied that they were shot by the British Army from Henry Taggart hall.  The use of force by the army was clearly disproportionate given the number of civilians around and as soldiers were in a protected position in the hall.  Mrs. Justice Keegan said that these were innocent people, and their deaths had been a tragedy to their families.<\/p>  <p>  The third incident regarded the death of Edward Doherty.  Mr. Doherty was an innocent man who posed no threat and had come across the events on the Whiterock Road while passing by.  Mr. Doherty was killed by soldier M3, using disproportionate force, and, as Mrs. Justice Keegan noted, the actions of soldier M3 were not properly examined or investigated at the time.<\/p>  <p>  The fourth incident involved the deaths of Joseph Corr and John Laverty.  Mrs. Justice Keegan found that Mr. Laverty was shot in the back while crouching or prone.  Both were shot by the British Army, with no valid justification provided for soldiers opening fire.  The men were not armed or acting in a manner that could be perceived as posing a threat.  Mrs. Justice Keegan noted that no adequate investigation was subsequently carried out by the Royal Military Police.  Mrs. Justice Keegan stated that it had been wrong to describe the two men as gunmen at the time and that rumour should be dispelled.<\/p> <p> The fifth incident involved the death of John McKerr.  Mr. McKerr was an entirely innocent man who was shot indiscriminately on the street.  He was not armed or behaving in any way that would explain why he was shot.  He had no associations with the IRA.  Mrs. Justice Keegan could not make a definitive finding as to who shot Mr. McKerr and from where the shot had been fired.  However, she described the inadequacy of the original investigation as shocking.  Not one statement was taken from the military in the area, the scene was not sealed and the bullet was not recovered.  There had been an abject failing by the authorities to inquire into the death of an innocent civilian on the streets.  This failure had hampered the inquest greatly and was the striking feature of the case which Mrs. Justice Keegan recorded in the strongest of terms.<\/p> <p> This is the truth about the ten civilians who were killed in Ballymurphy and this is what history will record.  I would also like to pay my condolences to the family of Paddy McCarthy, who died of a heart attack on 11 August 1971, following an altercation with soldiers in Ballymurphy, and whose death did not form part of this inquest.<\/p> <p> It has been a long, hard struggle for truth and justice.  As John Teggart, whose father Danny was killed, said last week, the families sat through 100 days of evidence during the inquest and relived the horror of what happened to their loved ones, day in, day out.  Mr. Teggart also pointed out that many family members, witnesses and campaigners have died along the half-century road to justice.  It was also a journey marked by entirely unfounded speculation and suspicion.  As Mrs. Justice Keegan noted in her findings, the blackening of these names led to some victims' families being isolated and enduring hardship in their own communities.  Grief and loss was compounded by shame and a palpable sense of injustice as their loved ones were murdered and posthumously defamed.  Briege Voyle, daughter of Joan Connolly, spoke bravely last week about the impact on families' mental health and how trauma effectively ruined so many lives beyond the ten who were murdered.  She noted her father, left to raise eight children alone, never recovered from Joan's death.  Eileen McKeown, daughter of Joseph Corr, spoke about how the hearts, hopes and dreams of her family were \"shattered\" by his killing.  John McKerr was a former British army soldier who lost his hand in the Second World War and was proud of his military service.  His daughter, Anne Ferguson, spoke at her family's shock and sense of betrayal at his killing, as he was such a proud military man.<\/p> <p> It should not have taken this long to establish the full truth about Joan, Joseph, John and all the Ballymurphy victims.  I hope, though, that the families can take solace from the full truth finally being told and from this part of their journey coming to an end.  The findings of the inquest were very significant and there must be a recognition of the appalling hurt caused to the families.<\/p> <p> When I met with Prime Minister Johnson on Friday, we discussed the inquest results and the impact that the lack of a proper and impartial investigation into the killings has had on the families over the past 50 years.  I also discussed with the Prime Minister the acknowledgement and apologies that have already been made.  I emphasised the importance of the British Government responding in a way that recognises the gravity of the findings, which categorically established that ten innocent people were killed, and in a way that respects the wishes of the families.  Following that discussion, I would hope that all opportunities will be taken to convey and underline that acknowledgement of the seriousness of these findings.<\/p> <p> Prime Minister Johnson and I also spoke about the wider issue of legacy and of how best to secure progress and answers for the many other families who, like those in Ballymurphy, or in Kingsmill, or in Birmingham, have been pursuing truth and justice for far too many years.  Yesterday was the 47th anniversary of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, another of the darkest days of the conflict, and those families' search for the full facts of what happened to their loved ones continues also.  I was clear with the Prime Minister that every family bereaved should have access to an effective investigation and to a process of justice, regardless of the perpetrator.  The Stormont House Agreement framework allows for the crucial elements we need - investigations, truth recovery, oral history, reconciliation and acknowledgement.  While the Government is ready to engage and work with the British Government and the Northern Ireland parties in relation to any concerns around aspects of the implementation of the Stormont House Agreement, I made clear that this must be a collaborative and collective process and must have the needs of victims at its heart.  I was clear that unilateral action cannot be the basis of any sustainable way forward.  We will continue to engage with the UK Government on this.<\/p> <p> While the terrible details of these unjustifiable killings are a sombre reminder of the dark years that this island endured, and while many challenges still remain, I strongly believe that we are in a far better place today.  I would also like to say that I do not accept the argument made by some that the campaigns and advocacy by victims and survivors in Northern Ireland in some way delays or undermines the work of reconciliation.  The work and advocacy of so many of those who lost their loved ones, including the Ballymurphy families, is about bringing truth to light and bringing accountability.  I have met many of those working for victims who are at the very forefront of the work of reconciliation, who show dignity and generosity and vision for the future.  It is all the stronger because it comes from a deep-seated determination that such violence should never be allowed to re-emerge on this island again.<\/p> <p> The Good Friday Agreement has allowed communities in Northern Ireland to come together in a spirit of empathy and reconciliation.  This was evident again in the past week, as politicians, community leaders and citizens from all communities came out to welcome the inquest report and stand in solidarity with the Ballymurphy families.  Let us continue to move forward, utilising the full potential of the Good Friday Agreement, to deliver further reconciliation and ensure that other families, across all communities, like those in Ballymurphy, have their day when the truth finally emerges and is publicly acknowledged.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051800022#U01500","speaker":"1458","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621353000,"counter":298,"content":"<p>&ldquo;All entirely innocent of any wrongdoing&rdquo; - these were the words of the coroner last Tuesday confirming what so many had known for 50 years, that the ten people shot dead in Ballymurphy, west Belfast, by the parachute regiment in 1971 were all innocent civilians, all victims of British state murder, all ordinary people living their lives, all people with hopes and dreams for the future, all taken away from their families, friends and communities in the cruellest of ways.<\/p>  <p>  This massacre occurred against the backdrop of the introduction of internment without trial, against the backdrop of sectarian pogroms waged against nationalists, as the British and Orange states violently lashed back against the just demand for civil rights.  It was against this backdrop that the parachute regiment entered Ballymurphy, or the Murph, as it is called, and murdered Francis Quinn, Fr. Hugh Mullan, Noel Phillips, Joan Connolly, Danny Teggart, Joseph Murphy, Edward Doherty, John Laverty, Joseph Corr and John James McKerr.<\/p> <p>Joan Connolly was shot as she ran to the aid of Noel Connolly.  Fr. Mullan, the parish priest, was shot while waving a white cloth as he ran to help another victim.<br\/><br\/>Some of those who were killed were shot in the back.  Some were shot as they crawled or crouched for safety.  Pat McCarthy, the 11th victim not covered by the inquest, died of a heart attack, not after an altercation but after a para put an empty gun in his mouth and pulled the trigger.  These killings were not accidents.  They were the outworking of premeditated British policy, proven by the fact that the very same regiment would shoot dead another 14 innocent civilians on the streets of Derry less than a year later.  <br\/><br\/>In the aftermath of the Ballymurphy massacre, the soldiers congratulated each other in full belief that their Government would protect them, cover up for them.  They patted each other on the back for a job well done, such was the contempt they felt for the lives they had taken.  For decades, the black propaganda from British authorities was that those shot in Ballymurphy were armed and posed a threat, a narrative propped up by the lack of any meaningful investigation into the killings.  They were not armed.  They posed no threat.  These have been exposed for the shameful lies that they were, exposed as a cover-up of the horrors the parachute regiment inflicted on the people of Ballymurphy.<br\/><br\/>Now the dark clouds of lies have been parted and the truth has been set free.  We would have never got here if it was not for the families.  Everything they went through was summed up in the words of Alice Harper whose father Danny Teggart  was shot 14 times during the massacre.  She said: <\/p><blockquote>\tWe&rsquo;ve waited a long time, 50 years is a long time to wait.  We always knew they were innocent, but now it has been proven, and for what our family has been through, not just our family but all the families, I&rsquo;m overwhelmed today.  It&rsquo;s just a relief now that we can shout from the rooftops that our Daddy was innocent. <\/blockquote> <p>Her brother John said:<\/p><blockquote>\tWe have corrected history today.  The inquest confirmed that the soldiers who came to the area supposedly to protect us &hellip; turned their guns on us. <\/blockquote> <p>On Thursday, I was with the families in Ballymurphy.  It is a meeting I will remember for the rest of my life.  It was humbling to be with them and to hear how they felt following the verdict.  I have always been and remain in awe of their courage, resilience and above all else, perhaps, their stamina.  I am in awe of their humanity.  It is hard to fathom what it must have been like for these families to wake up every morning since 1971 and to feel the immense loss and injustice, to see the empty chair, to think about the beautiful lives ripped away from them and then to face the torrent of lies about their loved ones and still be able to carry on.  Mothers, fathers, brothers and sisters, against overwhelming odds and for 50 years, found in themselves an inspirational reservoir of strength to keep going.  Some have grown up looking for the truth, some have grown old and some have died, heartbroken, without it, but they refused to allow the propaganda to stand.  They refused to allow their loved ones to be forgotten and with unwavering determination they cut through the lies of the British state.  They gave it everything they had and they prevailed.<br\/><br\/>The result of the inquest is bitter sweet for the families.  The botched apology offered to them by Boris Johnson has caused hurt and anger.  The apology was silent on the massacre.  It did not mention the paras.  As Mary Kate Quinn, the niece John Laverty, described it, it was the apology of a government &quot;more concerned about laying the groundwork for amnesty legislation.&quot;  Ms Quinn was referring to the confirmation of the British Government that it will now attempt to block the families from getting justice.  This it will do in open defiance of the Stormont House Agreement, an international agreement signed with the Irish Government on dealing with the legacy of the past.  On the very same day as the Ballymurphy families saw their loved ones declared innocent, on the day the door to the truth was finally opened, the door to justice was slammed in their faces.  <br\/><br\/>The Stormont House Agreement is about facilitating the pursuit of truth and justice in a balanced, transparent, inclusive and fair manner.  It is wholly unacceptable that the British Government is set to walk away from these obligations and instead put in place rogue legislation that is unashamedly designed avoid accountability.  It seems that those paras who patted each other on the back in 1971 were right after all: their government, their system, will do absolutely everything it can to protect them.  This is wholly about stopping the Ballymurphy families and so many other families across the board from having justice for their loved ones.<br\/><br\/>When I spoke to the Ballymurphy families last week they made it clear that amnesties must be off the table, and they are absolutely right.  Those involved in British state murder of innocent civilians must be held to account.  Boris Johnson and the British Government must face up to that.  Britain can no longer continue hiding its dirty war in Ireland.  Proceeding with an amnesty at the expense of pursuing accountability will have profound and fundamental implications for confidence in the rule of law and for the administration of justice.  Making agreements is important in our peace process but keeping agreements is even more so.  The British Government cannot be allowed to tear up Stormont House and wash its hands of the families right to justice.  It is wrong, disrespectful, deeply hurtful and it is not on.  <br\/><br\/>In February, members of this D&aacute;il stood as one in calling for the British Government to honour its commitment to introduce legislation to implement the Stormont House Agreement to protect the right to truth and justice.  The cynical behaviour on the part of Mr. Johnson and his Government must be forcefully challenged by our Government in Dublin.  Dublin must now stand four-square behind the Ballymurphy families and all of those waiting decades for the truth about what happened to their loved ones.  The message must go clearly from this Chamber that this will not stand, because the Ballymurphy families are very clear that their journey is not over, far from it.  They are intent on justice.  They are taking this stand not just for their own families or for their own community of the Murph, they are taking this stand for everyone.  After 50 years fighting for the truth to be set free, after 50 years seeking vindication for their loved ones, after 50 years of an inspirational struggle, it is the very least they deserve.<br\/><br\/>The Ballymurphy families never gave up.  The Ballymurphy families gave in and now they must have justice.  It is the job of the Irish Government to ensure that Boris Johnson and his Tory Government cannot deny them that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051800023#V00200","speaker":"1466","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621353600,"counter":300,"content":"<p>The coroner Mrs. Justice Keegan reported after the longest running inquiry to date in Northern Ireland.  Her findings could not have been clearer or more stark that over three shocking days in August of 1971, the ten victims who were shot and killed in the Ballymurphy area of west Belfast were entirely innocent and their killings were unjustified.  Unjustified was as far as the coroner could legally go.  Their names must be individually recalled in the House: Francis Quinn, Fr. Hugh Mullan, Noel Phillips, Joan Connolly, Daniel Teggart, Joseph Murphy, Edward Doherty, John Laverty, Joseph Corr and John McKerr.<\/p>  <p>  Now that truth is properly in the public domain, it must be appropriately responded to by the British Prime Minister and Government.<\/p> <p>In a letter addressed collectively to the families on 12 May, Prime Minister Johnson expressed his sorrow over what had happened.  What is appropriate and proper is for him to travel to Belfast and extend his government&rsquo;s apology directly to the families of the victims.  He should also make a personal statement to the House of Commons, as a previous UK Prime Minister, Mr. David Cameron, did following the Bloody Sunday inquiry.  It is also required that the measures in the painstaking work completed in the Stormont House Agreement be implemented now, particularly the paragraphs focused on dealing with legacy issues, namely paragraphs 21 to 55.<\/p> <p> The heartbreaking legacy of decades of violence on our island and in Britain has left deep and lasting wounds.  Those wounds stretch into many households.  The Taoiseach referred to the Dublin and Monaghan bombings.  My sister and her husband were seriously injured in the Film Centre, O&rsquo;Connell Bridge House, in 1972.  I remember the impact that had on our family.  I recall going, as a young person, to see both of them in the Mater Hospital.  It was surrounded by troops and garda&iacute; because the chief of staff of the Provisional IRA, Se&aacute;n Mac St&iacute;of&aacute;in, was on hunger strike there at the time.<\/p> <p> We need a way of addressing all these hurts.  I would in no way want to place my family&rsquo;s hurt in parallel with the grievous hurt of people who have lost family members and, worse, whose memories have been trampled upon, whose reputations have been traduced and who have been lied against for decades.  That must come to an end.<\/p> <p> Many thoughtful proposals examining processes that have worked to some degree internationally have been advanced.  As an Oireachtas, perhaps we need to see whether we can build future agreement on a way to supplement the paragraphs in the Stormont House Agreement, that is, those dealing with the past, implementation and reconciliation.<\/p> <p> Years do not diminish a family&rsquo;s pain.  In this regard, let us consider the individual families&rsquo; reactions after the vindication, decades later, of their reputation, having carried the burden of hurt for so long.  To have final vindication is so important, redeeming and meaningful for the families.  We really do have to struggle to find a way of achieving this appropriately for the many others touched upon by the Taoiseach in his speech and so many more who are struggling with the pain in silence right now.  The denial of truth merely adds immeasurably to the great pain being endured.  Therefore, while we heartily welcome the findings of the Ballymurphy inquiry and call on the British Government to fully react to it appropriately and properly, we need to bring the relief experienced by the Ballymurphy families to so many other families who are enduring great hurt.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051800024#W00200","speaker":"1620","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621354200,"counter":302,"content":"<p>I am here as a Deputy from County Louth, a Border county.  Having lived there all my life, I know how difficult, sad and tragic the loss of any life is on our island.  My county has suffered greatly in many ways.  I am also Chairman of the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.  Our members have agreed unanimously that the families of the victims of the Ballymurphy massacre should come to the Oireachtas next Tuesday to talk to us about how they feel about what happened to their relatives and what must happen.  I hope we will reach an all-party consensus on that.<\/p>  <p>  Like other Members, I would like to record the names of those who died: Frank Quinn, Fr. Hugh Mullan, Noel Phillips, Joan Connolly, Danny Teggart, Joseph Murphy, Edward Doherty, John Laverty, Joseph Corr and John James McKerr, and Paddy McCarthy, who died separately.<\/p>  <p>  I agree with what we are all saying here, that is, that the fight for 50 years to get justice and clarity is not fully resolved.  The decision of the coroner, Mrs. Justice Siobhan Keegan, absolutely vindicated the battle that was fought for so many decades to ensure the innocence of all those who died on the day of the Ballymurphy massacre would be established clearly for all time.  There is no hiding place from the truth.  The truth is that the victims have been absolutely vindicated.  The inquest was the longest ever held in Northern Ireland.  Mrs. Justice Keegan, when announcing the outcome of the inquiry, was very clear in pointing out the difference between the general nature of the evidence given by the British army, which was shown not to be specific or clear, and the clear, specific evidence given by the local witnesses.  It was said that the actions of the British army went unchallenged and led later to the appalling vista of Bloody Sunday, where again the parachute regiment ran riot, with many innocent people dying as a result.<\/p>  <p>  I am aware of and respect what is held sacred by the families.  The Taoiseach and Deputy Howlin referred to the 47th anniversary of the Dublin bombings.  A lady from Drogheda, Concepta Dempsey, was murdered in those bombings.  She was a 65-year-old lady who came from a very staunch Fine Gael family in Drogheda.  In fact, Mrs. Kathleen Dempsey was the first female mayor of Drogheda.  What happened was a tragedy.<\/p>  <p>  The reality is that the Stormont House Agreement is crystal clear on the way forward to deal with the historic issues that arise as a result of all the troubles in the North.  The historical investigations unit, whose points were clear and well thought-out, brought comfort to all those who signed up to that agreement, namely the Irish Government, the British Government and, indeed, the parties in Northern Ireland at the time.  The agreement is victim-centred.  It is about justice but also reconciliation.  Reconciliation cannot happen without a due apology.  There has not been a clear apology as far as the families are concerned.  Many people, including me, have noted what the UK Prime Minister has not done; he has not met the families personally and he has not offered an apology in a contrite and humble way, which he is obliged to do.  He is obliged to apologise to them for the hurt and the awful wrong done to them.  Until that happens, there will not be full closure for the families.  They are entitled to and need it.  It is what the country needs.<\/p>  <p>  We face new circumstances in Northern Ireland and major changes, including demographic changes, that the next decade or decades will bring.  The unionist parties in the North will soon be led by two new, separate leaders.  There is a need for a new relationship between all of us on this island.  I welcome very much the initiative of the Taoiseach and his Government in respect of a shared island unit.<\/p> <p>The way forward can only and will only be by working together and reaching out.  One of the problems we have in this country is meeting and understanding each other.  The most significant problem we face on our committee, although I know it is not the first time the Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement has had this issue, is relating to, and meeting in the appropriate location to talk to, our unionist colleagues in the North of our country.  There is no reluctance on our side to meet with them.  There is no set agenda or prerequisite.  We want to hear, listen and understand.  We want to reconcile the traditions on this island in a constructive, positive way, recognising and respecting all on this island, whatever views they hold, be they Catholic, Protestant, any other religion or none, whether they are unionist, nationalist, Alliance or whatever.  We want to work together and build up our shared island and our economy North-South, and emphasise the progress with cross-Border education, health, transport, energy policy and so on.  That is our future together.<\/p> <p> This opportunity is one for all of us to renew our commitment to justice, peace and reconciliation, and to make sure of that for the families who suffered so greatly as a result of the death of their loved ones in that appalling massacre in Ballymurphy.  This is our opportunity to look to all of the people on this island, especially the unionist population and their new political leaders.  We want reconciliation and understanding.  We want closure on this past.  I know that all of us on our committee are more than anxious to meet with these families and to show our respect for them and the fight and battle they have fought for all of us.  They represent what we need to reconcile.  We need to make sure that there is never a repetition of those vile and awful scenes that happened in Ballymurphy, in Derry on Bloody Sunday, and so on.  We look forward together to a new future and the British Government cannot be allowed and must not renege on the promises and commitments it signed up to in the Stormont House Agreement.  It is essential that the truth comes out and that justice is served.  Reconciliation will not occur until that is done.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051800025#X00200","speaker":"1598","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621354800,"counter":304,"content":"<p>Almost 50 years ago, the parachute regiment murdered 11 people in Ballymurphy estate in Belfast.  For 50 years, the families of those murdered by British soldiers have fought for truth and justice.  It has taken almost 50 years to prove that every one of the victims was an innocent civilian killed as an oppressive state's forces swept through the North, interning Catholic men of all ages without trial and without any cause bar where they lived.  The truth has now been laid bare for all to see.  It has been many years since I first met the families of those killed in August 1971.  Today we remember those who did not live to see their relatives' innocence proven and their crusade for justice vindicated.  It is a pity that the families' pain mixed with joy at the coroner's verdict was met with such a cruel, indifferent non-apology from the British Prime Minister, Boris Johnson.<\/p>  <p>  Johnson's Government wants to legislate away the atrocities committed by crown forces in the North of Ireland and pretend they never happened.  It wants to cover up the role of the British army in the conflict and to legislate and put current and former British soldiers beyond justice and international law.  The British Government has no intention of fulfilling its obligations in the North.  The last thing it wants is truth or reconciliation.  The Ballymurphy families, the Finucane family, and the victims of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings have been forced to campaign for decades for the truth to come out about those atrocities.<\/p>  <p>  Yesterday marked the 47th anniversary of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, another act of violence on this island aided and abetted by the British state.  Thirty-four people were killed that day, the most at any point in the conflict.  The families believe that British security forces and their agents provided logistics to aid the bombers that day but every attempt to uncover the truth has been stonewalled by successive British Governments.  The British Government maintains its public position of silence and repeats its worn-out, rehearsed words of denial.  It refuses to release the relevant files and information that it has on the attacks that killed 34 innocent people, including an unborn child, and injured and maimed almost 300.<\/p>  <p>  Every death in the conflict was a tragedy.  No family's grief counts for less than any other.  There should never be a hierarchy of victims but there clearly is when it comes to those who were murdered by British state forces.  For wounds to heal and for growth and progress to really flourish, we need a truth and reconciliation process that deals with the past.  This was agreed in the Stormont House talks by both Governments and all political parties.  If we allow those wrongs to fester and remain, we will never collectively move on from the hurt and rancour that this type of pain inflicts over generations.  The cycle of state violence to oppress a people and try to make them cower in submission is not a new tactic, but it is one that seldom works.  It breeds resistance and leads to further conflict.  We saw it in Ballymurphy, in Derry following Bloody Sunday, in Dublin and in Monaghan.  We see it today in Gaza and East Jerusalem.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051800026#Y00200","speaker":"1571"},{"type":"speech","time":1621354800,"counter":305,"content":"<p>Today, I join colleagues across the Chamber in talking of truth and the manner in which it should manifest in justice.  We often hear the phrase \"justice delayed is justice denied\".  For the families whose loved ones have been killed by the forces of a state, the importance of justice cannot be overstated.  It is necessary for families and communities to come to terms with events that turned their world upside down.  Justice is meant to shine a light.  It is supposed to get to the truth and it is supposed to work to ensure that we hold those responsible accountable.  Justice is the only pathway we have in a civil society that can bring us to truth and reconciliation.<\/p>  <p>  In 1971, the British army implemented a policy of internment across Northern Ireland.  People suspected of being members of the IRA could be arrested and detained without trial.  A number of raids were carried out and in all, more than 1,000 people were interned without trial.  Justice is one of the main pillars that underpins democracy.  We understand justice to mean that those accused of a criminal offence would have access to due process, to a speedy trial, to a defence team and the outcome of a trial would be determined by a jury of their peers.  Where was the justice?<\/p>  <p>  Justice delayed is justice denied and the Ballymurphy massacre is a clear example of how the British state, the RUC and the British army colluded and acted to ensure that justice was denied.  Generations of families and entire communities were forced to grieve for their people while having to fight for answers, fight for truth and fight for accountability.  Where was the justice?  During an internment raid in Ballymurphy, Belfast, in August 1971, ten civilians were shot and killed by the British army, including a priest who was giving the last rites.  Another man died from a heart attack shortly after a gun was placed in his mouth by a soldier of the British forces.  The following year, in 1972, an inquest returned an open verdict on all those killed.  Where was their justice?<\/p>  <p>  Just a few weeks ago, the families finally got a fair inquest which was held to reconsider what happened in Ballymurphy in August 1971.  This time, a coroner found that all those killed were innocent and that the killings were without justification.  Yet in the same week, the British Prime Minister was considering an amnesty whereby no soldier could be held accountable for their actions prior to the Good Friday Agreement of 1998 and so I ask again, where is the justice?<\/p>  <p>  Despite the clear and obvious evidence which demonstrated what had happened, lies were told, stories were spun, the innocent were blamed and those who killed were allowed to continue with the brutality against people, families and communities across Northern Ireland for years to come.  If we are ever to come to terms with our past and to deal with legacy issues that took place in all communities, we need to know the truth.  We, the communities, the victims and their families deserve to know the truth.<\/p> <p>We need to know what took place, what happened, who decided what should happen and who carried that out.  We must understand this as political violence and recognise that civilians and the British army cannot be equated.  We cannot and should not forget the past but, if we are ever to move on, we cannot just leave it behind.  We have to come to terms with what happened and build towards a peaceful future together.  We must learn from the mistakes made and the atrocities committed in the past to ensure they never happen again.  There are many across our island who speak and search for truth.<\/p> <p> A point was already made about the 47th anniversary of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings and the families who still seek truth.  I will raise the case of another individual, a friend of mine, who is being treated in a grotesquely unfair manner on our island.  Will our Government demand that the British Government immediately remove the current 84-year embargo on all files relating to the case of the Reavey brothers?  Three innocent young brothers were murdered at Whitecross, County Armagh, on 4 January 1976 by the so-called Glenanne gang, simply because they were Catholics.  Will our Government demand that the British Government apologise to the innocent brother, Eugene Reavey, for the scurrilous smear campaign deliberately orchestrated against him for decades?  In the history of what became known as the Troubles, it would be difficult to find anyone who has suffered as much while maintaining as much dignity as Eugene Reavey.  He is a true champion of peace and a co-founder of the Truth and Reconciliation Platform who, like the families of the Ballymurphy massacre victims, deserves his truth, his redemption and his apology.  He deserves to be held up as a beacon of truth in our country.<\/p> <p> I urge the Taoiseach and this Government to insist that the British Government reconsider its version of an amnesty and instead revert to the Stormont House Agreement, agreed and established to deliver necessary mechanisms capable of dealing with our history and shared trauma.  Only this can ensure that the rights of the victims, all those who died, who were injured, who were interned or who witnessed violence as adults or as children, to truth and reconciliation are vindicated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051800026#Y00300","speaker":"1560","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621355400,"counter":307,"content":"<p>I join with my colleagues in the Chamber in recognising the strength and dignity of the families of Ballymurphy in demanding justice over all of these years.  So many other families are in similar situations and are still yearning for justice.  References have been made to the anniversary of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings.  In recent months, we heard news of demands being made of the British Government with regard to the reopening of the inquest into the murder of Pat Finucane.  We have seen the British Government avoid, as best it can, calls for justice, transparency and openness at every turn.  We have seen obfuscation through official inquiries, which have been described here as blocking the truth.  We have seen refusals by the British Government and state to release papers and archives.  We have seen the hard drives of the Cory inquiry seized and destroyed while the inquiry was still in progress.  These are really nasty and insidious things that are ultimately blocking the truth.  As everyone here has said, this is a trauma and truth and reconciliation are needed to help us all move forward.  I have been talking to my colleagues in the Green Party in Northern Ireland a lot with regard to the need to address this trauma.<\/p>  <p>  While holding Westminster to account is incredibly important as it is Westminster that is most responsible for blocking this, we also need to look to ourselves.  The Irish Government signed up to the Stormont House Agreement.  We are co-guarantors of the Good Friday Agreement.  The independent commission on information retrieval that makes up part of this will need legislation in both London and Dublin if it is to work properly.  Why are we waiting on a government in London that has shown time and again that it does not want the truth to come out and that is seeking to block the truth?  I have been asking the Minister for Justice about this and I have been told that ongoing contact is being made with our British counterparts.  No timeline has been given.  There is no suggestion as to when this legislation can be implemented.<\/p>  <p>  We need to take responsibility ourselves and move ahead, even if it means moving ahead without the British Government.  We need to move ahead to start the conversation about what the independent commission on information retrieval will look like and how it will function.  By starting that conversation, we can put greater pressure on the British Government to come with us, to act and to seek out the truth to help address the trauma.  We need to take responsibility ourselves.  The Irish Government, as a co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement, needs to push ahead and help the relatives in their fight for truth and justice.  We can do that by pushing ahead with our own developments in respect of the independent commission agreed to in the Stormont House Agreement, to which we signed up.  If others will not play their part, we should still be seen to carry out our role.  Throughout the Brexit process, the Government of the time spoke a lot about how Northern Ireland should never be left behind again.  This is another situation in which Northern Ireland should not be left behind.  We need to play our part even if others do not.  We need to move ahead without those who just want to block any truth and, ultimately, any reconciliation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051800027#Z00200","speaker":"1570"},{"type":"speech","time":1621355400,"counter":308,"content":"<p>The findings of Mrs. Justice Keegan are harrowing to read and, I am sure, deeply painful for the family members, 50 years on.  Mrs. Justice Keegan's words declare that those involved, members and loved ones of those families, were entirely innocent.  This provides some justice to those who have spent decades seeking it.  That the British Government has had it in its power to do this for decades and did nothing is truly shameful.  The attempts to blacken the names of the relatives of these families in the aftermath were shameful.  That the British Government forced these families into a 50-year fight for truth and acknowledgement of those killed is shameful.  Their families and community knew all along that they were innocent but, in the interests of justice, they wanted this acknowledged publicly, something which many other victims have yet to secure.  The verdict this week should ensure that all parties act with haste to address this failure in respect of those other victims.<\/p>  <p>  The inquest highlighted acts of basic inhumanity when describing how Joan Connolly, a mother of eight, was shot and left to lie injured in a field and to die before being transported to a nearby hall.  We read this alongside the story of Fr. Hugh Mullan, shot while waving a white cloth and trying to aid an injured man, and the stories of all the other victims of that three-day period in 1971.<\/p>  <p>  In light of all of this, the actions of the present-day British Government seem all the more crass and irresponsible.  Prime Minister Johnson has failed to apologise publicly to these families and, on election day, leaked plans to introduce an effective amnesty for British soldiers.  This is shameful indeed.  It flies in the face of the peace process and the Stormont House Agreement.  While the British Government says that it only wants to exempt British soldiers, we all know this cannot be done without extending the amnesty to all of those who were involved in violence.  That would be a blatant violation of the Stormont House Agreement and devastating for those who pursue truth and who face the prospect of never being able to seek justice.<\/p>  <p>  In 2019, I had the privilege of welcoming the families of the Birmingham bombing victims to Dublin.  They also met with an tUachtar&aacute;n and the then T&aacute;naiste.  They want justice too.  They want the British Government to hold a public inquiry.  They want the murderers of their relatives to face justice.  They have been informed by the British Government that they specifically lie outside the legacy provisions of the Good Friday Agreement.  I believe the Irish Government can help in this case.  Justice 4 the 21, with which I met again last week, has given me a list of documents which the Irish Government can release which would help them in their pursuit of truth.<\/p>  <p>  There are many other victims who seek justice.  The anniversaries this week of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings and of the murders of Gavin McShane and Shane McArdle in Armagh are further reminders that legacy issues must be dealt with.  The Ballymurphy families endured for 50 years.  We must not allow others wait any longer.  All parties to the peace process must contribute to a solution.  In particular, the parties in Northern Ireland must work together and work the provisions of the Good Friday Agreement in order to bring forward solutions to support the families of victims and to put pressure on both Governments, and particularly the British Government.

And that 50 years has destroyed our lives.\"  These are the words of Carmel Quinn, whose brother, John Laverty, was murdered in 1971.  It is important to put on the D&aacute;il record just how horrific that atrocity was.  Between 9 and 11 August 1971, more than 600 soldiers entered the Ballymurphy area of west Belfast.  During that three-day period, 11 people were brutally murdered.  Last week, Mrs. Justice Siobhan Keegan stated that, in every single case, the death was not adequately investigated.  That was because there was no investigation.  She also stated that all of the deaths were in breach of Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights, namely, the right to life.  Why was there no adequate investigation?  There was cover-up after cover-up.  On the same day that Mrs. Justice Keegan delivered her findings, the British Government had the gall, which comes as no surprise to any of us who understand Britain's dirty war in Ireland, to decide to propose an amnesty.<\/p>  <p>  Last week, Boris Johnson apologised for what he described as the Ballymurphy \"events\".  What happened in Ballymurphy was not an \"event\", nor was it a \"situation\".  It was a massacre.  Words matter.  It was a massacre that lasted for three days and where British army soldiers wreaked havoc on the streets of Ballymurphy.  Ballymurphy cannot be apologised away.  It was a three-day sustained attack.<\/p>  <p>  Let us be frank - the apology was just a distraction.  The families are clear.  They did not ask for an apology.  They asked for accountability and justice.  They have waited 50 years to hear the word \"innocent\", with far too many family members having passed away before seeing that day.  We cannot make the families wait any longer.  To do so would be to prolong their torture and trauma.<\/p>  <p>  Boris Johnson is saying \"Sorry\" on the one hand and, on the other, he is intending to grant amnesty to the very soldiers who murdered these people.  That the finding of innocent and the rumblings of amnesty were brought to light on the same day was no coincidence.  It is British state policy to continue denying these families the accountability that they deserve.  We have to be straight with the British Government, in that people cannot destroy a community, lives and families and get away with it.<\/p>  <p>  The D&aacute;il needs to speak with one voice and tell the British Government that amnesty is off the table.  The Irish Government needs to be strong when telling the British Government that the mechanisms within the Stormont House Agreement, of which the British Government is a co-guarantor, must be implemented in full, not just for the families of Ballymurphy, but every family seeking truth and accountability.  Without accountability, how does Boris Johnson even know what he is apologising for?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051800028#AA00200","speaker":"1579"},{"type":"speech","time":1621356000,"counter":311,"content":"<p>After a long and difficult campaign, the Ballymurphy massacre families have been vindicated at last.  It was moving to see their relief and joy.  The Irish State, Government and media were all over them last week, but where were they for the decades the families were knocking on their doors seeking justice?  It made me think about how most states will cover up events to which they do not want to own up - what the Black Lives Matter campaign in America has pointed to, the Stardust victims in Dublin, the family of Terence Wheelock, the family of Shane O'Farrell and, most lately, George Nkencho.  Their families are knocking on doors but being denied justice.  I plead with the Taoiseach to listen to them and ensure that justice is not delayed for others.<\/p>  <p>  Within hours of the announcement of the findings of the Ballymurphy massacre inquest, we saw the bizarre scenario of one arm of the British state, the judiciary, judging members of another arm of the British state, the army, who were responsible for killing ten innocent civilians, and a third arm, the British Government, announcing that it wanted to make plans to make those perpetrators and the perpetrators of all other violence immune from prosecution.  The British Government has to be challenged on this.  Its plans to end the reinvestigation of killings by state forces in Northern Ireland are wrong.  All families of victims deserve independent, fully resourced investigations into the deaths of their loved ones.  They deserve the support of our Government in seeking that.<\/p>  <p>  The British Government must be made to feel the pressure to stick by the Stormont House Agreement and the Good Friday Agreement.  Various public consultations on how to deal with the past have come and gone in the North.  Habitually, London has broken its commitments.  Britain must not now be allowed to bail out of its commitments to previous agreements.<\/p>  <p>  Interestingly, Prince Charles is in Belfast today.  He is the colonel-in-chief of the parachute regiment, the regiment responsible for Ballymurphy and Bloody Sunday.  I wonder whether anyone will ask him his views on these outcomes and invite him to apologise to the families.<\/p>  <p>  Boris Johnson and the Tory Party are feigning concern for former British soldiers.  According to the Royal British Legion, 6,000 former British soldiers are homeless on the streets of Britain, many of them dependent on food banks.  Some 10,000 are in jail or on probation and 50,000 suffer from permanent mental health issues or injuries and are dependent on state services.  These veterans live in miserable conditions and are not respected by the British Government.  As many as 200 former soldiers could now face prosecution if the British Government is prevented from getting away with its latest move.  Is that what it is scared of?  It has a great deal to lose through the testimony of almost 200 former British soldiers if they are allowed to be prosecuted in Northern Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  We have to stand up to the British Government and honour the memory of the Ballymurphy families, the Bloody Sunday families and others by not allowing it to rewrite history and stop the investigations into all of the deaths that have occurred.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051800028#AA00300","speaker":"1486"},{"type":"speech","time":1621356000,"counter":312,"content":"<p>\"His apology means nothing, we need him to go back to the MoD and tell them to tell the truth, tell our legal team the names of the soldiers who murdered our loved ones and ask them why.\"  These are the words of Briege Voyle, whose mother, Joan Connolly, was murdered in Ballymurphy.  She spoke in the immediate aftermath of the coroner's verdict, which made it clear that these were civilians who posed no threat and were unarmed.  At least nine of the ten were certainly shot by the British army.  She spoke at the same time as the British Prime Minister was wrapping his arms around plans for a blanket amnesty for British soldiers in an attempt to whitewash the role that the British state played in the North.<\/p>  <p>  I have no faith in the British state, the Irish State or the forces of nationalism and unionism to resolve historical issues meaningfully.  All have an interest in obscuring the role they played during the Troubles.  Instead, we need a process independent of these forces that can deliver truth and justice for victims and their families.

In my brief time as a Member, I have never been more struck by a debate where there has been such a unified opinion across the Chamber as well as such genuine compassion for the people at the heart of this scandal, the bereaved families of those ten innocent people who were murdered in Ballymurphy 50 years ago.  That they had to wait so long to get vindication and justice for their relatives is a damning indictment of everyone involved in the political system across these islands.<\/p>  <p>  I was struck by the address made by the Taoiseach at the outset of the debate.  It was compassionate, sincere and detailed, and went through each of the incidents.  It was in direct contrast with what we have seen from the British Prime Minister since the results of the inquest were revealed.  To use the words of the lawyer for the families involved, his response has been \"cack-handed\".<\/p>  <p>  We all have a responsibility not just to speak in this Chamber, but to use every lever at our disposal to ensure that our counterparts across the water know the importance of seeing a full and public state apology from the British Prime Minister.<\/p> <p>Furthermore, there should be individual apologies to each and every one of the families of the victims of this absolute travesty of justice that took place so many years ago.  We have opportunities to act in the coming weeks and months.  For those of us who remember the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly, it is important to note that there will be a meeting of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference in June.  We all engage with political colleagues throughout Great Britain at various political, governmental and parliamentary levels.  It is important that we reflect the absolutely sombre mood of this Chamber on this matter and make sure that message is put across.  It is clear that the result of the inquest was meant to provide some amount of relief and dignity for the families involved.  Unfortunately, the political response in the United Kingdom has simply done more to increase the level of trauma and upset that has been lingering for decades.<\/p> <p> This leads on to the next step in the reconciliation process across these islands.  If we are to have truly meaningful engagement and reconciliation, we must have an open and fair approach to issues such as legacy in order to ensure justice is done for all victims throughout the period in question.  Colleagues across the Chamber have rightly said that we are very concerned by the political movements in Great Britain, particularly in England, that would deprive families of the levels of justice that the Good Friday and Stormont House Agreements afford.  I was struck by the motion passed in the US Senate last night reaffirming its commitment not just to the Good Friday and St. Andrews Agreements but also the Stormont House Agreement and, indeed, the Northern Irish protocol to the withdrawal agreement.  This is something that is often lost in the discussion on these issues, if there is a discussion, in Westminster.  We often have to rely on Northern Irish Members of Parliament taking their seats or on a number of sympathetic Members from the likes of the Scottish National Party or others who have specific connections to Ireland to ensure that at least some semblance of a nationalist voice is heard.  The vast majority of English MPs simply want nothing to do with this.<\/p> <p> We are dedicating an entire debate in this Parliament to the findings of the Ballymurphy inquest for very good reason.  It is important that we do so and that the Seanad had a similar debate last week.  I was very struck by how my colleague, Senator Currie, methodically read out the names of every single victim, something that has also been done by a number of Deputies today, including the Taoiseach and Deputy McDonald.  It is important that we remember them not just as details or statistics but as brothers, sisters, children, parents and loved ones who were slaughtered in the streets and were absolutely innocent.  We are not seeing that happening in the Palace of Westminster.  We need to be quite firm with our friends across Great Britain that all of us have responsibilities to the victims.  If we want to move forward in a new relationship across this island and across these islands, we have to be clear that nothing can be swept under the carpet.  That happens with both state actors and non-state actors.  We must not glorify the atrocities and we must not ignore them.  We must be open and frank and put the victims at the heart of the pursuit of justice.  There are many more victims who are deserving of having that level of truth, justice and, crucially, respect shown to them.  Respecting the principles of the Good Friday and Stormont House Agreements cannot simply be a temporary plaything.  It must define everything we do politically on this island and across these islands in terms of developing relationships and providing an element of succour and closure for victims.<\/p> <p> I pay credit to the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, who will wrap up the debate.  I commend every Member of the House who has engaged consistently with the families of the victims of the Ballymurphy massacre.  I understand Deputy McDonald was in Belfast last week with Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile and others.  That engagement must continue until the families truly believe their case has been heard, justice has been delivered and the truth has won out.  It is a challenge for us all not simply to end the discussion this evening but to continue it in an open and compassionate manner.  We must not seek to score political points on matters that are parallel to this debate but, instead, try to put passionate reconciliation at the heart of our discussions, understanding that many people were hurt and many are still waiting for justice.  The people who are most important in this debate are the ten innocent victims who were slaughtered 50 years ago.  They are the people whom we in this House must put front and centre of the remaining interventions on this debate.<\/p> <p> As we move forward to ensure proper justice is delivered, the Government must take a considered, firm and consistent position.  It must ensure the discussion is not ended in a couple of weeks or months but underlines all our engagements with our British colleagues.  I really want to underline that the announcement last week provides an opportunity for clarity on what actions will be taken as we go forward.  The responsibilities of the Government are quite clear in this regard and it will be held to account by Opposition and Government Deputies equally.  I conclude by remembering the ten innocent victims and urging that we always keep the sensitivities and grief of their family members at the heart of all our discussions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051800028#AA00500","speaker":"1473","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621356600,"counter":315,"content":"<p>I spoke to a woman from Belfast a few weeks ago about Ballymurphy.  She told me that her mother always said that her brother went out that day and came home a totally different person and was lost to the family.  He reacted to the state-sponsored violence and the subsequent cover-up of what happened at Ballymurphy and on Bloody Sunday a few months later in the only way he could, which was by taking up arms.<\/p>  <p>  I was staggered over the past month or so by how few people to whom I spoke had heard about Ballymurphy.  There are a number of reasons for that.  Going back to section 31 of the Broadcasting Act, the political programming that was offered by journalists in this State led to a narrative that ultimately served no purpose at all.  The people who went further than what was required in the Broadcasting Act silenced campaigners who were campaigning against injustice.  Those campaigners were labelled as fellow travellers.  The Special Branch followed them around, they were harassed and they lost their jobs.  Even people from my party who were trade union representatives were not allowed to speak on television on behalf of their trade union.  People think cancel culture is something that has only been happening recently.  In fact, anyone who was supportive of people like the Birmingham Six and the victims of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings and Ballymurphy was, in effect, cancelled back in the 1970s and 1980s, whereas the leaders of the campaign to silence became establishment figures, columnists and programme controllers.  If they are to be believed, they became Government advisers.<\/p>  <p>  Fortunately, truth and justice have now been obtained by the families of the Birmingham Six and the victims of Bloody Sunday and Ballymurphy, but the other campaigns go on.  The political coverage and whitewash that happened around that time and in the years leading up to Ballymurphy saw lies being told about weapons being stored in Catholic churches, making both the church and its lay and clerical members legitimate targets in the eyes of loyalists and the British army.  Even to this day, journalists and newspaper executives are assumed to hold political views and affiliations based on where on the island they come from.  We have seen recently that this continues.  Campaigners and documentarians who sought to establish the truth were harassed viciously.  It is hard to imagine that political advice was sought until recently from some of the people who engaged in this nonsense but apparently that is the case.  Many media outlets may not admit it but there was a whitewash in the British legal system and there was a whitewash of silence in Ireland over Ballymurphy, Bloody Sunday and many others.<\/p>  <p>  Issues with inquests in the British state are not confined solely to the Six Counties, as a recent report by the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, ICCL, on the 26-county system demonstrates.  The report documents the heartbreaking incidents where families have had to wait many years to find out what happened to their loved ones.  What was done to the Ballymurphy families through malfeasance and contempt is being done to others through neglect bordering on contempt.  This must be urgently addressed and the findings of the ICCL report must be implemented.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051800029#BB00200","speaker":"1488"},{"type":"speech","time":1621357200,"counter":316,"content":"<p>Go raibh maith agat, a Theachta.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051800030#CC00100","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1621357200,"counter":317,"content":"<p>I will finish on this.

While I wholeheartedly welcome the decision made by the inquest in the North that the people in Ballymurphy who were murdered by the British army were completely innocent, I am still absolutely shocked and angered by the fact that the British establishment allowed the lie to hang in the air for 50 years.  In 1971, the British forces killed ten innocent people while imposing mass internment on the nationalist community in the North of Ireland.  Following 100 witnesses and more than 100 days of evidence, last week's findings served to shed light on the brutalisation of innocent people by the forces of the British state in the North.  I salute the resilience of the Ballymurphy families and their campaign.  Our hearts break because so many of those family members passed away before they were able to see their families' names cleared by the inquest.<\/p>  <p>  Among the ten people who lost their lives was a mother of eight, and what happened to Joan Connolly is especially harrowing.  She was 44 years old when she was killed by the British army.  She was searching for her daughter and in the gunfire she had to hide behind the gable end of a house.  She witnessed Noel Phillips, who was only 20, get shot and, like anybody with a bit of humanitarian sense in them, she went to help.  For her kindness she was shot by the British soldier.  The bullet went through her eye and, according to a witness, took half her face off.  She was shot again repeatedly by the British army and was left to bleed to death for six hours.  I am very cautious about relating in such harrowing detail what people went through in those situations, but it is extremely important that people throughout Ireland understand the brutality that was meted out to the nationalist community by the British state that day.<\/p>  <p>  We often think of the wrongs that happened at that time as being in the past but they are not just in the past.  Immediately after those murders, the reputation of the men and women of Ballymurphy was defamed by the British state.  It lied about those victims.  It said they were gunmen and instigators of violence.  In doing so, it wronged again those it had just murdered, and that wrong remained right up until last week.<\/p>  <p>  I have raised the experience of the families of the Ballymurphy massacre over and over in the D&aacute;il and in the media and I have to echo Deputy Daly's words: most of the time in this Chamber and in the establishment press I have felt there has not been enough support for those families.  There is a hierarchy of victims for some in the D&aacute;il.  For some there was no political capital to be made from these families' campaigns.  Having been murdered by the British army and defamed by the British state, and in many ways by some in the southern establishment, their deaths were discriminated against in a shocking way.  Yesterday was the anniversary of the Dublin-Monaghan bombings.  In that case we had a Garda investigation that was not properly carried out, we had a Fine Gael and Labour Government that in reality took little interest in what happened and we had, and have still, a British state that remained silent on the truth of what happened.  The deputy leader of Aont&uacute; and Mid Ulster councillor, Denise Mullen, was four years old when she witnessed her father, an SDLP supporter and civil rights supporter at the time, being murdered by agents of the British state in front of her in her home.  Justice and truth have been withheld from the majority of victims and survivors of the Glenanne gang too.  As for the southern establishment's interest in victims in the North of Ireland, I have raised with three separate taoisigh the request that they meet with the victims of the Glenanne gang: first with Enda Kenny, who never replied to my request, second with Deputy Varadkar, who never met with the families, and third with the current Taoiseach.  In fairness to the current Taoiseach, he has not been able to meet them because of Covid.  However, I urge him and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who is present, to grab that nettle and choose a date to meet those families now that the Covid threat is receding.<\/p>  <p>  Now the Tories are talking about providing an amnesty to British soldiers who were involved in such crimes.  Last week, the families of Ballymurphy got the truth and now the Tories want to prevent them from getting justice.  If that happens, it will add another wrong to what happened to these families.  Many in the South, especially revisionists, seek to portray the British as independent and objective in the conflict that happened in the North.  Ballymurphy blows that idea out of the water.  The British were equal combatants in the trouble in our country.  Why are the British soldiers who killed those innocent victims on that day not in jail?  The reason they are not is that the British state remains in combat with truth and justice to this very day.  For as long as it prevents people from finding a pathway to justice, it is doing wrong by families such as those of the Ballymurphy massacre.<\/p>  <p>  The Irish Government is a co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement and the Stormont House Agreement.  It has to step up to the plate.  It is dealing with a very belligerent partner in those agreements.  I believe the southern Government is a junior partner in those agreements at the moment.  Our Government needs to step up to the plate, co-guarantee those international agreements and make sure that victims right throughout the North of Ireland, on all sides, have a pathway to the truth and justice for their families.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051800030#CC00300","speaker":"1504"},{"type":"speech","time":1621357200,"counter":319,"content":"<p>I am glad to have a couple of minutes to make a few points about the Ballymurphy massacre.  It strikes me today - and I do not doubt the sincerity of anybody who has spoken, from the Taoiseach right through to the most recent speaker - that our collective ambivalence as an Oireachtas throughout many tragedies in the North of Ireland, elsewhere, is worth noting.  What are we really doing about the various atrocities, from Ballymurphy through to Bloody Sunday, the Dublin-Monaghan bombings, Guildford, Birmingham and so on?  When the passage of time dictates it, we will jump up and down, be indignant, demand apologies and seek redress, but at the time what do we do about it?<\/p>  <p>  I am conscious that a number of years ago, on the say-so of the Brits, we here took it upon ourselves to expel Russian diplomats, perhaps rightly, because it was alleged a former spy had been murdered on British soil by Russian agents.  At the time I asked whether we would ever take such steps in other instances.  I asked at the time: what happens the next time children are killed in Israeli strikes?  Of course, 61 children have been killed in Israeli strikes over the past week.  I wonder whether we will wait 50 years as a State before we hold a debate in this House to condemn collectively the actions of the Israelis in not exercising due care in undertaking violent acts.  That is worth reflecting on, as are the other issues that come before us here.  How many protected disclosures sit uninvestigated?  There are the mother and baby homes issue and so many others.  They will be sat on for 50 years while we as a nation are happy - \"we are all right down here, Jack\" - and ambivalent to the atrocities of the North.  In real terms, in trying to get the appropriate accountability, justice and redress for all victims of the conflict, particularly those families of Ballymurphy whom we are discussing today, what are we really doing about it?  Is it a stiff letter to Prime Minister Johnson?  What do our actions of diplomacy include in the context of seeking that?  That is a point worth raising.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs is in the room.  We were happy and quick, perhaps rightly so, to expel Russian diplomats.<\/p> <p>Let us see some action on Israel.  In any war situation it is unacceptable for 61 children to die in a week.  I hope the Minister can bring that to the Cabinet and we can come up with a suitable response of our own and lead the way, using our position on the United Nations Security Council as a small nation of peace, rather than waiting for the leads of other countries and the say-so of the Brits, the Americans or anyone else.<\/p> <p> Obviously, I welcome the Americans' reaffirming their support for Stormont House Agreement and Good Friday Agreement.  We need to hammer that home.  In the interests of all victims on all sides, we also need to insist that under no circumstances should the British authorities press ahead with any sort of amnesty or clemency.  Accountability, justice and redress must come long before any such matters are considered, if ever.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051800030#CC00400","speaker":"1606","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621357800,"counter":321,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to examine the report of the Ballymurphy inquest.  I acknowledge the perseverance and dedication of the families of the victims in their long journey to establish the facts of what happened and to get justice.  I extend my deepest condolences to the families and friends of those victims killed between 9 and 11 August 1971.  It is unacceptable that these families had to wait almost 50 years for the truth.  One wonders if these killings had taken place in England, Scotland or Wales, whether successive British governments have acted sooner.  This was a shameful episode.  Innocent people were killed and their reputations were sullied.  It was appalling and it must be acknowledged by the British state.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the Taoiseach's meeting with the British Prime Minister, Mr. Johnson, to underline the seriousness of the findings and to call for a meaningful apology to be extended to the families.  The Taoiseach was right to highlight the need for transparency and truth on the atrocities that happened during the Troubles, including the Dublin and Monaghan bombings which took place 47 years ago yesterday.  Thirty-four people died in the bombings and more than 300 were injured when four car bombs were detonated on 17 May 1974.  Their families and friends deserve the truth, as do all victims of atrocities that took place during the Troubles.

The victims and their families must be the priority.  <\/p>  <p>  With the shared-island initiative, it is important for all of us to re-engage in cross-Border initiatives to ensure there is reconciliation on all sides.

We know from the summary of findings of the Honourable Mrs. Justice Keegan, who presided as coroner over the inquests into the deaths, that the inadequacy of the original investigation was shocking.  According to Mrs. Justice Keegan, not one statement was taken from the military in the area.  The scene was not sealed and the bullets were not recovered.  She went on to say that there had been an abject failing by the authorities to inquire into the death of innocent civilians on the streets and that this failure had hampered the coroner greatly.  The coroner recorded in the strongest of terms that that was a striking feature of the case.  <\/p>  <p>  We must hope, pray and ensure that we never return to those days.

Following the inquest into the 1971 Ballymurphy massacre, it is now being established beyond doubt that the victims that day, Fr. Hugh Mullan, Francis Quinn, Joan Connolly, Daniel Teggart, Noel Phillips, Joseph Murphy, Edward Doherty, Joseph Corr, John Laverty and John James McKerr, were innocent.<\/p>  <p>  Things went on in Northern Ireland and we will never get a final peace if we cannot have honesty and reconciliation, and acceptance by the British government that barbaric acts happened there.  There were many other events, including the killing of Aidan McAnespie in Aughnacloy, for which there was no proper investigation.  There was a cock-and-bull story that a bullet ricocheted off the ground.  It is totally unacceptable.  He was being intimidated day in, day out, as were the people in Ballymurphy.  It took that length of time.  <\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach's meeting with the British Prime Minister last week was only window dressing, coming out with pious platitudes afterwards.  I happened to be on a school trip to Dublin on the afternoon of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings; it was the most appalling experience.  There has been cover-up in respect of the Omagh bomb.  Detective Garda Sergeant White, who has now gone to his eternal reward - his mother, Mrs. Angela White, went shortly after him - did his best to stop the bomb going up.  People knew that bomb was going to Omagh and it was not stopped.  Michael Gallagher and the families of the Omagh bomb victims are striving hard for justice.  They got many promises from Enda Kenny when he was leader of Fine Gael before he got into government about what he would do for them.  When he got into government, the system just abandoned them.  The system needs to be outed here and the cover-up needs to be stopped.<\/p>  <p>  We need honesty and respect for human life and accept that where murder happened it should not have happened.  At least people can grieve properly if they know that they have justice with people held accountable.  There is no accountability in that system or the Dublin and Monaghan bombings and collusion there with MI5 and whatever else.  It is outrageous.  In an effort to go forward to the new Ireland, the shared Ireland, it is time that we have accountability, responsibility, honesty and openness.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051800031#DD00400","speaker":"1612"},{"type":"speech","time":1621357800,"counter":324,"content":"<p>On Tuesday, 11 May, there was finally some justice for the ten people murdered in the Ballymurphy massacre.  Fifty years after the tragedy of August 1971, an inquest, led by the coroner, Mrs. Justice Siobhan Keegan, found that the ten people killed were entirely innocent.  The inquest found that nine of the victims had been shot by the British army.  However, due to the lack of investigation at the time into the tenth death, that of John McKerr, it was not possible to definitively rule who had shot him.<\/p>  <p>  Nine men and one woman were killed in the massacre, the 44-year-old Joan Connolly was a mother of eight children.  Fr. Hugh Mullan, a 38-year-old priest, was also among those killed, as was Francis Quinn, aged 44, who was shot when he went to help the priest.<\/p>  <p>  These ten innocent victims were killed as part of operation Demetrius, which was internment without trial.  The first day of operation Demetrius on 9 August 1971, approved by the British Government, involved mass arrests of more than 340 people from Catholic backgrounds.  Ian Paisley was opposed to internment as he was concerned that some loyalists would be interned.<\/p> <p>From 9 August 1971 until the end of that year, it is estimated that around 150 people were killed, with hundreds more injured.  That is 150 dead in four months.  The year 1972 was the worst year of the Troubles with almost 500 people killed.<br\/><br\/>With the British Government&rsquo;s involvement in operation Demetrius, one would think a proper state apology would have been forthcoming following the vindication of the ten people&rsquo;s innocence.<br\/><br\/>Last Friday, the Fianna F&aacute;il Taoiseach met with the Tory Prime Minister on a number of issues.  The Taoiseach said of the Ballymurphy verdict and his meeting with Boris Johnson: &quot;...and I think the British Prime Minister, you know, is fully appraised of it.  And I think will respond in his own way, in his own time.&quot;  That is quite insulting, insulting to our Taoiseach and to the families of the Ballymurphy massacre, that the Taoiseach would even accept this from the British Prime Minister.<br\/><br\/>Why was a full and unreserved apology not delivered from the floor of Westminster, as David Cameron did after the Saville inquiry?  If there had been a proper investigation in Ballymurphy we might never have had a Bloody Sunday at all.<br\/><br\/>Boris Johnson&rsquo;s private apology for the Ballymurphy massacre was reportedly delivered over a call to Arlene Foster and Michelle O&rsquo;Neill in the North.  A letter sent to families is also not sufficient.  John Teggart, son of Daniel Teggart, said on Thursday:<\/p><blockquote>\tIt's the manner of the apology, sending a letter two minutes before the secretary of state went live on TV.  It's the timing. <\/blockquote> <p>For some 50 years these families have been fighting for justice and answers and the least the Prime Minister could do is offer an official, adequate, public apology.  The untruths told about the ten victims were public at the time.  Correcting the record therefore should also be acknowledged in a public way.<br\/><br\/>Further unnecessary upset was caused to the families and many, many others around the North with the ill-conceived talk of an amnesty for British soldiers&rsquo; actions during the Troubles.  I see the Taoiseach apparently warned Johnson against such a move in their meeting last week but how strong was this warning?  We may never really know.  An amnesty cannot happen.  Some families are only now getting some justice and answers.  Many will never get any answers.  Procedures must, however, be in place to allow people to look for justice and for criminal prosecutions, where appropriate.<br\/><br\/>I support the calls of the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, ICCL, and the Committee for the Administration of Justice, CAJ, that we need assurances from the British Government that it will not seek to curtail further legacy inquests through its proposed Northern Ireland legacy Bill.  In a joint briefing note, the ICCL and CAJ stated: <\/p><blockquote>\tThere is still a risk, in particular with inquests delivering truth recovery, that there will be a fresh UK attempt to curtail legacy inquests, despite the competence largely falling to the NI Department of Justice.  It is essential that the Irish Government resists any attempts to curtail such inquests. <\/blockquote> <p>I wonder what sort of warning the Taoiseach gave.  How strongly was it conveyed to the British Prime Minister that we will not accept any such an amnesty?  The hurt, injustice and cover-ups are not just part of history.  They are evident in everyday lives, families and communities.  People continue to exploit tensions for their own political gains and we will watch with interest how the new DUP leader will also deal with things.<br\/><br\/>How many other families and communities are waiting for justice?  We know well in this House about the Dublin and Monaghan bombing victims and how they are also being thwarted by the British.  It is partly because the British have been allowed to present themselves as neutral in this conflict, which they never were.  They were always an active participant and there might not have been a need for a peace process if the British had lived up to their role in the conflict.  On that point we will probably never know.<br\/><br\/>I will finish by referring to where we have talked in recent days, and in fact in the past year or so, about the vital role that the European Union played in ensuring peace, the Good Friday Agreement and such matters.  I have heard no comment, however, from the European Union on the Ballymurphy inquests and what is happening there.  This is interesting and perhaps the rewriting of history will happen on this issue also.<br\/><br\/>I commend the families and communities who never gave up looking for truth, justice and answers for their lost and loved ones and I offer my full solidarity to them all.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051800031#DD00500","speaker":"1547","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621358400,"counter":326,"content":"<p>I begin by joining with the Taoiseach and all of my colleagues in conveying our condolences to the Ballymurphy families for the terrible events that took their loved ones from them and in extending our sympathy and solidarity for the nearly 50 years that they have had to spend fighting to bring truth to those events.  That is a lifetime of struggle.<\/p>  <p>  I was honoured to meet the families on several occasions in recent years as the Government worked with them to support their long campaign.  To hear the coroner&rsquo;s verdict announced last week and indeed for the Taoiseach to read the details of those findings into the record of this House today is powerful.  It was a moment of complete vindication, of truth at last.  It is also testament to the courage and determination of the Ballymurphy families and their unyielding sense of justice.  As the Taoiseach noted, the Government stands with the families.  Appropriate due process should follow from the coroner&rsquo;s findings and we will continue to support them as they consider their next steps.  The deaths at Ballymurphy were part of the tragic legacy of the Troubles which saw the loss of over 3,500 lives from all communities.  The Government is committed to helping all those who lost loved ones during the Troubles and who seek truth and justice to find it.  That, of course, goes for Ballymurphy families and for Kingsmill families.  That is why we passed the Criminal Justice (International Co-Operation) Act to facilitate that inquest and others like it.  It goes for the Dublin and Monaghan families who yesterday marked the 47th anniversary of that terrible day of loss.  That goes for the Birmingham families who I was privileged to meet a little over a year ago.  That goes for all families.  Every family bereaved in the conflict must have access to an effective investigation and to a process of truth and justice, regardless of the perpetrator.<\/p>  <p>  The Stormont House Agreement was reached between the two Governments and the political parties in Northern Ireland in 2014 after a long and intense period of negotiation, with the exception of the UUP which did not support it at the time.  It set out a path forward and a balanced framework which encompassed the core principles of truth, justice and reconciliation.  The agreement includes an historical investigation unit to take forward independent investigations into outstanding Troubles-related deaths and an international independent commission for information recovery to enable victims&rsquo; families to seek and receive information about the circumstances of the deaths of their loved ones where that information cannot be used in courts.  It includes an oral history archive to allow all of the different experiences of the Troubles to be shared and an implementation and reconciliation group to look at the themes and patterns of the conflict and support initiatives that can contribute to reconciliation and a fuller understanding of the past.<\/p>  <p>  The two Governments followed up the Stormont House Agreement with a bilateral international agreement to allow the establishment of its information recovery body.  At the time of the New Decade, New Approach Agreement in January of last year, the British Government once again committed to legislating for the Stormont House Agreement.<\/p>  <p>  In March of last year, the British Government issued a written ministerial statement that proposed to depart significantly from the Stormont House Agreement.  Since then I have spoken regularly to the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland to express our strong concerns and to reiterate the importance of the collective approach consistent with the Stormont House Agreement and one which, crucially, is compliant with our international human rights obligations.  I reaffirmed those critical principles to the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland when we met the week before last in Dublin and strongly advised him against any unilateral action on these very sensitive issues.  Reports of possible plans to introduce a statute of limitation have, of course, caused significant upset, shock and concern, including for the Ballymurphy families who have spoken out on this issue.<\/p>  <p>  In my time as Minister for Foreign Affairs I have met many victims and survivors from both communities.  I know how hurt they are by the idea of being denied a route to pursue justice on behalf of their loved ones as provided by the Stormont House Agreement.  There is a need to take a comprehensive view of how to achieve progress and reconciliation for society as a whole but the needs of victims and families must be at the heart of that process.  We have strongly communicated our position on this issue to the British Government.<\/p> <p>We will continue to do so and we will continue to call in the clearest terms for there to be no unilateral action.  The Government remains ready to engage and work with the British Government and, of course, the parties to the Northern Ireland Executive with a view to reaffirming a collective approach that is consistent with the Stormont House Agreement.  Of course, we want to continue to work with victims and their families at the centre of that process as well.<\/p> <p> The history of the peace process has taught us that real and lasting progress is made when we work together, even on the most difficult and sensitive of issues.  We know the Stormont House Agreement is not perfect.  I am not sure there can be a perfect solution to such a complicated and sensitive problem as how to address the legacy of our past in a way that meets the needs of all families and our communities as best we can.  However, it gives us a solid framework and an agreed path forward and we need to take it together.<\/p> <p> The process of building a lasting peace and deeper reconciliation across all communities is difficult, painful and slow, but it is made easier when we have a foundation on which we can have confidence based on principles to which we can always turn, such as a clear map when the path forward seems too difficult or unclear, as well as truth, justice, rule of law and empathy with one another's pain.  Those values bring us together and, as the Taoiseach stated, that unity was so clear last week as leaders and citizens from all communities and all political parties came out to welcome the findings of the Ballymurphy inquest.  The findings of Mrs. Justice Keegan last week laid out a set of truths.  All ten people who were killed were wholly innocent.  All ten were killed without justification.  I hope that with the telling of those truths and the bringing to light of the immense wrong that was done, a burden begins to lift.  We will keep working in support of all those seeking truth and justice so that more burdens carried on the shoulders of other families and communities for far too long can be lifted also.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051800032#EE00300","speaker":"1457","continuing":true},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Nursing Homes Support Scheme (Amendment) Bill 2021: Order for Second Stage","time":1621359000,"counter":328,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051800033#FF00150"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1621359000,"counter":329,"content":"<p><\/p><p><\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1621359000,"counter":330,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That Second Stage be taken now.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051800033#FF00175","speaker":"1614"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1621359000,"counter":331,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Nursing Homes Support Scheme (Amendment) Bill 2021: Second Stage","time":1621359000,"counter":332,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051800033#FF00200"},{"type":"speech","time":1621359000,"counter":333,"content":"<p>I move: \"That the Bill be now read a Second Time.\"<\/p>  <p>  I am very pleased to have the opportunity to introduce the Bill to the House.  Since I was appointed in July 2020 as Minister of State with responsibility for mental health and older people, updating the fair deal legislation to enhance protections for farmers and small business owners has been an absolute priority for me.  I look forward to hearing the views of Deputies and working with all Members of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and Seanad &Eacute;ireann to progress this important legislation without delay through both Houses.<\/p>  <p>  The goal of the Government is to support older people to live in their own homes with dignity and independence for as long as possible.  Unprecedented investment has been made available for home support and intermediate care in 2021 to advance this goal.  Nevertheless, long-term residential care is part of an overall continuum of care and remains an integral option for many older people to ensure they receive the right care in the right place at the right time.<\/p>  <p>  The nursing homes support scheme, commonly known as the fair deal scheme, is a system of financial support for those requiring long-term nursing home care.  Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their means, while the State pays the balance of the cost.  The fair deal scheme is one of the most substantial financial support schemes in the State, supporting up to 22,500 people by the end of this year.  With a gross budget of approximately &euro;1.4 billion in 2021 and a net cost to the State of just over &euro;1 billion, maintaining the level of investment by the State to supplement the contributions from residents is essential to ensuring that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone.<\/p>  <p>  We must protect the successful operation of the fair deal scheme by ensuring that any amendments made to the scheme support its long-term sustainability.  We must also preserve its fundamental policy objectives and principles.  The fairness that gives the fair deal its name is based on avoiding an unfair situation where people who have greater means available to them could pay less to the scheme than individual who have fewer financial resources.<\/p>  <p>  Under the scheme, a financial assessment is carried out by the HSE to determine how much each applicant will contribute to the cost of their care.  Applicants contribute up to 80% of their assessable income and a maximum of 7.5% of the value of their assets each year.  The State then pays the balance of the cost of care.  A person's level of contribution is unaffected by their choice of nursing home, be it public, private or voluntary.  However, the capital value of an applicant's principal private residence is only included in the financial assessment for the first three years of their time in care.  This is known as the three-year cap.<\/p>  <p>  The scheme contains important safeguards for participants, such as ensuring that nobody will pay more than the actual cost of care.  It also ensures that people do not have to sell their home during their lifetime to pay for long-term nursing home care.  Where an applicant's assets include land and property held in the State, the contribution based on such assets may be deferred and collected from the estate through the optional loan element of the scheme which is known as ancillary State support.  There are also limits on the financial assessment.  For example, the first &euro;36,000 of the value of an individual's assets, or &euro;72,000 in the case of couple, is not counted at all.  If an applicant has a spouse or partner remaining at home, he or she will retain half of the couple's income.  <\/p>  <p>  Although there is broad agreement that the fair deal scheme operates well and continues to provide appropriate financial assistance where required, concerns have been raised through many years about the financial assessment where applicants have operated family-owned farms or businesses.  In the review of the scheme published in 2015, it was highlighted that the three-year cap which applies to the principal private residence does not apply to farms except under very specific circumstances.  A concern was raised that the annual fair deal charge based on the value of those family farms or businesses could affect their viability and sustainability, especially where care might be required for a long period.<\/p>  <p>  The Government heard these concerns and, following publication of the 2015 review, made a decision to introduce changes to the scheme with regard to the financial assessment of farm and business assets that are passed to a family successor.  It is Government policy to encourage ordinary succession arrangements for farms and small businesses where appropriate.  These arrangements should ensure that farm and business assets are transferred well in advance of five years before nursing home care is required, avoiding a levy on the farm or business asset entirely.  However, despite best efforts, sometimes unexpected health events can occur which prevent early succession arrangements.  The scheme currently acknowledges this, so that a farmer or business owner can qualify for a three-year cap on the financial assessment of productive assets in cases where the person has suffered a sudden illness or disability that causes him or her to need long-term residential care.  This legislative amendment to the scheme will now extend this principle to cap contributions based on family-owned and family-operated farm and business assets at three years where a family successor commits within the first three years of the person's time in care to working the farm or business for a period of six years.  The intention of this change is to ensure that in situations where the productive income of the family farm or business is being relied upon as a principal livelihood and the farm or business is being handed down to the next generation, the viability and sustainability of these farms and businesses is protected.<\/p>  <p>  Ultimately, the Bill seeks to alleviate any unnecessary financial pressures placed on these families due to existing provisions within the law.  Therefore, regardless of the duration of a person's length of stay in long-term residential care, the maximum contribution based on the capital value of a farm or business will be 7.5% per annum for three years only, provided that all the conditions of the scheme are complied with.  This change will ensure that the fair deal scheme is truly a fair deal for farm families and small business owners.<\/p><p><i>6 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p>  <p>In November 2019, the Joint Committee on Health undertook pre-legislative scrutiny of the general scheme of the Bill.  Unfortunately, the report of the committee was not completed before the dissolution of the 32nd D&aacute;il.  Progress on the development of the Bill was subsequently negatively impacted by Covid-19.  To ensure the legislation would not be delayed, in light of the work already conducted on the proposed legislation by the committee, which is on public record, I sought permission from the Oireachtas Business Committee for a waiver from the requirement to conduct repeated pre-legislative scrutiny.  The waiver was granted on 4 February.  I thank the former members of the committee for their engagement during this process.<\/p> <p> This is a lengthy and technical Bill.  I will now take the House through the Bill section by section to clarify its provisions.  As I address each individual sections, it will provide more clarity on how the Bill will operate in practice.<\/p> <p> Section 1 is a standard provision, clarifying the principal Act to which the amendment applies.  Section 2 amends section 3 of the principal Act, providing definition for certain key terms used in the Bill.<\/p> <p> Section 3 provides for the appointment of a family successor to a farm or business asset which the person in care, or his or her partner, owns or previously owned.  The section details the eligibility criteria which must be met by the person in care and the prospective family successor.  Key among these is that the person in care must declare, by way of a statutory declaration, that for a period of three years, which need not be continuous, during the period of five years ending with the day on which he or she began to receive care services, that a substantial part of his or her working time, or his or her partner, or the family successor, was spent running the farm or business asset.<\/p> <p> The nominated family successor must also commit, by way of statutory declaration that a substantial part of his or her normal working time will regularly and consistently be applied to running the farm or business for a period of six years beginning on the date of his or her appointment.  The prospective family successor must be at least 18 years of age and related to the person in care, or his or her partner.  If the asset in question is a transferred asset, the family successor must be the owner of the asset.  This section also allows the person in care to appoint multiple family successors on multiple assets, but only one family successor on any given asset.  This section also obliges the owner or owners of the farm or business asset to consent to a charging order being registered against the asset.  The role of the executive in the application process is also established.<\/p> <p> Section 4 provides for the creation of a charge against the interest which the person in care or his or her partner has or had in a farm or business asset.  This charge acts as security for the relief advanced under the amendment in case a recoupment has to take place.  Increased State support in respect of productive assets will not be payable until such a charge is in place, where applicable.  The charge can be placed on land-based assets in the State.  This provision adopts the administrative procedures to facilitate the charging of assets from similar procedures in the principal Act relating to ancillary State support.<\/p> <p> Section 5 provides for the duties of the HSE when determining whether the three-year cap will apply in respect of farm or business assets.  Persons wishing to avail of the three-year cap must have been in care for three years and have appointed a family successor in respect of relevant assets.  The charge on the asset must also be in place.  The executive will determine whether the applicant will qualify for the relief, with all the conditions for qualification being outlined in this section.<\/p> <p> Section 6 mandates the executive to calculate the revised State support that will be payable following a determination that the three-year cap applies, and to also calculate and record the amounts of relief payable to the person in care for the period during which the three-year cap applies.<\/p> <p> Section 7 provides for the review process for all appointed family successors.  Following a determination that the three-year cap applies to a farm or business asset, the HSE will need to review, at least once, that each family successor is complying with the conditions he or she agreed to when appointed.<\/p> <p> The Department of Health, alongside the HSE, is currently working with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to develop the operational guidelines for this review process and the specifics of how the compliance checks will be undertaken.  The Department will also be developing, alongside relevant stakeholders, guidelines for completing compliance checks for those running businesses.<\/p> <p> Section 8 provides for when the person in care dies after the three-year cap has been applied.  In this instance, if the six-year period committed to by the family successor has not expired, the family successor will have to commit to continuing to finish the six years.  Alternatively, the lawful successor may become the new family successor or appoint a different family successor.<\/p> <p> Section 9 provides for when the family successor dies or can no longer comply with his or her obligation before the six-year period that was committed to has expired.  This section allows the person in care to appoint a new family successor who will have to finish whatever is left of the six-year obligation of the original family successor.<\/p> <p> Section 10 provides for changing a family successor when an asset is transferred by the person in care or, in the case of a transferred asset, by the family successor.  In this instance, the newly appointed family successor will have to complete the six-year obligation agreed to by the original family successor.<\/p> <p> Section 11 provides for a situation where a repayment event occurs caused by one or more of the circumstances listed in this section.  A repayment event may occur when the family successor does not comply with his or her obligations under the amendment, and for various other reasons outlined in the Bill.  Before a decision is made on a repayment event, the person in care will have the opportunity to make representations to the HSE.  If the HSE decides that a repayment event has taken place, the three-year cap will be removed and the amount of State support that the person in care receives under the scheme will be revised.  The relief already advanced after the three-year cap was applied will also have to be recouped.<\/p> <p> Section 12 provides for the recovery of sums due to the executive when it is determined that a repayment event has occurred.  The Revenue Commissioners will act as the collection agent to recoup the debt owing to the State.<\/p> <p> Section 13 makes it an offence for any relevant person to knowingly or recklessly give the executive information which is false or misleading in respect of various provisions in the Bill.  Section 14 amends section 21 of the principal Act, extending the powers of a care representative in the event that a person in care does not have full capacity to make decisions regarding an application to the scheme.<\/p> <p> Section 15 amends section 24 of the principal Act, requiring the appointed family successor to provide written notice of any material change in circumstances of the person in care to the executive.  Section 16 mandates the person in care, his or her partner, and the family successor, to inform the HSE of any material change in circumstances of any family successor.<\/p> <p> Section 17 amends section 27 of the principal Act, allowing the executive to request that the assets of an estate are retained in order to repay any moneys owed as a result of a repayment event under the Bill.  Section 18 sets out the administrative process in relation to the discharge, or release of the charge, made against an asset under this Bill.<\/p> <p> Section 19 amends section 29 of the principal Act and refers to a charge or charges to be made under section 14B against farm or business assets which are under joint ownership.  Section 20 amends section 32 of the principal Act, extending the circumstances under which appeals against certain decisions of the executive can be made.<\/p> <p> Section 21 amends section 36 of the principal Act, and allows the Minister, by regulation, in respect of any difficulty which arises during the period of three years from the commencement of the Act of 2021, to take any necessary action to bring the amendments in the principal Act into operation.  Section 22 amends section 45 of the principal Act, expanding the executive's duties regarding the storage, retention, and disposal of applications and notifications made under this Bill.<\/p> <p> Section 23 requires the executive to produce an annual report for the Minister for Health detailing the effects of the new provisions on the scheme, trends arising from these effects, and some other matters that may be specified by the Minister.  Section 24 requires that the Minister must carry out a review of the operation of the amendments to the principal Act not later than five years after the 2021 Act comes into operation, in consultation with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  A report setting out any findings must be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.<\/p> <p> Section 25 amends Schedule 1 of the principal Act, repealing the availability of the three-year cap on productive assets as a result of sudden illness or disability.  This section adds additional provisions which allow for the three-year cap to apply to farm and business assets following a positive determination under this Bill.  This section also amends the definition of \"transferred income\" in the principal Act, ensuring that the income earned by the family successor, while working a productive asset, is not factored into the financial assessment for the scheme.<\/p> <p> Section 26 provides for transitional arrangements and amends certain paragraphs in Part 3 of Schedule 1 of the principal Act.<\/p> <p>Finally, section 27 is a standard provision, dealing with the Short Title and commencement arrangements. <\/p> <p> It will be necessary to introduce a small number of Government amendments, including technical amendments, as the Bill makes its way through the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The most significant of these concerns how couples will be treated under the Bill.  It was not possible to provide for these items before the Bill was published, but they are all in line with the contents of the general scheme of the Bill.  At a recent Cabinet meeting on housing, I committed to working towards bringing forward an amendment on Committee Stage related to extending the three-year cap to the proceeds of the sale of a principal private residence.  The proposed amendment relating to the three-year cap that is the subject of the legislation is grounded in the principle of fairness that is fundamental to the fair deal scheme and seeks to remove a disincentive to those who would otherwise choose to sell their home.<\/p> <p> I fully acknowledge the severity of the current housing crisis and I am committed to advancing the programme for Government by bringing forward policies that are targeted, equitable, safeguarded, and based on robust evidence.<\/p> <p> The potential for inclusion of a Committee Stage amendment aimed at encouraging residents of long-term care who avail of fair deal to rent out their vacant homes was also discussed.  I have committed that the Department will continue to actively engage with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, following the existing agreed plan to support the development of policy in this area.  I also continue to hold the view that the scheme should not be extended to change the method of assessing income from productive assets that are subject to a lease agreement.  The policy objective of this Bill is to protect the continued family ownership and operation of farms and businesses, and this policy would not be advanced if such leasing income was included in the three-year cap.<\/p> <p> The changes to the Act will also not be applied retrospectively.  That is a challenging precedent to introduce to the scheme and the risk of potential impacts is high.<\/p> <p> This historic legislation comes after many years of hard work by many key stakeholders, including politicians, advocacy groups, and organisations representing older people.  As a Minister of State from rural Ireland, I am acutely aware of the financial pressures that many farm families experience when it comes to the care of their loved ones.  This is a hugely emotive issue for many families and one that the programme for Government promised to deliver on.  <\/p> <p> I acknowledge the work of my officials and members of Cabinet in getting this long-awaited legislation to this point, and I look forward to seeing it enacted as soon as possible.  I anticipate that it will receive cross-party unanimous support, and I look forward to discussing the details of the Bill with colleagues in both Houses. I commend the Bill to the House<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051800033#FF00300","speaker":"1614","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621360200,"counter":336,"content":"<p>I commend the Minister for State on bringing forward the Bill.

Section 3 sets out how a successor is appointed to assets and puts in place rigorous safeguards to ensure it is for the purposes of running a family farm or business. Section 5 sets out how the HSE will determine eligibility for the cap to apply.  This only happens after someone has been in care for three years, which may put in doubt some of the certainty being looked for to plan ahead.  Section 14 allows for a care representative to make decisions in the event of incapacity of the person in care.  It is important this is overseen appropriately and carefully to ensure there is no abuse of these powers.  Sections 15 and 16 allow for notification of a change in material circumstances and how that will be handled where a successor cannot pay.

 <\/blockquote>  <p>Every day, I receive calls or emails from working people across the country.  While their personal circumstances may be very different, a single thread runs through all these conversations.  Growing numbers of working people in average and above average jobs cannot afford to rent or buy a home.  This is not an accident; it is the direct result of bad Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael housing policy for decades.<\/p><p>Recently, I have spoken to many single people in their 20s who are saving every penny they can for a deposit while renting at extortionate prices and repeatedly being outbid when they put in offers by other buyers or, in some cases, institutional investors.  I spoke to many couples in their 30s back living with their family, putting off having children and working hard to save money for a deposit but unable to secure a big enough loan to buy an affordable home.<\/p><p>I recently had a distressing conversation with a businessman in his 50s.  He is a man of significant means but, following a divorce, he left the family home to his ex-wife.  He was paying a portion of the mortgage as well as maintenance and he could not afford to rent, let alone buy another home.  That man was sofa-surfing at the time I spoke to him.  I had another upsetting phone call from a healthcare worker, a woman who has put her life at risk during Covid-19 for the good of the community.  She is in her late 40s.  Unfortunately, trough no fault of her own, she lost her first home after the financial crash.  She was in mortgage arrears and the property was repossessed.  Now she would be able to buy again but, because she is treated as a second-time buyer, the 20% deposit requirement and the length of maturity of the mortgage push ownership beyond reach.<\/p><p>Fianna F&aacute;il says it is the party that builds houses but it is not building any houses for the people I am talking to.  The Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, tells us he believes in home ownership.  Unfortunately, believing is not the same as investing in the homes these working people deserve.  The cause of our housing crisis is an over-reliance on the private sector.  We have developer-led planning, taxation and delivery.  There is no doubt our speculative, developer-led housing system is broken.  It cannot, and will not, meet the needs of ever-growing sections of our community.  To add insult to injury, Government policy has allowed big investors to swallow up increasing volumes of the limited supply of family homes, denying thousands of people ownership of their own home and forcing them to rent at extortionate prices well into the future.<\/p><p>This has to stop.  It is time for Government policy to change and the most important thing Government could do to make this change is dramatically increase capital investment.  The week before budget 2019, Raise the Roof, the civil society campaign led by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, mobilised more than 10,000 people outside the D&aacute;il.  Inside the D&aacute;il, a clear majority agreed a motion tabled by Raise the Roof Deputies to double capital investment in social and affordable home.  The Minister, Deputy O'Brien, and Fianna F&aacute;il supported that, yet budget 2019 came and went with no doubling of capital investment.  Budget 2020 came and went and no doubling of capital investment.  In the general election of 2020, Fianna F&aacute;il promised to deliver 20,000 public homes every year for the lifetime of the Government, comprising 10,000 social and 10,000 affordable.<\/p> <p>However, when the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, took the floor to introduce his first budget, that election promise was gone.  The commitment to double capital investment in social and affordable homes was also gone.  Instead, we had derisory increases in social and affordable housing expenditure, showing that Fine Gael was still at the steering wheel.<\/p> <p> The motion before us is very straightforward.  It states that to make a serious dent in the affordable housing crisis we must spend &euro;2.8 billion annually to build 20,000 social and affordable homes each year for the next five years.  If that is done and houses are delivered at genuinely affordable prices then we will have a Government that is starting to meet the needs of the community, but if we do not do that the crisis will continue.  On that basis I commend the motion to the House and urge the Government to abandon its failed policies and start to do what everybody knows it must do. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051800035#HH00700","speaker":"1468","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621360800,"counter":343,"content":"<p>The provision of affordable housing is a fundamental duty of the State.  I commend Deputy &Oacute; Broin on all the work he has done in putting this front and centre.  There is no doubt that this and previous Governments have abjectly failed in their duty to provide affordable housing.  Housing has become unaffordable and the majority of workers and families are locked out.  Since February 2012 house prices have doubled in Dublin.  The same story is told right across the State.  Since 2016, house prices have jumped by 30%, while rents have increased by 44%.  In my constituency of Donegal, rents have increased by 7% in the past year alone.<\/p>  <p>  Faced with this failure, the Government has been desperate to blame everybody but itself.  However, it is Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael who between them have held power in the State for the past decade.  Their record speaks for itself.  In 2016, Fine Gael's Rebuilding Ireland housing plan promised much.  It promised to deliver 2,000 affordable rental homes by 2018.  The total number delivered to date amounts to zero.  In 2018, the previous Government, led by Fine Gael, promised to deliver 6,000 affordable purchase homes by 2021.  The total number that have been delivered to date is also zero.  There has been a failure to deliver.<\/p>  <p>  The housing crisis goes well beyond the issue of affordability, with the legacy of defective housing impacting countless homeowners and renters.  In Donegal, thousands of homeowners are affected by mica, with their homes seriously damaged.  The redress scheme requires homeowners to stump up 10% of the cost of remediation but, in reality it is far more than 10%, in some cases it is 30% and above.  This has resulted in the scheme being unattainable for many families and, in short, no use to them whatsoever.  Sinn F&eacute;in argued from the beginning that we need a 100% redress scheme, similar to the pyrite remediation scheme that was rolled out in Dublin and north Leinster.<\/p>  <p>  Many generations now look to the future with anxiety and despair at their ability to start a family and to secure a home.  Events in recent weeks have shown that the unaffordability and scarcity of housing has been compounded by the Government's own policy towards investment funds in the housing market.  The block purchase of homes by an investment fund at a new development in Maynooth rightly angered the nation, as the public now know it was not an isolated incident, nor was it an accident but something that has been happening for years as a direct result of Government policy.  In Dublin alone, six out of every ten new homes were snapped up by these funds in 2019, pushing struggling homeowners out of the market, driving up rent and driving up house prices.  This is by design.  In doing so, these funds have been facilitated by the Government through tax breaks, advantages and exemptions that leave them with a significant advantage over struggling home buyers.  They also have the advantage that the State invests directly in these vulture funds.  In addition, they have the benefit of paying no corporation tax on their rental profits, no capital gains tax and little by way of stamp duty.<\/p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in has called for years for these tax advantages to be brought to an end.  Now that the Government has been caught out it is scrambling to give the appearance of action as the spotlight shines on a crisis of its own making.  We will closely scrutinise the proposals the Government brings forward.  Let me be clear: for the Government to in any way exclude apartments from any measures it introduces is for it to tell struggling home buyers that an apartment is not a home, and it is.  It would also be telling struggling home buyers that they are not welcome in cities.  These funds pay no tax on their rental profits and no tax on capital gains.  Sinn F&eacute;in has called for a stamp duty surcharge.  For it to have any impact it needs to be applied without exception at a rate of at least 17%, but it needs to go beyond that.  We must ensure that the profits of these funds are taxed.  Anything short of that simply will not cut it.<\/p>  <p>  The motion before us is about making housing affordable again.  It calls for doubling of direct capital investment in public housing.  It also calls for annual targets to deliver cost rental and affordable purchase homes, and for every local authority in the State to deliver a minimum of 8,000 affordable units each year.  Unaffordable and scarce housing is a social crisis.  It really requires a change of Government to deal with it, but short of that I urge all Deputies to support this motion and start to turn the tide on this crisis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051800036#JJ00200","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"speech","time":1621360800,"counter":344,"content":"<p>The housing crisis has got worse and worse under the Government.  A generation is being failed as we speak.  A single person who wants to buy a home can forget about it.  It seems like a hopeless ambition for a single parent to purchase a home.  Even couples with two incomes and no dependants struggle to get a foothold on the property ladder.  A generation is being squeezed out of property ownership.  For many it is near impossible to get mortgage approval and for those who do get it, in many cases it is for much less than the cost of any dwelling.<\/p>  <p>  House hunters who believe the State can be of assistance are cruelly let down.  They would consider social housing.  They work hard and they earn an average or below-average salary.  They might try to get a council house or HAP or RAS support.  The avenues for social housing are not clear for people whose income exceeds the income threshold of &euro;31,500 for two adults and one child in my home county of Limerick.  One could ask what they should do.  It appears that the Government expects them to live at home with their parents or to rent.  This generation is being bled dry.  If they pay rent, they will be paying 44% more than they did in 2016.  The average rent in Limerick is &euro;1,293 a month, a 6.3% increase on last year.  How are they meant to pay such astronomical rents while saving for a deposit for a house when house prices have increased by 30% over the same five-year period?

We must provide it because a generation of renters and adult children who are being forced to remain living with their parents cannot afford to wait.  The Government must step up to the mark and take significant action on the rental crisis and the delivery of affordable and social housing.  The Government must deliver at least 8,000 affordable houses each year and 4,000 affordable purchase houses each year.  A first step to demonstrate that this is not the case is to stop the sale and gifting of public lands to private developers and to use this land to build public homes like the type I grew up in.  I fear however that the current Minister is not up to the task.  He has progressed with his failed housing policy.  On the main title under his remit he has failed consistently.

However, that means they no longer qualify for any sort of housing support payment, but they cannot afford to rent a property at the current market values.  They have a decision to make, and it frequently results in them turning down work or extra shifts or refusing to claim a social welfare payment to which they are entitled because they must restrict their income in order to qualify for social housing or, to be more exact, qualify for social housing supports.  They are individuals or couples who are quite happy to work and to increase their hours to support themselves and their families.  They would quite happily rent privately but they cannot afford to do so.  The alternative is for them to try to squash in with parents, which is not always an option or to become homeless.  Even properties of a very low standard that are dark, damp and mouldy and do not have sufficient space are being rented to families and individuals for exorbitant rents.  These are places that no one would rent if they had any sort of choice.  They are houses that are in bad condition and that are bad for people's health and for their physical and mental well-being, but they have no choice.<\/p> <p>To rent a three-bed property in Cavan costs approximately &euro;900 per month.  According to the Residential Tenancies Board, average rents in Cavan have risen by 27% in four years and in Monaghan by 17%.  Couples whose relationship has ended are being forced to continue living together as they cannot afford to live in separate dwellings due to lack of availability and affordability.<\/p> <p> There are no properties of any description available at any cost in my constituency.  Last week, a constituent told me there were six properties available for rent and she could afford none of them.  Action has to be taken to deal with this problem because it is getting worse and worse and people are worried and stressed out about how to afford the rent.  They are being forced into poverty.<\/p> <p> The Minister must begin a programme of building affordable houses for rent and for purchase.  Housing need throughout this country is at crisis point and action needs to be taken.  From listening to young people, they have told me they are going to emigrate because they cannot afford any reasonable standard of living in this country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051800036#JJ00400","speaker":"1513","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621361400,"counter":347,"content":"<p>I commend Deputy Eoin &Oacute; Broin for this motion on housing and for all the work he has done around this issue.  The inability to purchase new homes because they are unaffordable is nothing new to residents living in Dublin Bay South.  Young working families have not been able to purchase affordable homes for a long time.  Facebook, Google, LinkedIn, Amazon and now TikTok have all moved into Ringsend, the Pearse Street area and right across south Dublin.  As they have moved in, the prices of buying and renting even modest homes have gone through the roof.  Earlier this year, Deputy &Oacute; Broin got information under freedom of information which showed that the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage was told that Dublin City Council was under pressure to secure the funds to purchase the two sites where the affordable and public housing will be situated on the Irish Glass Bottle Company site.  It is reported that many working in Dublin City Council housing section seem to doubt whether affordable homes can be delivered on the Irish Glass Bottle Company site, and even if they are delivered, it seems they will not be affordable to ordinary working families.  They may be affordable to the high paid executives working in the tech companies but not to young working families who have to continue to live with their parents or pay huge rents that prevent them from saving for a home.<\/p>  <p>  In June of last year, on NewsTalk, the Minister said that he would be looking at house prices in the region of &euro;160,000 to &euro;180,000, and from &euro;230,000 to &euro;250,000 on a shared equity basis.  Now, it seems the affordable homes, if delivered in Ringsend, Harolds Cross or right across south Dublin and Dublin city, will be in the region of &euro;450,000.  That cannot possibly be classed as affordable.  How can ordinary working families ever hope to buy a house in the community they went to school in?  The Irish Glass Bottle Housing Action Group, which has campaigned tirelessly for affordable homes on the Irish Glass Bottle Company site, is extremely concerned that people will not be able to afford affordable housing there, that is if there is any affordable housing because the &euro;450,000 clearly cannot be reached by many people who have grown up and lived in the community.  The Minister needs to state clearly that there will be affordable homes on the Irish Glass Bottle Company site and that they will not cost &euro;450,000.

On the one hand, it pretends to do something about it and, on the other, it is investing in the very cuckoo funds that have moved into the nest of the first-time buyers, and the very vulture funds that are picking at the carcass of any of the hopes of ordinary workers of renting or owning their own homes.<\/p>  <p>  It is becoming increasingly difficult to buy a home, given the cost of housing has increased by 30% since 2016, while the cost of renting has increased by 44% in the same period.

The Government firmly believes that home ownership is good for individuals, good for families, good for communities and good for the State.  With this in mind, we have put affordability and the chance to own a home at the very heart of our housing policy.  The Affordable Housing Bill, which was introduced to the Oireachtas just last night, and the Land Development Agency Bill 2021 will work together to deliver affordable homes.  These two landmark pieces of legislation are backed up by the largest housing budget in the history of the State, with &euro;3.3 billion in 2021.  Some &euro;620 million has been made available for affordability measures.<\/p>  <p>  The Affordable Housing Bill has four key new elements: first, the first local authority-led direct build affordable homes on State lands in over a decade; second, our first ever national cost rental scheme; third, an innovative shared equity scheme; and fourth, the expanding of Part V and designating of units for first-time buyers.  This element will be brought in on Committee Stage in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann following the conclusion of further work with the Attorney General and Cabinet approval.  Using the Bill as its foundation, the upcoming \"Housing for All\" plan, which will be published this summer, will set out the ambitious range of affordable housing targets across the country.<\/p>  <p>  The roll-out of local authority-led direct build affordable housing will be the central plank of the Government&rsquo;s plans.  Homes will range from &euro;160,000 to &euro;310,000.  We are working with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and will shortly bring forward improvements to the &euro;310 million serviced sites fund to ensure it can effectively fund major delivery in the State.<\/p>  <p>  The Government committed to improving rental security and affordability by developing the often proposed cost rental model.  We have now done this.  I am pleased that the development of cost rental has been widely welcomed, including by the Opposition.  Through careful controls and the deployment of public subsidies, rents which cover costs can be at least 25% below market rates, and generally 30%.  This is an entirely new form of housing tenure and an exciting departure for housing in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  In February, we announced approval for the financing of 390 new homes located in Dublin, the surrounding greater Dublin area and Cork under the cost rental equity loan scheme.  These homes are funded by &euro;35 million made available in budget 2021.  A further &euro;100 million in long-term, low-interest loans has been made available by the Housing Finance Agency.<\/p>  <p>  Shared equity will involve the State bridging the affordability gap by taking an equity stake of up to 20% between an individual&rsquo;s mortgage limits and the price of the home.  It will work in conjunction with the help to buy scheme to get people into homes this year.  It will help turn generation rent into a generation that can buy their own home.  It is intended that this scheme will be a short-term, targeted measure as part of a much broader multifaceted approach to increasing housing supply and affordability in the State.  It will increase viability and generate supply to provide an immediate boost to first-time buyers for new homes.  Taking on board legitimate concerns, safeguards are being built in to tailor eligibility to meet individual affordability needs only and to manage prices through area-based price ceilings.<\/p> <p>It is also our intention to bring forward further changes to further strengthen the Affordable Housing Bill at Committee stage.  This will include expanding Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000 and designating a range of units for first-time buyers.  Work is underway with the Attorney General to bring these amendments forward to level the playing field for first-time buyers.<\/p> <p> In addition, the Land Development Agency Bill is being advanced and will have a crucially important and increasing role in the delivery of more affordable homes.  This will include homes for affordable purchase and cost rental, but it will also include social housing.<\/p> <p> We are in the middle of a national housing crisis.  Faced with such an emergency we need to use all tools at our disposal to address this challenge across both the private and public sectors.  We need to stop letting one party&rsquo;s perfect be the enemy of everyone&rsquo;s good when facing a crisis.  Magic bullet fantasies and cynical hysteria politics do a generation locked in a rent trap a grave disservice.  We are very much aware of the breadth of the task that is facing us in this area, and are determined to take on this challenge.  The Government is confident that the extensive range of measures that our three parties are introducing will increase the housing supply in the State and make housing more affordable for people across the country, and as such I reiterate our proposed revisions to the motion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051800037#KK00600","speaker":"1595","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621362000,"counter":353,"content":"<p>Home ownership has become a pipe dream for many my age.  That is the sad reality.  Young people feel hopeless and locked out of the housing market.  This is fundamentally wrong and must change.  That is why I am so glad this Government is committed to changing that and has backed up that commitment with historic investment.  We want to make renting and home ownership accessible, affordable and achievable for everyone.  In the past year we have taken five major steps towards that.  We extended the help-to-buy scheme for first-time buyers and we brought in the Land Development Agency to kick start the delivery of homes on public land.  We will extend the Part V obligations to include 10% affordable housing as well as 10% social and shortly we will pass the Affordable Housing Bill to give people the opportunity to own their own home or to avail of secure, affordable long-term leases.  I am not sure if Sinn F&eacute;in has supported even one of those milestone measures.  Instead it is focused on delay tactics, on fairytale economics and on impractical ideology that results not in homes but in Sinn F&eacute;in councillors voting against homes on public land, over 5,000 homes in Dublin City Council alone in less than two years.<\/p>  <p>  We all agree that international investment funds should not be competing with first-time buyers for three and four-bed family homes but we should not be naive either about where foreign investment is needed.  We need to produce in excess of 35,000 homes a year over the next ten years at a cost of &euro;10 billion a year.  We can invest &euro;3 billion or &euro;4 billion in State funding every year but where will we find the &euro;6 billion short fall without external investment?  The Sinn F&eacute;in motion seems built on the idea that we should borrow &euro;6 billion every year for ten years but with the balance sheet of about &euro;266 billion, that is just not practical.  The Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, is bringing forward legislation to address the issue of investment funds competing with first-time buyers.  Will Sinn F&eacute;in support that or will it stick with its tried and tested policy of delay and oppose?  Will it back the Affordable Housing Bill or will it vote against it on the pretence that one strand of the Bill will not work, despite it supporting that strand in the North and overseeing its operation?  There it calls it a success, here it brands it a fantasy.  The truth is the policy of opposition for the sake of opposition will deliver nothing for anybody.

It is important to realise that the reason for the housing challenge in this country is that the number of people working here has increased by over 400,000 since 2011.  The housing market does not respond immediately to demand.  From the time of identifying a site to putting in planning and going through the planning process to building is approximately three years.  For the market to respond to demand takes anything up to three to four years.  It is also difficult in Ireland where the process is far too long, particularly when there is such a huge range of opportunities for people to object and delay the process which is not helpful in the delivery of housing.  It is also important that we realise that despite all the economic challenges from 2011 and 2016, from then houses did become available.  In the last four years, over 73,000 new residential units were built.  That is not often acknowledged.  Yes, there are challenges but look at the changes in that four years, where we went from 14,000 in a year to over 21,000.

This Government is no exception.  It is continuing to put forward failed policies and strategies.  The Minister has put forward housing proposals which will not deliver social and affordable housing on the scale required or even houses that are affordable.  The Government's view of what is affordable goes beyond what most couples on good incomes can actually afford to buy.  The Minister's housing plans, which include schemes such as the shared equity scheme, lack ambition, will inflate house prices, increase personal debt and go against expert opinion.  His proposals were strongly condemned as ill-conceived by housing associations, housing experts and economic organisations, yet they were robustly defended by local Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies despite all the evidence to the contrary.  Now, with the public backlash, these very same Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies are imploring the Minister to revise his proposals.  We need to get away on the reliance on private developers building social and affordable housing.  The Minister's policies pander to the private sector and to the very vulture funds and similar which can avail of significant grants and tax exemptions, allowing them to buy up whole housing estates.  In my constituency of Dublin North-West a company which bought a whole housing estate in Kildare is now buying up entire apartment blocks in Santry to rent them out.  This is also happening in other areas of the constituency and every day I hear from my constituents of their frustrations as they try to get on the property ladder.  Investment funds are driving up property prices and rents.  Local authorities should be the drivers behind the building of social and affordable housing, not private developers.  In my constituency, lands belonging to local authorities have been identified around Finglas, Ballymun, Whitehall and Santry where housing can be built at an affordable cost.

There are thousands on the housing list in Meath and 157 people in the county remain homeless, according to the latest figures.  This did not happen by chance.

Some of the reasons may be valid as there may be violations of master plans and objectives, and we all reserve the right to protect these and to speak to them and to democratic processes, but many of the reasons are not valid.<\/p> <p><i>7 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p>  <p>Many are purely to protect votes in their own backyard.  That is the reality.  Politicians have to be honest with themselves.  Bills were presented to the Oireachtas last night which we believe will not solve the affordability crisis.  We supported the Land Development Agency Bill on Second Stage because we believe in the concept of a land development agency but we have little faith that it will do what needs to be done.  We all need to take responsibility.  This is another good motion presented by Deputy &Oacute; Broin.  There is much good in it but people, who are angry, will look at mud being slung from side to side of the D&aacute;il.  I refer to an article by a friend of mine, Conor Sheehan, who is a county councillor in Limerick.  It was in the <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>today.  I know he is a county councillor, working in politics, but Conor is essentially a worker, like everyone else, who earns an average income like everyone else.  He does not have a permanent pensionable job but he is a worker who is working hard and is performing his side of the social contract.  He is not getting anywhere and he is not able to afford a home.  He is doing everything right.<br\/><br\/>I mention him because he is based in Limerick.  There is sometimes a focus on the housing crisis as a Dublin issue.  Maybe it is felt more acutely because Dublin is the most expensive place to live or rent in the country.  Our media and many of our politicians, and so on, are based here.  Our housing and affordability crisis, which affects young people, is in every county in this State.  People are furious.  On the road I grew up on in Finglas, when you look at the houses there, there were people who worked in Superquinn, in the local pub, painters and decorators, retired people, porters in banks, glazers, people who worked in hospitals, electricians, nurses and a postman.  A whole gamut people lived there and were able to afford a mortgage on a decent home in a good area.  If I went and asked them, none would say that they got that easily.  They worked hard for it.  They followed the pathway that was there and, ultimately, they got what they worked hard for.  The difference now is that people are working as hard as they did in the past but the State is not living up to its obligations.  It is failing on every single level.  People's anger is palpable.  It is difficult when one sees the social contract being broken in such an egregious way.<br\/><br\/>How do we go about fixing this system?  We need to go back to the Kenny report and its recommendations.  We know we are going back in time but we need to look at the price of land and how to tackle that.  The recommendations of the Kenny report need to be implemented.  If they are to be challenged, let them be challenged.  It is there and too many Governments have ignored it or not tested it.  That cannot go on.  We will promote this in the coming weeks and look for support.  We need to link up secure work, trade union membership density and the living wage with the ability to afford a home.  That ability is lacking and the insecurity of work, low pay and poor conditions are impacting people's ability to afford a home.<br\/><br\/>We need to reorient our thinking along those lines as a State.  As has been mentioned so much over the last weeks, we need to kick the cuckoo funds and for-profit investment funds out of this area.  They are causing corrosive damage, not only with the bulk purchasing of new estates, but their activity in the second-hand housing market is going under the radar and is having a significant impact that I believe is not being measured accordingly.  They are going in to take houses before they even hit the market, so first-time buyers or people downsizing are not even aware that these houses would have been available to them.  That has to end.  There is certainly unanimous agreement in the Opposition on that but I believe that the vast majority of individuals in Government have to believe that this needs to end.<br\/><br\/>We need State investment in affordable housing at scale, as is mentioned in this motion.  There is no other way around it.  We want to be able to support the affordable housing Bill, as mentioned by our spokesperson, Senator Moynihan, last night.  We will have a lot of difficulty because there is a fundamental flaw in the Bill, which is its failure to provide a definition of affordability linked to income.  This one flaw cuts the credibility of the affordable housing Bill in half.  As Senator Moynihan said last night, we should call it what it is, which is a market discount Bill.  When one sees a Bill such as this being presented at a time when a three-bed apartment in the proposed O'Devaney Gardens development is being presented for &euro;420,000, one gets a sense of just how crazy, how wrong and failing this system is.  This Bill will not resolve that.  The shared equity portion of the Bill, despite all the voices beyond politics, including the Economic and Social Research Institute and other agencies raising issues, and the examples of it failing to work in other jurisdictions, still remains part of this Bill.<br\/><br\/>First-time buyers, young people and workers are watching the debates in the D&aacute;il.  They are not just looking at this via social media, Twitter or Facebook.  They are watching the actual debates on Oireachtas TV.  They will be as angry after this debate as they are after every other debate and every week that goes by without any progress, with every Bill that is presented that they know will not solve the problem.  There is a lost generation.  With the way things are going, we could have two lost generations.  We, as this small island with a relatively small population on the west coast of Europe, are failing again with a key issue, which is the provision of affordable, secure housing for the island's people.  I do not want to be anywhere, whether here or on a bar stool, having this same conversation in ten years in front of a Ceann Comhairle or a friend.  This has to be resolved straight away.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051800039#MM00400","speaker":"1564","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621363200,"counter":362,"content":"<p>Following on from what Deputy Smith said, there is significant anger and it is not just from young people.  People in their 30s and 40s who would have aspired to own a home and in previous generations, working hard, saving and putting their shoulder to a wheel, would have been able to afford a home, are increasingly angry about this and about being locked out of home ownership.  Older generations are angry about this.  I remember the number of people I met during the election campaign who told me about how, when they were younger, they were able to afford a home and how angry they were that they had their grown-up children and grandchildren in the box rooms and the worry that they had for them.  They were angry that the social contract that they had, which they expected for their children and grandchildren, has been ripped up.<\/p>  <p>  This has happened because of the choices and decisions made at a Government level.  None of this is an accident.  I have several issues with the Government's approach to housing.  A specific issue that is unforgivable when it comes to housing policy is that the Government will not listen to mainstream, independent advice.  I can understand if the Government does not listen to people in the Opposition and dismisses it, which is the Government's own prerogative, but not to listen to its own advice from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the Central Bank and the ESRI is unforgivable.  They have specifically advised that the shared equity scheme in the Government's affordable housing Bill will drive up house prices.  It is an indisputable fact that they have advised that.  Another indisputable fact about the shared equity scheme that the Government is putting forward is that it was lobbied for by developers.  One can see that if one looks through the lobbying register.  That was where the idea came from.<\/p> <p>It was not in any of the parties' manifestos in the last general election.  Another undisputable fact is that, when a shared equity scheme was introduced in the UK, it caused the profits of the larger developers and builders in the UK to soar.  Their profit levels went through the roof.  These are three undisputable facts.<\/p> <p> When the Government is making its decisions regarding housing, what is missing in its approach is a realisation of the great human cost of housing unaffordability and insecurity for people and families.  It creates incredible stress.  It causes delays in the formation of families as people put off having children.  People do not know whether their children will be able to stay in their school or if they will have to move.  This is heart-wrenching for parents who have quieter children or children with additional needs.  It may have taken them a couple of years to get them settled into school and to get them to a point at which they are comfortable and have friends.  The stress caused by housing unaffordability and insecurity in the private rented sector is heart-wrenching.  Of course, if it wanted to, Government could tackle this latter issue straight away.  It could bring in improvements and security of tenure for renters.  It could do that straight away.  Parents face heart-wrenching stress and anxiety because, having gone through everything to settle their kids in a school, they just do not know if they will be uprooted and have to move away again.  It might take years for their children to again form friendships, to get involved in local GAA clubs and so on.  I wonder if this was considered properly at all.  <\/p> <p> Let us look at the role of institutional investment funds.  We have heard reports in the media over recent days as to what the Government is planning to do in this area.  We have heard about measures that would be completely and utterly insufficient to deal with this problem.  The planning measures the Government are floating and talking about will not, in effect, kick in for several years.  Planning permission was secured for Mullen Park in Maynooth in 2014.  That is when the process there started.  One might be looking at delays of four, five or six years in respect of many developments that have been given planning permission.  We also know the Government does not believe the very limited planning protections being talked about should apply to higher-density developments or apartments.  It does not believe the families and individuals who live in apartments should have the same rights as those who live in lower-density housing.  <\/p> <p> We do not yet know what the Government intends to do with regard to stamp duty but I would be surprised if it brought in the sorts of measures needed, for example, a rate equivalent to that in the UK, where it is 15%, and surcharges for investment funds and companies investing in properties worth more than &pound;500,000.  At a minimum, these are the sorts of measures at which the Government should be looking with regard to stamp duty, but it would not be enough.  Really, the Government should be looking at rent levels, especially for new-build developments.  If one wants to tackle the very high yields investment funds make from buying up properties here and renting them out, one needs to look at the rent levels.  That would be a proper deterrent and would also provide more affordable rents for people.  With regard to institutional investment funds, the Government and State are playing a key role in that, through the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, they are using public funds, State funds, to buy up property though investment funds.  These investment funds the State finance may build themselves or they may buy up property.  That makes absolutely no sense whatsoever.  <\/p> <p> Earlier today, I cited an example.  Activate Capital has put State funds, provided by the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, into a housing development in Blackhall Place.  Dublin City Council then agreed long-term leases on these same homes, homes which were at least part-financed by State funds, and has guaranteed rents of &euro;2,000 per month per home.  This is an absolutely unacceptable use of public money.  It is inflating home prices while agreeing these sweetheart deals on long-term leases.  It is completely unacceptable.<\/p> <p> It is worth noting that the Institute of Professional Auctioneers and Valuers has said that the Government should seek discounts of approximately 50% on market values when negotiating long-term leases for houses and discounts of 30% for apartments.  What sort of discount does the Government look for?  It looks for a discount of between 5% and 10% on full market rates when industry sources say that we should be going for something in the region of 50%.  We also know from responses to freedom of information requests I have made that, in some cases, the State did not even look for an independent valuation in respect of market rates.  The State just signed up on the basis of the valuations given by the developer.  One really could not make it up.  The Government is ploughing in these great sums of money while not seeking value for money, not attempting to drive down rents and not trying to ensure housing affordability.<\/p> <p> As to what needs to be done in this regard, there is no question at all but that the recommendations of the Kenny report should be implemented without delay to drive down the price of development land.  That is what the Land Development Agency should be doing.  It should be assembling land for affordable housing and affordable homes.  &Oacute; Cualann Cohousing Alliance has proven that genuinely affordable homes can be built if land is made available.  That is what the Land Development Agency should be doing but that is not the Bill the Government is bringing before us with regard to the agency.  Instead there are all sorts of revisions to the Land Development Agency.  For example, it will be allowed to take land from public bodies and, if it does not use it, it will be allowed to sell it off to a private third-party developer.  Why include that provision in the Bill if it is not something the Government wants to use?  Why not provide safeguards by removing those sorts of clauses from the Bill?  We will know if the Government is in any way serious about this because, if it is, it will remove those clauses from the Bill straight away.<\/p> <p> People are very angry about this.  There is a responsibility on all of us to make sure we do everything we can to address this issue.  The Government should really start by listening to mainstream independent advice in this area.  It should listen to such advice and drop the shared equity scheme.  That would be a good start.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051800040#NN00200","speaker":"1550","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621363800,"counter":364,"content":"<p>I will be sharing my time.  I will take seven minutes and Deputy Barry will take three.  I thank Deputy &Oacute; Broin for using his party's Private Members' time to bring up this important discussion on affordable housing.  It is very difficult to know where to start with the Government's narrative.  It comes in here and says that the Opposition just criticises for the sake of criticising and that we have no constructive proposals.  That is such a dishonest narrative.  I am really quite sick of it at this stage.  The Government continues to play politics with this issue, which is a crisis for great numbers of people.  The majority of people are now affected by the crises in housing and affordability or by the extortionate cost of rent in one way or another.  The vast majority of working people cannot afford the prices at which the market is delivering, or not delivering, houses or the rents being charged.  They are simply unaffordable for the vast majority of people.<\/p>  <p>  Rather than acknowledging the mess it has made of this, the Government keeps firing back dishonest criticism at the Opposition.  Every single year since I got into the D&aacute;il, People Before Profit has submitted an alternative budget.  Since year one, 2011, we have been warning about the Government's policies on housing, and particularly its decision to sell off all the NAMA properties.  We had the opportunity to take control of this land bank and to deal with the housing crisis by delivering affordable housing on a massive scale.  In 2011, we warned that the Government was making a disastrous decision.<\/p> <p>In that year, the same Fine Gael-Labour Party Government made a decision, one that was also criticised by us, to stop the capital construction programme of public housing and outsource the delivery of social housing to the private sector.  In what was essentially a counter-revolution in social housing, social housing was transformed overnight into social housing support, which was code for outsourcing it to the private sector.  These two decisions - offloading the NAMA portfolio and stopping the building of council housing - have led to this disastrous situation.  It is not just a disaster for the 70,000 to 100,000 families on social housing waiting lists.  If the State is not delivering public and affordable housing on its own land, it means that the for-profit entities - vulture funds, cuckoos and speculators - control the market, prices and rents, destroying things for everyone.  The public land bank is the way to dampen the market and have a counterbalance to these unaffordable rents and property prices.<\/p> <p> I should add to this debate the banks, which have not been mentioned yet.  In 2019, the Central Bank pointed out that people in Ireland were paying &euro;80,000 more in interest on an average mortgage of &euro;300,000 than their European counterparts were.  This is another component of the unaffordability issue.  The banks that we bailed out are essentially extorting their mortgage customers with the highest interest rates anywhere in Europe.<\/p> <p> How do we solve this crisis?  We should do the exact opposite of what the Government is doing.  People Before Profit has been saying this in budget submission after budget submission since I entered the D&aacute;il in 2011.  We should use the public land bank to deliver public and affordable housing directly.  Affordability must not have anything to do with the market.  The whole point of affordability is that it should be related to someone's income.  If it is related to market conditions or market prices, it is not about affordability, but something else.  If we want to unravel the mystery of why the Government, despite making announcement after announcement about affordable housing for five years or God knows how long, has not delivered a single affordable house, there is a simple reason.  The same property developers the Government is talking to and being lobbied by - we have now discovered that the Government is giving them hundreds of millions of euro and designing laws in order to involve them further in public land banks through the Land Development Agency - do not want houses being sold at affordable levels.  If they were trying to flog houses at &euro;400,000 or &euro;500,000 but the State was building &euro;180,000 or &euro;200,000 houses, who would buy houses from them?  The Government should not care about them.  It should care about delivering housing.  This can be done on public land at rates that are affordable.  It would drive the speculators, vulture funds, cuckoos and so on crazy, however, which is why the Government does not do it and we either do not get affordable housing or get \"affordable\" housing that is unaffordable.  The cap in Dublin will be &euro;450,000.  The Minister called it a local area ceiling price cap, but that would defeat the whole point of affordability if the cap is based on market conditions in Dublin, which are off the Richter scale.  The cap must be about income.  A teacher, nurse, council worker or retail worker does not earn a higher wage just because he or she happens to live in Dublin where rents and property prices are higher.  Affordability has to be linked to the actual incomes that ordinary workers earn, and the average income in this country is approximately &euro;40,000 per year, with many earning much less.  Rents and mortgages have to be set at actual affordable levels.  This means rent controls where local authorities tell landlords that they are not allowed to charge more than a certain amount for a property.  The rent would have to be affordable for the incomes of ordinary workers.<\/p> <p> We have proposed solutions.  They could be used, but the truth is that the Government is not interested because it is dancing to the tune of the speculators, vultures and investment funds that want to profit from the housing crisis and have no interest in solving it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051800041#OO00200","speaker":"1478","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621364400,"counter":366,"content":"<p>I wish to address the emergency legislation that will be considered tonight by the Cabinet.  <i>The Irish Times<\/i>has posted a report that the Cabinet is considering the idea of increasing stamp duty to 10% on multiple purchases and that multiple purchases would be defined as the purchase of more than ten houses.  In the case of a &euro;250,000 house, the ordinary house buyer would pay stamp duty of &euro;2,500 whereas the investment fund would pay stamp duty of &euro;25,000.  We can set that against a recent comment in the <i>Business Post<\/i>to the effect that approved housing bodies had in some cases been outbid by up to &euro;80,000 per house over the preceding four weeks.

If I were the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, I would simply ban investment funds from snapping up houses in housing estates.  If we are going to take the stamp duty route, though, we need to go well beyond 10%.  Why not have a stamp duty rate of 100%?  No ordinary person would be affected by that, as he or she would not be buying multiple houses in the current market.  Why has the Government set the number at more than ten houses?  What ordinary person is going to buy seven, eight or nine houses?  If we are going to stop speculation in the housing market, the number should be much lower than ten.  The legislation must apply to apartments and existing developments, cover corporation tax and capital gains tax for the vultures, and include not only stamp duty increases but also increases in the rent roll.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051800042#PP00200","speaker":"1522"},{"type":"speech","time":1621364400,"counter":367,"content":"<p>I thank Sinn F&eacute;in for using its Private Members' time to table this motion.  Over the past week, the housing crisis has come back to front and centre on the political agenda.  We have had much debate about cuckoo funds, vulture funds and housing policy.  The Minister has said that he is committed to providing family homes - semi-detached or detached houses with front and back gardens, as he declared on air with Ms Claire Byrne last week.  The truth of the matter is that all of this is rhetoric.  Fine Gael wants people to live in apartments, duplex-type units or terraced housing with no gardens.  No one in the House would dispute that our children and our children's children will aspire to live in semi-detached or detached houses with front and back gardens where they can rear their families in a reasonable space.  This is most people's aspiration for themselves and their families.  Unfortunately, the problem appears to be that the Government does not realise that our planning policy, as enunciated in ministerial guidelines, provides for few family homes, and certainly not on the scale of 20,000 that we hear politicians speaking about in the national media.<\/p>  <p>  A most astonishing statistic struck me last week but got no coverage in the media.  Out of 16,000 units that received planning permission from An Bord Plean&aacute;la, only 4,334 were houses.  Of those, only 1,200 were semi-detached or detached family homes.<\/p> <p>That is an astonishing figure for a Government that is committed to building family homes.  It is extraordinary that the penny has not dropped with either the Government or the media that planning permissions are not being granted for family homes because planning policy prevents that from happening.  Last week, it further became clear that the only reason the Government was upset about cuckoo funds was that those funds had started buying family homes.<\/p> <p> There are many issues surrounding the supply of housing, including planning policy, funding and viability.  Apartments and duplex-type units are not viable beyond the M50.  There are many strategic housing development, SHD, permissions that have not been implemented simply because there is no demand for the flats and duplexes for which permission was granted.  An issue that seems to escape everybody in this House is that we will have to build family homes to solve the housing crisis.  However, Government policy is mostly  opposed to family homes.  I ask anyone who disagrees with me to read specific planning policy requirement, SPPR, 4 of the ministerial guidelines on building heights, which states that two-storey and own-door houses should be avoided.  If we are to have supply of family homes, we must immediately start amending planning policy.  We need to allow houses to be developed at ten units per acre beyond the M50.  We know for certain that this type of medium-density housing is what our constituents and their families want.  It is what planners outside Dublin want.  Such development is buildable, fundable and viable.<\/p> <p> Fine Gael in government, with the support of the Minister for Finance, surrendered control of housing planning policy to a small cohort of planners who are city-based.  It has promoted a policy that forced families into small flats or duplexes and other spaces that are not suitable for rearing families.  This was confirmed by An Bord Plean&aacute;la when its representatives appeared before the Committee of Public Accounts.  They indicated that a mere 7% of the total units for which planning permission was granted were family homes.  Has no one in the Government stopped to consider this point?  Our planning system is abjectly anti-family homes in favour of a high-density model that was conceived in post-revolution Moscow.  The 15-minute city regularly cited by the Custom House as the panacea to all housing and transport ills has never worked anywhere from a social perspective.  The policy does not consider its dire social effects.<\/p> <p> I commend the councillors of County Cavan who exercised their mandate and rejected this Stalinist, anti-family home policy in favour of a rational approach that will serve their constituents well.  I call on all councillors worth their salt in rural Ireland to stand up and be counted and reject the Stalinist housing policy that has been slavishly implemented by Fine Gael in government.  If we do not, in the first instance, give people the family homes they want, we will never solve the housing crisis.  The real question is whether Fianna F&aacute;il has the bottle to take control of this crisis.  To do that, it must amend planning policy now.  If it does not do so in the next few months, the crisis will persist for decades.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051800042#PP00300","speaker":"1622","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621365000,"counter":369,"content":"<p>I am happy to take part in this debate, not only on affordable housing but on the crisis in housing.  There is a crisis in terms of supply, affordability, sustainability, planning and the long-term economic effects of housing policy as it is operating at present.  In terms of supply issues, other speakers have referred to the ability to develop land but I am not sure they understand the real difficulties in this regard.  A commercial developer looking at a parcel of zoned land must first consider the scale of development that he or she will either be allowed or required to do.  Developers must then consider what density of housing is being asked for and look at the financial viability of building something and trying to sell it on, probably two or three years after planning was originally sought.  Beyond that, they have to think of the difficulties of going into banks to raise developer finance.  The reason we have cuckoo and vulture funds in Ireland is that they are underpinning development finance.  There is no doubt that they are outbidding housing bodies.<\/p>  <p>  Another issue is the SHD provision in respect of planning developments of more than 100 units.  In my city of Waterford, it has served us poorly.  A major development there has been given planning permission but will not be built in its present configuration because it involves a large number of single apartments for which there is no market in the city.  The developer will wait to see how the planning can be tweaked in future.  We need to look at how planning is configured and what is required in terms of density.  There are also major issues with Irish Water, service access and zoning and servicing sites.<\/p>  <p>  Then there is the affordable issue.  There is not a builder in the country now who can build houses for less than &euro;200 per square foot.  That is not taking account of site costs.  It will cost a builder &euro;250,000 to &euro;260,000 to build a 1,300 sq. ft house, before adding the site cost and service access costs.  Somebody buying that house will have to pay &euro;200,000 at 4% over a 20-year mortgage and also pay up to &euro;98,000 on top of the mortgage.  There are very few of those homes available in the country.  People are looking at 30-year mortgages or at affordable and other schemes.  What the Minister has brought in may not be perfect but I welcome initiatives such as the help to buy scheme and the new affordable housing scheme.  There is definitely room for the cost-rental model in Ireland.  Under the affordable scheme, 20% of the house cost is payable at 0% for five years, which will be a help.  However, we must look at people's ability to borrow the additional moneys required.  They will still have to come up with 80% of the cost.  People working in an SME for the average industrial wage - I am not talking about the public sector, including garda&iacute; and nurses - are earning between &euro;28,000 and &euro;35,000.  If such people are not partnered up, how are they to buy any apartment or house?  They have no chance.  Yet, at the same time, we have a large amount of vacant property in the State and nobody is talking about a housing model that would offer incentives to property owners to develop such property for the market.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the new provision to mandate that 10% of new housing schemes be affordable.  As a councillor in Waterford, I asked for that many times.  However, I reiterate the issue of purchaser sustainability.  Planning issues are still to the fore and planning guidelines, as Deputy Verona Murphy outlined, are now very much in the mix.  It appears that the Government, the planning authorities and the regulator are taking a very negative view of one-off housing in rural Ireland.  That is a very retrograde step for the development and sustainability of communities.  We cannot have minimum density requirements in the regions.  We talk all the time in the House about the migration to Dublin.  We need to get people out of Dublin and give them the opportunity to live in rural areas.  We are not a densely populated country and we can afford to have people living rurally.<\/p>  <p>  I will conclude by referring to a couple of initiatives I would like to see introduced.  In terms of affordability, public land use is absolutely crucial.  There must be a review of the purchasing index because we are paying far too much for materials in this country.  I would like to see some type of public procurement system and probably a parcelling up of land zonings that would be given to smaller developers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051800043#QQ00200","speaker":"1616"},{"type":"speech","time":1621365000,"counter":370,"content":"<p>We can talk in here until the cows come home about affordable housing but Government policy, especially since the Green Party went into government and got its way on so many issues, means that affordable housing is a pipe dream.

Then we have the young men and women who have a site and are able to build a house but are not allowed to do so.  There are also issues with councils refurbishing houses.  In the case of Waterford City and County Council, for example, in any house it retrofits, the chimney is blocked.  There are to be no more chimneys in any of the new houses that are in planning.  I spoke to a farmer last week who is having problems getting planning permission for his daughter.  He has 300 acres of land with timber and everything else.<\/p>  <p>  Everything is being done to drive costs upward.  Houses are non-affordable instead of affordable.  We talk in this House about why housing cannot be built.  It must be profitable for a builder - I am talking about small builders, not the big developers - to build a house, but it is not.  The cost has gone higher and higher.  There are issues with all the waste material.  We have gone over the top with disposal costs as well.  We have had regulation after regulation and, hey presto, we have a new planning regulator, which is another big quango.  The first time ever I heard of it was in regard to the Cahir town plan that was done recently.  The person in charge is a planner all his life and now he has the power and is diminishing the powers of local authorities.<\/p> <p>It is shocking.  Cahir was forced to dezone from 50 ha down to 10 ha.  I hope this will be changed now.  The council has come out this week to build on a site to which the councillors had objected because it is a green area in a housing estate.  The council is going building there after rezoning 50 ha elsewhere in the town, taking away the green space it had.  The policies are those of a nincompoop.  It is an upside-down, mixed-up world.  It is crazy.  If you were to put the whole lot into a cement mixer, mix it all up and churn it out in a heap, you would get more common sense out of it.  There is absolutely no common sense whatsoever.  The people who want to build the houses will not be let build them, and the builder cannot afford to build them because of all the regulations and baloney.  I could call it something a lot stronger but I will not use the world I am thinking of in our national Parliament.  A hundred years on from the freedom Dan Breen, Se&aacute;n Treacy, Michael Collins and Liam Lynch fought for, now we are tied up in knots, with regulation after regulation and officers, officials and regulators wielding power like latter-day gods.  They are like Stalin.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051800043#QQ00300","speaker":"1612","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621365600,"counter":372,"content":"<p>I thank Sinn F&eacute;in for allowing us this time to debate this very important motion.  I have nothing personal to say to anyone, but there is a hames being made of the building of houses.  The Government is paying a regulator to dezone land in Kerry.  It is paying a regulator to block one-off houses for people who would build the houses themselves if they could get the planning permission.  The Government is giving one developer in each settlement, town or village the monopoly to build houses.  If there were a developer on a site on each side of a town, at least you would have competition, but what happens if you give that monopoly to one developer?  Those developers have a monopoly and can charge what they like.  There is no competition.  Small traditional builders who always built a few houses and sold them on cannot build now because they cannot finance a scheme of ten or 12 houses.  Banks will not put forward the finance.  Since the abolition of stage payments, they cannot carry the full cost of the houses until they get paid.  What happened - and I have seen this happening - when they finished the houses and sold them on?  Money was held back by the purchasers and the developers found it very hard to get the last &euro;15,000 or &euro;20,000 from them.  That is why the builders are not building.<\/p>  <p>  Following the debacle we have gone through here day after day when we have raised the felling licences, the price of timber has gone up to an exorbitant amount and is not available.  It takes six weeks to deliver the timber ordered for a house.  They will not tell you the price, or they cannot do so until they bring it to you.  Irish Water is charging &euro;6,500 per house in a scheme.  The price of insulation has gone up by 40%.  The price of steel has doubled.  There are other levies and regulations.  If the Government is wondering why it is costing massive sums of money to build houses or why it is so hard to build them, those are some of the reasons.  The Government would want to cop on and go down the country and look at what is going on there.  The Government is talking about &euro;450,000 for a house.  That is not an affordable house.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051800044#RR00200","speaker":"1580"},{"type":"speech","time":1621365600,"counter":373,"content":"<p>T&aacute; &aacute;thas orm labhairt ar an r&uacute;n f&iacute;orth&aacute;bhachtach seo.  Affordable housing - or indeed the lack of affordable housing schemes - is a huge issue of concern.  In my constituency, Laois-Offaly, we have little or none available, which is leading to couples and single people paying exorbitant rents.  Even though some areas are rent pressure zones, it makes little or no difference.  This Government needs to get real.  It is failing many of our young people because of the lack of action on building affordable housing schemes, which are so badly needed.  What is very frustrating to people is that the signs of this problem growing have been there for years and years yet we have allowed it to deteriorate to catastrophic levels.<\/p>  <p>  In 2019 the ESRI made it clear that the trends in housing payment costs across households showed that on average households were paying one fifth of their total income on housing costs.  This figure has only grown with the rising costs of insurance and utilities.  The ESRI analysis indicated that private renters and low-income households were paying a significantly higher proportion of their incomes on housing payments.  Households in the bottom 25% of income distribution in particular were spending between two fifths to more than one half of their income on housing costs, depending on tenure.  Again, all this has become worse in the intervening years.  We have a society crippled by the lack of affordable housing options, a planning system at the mercy of organisations which should be disbanded, like An Taisce, and a local authority housebuilding system that is not fit for purpose.  There are issues with the planning arrangements in local authorities.  It takes far too long for these housing schemes to get off the ground.  Every local authority should have its own legal department in order to be able to move the process on.  We have to see a change here and we have to see the Government stepping up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051800044#RR00300","speaker":"1592"},{"type":"speech","time":1621365600,"counter":374,"content":"<p>We have been talking about housing since I got here in 2016.  Unfortunately, we have gone from one housing crisis to another.  I know now why there is a crisis in housing.  It is because of the Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il parties.  They are backed up now by their buddies in the Greens.  They are the cause of the problem and the nightmare.  Young people in rural Ireland want to build on their own farms and in their own communities.  They are being refused continuously by a planning system, regulations and the 2040 plan.  Our group did our best here last week to try to see if we could turn that 2040 plan into a document on which we could have at least a little consultation and discussion in order that young people would be allowed planning permission in their own areas.  Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Greens all voted one way and that was to make sure to heap more misery and difficulty on those people.  As if there were not enough regulation, the Government parties have their buddies in An Taisce just in case you get past the post.  An Taisce gets over &euro;3 million a year from the State.  We have looked at all the Departments that were handing out money to An Taisce left, right and centre.  Nobody is questioning why every other organisation in the country does not get money.  This is an organisation that certain political parties want to have in our system to make life more difficult for people who want to get housing.<\/p>  <p>  We blame the development plans, and I urge Cork County Council to be very careful in supporting its county development plan if parts of it involve the 2040 plan that Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il have put into these county development plans.  If it does, and if it means young people cannot get planning permission in their own communities, the council should absolutely reject it and be proud to do so.  We are looking at dezoning and a situation in which if people are lucky and fortunate enough to get planning permission, there is then the issue that the banks will not give them the money.  We have a massive housing crisis, whether you are building one or whether you cannot get to live in one.  Today we were told that despite being promised that there would be 80 timber felling licences a week, we are down to 40.  We have a crisis of the highest order and it is led by the Green Party and then Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael backing them up.  Something has to give here.  The country is starting to overheat and these parties are lying idly by.  They are costing young people their homes and their lives.  They cannot just start off in life like everybody else once did.  Many of these politicians have their own homes and there was nobody standing before them refusing them when they bought or built them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051800044#RR00400","speaker":"1461"},{"type":"speech","time":1621365600,"counter":375,"content":"<p>I thank Sinn F&eacute;in and Deputy &Oacute; Broin for using their Private Members' time to put this issue on the agenda of the D&aacute;il.  As with previous housing motions, it is really important.  I have two questions for Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael, the dominant parties in successive governments, and for the Labour Party and the Greens.  I found it incredible to listen to the Labour Party representative tonight.  The last time the Labour Party was in government, it was too busy trying to force domestic water charges down the throats of working-class people to notice the developing housing crisis.  What it gave us was the initiation of HAP, which is causing huge problems.  My first question is this: how did the governments of these parties, successive establishment governments, get into this mess?<\/p> <p>This crisis is the result of policy decisions made by the successive governments led by the establishment parties and their decision to end direct local authority house building and transfer responsibility to the private sector.  Local authority housing stock now is only one third of what it was in the 1960s.  Before the crash, pursuant to this policy, the Government attempted to create a new class of small part-time landlords, encouraging so-called buy-to-lets.  After the crash, many of these buy-to-lets ended up being repossessed.  A new strategy then emerged of encouraging REITs, so-called vulture and cuckoo funds.  They are exempt from corporation tax, stamp duty and capital gains tax.  In addition, as revealed in the <i>Business Post<\/i>, State funds were invested in these companies.  <br\/><br\/>What can the Government now do to resolve this mess?  It seems that the Attorney General has given his blessing to proposals under consideration by the Cabinet.  That does not mean that any proposal will not be subject to legal challenges.  If the stamp duty is increased, the extra cost will simply be included in increased prices and higher rents.  Changes to planning could take three to four years to be passed and implemented.  Between 70,000 and 80,000 planning applications are currently in process and they will not be affected by any new laws.  <br\/><br\/>This crisis will not blow over.  It will not be resolved by mere tinkering with the system.  If it were not for the pandemic, there would already be enormous protests on the streets on this issue.  Based on the number of emails and social media comments I am getting, I believe there is a strong mood to be on the streets, demanding change.  <br\/><br\/>Fianna F&aacute;il is now trying to protect itself as a party of first-time buyers.  We should be clear who these first-time buyers are.  They are young working-class couples.  They are not looking to put their foot on the so-called property ladder.  These are couples seeking to put a roof over their head and hopefully raise a family.  They cannot afford to be at the mercy of some greedy landlord, jacking up the rent or evicting them because they can get more out of someone else.<br\/><br\/>The proposal to build 6,000 so-called affordable homes over the next four years will not con anybody; it is actually pathetic.  Sufficient zoned land is available through local authorities and NAMA to make a significant dent in this crisis.  It means, in the main, building public houses, the majority with affordable rent and security of tenure with some of the land set aside to build housing with a leasehold arrangement, as State-subsidised mortgages.  It will create the conditions to eliminate local authority housing waiting lists.  We should also be introducing cost-rental housing for those who do not qualify for local authority housing.<br\/><br\/>Fifty years after it was first recommended, the State should introduce a key recommendation of the Kenny report for land rezoned to residential use to be capped at 25% of its agricultural value.  The Government could introduce a separate 20% &quot;use it or lose it&quot; tax on derelict sites, land hoarding and vacant properties.  These are the measures that could make a difference.  Increasing supply would help to reduce house prices and rents in the private sector.  All that is needed is the radical will to do so.<br\/><br\/>We are seeing a crisis develop regarding housing assistance payments, HAP.  I have been contacted by several people who have reached the cap on the homeless HAP and they are required to top up more and more.  These people came from homelessness and will end up in homelessness if the Government does not review this very quickly and protect these renters.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051800044#RR00500","speaker":"1569","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621366200,"counter":377,"content":"<p>I thank all Deputies for their contributions.  I thank Deputy &Oacute; Broin and Sinn F&eacute;in for tabling the motion.  Deputy &Oacute; Broin continues to bring constructive ideas to the housing debate.  This evening's discussion has been useful.<\/p>  <p>  I will start by addressing some of the points I have listened to since I took over on this side of the debate.  Deputy Verona Murphy and others raised the issue of medium-density housing.  We believe that in large urban areas that is simply not viable or sustainable for reasons of public transport and spatial planning.  The notion of family homes is changing significantly.  We are trying to create sustainable communities as well as just units.<\/p>  <p>  Deputies Shanahan and Mattie McGrath and others spoke about rural housing and one-off rural housing.  The preference in the national development plan, NDP, is for clustered settlements and ensuring that housing is located in the right place where it is close to and connected into water and wastewater infrastructure because we have a significant problem with groundwater and pollution from septic tanks.  It is also about the renovation of housing in smaller urban settlements in line with the Town Centres First policy.<\/p>  <p>  Questions were raised about the role of the Office of the Planning Regulator.  The Government's view is that the office is a vital cog in the wheel of our planning system and ensures we have sustainable planning in this country.  We reject any commentary regarding the role of the Office of the Planning Regulator.  That office provides a vital role in ensuring sustainable development and avoiding unchecked planning.<\/p>  <p>  There have been calls to disband An Taisce.  An Taisce is a prescribed body and an essential partner in our planning process.<\/p>  <p>  In response to the points made by Deputy Joan Collins, we are working to resolve myriad issues relating to housing and affordability.  There is considerable commentary about what has happened in the past, but we are trying to secure a sustainable future for everybody, something on which everybody in this House needs to work collectively.  It is a crisis and a significant challenge for us all.  All Deputies in this House should be working collaboratively to try to achieve that.<\/p>  <p>  I firmly believe that home ownership is good for individuals, good for families, good for communities and good for the State.  With this in mind, we have put delivery, affordability and the chance to own a home at the very heart of our housing policy.  In its proposed amendment to this evening's motion, the Government reflects this and makes clear, as laid out by the programme for Government, that its actions will be guided by the core principle that everybody should have access to good quality housing to purchase or to rent.<\/p>  <p>  This is also an opportunity to raise simple but fundamental questions of the proposed plans laid out by the main Opposition party.  It points out the cross-border hypocrisy, misleading definition of ownership and opposition to real housing projects that characterise Sinn F&eacute;in's actual policy.  The promise of 20,000 homes comes without any indication of where they will be built or who will build them.  Why is shared ownership promoted in the North but vehemently opposed here in the South?  Why does it refer to long-term lease as \"ownership\" under its scheme?  I assume it is a concept similar to that of housing in other EU states, but it is not described as ownership.  These are fundamental questions that remain unanswered.  <\/p>  <p>  In contrast we are focused on delivery and that will be a key test for the Government.  The Affordable Housing Bill 2021, which the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, introduced to the Oireachtas last night, together with the Land Development Agency Bill 2021 will work to give people the opportunity of ownership.  These two landmark Bills are backed up by the largest housing budget in the history of the State and our most ambitious social housing targets on record.  Combined, this represents a major step change in our housing policy that mobilises both the public and private sectors.<\/p>  <p>  Using these Bills as its foundation, the upcoming housing-for-all plan to be published this summer will set out the ambitious range of affordable housing targets across the country over the coming years.  Will the Opposition support these crucial pieces of legislation?  <\/p>  <p>  The proof of the pudding of our housing plans will be in the delivery of units.  Let us consider what we are doing in one specific important area, the roll-out of local authority-led direct-build affordable housing, which will be a central plank of Government's affordable housing plan.  Homes will range from &euro;160,000 to &euro;310,000.  The Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, is working with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to reform the &euro;310 million serviced sites fund to ensure it can effectively fund major delivery.<\/p><p><i>8 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p>  <p>For example, a development this year at Boherboy, County Cork, will be the first serviced sites fund, SSF, scheme delivering homes under the affordable purchase legislation.  It will deliver 116 affordable homes and two- and three-bedroom homes are expected to be made available to first-time buyers at purchase prices ranging from &euro;198,000 to &euro;223,000.<\/p> <p> Fingal County Council is currently constructing an affordable housing development with 39 affordable and 12 social homes in Dun Emer, Lusk, comprising two- and three-bedroom houses and apartments.  The council is accepting applications for these homes which will be offered by the local authority at property prices starting from &euro;166,000, with an average of 25% reduction on open market values.  The House will agree that these are affordable prices.<\/p> <p> We need local authorities to bring forward many more of these types of projects at pace.  That is the message that we have given.  For our own part, we will ensure that the necessary budgetary and statutory supports are in place.  We should also note that drafting and amending provisions to Part V of the Planning and Development Act to increase the current 10% social housing requirement for all new developments to a mandatory 20% social and affordable requirement is a very worthy and useful mechanism which has worked well in the past and should never have been reduced.  Additional to the affordable housing Bill 2020, the Land Development Agency, LDA, is using &euro;1.25 billion from the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, to assemble strategic sites in urban areas to deliver social and affordable homes for rent and purchase.  Cost-rental is being delivered and this was a key ask of the Green Party in the programme for Government.<\/p> <p> In conclusion, I reiterate that our core approach in the middle of a national housing crisis and confronted with such an emergency is that we must use all tools at our disposal to address this challenge across both the private and public sectors, and by not tying one hand behind our back.  I am committed to pragmatism over ideology and to delivering over dogmatism to boost supply and to open up home ownership to a new generation.  We need to stop letting parties be the enemy of everyone&rsquo;s good when facing a crisis.  Silver bullet fantasies, cross-Border hypocrisy, misleading claims of ownership and cynical hysteria politics will wreak havoc on a generation locked up in a rent trap and they deserve better.  I also reiterate that it is important that we work collectively to try to address this crisis.  We in government will be more than happy to work with parties across the House to try to achieve that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051800045#SS00200","speaker":"1512","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621366800,"counter":379,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an gCathaoirleach Gn&iacute;omhach.  It is bad enough that the Government appears to be blind to the solutions but we now know that it is an active contributor to the dysfunction in our housing system.  Since 2016, house prices have risen by 30% and rents have increased by 44%.  The cost of a home in the first quarter of this year was 7.6% higher than in the same period last year.  Behind every one of these increases in rent or house prices are ordinary families and workers struggling to get themselves into a home or to retain their homes.  Repeatedly, Government solutions are more of the same.  It is handouts, freebies and tax breaks but these are for the corporate landlords, the speculators and the vultures.<\/p>  <p>  We heard in here only last week speaker after speaker from the Government side feigning anguish and crying crocodile tears at the very thought that investment funds could be purchasing large swathes of family homes.  It turns out that the Government, the same parties, were actually investing in those very investment funds.  We need an increase in the delivery of social and affordable housing to deliver homes for those who need them and to reduce the pressure that is pushing up rents and house prices.<\/p>  <p>  Every single week Deputy &Oacute; Broin and Sinn F&eacute;in bring forward the proposals that will do exactly that and every single week Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Green Party Deputies vote them down in the hope and blind aspiration that the Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s policies, which are a repeat of the Fine Gael policies before him, will somehow deliver different results.  We are calling for a doubling of the direct investment in public housing to &euro;2.8 billion per year at the very least because that is what is needed.

They have failed young people, renters, first-time buyers and every person who wants security in their home.  The evidence of this is all around us.<\/p>  <p>  The evidence is in my family.  It may not be in that of the Minister of State's but it is definitely in mine.  It is not that long since the Minister of State's Green Party and Fianna F&aacute;il crashed our economy off a cliff.  The solution put forward by Fine Gael and the Labour Party was to invite the vulture funds in and roll out the red carpet for them.  I see the impact of those decisions every day of the week in my constituency in Swords and in Balbriggan, and right across Fingal where I am proud to represent the people who are at the business end of the Government's policies because its policies has failed them.

That is what it was like and it is worse now renting in Dublin.  I was able to buy a house on an ordinary income.  That is gone from people now and they cannot aspire to owning their own home and having security.  In 1965 my father and mother, and people like Bernard and Betty Browne, were part of the Dublin Housing Action Committee.  They demanded adequate housing, fair rents for proper homes, protection from eviction and an end to the scandal of empty homes.  More than 50 years on, their grandchildren and great-grandchildren are fighting for the same thing and this time they are fighting the Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and Green Party Government.

Having just read the press release it is an absolute cop-out.  The Government plan will do nothing to stop investment funds from bulk-buying family homes.  The proposed planning changes will not apply to existing planning permissions and will not apply to future apartment developments.  The tax changes are absolutely minimal and will also not apply to apartments.<\/p>  <p>  What is proposed to happen is that bulk-buying of houses, duplexes and apartments that were intended for owner occupiers, whether first-time buyers or others, will continue to be snapped up by international investment funds.  The people who are not able to buy those homes will then be forced to continue to rent houses, duplexes and apartments at exorbitant rates.  How anybody could think that that is an adequate response to the very legitimate outpouring of anger by people enraged by the failure of successive government housing policies is really beyond me.  People are going to very quickly see tonight&rsquo;s announcement for the cop-out that it is.<\/p>  <p>  I will reply to some of the Government&rsquo;s responses to our Private Members&rsquo; motion.  At the centre of this is a very simple proposition.  If people want large volumes of affordable homes to rent and to buy, if the Green Party genuinely wants to see the policy that it campaigned for in its election manifesto, that is, large volumes of good quality, energy-efficient apartments in our city centre being delivered for prices people can afford to rent or buy, then there is only one way of doing that.<\/p> <p>That is very significant increases in direct capital investment by the Government to ensure local authorities, approved housing bodies and community housing trusts can deliver those homes.<\/p> <p> Ministers can come into the House and say as many times as they want that they believe in home ownership, affordability and fair rents, but the figures tell a very different story.  Not a single affordable home to rent or buy has been delivered by Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael in the past five years.  This year, we are only going to see 530 affordable homes, 90 of which will be to buy with the remainder to rent, although some of the prices are way beyond the reach of ordinary working people.  According to officials from the Department who appeared before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage only a matter of weeks ago, next year we will only see 700 new homes through the serviced sites fund and may breach the figure of 1,000 new homes in 2023.  That is not an affordable housing programme; it is an insult to the working people who desperately need affordable housing.<\/p> <p> A similar situation pertains with the Land Development Agency.  It was to be the great white hope of increasing housing supply.  It recently told the Oireachtas housing committee that none of its units will be ready until 2023 and even then there will only be a few hundred.  It will be 2025 before the LDA breaches the figure of 1,000 homes and by that stage, the affordable housing crisis will be even worse.<\/p> <p> What do we need to do?  We need to listen to the ESRI.  Only two weeks ago, it recommended the doubling of direct capital investment in the delivery of social and affordable homes.  That would mean spending this year and next year of &euro;2.8 billion, rather than &euro;1.4 billion.  Even the International Monetary Fund has stated it is possible and necessary for the Government to commit that kind of capital investment.  If it does not do so but, rather, continues to throw tiny sums, such as &euro;35 million this year for cost rental and just &euro;50 million for affordable purchase, at this problem, the gap between the rhetoric of the Government and the reality of people's housing needs on the ground will grow ever wider and anger will increase.

The State needs to double capital investment in public housing, deliver 20,000 social and affordable homes a year for the next five years, make sure those homes are genuinely affordable, with rents below &euro;900 and house prices below &euro;230,000, and stop gifting and selling public land to private developers to build and sell unaffordable houses.

It is the central cybersecurity incident response unit for the State, with a broad remit across the cybersecurity of government ICT and critical national infrastructure.  The NCSC acts as a central contact point in the event of a government or nationwide cybersecurity incident affecting the State.  It also provides expert advice and analysis on cybersecurity issues and is involved in co-ordinating and supporting the response to significant incidents, with a lead role being taken by the entity affected by the incident.<\/p>  <p>  Information sharing is a key component of the work of the NCSC, whereby it acts as a source of expert advice and guidance, but also as a clearing house for information.  That is to say, it takes in threat intelligence data, trends and risks data from national, global and local sources, analyses them and makes sure those people who need those data get them, either to protect their systems or to assist them in carrying out their statutory roles.<\/p>  <p>  The NCSC team comprises highly skilled specialist technical civilian staff, with skill sets in areas such as computer science, software engineering, malware analysis, information technology forensics, cryptography, software development and cybersecurity compliance, as well as general cybersecurity skills.  The computer security incident response team, CSIRT, is the team within the NCSC that leads in response to cybersecurity incidents.  The CSIRT of the NCSC is designated as the national CSIRT by Government decision and under the EU network and information security directive.  The CSIRT has international accreditation and is the team that is notified by constituent organisations of an incident or a suspected incident.  It is this team that engages with the affected body to support it in addressing the threat.<\/p>  <p>  Early on the morning of Friday, 14 May, the NCSC became aware of a significant incident affecting the HSE network.  Initial reports indicated a human-operated Conti ransomware incident that had severely disabled a number of systems and necessitated the shutdown of the majority of other HSE systems.  The NCSC activated its crisis response procedures and made contact with a major international cyber incident response company which was engaged by the HSE early on Friday morning and began immediately to determine the nature and extent of the incident.<\/p>  <p>  Throughout the past four days, the Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth, and I have been in daily contact with my officials in the NCSC.  I was also in regular contact throughout the weekend with the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste, the Minister for Health, Deputy Donnelly, and the Minister for Justice, Deputy Humphreys, as well as Mr. Paul Reid, chief executive officer of the HSE.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, yesterday afternoon An Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste, the Ministers for Justice and Health, the Minister of State, Deputy Smyth, and I met to be briefed by the NCSC and the HSE and to discuss the ongoing impact of the cyber incident on the HSE.  The NCSC provided a detailed briefing on the incident, technical responses that have been deployed and the ongoing work to recover the IT systems of the HSE, prevent further damage and, very importantly, support the restoration of healthcare services.<\/p>  <p>  A determined and methodical approach has been adopted to resolving the impact of this incident.  I understand that all necessary resources and personnel are engaged in support of the HSE.  In the coming days, the NCSC will continue to work in close co-operation with the HSE, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Government chief information officer and a specialist cybersecurity contractor.  The Minister for Health has already provided information on the measures being implemented to ensure continuity of services during this period.<\/p>  <p>  The NCSC is also supporting the Department of Health in implementing its response plan to a cyberattack late last week, including the suspension of some functions of the IT system of the Department as a precautionary measure.  As regards the incident in the Department of Health, the NCSC was notified by the information security team in the Department on the afternoon of Thursday, 13 May, of suspected malicious activity on its network.  The NCSC engaged immediately with the Department and, recognising there were indicators of an attempted cyberattack, advised the Department to implement its crisis response plan and to engage a specialist incident response team, which it did on Thursday evening.  Throughout Thursday night, the NCSC and the third-party contractors worked closely with the Department to investigate the incident and begin the recovery process.<\/p>  <p>  The NCSC has provided specific advice and guidance to its constituents throughout the weekend based on its analysis of the incident in the health sector.<\/p> <p>The NCSC has more than 160 constituents, which includes Departments and operators of essential services.  An initial advisory notice was circulated on Friday and an updated advisory was issued by the NCSC on Sunday.  In addition, on Sunday, staff at the NCSE were in direct contact with operators of critical national infrastructure, including other bodies within the health sector, to ensure they had received the advisory notices and were implementing appropriate measures to protect their systems.<\/p> <p> Yesterday, the NCSC hosted online briefing sessions to answer questions from all its constituents.  The feedback from these sessions has been very positive.  The NCSC will continue to provide advice and guidance throughout the coming days and its advice will be updated when the malware deployed in the cyber incidents on the HSE and the Department of Health has been further analysed.  In addition to the specific guidance issued to its constituents, the NCSC has published on its website general information about these cyber incidents with some limited detail on the malware.  <\/p> <p> As Deputies will appreciate this is very much a live incident, so it is necessary to limit the circulation of sensitive operational information at this time.  I encourage IT managers in all businesses and voluntary organisations to review this guidance and consider what steps might need to be implemented to further enhance the security of their systems.<\/p> <p> In conclusion, I assure the House that my Department, through the National Cyber Security Centre, will continue to exert its considerable technical capacity in support of the HSE at this time.  It will continue to share any learning from this incident with the constituent organisations across the public and private sector to assist those organisations in ensuring the resilience of their cybersecurity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051800047#UU00500","speaker":"1465","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621368000,"counter":388,"content":"<p>I thank the Acting Chairman for the opportunity to update the House on the impact of the cyberattack on our health services.  Last week, the State was subject to a sophisticated ransomware attack.  Information communication technology, ICT, infrastructure at the Department of Health and the HSE, including national and local IT systems, were the subject of a serious and malicious cybersecurity incident in the early hours of last Friday.  The systems in my Department and the HSE were shut down immediately with the objective of containing the attack.  Since that time, both organisations have been working to analyse the extent of the attacks, which includes working closely with the National Cyber Security Centre and State agencies, including An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Defence Forces, in order to resolve the situation in a planned and structured manner.<\/p><p>This is having a profound effect on patients across the country.  Like many in the House, I have listened to some of the testimony from those directly affected.  Jill Byrne, mother of Cian, who has Down's syndrome, outlined on RT&Eacute; earlier today the many appointments scheduled for Cian this week, all of which have now been cancelled.  Like Cian, for many patients and families these appointments have been long awaited.  Others have had treatment for serious illnesses postponed.  Donna-Marie Cullen described how she was due to complete her radiation treatment for cancer at the end of May and now faces delays to that course of treatment.  We can only imagine the anxiety this is causing her, others in the same position and their families at this time.<\/p><p>The HSE and the Department are prioritising the restoration of services with teams working around the clock to resolve the situation through a planned, structured response, under the direction of a HSE national co-ordination centre.  This involves the assessment and recovery of approximately 2,000 IT patient-facing systems, each supported by infrastructure, multiple servers and devices.  In addition, there are approximately 80,000 HSE devices which need to be checked.  This is being carried out in a methodical process of cleaning, restoring and bringing back online while managing the risk of reinfection.<\/p><p>The HSE is prioritising those patients most in need of urgent care.  In particular, every effort is being made to maintain cancer services, with a particular focus on urgent and time-sensitive cases.  Unfortunately, radiotherapy services are particularly impacted.  Medical oncology is continuing, with some delay due to manual recording in administrative processes.  Plans are being developed to relocate some of these services to private hospitals on a temporary basis.<\/p><p>Patients and clinical teams at acute hospitals are experiencing increased turnaround time for laboratory tests and difficulty in accessing patient information history, which is a matter of concern.  A significant number of outpatient appointments have been cancelled.  Most community health services such as disability, mental health, primary care and older people services are operating as normal.  However, I am advised that some delays and cancellations can be expected.  This is especially the case in dental, orthodontics, ophthalmology and audiology services.  Any appointments that cannot go ahead will be rescheduled as soon as possible.<\/p><p>Emergency departments are open and operating.  However, patient flow is impacted in all areas due to reduced laboratory and radiology capacity and, of course, reduced access to patient records.  If a patient is acutely unwell or seriously injured, they should attend an emergency department.  We also have injury units and GP out-of-hours for people to access.<\/p><p>The HSE continues to provide updates on the provision of its services, including hospital appointments, emergencies, community health services, radiation therapy, screening services, sexual assault treatment units, counselling services and, of course, Covid-19 vaccine and testing updates at <i>hse.ie<\/i>.  This is where patients can access the most up-to-date information as it is changing all the time.<\/p><p>Access to ICT continues to be severely restricted.  This means officials of both the HSE and the Department of Health do not have access to email and the other information systems required to carry out day-to-day work.  As a consequence, it is not currently possible for my Department to meet all its Oireachtas obligations.  I thank all colleagues for their understanding in respect of the challenges we face in meeting our Oireachtas obligations, including parliamentary questions.<\/p><p>The criminals behind this assault are utterly contemptible, but Ireland is not alone in facing cyberattacks.  These criminals deliberately target critical infrastructure.  Unfortunately, healthcare is a real target of cybercrime at the moment, due to the high value of health data and the criticality of health services.  As the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity has pointed out, malicious criminals have introduced more advanced phishing campaigns and ransomware attacks since the onset of the pandemic.  We will overcome the effects of this assault on our public health system and I reassure colleagues we are doing all we can to ensure we resume services as quickly and safely as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051800048#VV00200","speaker":"1623"},{"type":"speech","time":1621368000,"counter":389,"content":"<p>As the Ministers know, I prefer to use my time to ask questions.

The latest National Treatment Purchase Fund figures for wait times showed that just under 900,000 people in this State are on some form of health waiting list.  We can see that in the radiology treatment, radiotherapy treatment, laboratory testing, dental, orthodontics, ophthalmology, audiology and other services which are deeply affected.

It was a private meeting.  We have a number of questions we would like to be clearly answered.  First, are the Ministers satisfied that in view of what has happened with the cyberattack on the HSE and the Department of Health that the terms of reference of the capacity review that is currently under way are adequate?  I can say without fear of contradiction that it is the biggest virus attack in Ireland probably in living memory, outside of the Covid-19 virus attack.  Do the terms of reference cover what is happening at this moment in time?  Can the capacity review be expedited in view of what is happening?<\/p>  <p>  There are currently 29 staff in the NCSC at the moment.  Is that sufficient?  The budget is &euro;5 million.

I am confident that the capacity review mentioned by the Minister of State will give us a very clear indication of the next steps.  My understanding of the draft outline is that it is not looking at radical change.  It seeks to further extend our resources but not in a way that fundamentally changes the approach that we are taking.<\/p>  <p>  It is critical to understand that the NCSC has a key role in what has happened, but it is not the only line of defence.  In fact, it is not the key line of defence.  The key line of defence is every single Department and public agency, every single laptop and every single interaction we take.  The Minister for Health mentioned the fact that his Department is spending something like &euro;203 million a year on its IT systems.  I could take three other large Departments and add a similar amount to that.  For just four Departments we are looking at an investment of more than &euro;400 million in our IT systems, a large part of it relating to IT security.  The NCSC has a critical role but it is only an advisory role.  Critical analysis and capability is required right across the various agencies of State, in particular within the health system.  By their very nature, due to the large expanse of the network of health systems and the large number of people engaged, the urgency of sharing information between doctors, hospitals and so on makes it particularly vulnerable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051800050#XX00700","speaker":"1465"},{"type":"speech","time":1621369200,"counter":415,"content":"<p>The NCSC is not strictly advisory.

What is the working relationship with the various agencies in Ireland, such as the Garda, the Defence Forces, the HSE and other agencies, and also at European and international levels?

Can we get clarity on the robustness of the systems in place across every level of Government, and every Department.

What is the cybersecurity awareness of all staff across Government?  Do they know how to maintain resilience and how they can be alert to the threats?  Let us be under no illusion; this is not just an act of cybercrime but an act of cyber terrorism.  It goes to the very heart of protecting the most vulnerable in our society and should be treated like that.  It is not a unique attack.  Only today the Waikato health board in New Zealand was the victim of a very similar attack.  It is a growing threat.  Many Deputies have warned of their concerns.

There is a parallel with public health advice that it is not the Department of Health that prevents one from being infected but the information it provides to the public and the hygiene habits that, in this case, translate to security habits.  It is the information and education about not clicking on links, using strong passwords and all the messages that have to be repeated again and again and making sure that people do that, it is audited and so on.  Every staff member has to adopt those habits.  That said, we must have in-depth defence.  There cannot be a situation where an organisation can completely implode because somebody clicks on a link.  The strength in defence and depth and having a secure organisation goes beyond securing the end points and preventing people from getting into one's organisation; once they have penetrated it, one wants to ensure they may only move very slowly throughout it.  That requires advice about how one sets up one's networks.  Again, that comes back to education.  The role of the National Cyber Security Centre is to perform risk analysis of these organisations and to advise on a set of measures to strengthen them and to provide incident response teams when those things happen.<\/p>  <p>  How do we get resilience?  We have to keep improving all the time.  It is an arms race.  One is continually being attacked.  It goes back to the parallel with the real life virus which mutates into variants.  Computer viruses are upgraded all the time and are mutating and come back stronger and we need to come back stronger all the time.  That is why last year we needed to triple our budget for cybersecurity staff.  It will go up again next year.  The number of IT staff in the HSE doubled in two years.  Hundreds of millions of euro are being spent but it will be more in the future because it is an arms race against well-funded cyber criminals.<\/p>  <p>  We are getting support and co-operation from other countries through a number of organisations, Europol, ENISA and we have had direct contact from member states which have also suffered attacks by this particular crime gang.  They have kindly shared the information about the signs, when one can see it coming and the remedies that can be applied.  We will offer that same information to New Zealand today.

It is a global phenomenon and problem.  The nature of the Internet is that it that connected network.  A key thing coming out of this incident is strengthening our defence systems but also using it as an opportunity to further enhance our use of the technology while making it secure.  We should be careful not to create a paradigm in the likes of the health system which has had huge benefits and advantages from the use of ICT equipment and new ways of doing things.  Perhaps one reason we were particularly vulnerable at this time was because with remote working, there is a very wide network of devices, often remote from central facilities, which is by its nature less secure.  It is why these networks tend to be attacked.  In response, we should not recoil from the use of ICT infrastructure but double down on making it safer by design, building in resilience.  There are attacks all the time.  It depends on what one calls an attack.  It could be something as seemingly insignificant as a phishing incident or an effort to get someone to link in to allow someone into the network.  That in itself is not the key issue; it is, as the Minister of State said, the further line of defence once they get in the network.

There is no shortage of resources but, unfortunately, it is a painstaking task.  The task is to find the malware in each part of the network and obliterate it.  It is a matter of using agents on the network to find it quickly and of checking to make sure the network is secure as we bring it back up again.  That, unfortunately, takes time.  The key project in the Department of Health is getting the networks back up and running for the patients.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051800053#AAA00200","speaker":"1465"},{"type":"speech","time":1621371000,"counter":448,"content":"<p>I wish to add my thoughts on our dealings with Mr. Ciar&aacute;n &Oacute; h&Oacute;b&aacute;in at the committee meeting earlier.  We certainly did not get the answers we were looking for.  We obviously accept a criminal entity has made a dreadful attack on this State but a question is being asked about capacity in the NCSC.  I want to deal with this, in particular.  We welcome the review.  We need it as soon as possible.  We are talking about the NCSC ensuring compliance.  It is about a bit more than just relying on the capacity within the HSE, the area of critical infrastructure or the aviation sector.  We absolutely need to ensure capacity.  Could we deal with capacity as regards personnel and specific skill sets and the fact that we still do not have a director.  I have heard it said that there is a problem in that the positions were not advertised and that some of the positions had staff seconded to them.  I heard we do not necessarily have the capacity to ensure compliance.  The Minister is talking about the risk assessment of the hundred organisations the NCSC deals with.  What risk assessments have been done?  What is the capacity within the Garda, Defence Forces and all the relevant organisations?  Could the Minister of State revert to me on that?  As soon as possible, we need action on capacity within the NCSC.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051800053#AAA00300","speaker":"1498"},{"type":"speech","time":1621371000,"counter":449,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  I appreciate there is a complex arrangement of various groups.  Regarding capacity, the capacity review of the NCSC was commissioned by the Minister, Deputy Ryan, in January.  The reviewers analysed the strengths and weaknesses of the NCSC, the physical, hardware and personnel resources it needed, how it was doing and how it compared with similar organisations.  I will be very reluctant to publish the review when it is issued as it is a guide to the vulnerabilities of the NCSC.  I will certainly be acting on the recommendations but it will be difficult for me to publicly tell everybody what the weaknesses of the organisation are and the recommendations for it.  It has been upgraded continuously.  It has to be upgraded all the time because the threat is continuously upgraded.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the NCSC's relationship with the Garda, there is the Garda National Cyber Crime Bureau, which I believe has had its number of staff doubled to 140.  I can get more up-to-date numbers on that.  The bureau reports to Deputy Humphreys as Minister for Justice.  The Garda has intelligence from the Directorate of Military Intelligence.  It is an intelligence bureau and has a different role from that of investigating crime and making recommendations on how to protect oneself.

I will start with a brief statement and progress to questions and answers immediately afterwards.<\/p><p>I utterly condemn this outrageous attack.  It is an attack not only on the Irish health service but also on Irish sovereignty by criminal elements outside this jurisdiction.  It is a heinous attack, a heinous crime.  The blame for the incident lies principally with the criminal actors, for sure.  I agree with the views of retired colonel Dorcha Lee in <i>The Irish Times <\/i>this morning.  He states this cyberattack is of such a scale and of such magnitude and consequence that it should be categorised as cyberterrorism rather than cybercrime.  I certainly agree with that thesis.<\/p><p>While utterly condemning the actions of some people, I utterly commend the actions of others, particularly our cyber professionals who have been working around the clock to fix this problem.  They are highly motivated, qualified and patriotic people who are working even as we speak.  I recognise the clinical staff in the HSE who, once again, are scrambling to try to deal with an incident and a geopolitical shock that was not of their making.  I pass on my gratitude to the patients for their understanding and tolerance of the fact that their appointments have been postponed or that their treatments have been cancelled.<\/p><p>I welcome the publication of National Cyber Security Strategy about a year and half ago.  It is a very good document.  It is certainly a good start but, in light of events in the past few days, perhaps we need to review it and insert more ambition into it because we have just been shown and have proven how important cybersecurity is.<\/p><p>I welcome the appointment of Deputy Ossian Smyth, as Minister of State with responsibility for cybersecurity.  I have had the very good fortune of sitting next to him in the past year in the convention centre and we have had numerous discussions on cybersecurity in that period.  I have no doubt as to his ability and qualifications in this area.  It is very unusual for a Deputy to be appointed to a role for which he is eminently qualified and to which he is eminently suited.  I wish him well in his role.<\/p><p>I thank the Minister, Deputy Ryan, for his engagement on cybersecurity, both in public and in private, over the past 12 months.  His engagements and answers have always been very thorough, transparent and forthright.<\/p><p>My first question for the Minister and Minister of State responsible for communications is on the capacity review.  I appreciate the responses of the Ministers and Minister of State so far this evening.  It is hoped that the capacity review will be finished in the next few weeks, as the Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth, said.<\/p> <p>Will it be published?  Is an implementation body in place to make sure it is actually implemented?  We have a great tradition in Ireland, as, indeed, there is across the world, of writing wonderful reports but not really implementing them.  Will the Minister comment on that?<\/p> <p> The National Security Analysis Centre, NSAC, is an entity which was recommended to be established by the Commission on the Future of Policing.  Is the National Security Analysis Centre involved in this response?  Is it adequately resourced?  I know it is embedded in the Department of the Taoiseach so perhaps the Ministers do not have an answer to that now and could reply in written form if necessary.<\/p> <p> At times like this, I am glad that our Defence Forces have sent people to the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence in Estonia.  There is one member of the Defence Forces there at the moment.  I am heartened by the fact the Defence Forces have sent people as observers to the Permanent Structured Cooperation cyber defence projects.  It ensures that we have both the tools and the talent in this country to respond to cyber defence from a military perspective, if required.  I am aware the Commission on the Defence Forces will report in December.  I understand that it is considering establishing a dedicated Defence Forces cyber defence unit with both defence and offence capabilities.  What are the Minister's thoughts on the utility of that?  I know the Minister, Deputy Ryan, mentioned that the National Cyber Security Centre is more of a co-ordinating centre than a first response centre.

The Department of the Taoiseach is centrally involved.  It is an all-of-government co-ordinated response and approach.  The Defence Forces have been mentioned.  As the Deputy said, they have critical capabilities with regard to the protection of the Defence Forces' own networks.  The crossover is evident in that much of the expertise that we have in such bodies as the National Cyber Security Centre are people who have come from the Defence Forces or been trained in that background.

To put that in context, if one takes just orthopaedics, people are in agony, not according to me but according to a consultant who has written to us repeatedly.  Some 1,143 people are waiting on the inpatient list for orthopaedics and 6,602 are on the outpatient list, and so on.  We got a reply to say it would take 18 months.  In the last two weeks before this, we were told to ignore that 18 months but that it would be cleared some time in the future and they could not possibly tell us.  That is just orthopaedics.

That is why we are here tonight.  It is important that we have that capability and also that we try to achieve common purpose as we address what is still a critical situation.  For those patients in Galway, and for that reason, we have to be careful here in what we say.<\/p> <p>Various Members, including Deputy O'Donnell, have said they were not able to get as much information as they wanted from the earlier committee meeting.  This is because we have to be careful as this is an ongoing incident in which significant twists and turns may arise as it evolves.  We are only in the early phases of this.  The first phase involves identifying and containing the problem.  We will then seek to remedy it.  Providing that remedy will take a significant amount of time.  There may be real consequences, particularly for those in the health service.<\/p> <p> The various people involved in this were mentioned.  Those working on the IT system within the healthcare sector are particularly worthy of mention.  The truth is that, during the Covid pandemic of the last year, they have been under incredible strain.  They have had to react to a whole series of different and changing circumstances.  They have been required to create what are effectively entirely new systems.  They created an entire new system for contact tracing and for rolling out the vaccine, a system which luckily has not been affected in this instance because of the way in which this separate network was created.  They are the people most affected immediately with regard to the ongoing strain they have faced in their work over the last year.  I commend them and wish them well.  The rest of us are, in effect, there to provide support.  It is they who are the front-line key workers at this moment in time.<\/p> <p> We are in very difficult circumstances.  As Deputy Stephen Donnelly has said, this is going to take a number of weeks to resolve.  In those circumstances and with that sort of timeline, which is unfortunately inevitable because of the scale of the damage that has been done, our key concern is for the patients whose care may be affected.  I have absolute confidence that the Irish health system, which has shown great resilience in adapting during the Covid pandemic, will show similar resilience in providing care in whatever way is possible with the limited systems we have in place.  <\/p> <p> I listened with great attention to what various Deputies said with regard to the need for the capacity review to be published.  We will do that, subject to advice.  In a world in which there are criminal elements who would look to exploit information which might identify some of our capabilities or lack thereof, we have to be careful, but we will publish that review insofar as is possible.  I hope that will give people real confidence and back up what I see as the reality.  We have been in a maelstrom for the last four or five days but, from working with officials, I can say that I have been highly impressed with the service they provide to the public, their sense of dedication, their real capability and their calmness under very difficult circumstances.<\/p> <p> I appreciate this chance.  We had the opportunity today to share, as best we could, some of the information we have.  As Deputy Smyth said in response to an earlier request for further briefings to be provided to Oireachtas Members from the various different groups, we will absolutely look to make that happen in a way that ensures confidence and security while providing information to Members of the Oireachtas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051800054#BBB01800","speaker":"1465","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621372200,"counter":470,"content":"<p>I will start by thanking colleagues across the House for their time this evening and for their input, questions and proposals.  It is very galling that our public healthcare system and our patients, some of the most vulnerable people in the country, are the victims of this vicious criminal attack.  It is a despicable attack which shows scant regard for human health or human life.  I acknowledge the very real anxiety that patients right across the country are feeling tonight, felt earlier today and yesterday and will feel in the days to come.  Patients are desperately waiting for treatment.  In some cases, it is urgent care.  In others, the treatment may be less urgent but the patients may have been waiting a very long time, often too long.  I include adult patients and the parents of children who need treatment in that remark.  There is great worry and anxiety, which is very understandable.<\/p>  <p>  We have to do everything we can.  I say to those patients, and to the parents and families of patients, that everything that can be done is being done.  There are hundreds of people working across the State right now to get these services and systems back online as quickly and as safely as possible.  In so doing, we are prioritising the most urgent services including radiology, radiation oncology, the patient administration systems and work with the voluntary hospitals, some of which are less compromised than HSE services because of their standalone systems.  While it is going to take weeks to get all of the services back up and running according to the latest information we have, we envisage some of the more urgent services coming back online, part by part, in the coming days.<\/p>  <p>  I acknowledge our healthcare staff.  They have been the very best of us over the last year.  They have stepped up day after day, first in dealing with one virus, Covid-19, and then in dealing with its variants.  It has been a brutal year in healthcare.  Our healthcare staff right across the board, both clinical and non-clinical, are exhausted.  They have shown themselves to be the very best of us.  At a time when we were beginning to get a bit of breathing space and when the country collectively was suppressing Covid, as it still is, and when the vaccine programme was going from strength to strength, as it also still is, we were beginning to again have conversations in healthcare about waiting lists, building more hospitals, supporting GPs, hiring more clinicians and doing all of the wonderful things that need to be done in healthcare.  Then the same people were hit by this.  They are now working in our hospitals and community teams right across the country.  They are under incredible pressure.  They are doing their very best for their patients but things are slow.  The patients are, very understandably, frustrated.  I ask people who have to go to emergency departments, where things are slower than anyone would like, to be understanding of our healthcare professionals, as I know people will be.  They are doing their very best.  They are trying to get people triaged, assessed, treated and scanned as quickly as possible but everything is taking longer because of this vicious attack.  I pay tribute yet again to our healthcare professionals who have stepped up, this time to deal with a different type of virus.  <\/p>  <p>  The Government takes IT security and cybersecurity deadly seriously.  For example, the HSE budget has increased.  In 2019, it was &euro;130 million.  Last year, it increased significantly, to &euro;145 million.  This year, it is &euro;203 million.  Critically, in this year's national service plan, the funding for IT staff has been almost doubled.  As of last year, there were approximately 400 staff.  That is being increased by in excess of 350 additional staff.  There are massive increases in funding and in staff.  We all know why.<\/p>  <p>  While this is taking time, steady progress is being made.  Many highly professional, highly patriotic people are working within the HSE and the National Cyber Security Centre.  The Defence Forces have been involved, as is the Department of Justice.  A whole-of-government approach is being taken.  Steady progress is being made.  I thank the people involved.  They are working every hour, night and day, to make sure that our services are restored and, most importantly, that patients get the urgent care they need.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051800055#CCC00200","speaker":"1623"},{"type":"speech","time":1621372800,"counter":471,"content":"<p>It would be appropriate for me to say that the House in its entirety wishes the Government, including the two Ministers and Minister of State present, our health administrators and our health professionals absolute success in undoing the despicable crimes that have been committed against the Irish people, who require the support of our health services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051800056#DDD00100","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Ceisteanna - Questions - Ceisteanna ar Sonra&iacute;odh Uain D&oacute;ibh - Priority Questions","time":1621372800,"counter":473,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051800056#DDD00300"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Employment Support Services","time":1621372800,"counter":474,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051800056#DDD00400"},{"type":"question","time":1621372800,"counter":475,"qnumday":67,"qnumall":"[26485\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051800056#DDD00500","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if she will provide an update on the tender for local employment services; the length of time the tendering process will be open for applications; if the terms of reference will include changes to the current model of employment services from a cost-met model to a cost bid model; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1604","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","time":1621372800,"counter":476,"content":"<p>Will the Minister provide an update on the forthcoming tender process for local employment services and job clubs?

Social transfers contribute very significantly to reducing poverty rates in Ireland.<\/p> <p>According to the Central Statistics Office, in the absence of social transfers and pension income, the at-risk-of-poverty rate would be 41.4%.  After social transfers, the rate is 12.8%.  This is a poverty reduction effect of 68.5% for all social transfers and pensions, one of the highest in Europe.<\/p> <p> The most recent data from the CSO's income and living conditions survey show poverty rates are falling and Ireland is one of the very few countries where the overall level of income is increasing and where income inequality is also falling.<\/p> <p> Notwithstanding this progress, we should all acknowledge more can always be done, but what we do must be informed by the evidence.  Towards this end, the Department funds a large body of research, including the work of the Vincentian Partnership, to develop and calculate the minimum essential standard of living.  My officials work closely with Sr. Bernadette and her team and I find this work very useful in informing policy.  The outputs from this research complement data produced from other analyses such as the survey on income and living conditions produced by the Central Statistics Office.<\/p> <p> The Vincentian Partnership research provides an estimate of the income requirements of different family types in both urban and rural locations.  It provides a comparison of welfare payments against these calculated requirements to identify what the Vincentian Partnership terms adequacy gaps.  In 2020, the study concluded that pensioner couple households have no adequacy gaps but other households demonstrate gaps of various magnitudes.<\/p> <p> The work of the Vincentian Partnership also highlights issues that may also be addressed with improvements in services.  In this regard, improved services, such as the extension of GP-visit cards for children and the affordable childcare scheme, can result in significant reductions in the minimum income standards needed by households.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051800058#FFF01500","speaker":"1450","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621374600,"counter":513,"content":"<p>While the minimum essential standard of living is met by the State pension in certain circumstances, that is just one tiny cohort of people when we consider the range of social welfare supports provided.

The pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, was introduced on 13 March 2020 in response to the Covid-19 crisis.

The number of payments peaked at in excess of 600,000 in early May 2020.  Following the gradual reopening of the economy over last summer, number dropped to a low of over 200,000 by early October 2020.<\/p><p>Level 3 restrictions were imposed in Dublin, Donegal, Monaghan and Cavan from late September 2020 which saw recipient numbers gradually increase.  This was followed by a move to level 5 restrictions from late October and recipient numbers increased again to a peak of more than 350,000 by late November.  Easing of restrictions in early December saw the number of recipients fall to just over 280,000 by 25 December.<\/p><p>Level 5 restrictions, including restrictions on construction, were again reimposed from late December 2020 with recipients peaking at almost 481,000 in the week ending 5 February 2021.

As the Deputies are aware, the pandemic unemployment payment is an income support provided for employees and the self-employed who were in employment on or after 13 March 2020 and who lost employment as a direct consequence of the public health restrictions to address the adverse health outcomes from the Covid-19 pandemic.  The scheme is scheduled to remain open until 30 June 2021.  Since the payment began, more than 865,000 workers have received a payment under the PUP.  To date, more than &euro;7.5 billion has been spent on the PUP since it was first introduced.  Total expenditure for the scheme between 13 April 2021 and 11 May 2021 was &euro;520 million.<\/p><p>Many Deputies have requested in their questions information on the number of PUP recipients and expenditure amounts at county level.  These statistics form part of the reply, and are provided in a table for the record of the House.<\/p><p>The total number of PUP recipients on 11 May was 377,000.  This is the tenth consecutive week in which the PUP numbers have fallen and since 9 February, there are 105,000 fewer workers in receipt of this scheme.  I remind the House that last year, when the public health restrictions were eased, the total number receiving income support from PUP reduced from more than 600,000 to over 200,000 over a period of 20 weeks.  As restrictions continue to ease in the coming months, further large reductions in the number of PUP recipients are anticipated.  The very latest PUP figures are being published today and show that the total number of PUP recipients has fallen further in the past week by 13,498 to 363,167.  As I noted, I envisage that the wider re-opening of the economy this week will be reflected in further reductions in the numbers claiming the payment in the coming weeks.<\/p><p> <table>    <tr>

The Deputy has two questions.  The first question is on the number of people who have indicated their intention to withdraw from Covid-19 support payments.<\/p><p>The pandemic unemployment payment has proven to be a vital income support to workers, thousands of whom lost their jobs virtually overnight.  Since its introduction, over 23 million PUP payments have been made to in excess of 850,000 people, providing income support of more than &euro;7.5 billion to date.  The number of people in receipt of the PUP fluctuates in response to changes in the level of public health restrictions.  Numbers peaked at over 600,000 on 5 May 2020 and stood at just over 200,000 in October 2020.  Following the introduction of level 5 restrictions at Christmas 2020, the numbers increased again and stood at just over 481,000 on 9 February.  Since then, and in line with the resumption of economic activity, numbers have steadily declined, with just under 377,000 people paid on 11 May.  That is a reduction of over 104,000 claims.  That reduction increased to 120,000 this week.<\/p><p>Since the introduction of the PUP, over 643,000 claims have been closed, in the vast majority of cases because people went back to work.  Since the start of April, almost 85,000 people have closed their claims to return to work.  This is a very positive development and reflects the start of the recovery phase from this pandemic.  As the country begins to move out of level 5 restrictions, I remind workers who are returning to work that they must close their claim for the pandemic unemployment payment on the actual date that they start back at work, in order to ensure that their claim is processed correctly and to avoid incurring an overpayment that my Department will subsequently take steps to recover.  The easiest way to close a claim for the pandemic unemployment payment is online via <i>mywelfare.ie<\/i>.

There has been a lot of juggling in recent weeks trying to get people into schools.<\/p><p>I want to give three examples of the problems.

It is ridiculous that they cannot get a school place and have to send the child to a different county.<\/p><p>Another letter states that the son had been offered a first year place, after a long stressful wait, in the next village from Midleton, which is Carrigtwohill.Unfortunately, as they had not chosen the nearest school, they will not be able to access the Bus &Eacute;ireann bus as the school does not qualify.<\/p><p>A lady writes of a situation where most of the siblings in the family had gone to school in Midleton from Killeagh, which is the other side of Castlemartyr, between Youghal and Midleton.  Now, the last child has been told they will have to go to school in Youghal.<\/p><p>There is a lot of stress and confusion because people cannot go to the school nearest to them.

The Minister is aware of the pressures in east Cork with respect to secondary school places.  To give an example, one woman was told earlier this year that her daughter was placed in one school at No. 274 on the waiting list, at No. 256 in another school and at No. 124 in another school, and she had applied to all three.  Obviously, the stress and strain of that is enormous and that is only one family out of hundreds.<\/p>  <p>  I acknowledge the work that has been done in the last while by the Minister and her officials, school principals and the education and training board with respect to making extra school places available.  However, as the Minister will understand, parents accepted the first place they were offered when they saw the length of the waiting lists.  They were not aware that being placed on a waiting list is considered a refusal to admit and can be appealed, so most of them had not appealed.  Before they use a section 29 appeal, they should get a review from the board of management, but parents do not know that, or that it must be made within 21 days and that the appeal has to be done within 63 days.  One would almost have to be a barrister to follow how the appeal system works, and this is before they can go and look for school transport.  It is extremely complicated.<\/p>  <p>  As I have suggested previously, in the first instance, the Minister might consider having Carrigtwohill and Midleton as one education centre for school transport.  At a stroke, that would solve a whole range of problems for parents who are faced with having to drive children to school because they did not get into the nearest school because they did not appeal, or because they did not do a section 29 appeal, and so on and so forth.  Parents have been stressed all year, and this involves hundreds of parents and families because of the waiting lists. <\/p>  <p>  I am glad the Minister is present.  I am still not sure that all the students that applied have places and, from what I can figure out, there could be 50, 60 or 70 students without places for September.

Before I address the specific issues raised, I would like to provide Members with an outline of the extent of the school transport service and what it entails.<\/p>  <p>  School transport is a significant operation managed by Bus &Eacute;ireann on behalf of the Department.  In the current school year, over 114,000 children, including over 14,700 children with special educational needs, are transported on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country at a cost of over &euro;224.7 million in 2020.<\/p>  <p>  The purpose of the Department's school transport scheme is, having regard to available resources, to support the transport to and from school of children who reside remote from their nearest school.  Under the terms of the primary and post-primary scheme, children are eligible for school transport if they satisfy the distance criteria and are attending their nearest school or education centre as determined by the Department or Bus &Eacute;ireann, having regard to ethos and language. <\/p>  <p>  All children who are eligible for school transport and who complete the application and payment process on time will be accommodated on school transport services for the 2021-22 school year, where such services are in operation.  Children who are not eligible for school transport may apply for transport on a concessionary basis only and will be facilitated where spare seats are available after eligible children have been accommodated.  Where the number of ineligible children exceeds the number of spare seats available, Bus &Eacute;ireann allocates tickets for the spare seats using an agreed selection process.  Concessionary transport is subject to a number of terms and conditions, including the availability of spare seats on an existing service and payment of the annual charge.  Routes will not be extended or altered, additional vehicles will not be introduced, nor will larger vehicles or extra trips using existing vehicles be provided to cater for children travelling on a concessionary basis.<\/p>  <p>  I understand that some parents may have a concern that they would not be considered eligible for transport to the next-nearest school if, due to the enrolment pressures mentioned by the Deputies, their nearest school is full.  I would like to reassure them that in cases where the Department is satisfied that the nearest school is full, eligibility for school transport will be determined based on the distance that children reside from their next-nearest school, having regard to ethos and language.  If a family has further information in regard to the closest school being full, they should contact the school transport section of the Department.<\/p>  <p>  In October 2019, my predecessor announced a review of the school transport scheme with a view to taking a fresh look at the service and its broader effectiveness and sustainability.  Given the evolving situation with Covid-19, the work of the steering group had been delayed.  However, an initial meeting of the steering group was recently held in order to recommence the process, which will continue over the coming period.  The review is being conducted to ensure that the school transport system is fit for purpose and that it serves students and their families adequately.  This review will build on the proposals in the programme for Government as they relate to school transport, including examining the options to reduce car journeys and assessing how the school transport scheme can work in liaison with the Safe Routes to Schools programme; and examining the options for providing better value and a better service for students, including examining issues such as the nearest or next-nearest school, which I know is of particular interest to the Deputies.<\/p>  <p>  It is planned that the steering group will report to me on an interim basis as the review progresses with a view to presenting a final report later this year with recommendations on the future operation of the Department&rsquo;s school transport scheme.<\/p> <p>The steering group will report to me initially on preliminary findings on eligibility before moving to consider and report on broader issues such as the objectives of the scheme and its alignment with other initiatives and wider Government policy.  This steering group is due to report to me shortly with its preliminary report.

The Minister has been in the House before to hear me speak about Scoil Colm, which will now be opened as Our Lady of Hope as a special school.  That has given some hope to parents.  However, there is still an under-supply of special schools which is pushing more and more children into special autism spectrum disorder, ASD, classes.  We hear of reports being written stating a child needs a special class - not a special school - because there is no special school available.  Ultimately, the children are losing out because they are not getting the correct educational placement they need.  Children who should be in a special school are not getting a special school; their need for one is not being registered and they are taking up spaces in special classes, creating overly long waiting lists.  In Dublin 12 there is an added burden because established schools in Dublin 4 and Dublin 6 are not being forced to provide ASD classes, as other schools have been by the Department.  There are children in Dublin 4 and Dublin 6 who are completely under-supplied with ASD special classes being pushed into Dublin 12, increasing the waiting lists in Dublin 12 and then children from Dublin 12 are being pushed into Dublin 24.

The main issue I have to raise is access and inclusion model, AIM, staff for children with ASD in early years education at the very start of their national school education.  For a Montessori school to take on a child with ASD, it requires AIM staff who have further qualifications than most childcare workers to work one-on-one with the child.  It is obviously crucial for children with ASD to attend Montessori preschool and early stages of mainstream education, socialise and get used to a school and communal environment as it is important for their families, parents and guardians.  However, many childcare providers and national schools are forced to turn away children with autism as they simply do not have the staff to care for them.  One of the big reasons for this is the remuneration for AIM staff is simply not high enough.  They are paid &euro;14 an hour which is about &euro;10.85 after tax which is not enough to attract sufficient talent to early years Montessori and senior and junior infant schools across Dublin.  As a result providers are forced to turn away children with autism leaving them and their families stuck and out of options as they cannot use their existing staff to work with children.  It is unfair for so many reasons.  Children with autism have every bit as much right to childcare and an education as any other child, particular in early years and in their first years in primary education.  These barriers to entry for children with autism will only disadvantage them as they progress through the national school system.  In my area of Dublin Rathdown a family with two young children with autism have been rejected from six childcare providers due to a lack of staff.  As they prepare to enter junior infants next September they are unable to establish what national school will be able to accept them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051800066#OOO00700","speaker":"1473"},{"type":"speech","time":1621378800,"counter":622,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputies for raising this issue as it gives me an opportunity to outline the current position regarding provision for children with special educational needs, including autism.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the particular case referred to by the Deputies, I am assured by the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, that the local special education needs organiser, SENO, is working with this family so that the child concerned is placed in the most suitable school placement and the necessary supports are put in place. <\/p> <p>Enabling children with special educational needs to receive an education appropriate to their needs is a priority.  Children with special educational needs should receive their education in placements that are appropriate to their needs alongside their peers wherever possible unless such an approach would be inconsistent with the best interests of the individual child or other children.  This inclusive approach is consistent with the provisions of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004.  This policy is supported by significant investment on the part of the Government.  The State will spend approximately &euro;2 billion, or just under 25% of the entire education budget for 2021, on making additional provision for children with special educational needs this year.<\/p> <p> The NCSE has responsibility for co-ordinating and advising on education provision for children nationwide.  It has well-established structures in place for engaging with schools and parents.  The NCSE seeks to ensure that schools in a given area can, between them, cater for all children who have been identified as needing special education placements.  There are planning processes at both national and local levels to ensure the required number of specialist education places come on stream to meet identified need in a timely way.  Normally, schools are very willing to respond to the emerging needs in their areas.  However, where a shortage of places is identified, the Department of Education works closely with the NCSE and the schools in question to expand provision to meet local need.  This collaboration works well.  There has been strong collaboration and engagement between the partners in education, the parents and schools in making the provision possible.<\/p> <p> The NCSE is working with a significant number of families and schools to secure suitable placements for children with special educational needs.  This is important work.  I assure the Deputies that it is a priority for all concerned.  We will continue to work hand in hand with the partners in education to ensure the individual needs of children are met in the appropriate environment, be it in a special class or a special school.<\/p> <p> On some of the points raised by the Deputies, early years education is not my domain but I take the point raised in respect of the need to have appropriately trained staff.  Regarding the allocation of staff within the school setting, significant progress is being made in terms of the allocation of special needs assistants.  The number of special education teachers is at a significantly higher level, with over 18,000 pupils covered.  The same applies to staff with expertise in working with children with additional needs, including children with autism.  It must be acknowledged that over one fifth of the budget is rightly being spent in the area of special education.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051800066#OOO00800","speaker":"1582","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621379400,"counter":624,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

There is a domino effect in that children are being bussed out of their own communities into others.  The knock-on effect ultimately means that, because some areas are not providing or not being forced to provide the ASD classes they should be providing, other areas and children are suffering.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051800067#PPP00200","speaker":"1570"},{"type":"speech","time":1621379400,"counter":625,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for the thorough reply.

When there is early diagnosis and early intervention, children are not getting the supports they need to allow them to enter mainstream education in the best possible way.  That is why we need to see support for Montessori workers in the early childhood sector.  Equally, we need to see early childhood services, Montessori schools and cr&egrave;ches provided with the opportunities to expand and have the appropriate spaces.  I am aware that much of this does not fall directly under the Minister's purview but it will feed straight into the national school system at a very early stage.

The just transition fund was introduced to compensate the midlands and help to ensure it will not be left behind, with its local economy being forced to adjust, as the rest of the country reaps the carbon-reduction benefits.<\/p>  <p>  Thanks to Center Parcs, the gas pipeline was extended to Ballymahon.  As we seek to offset the impact of fast-tracked decarbonisation in the midlands while at the same time safeguarding future energy supplies for local industry, it is vital that we seek to extend the pipeline to Longford town and Edgeworthstown.  This would facilitate connections to major energy users.  There are as many as ten major industries across the two towns, employing nearly 3,000.  The pipeline would allow them to reduce their energy emissions, utilise energy efficiently and apply renewable technologies while exploring expansion potential.  At least two of the industries are finalising major expansion plans.  A positive indication regarding the availability of gas would certainly be welcome at this point.  This would take place in tandem with Longford County Council's plans to develop an anaerobic digester in the Lanesborough-Mountdillon area as part of the just transition process following the closure of the local power station.  At the heart of the anaerobic digester plan is the determination to deliver renewable energy back to the grid, driven and supported by the local communities most affected by the process of climate action.<\/p>  <p>  This holistic package will help to develop employment opportunities and economic development, enhancing biodiversity and environmental quality while promoting community-based innovations to decarbonise the difficult areas of agriculture and transport.  Longford County Council has made a compelling case for the gas line extension to Longford town and Edgeworthstown under the climate change action plan.<\/p> <p>I am aware that the application is currently being reviewed by the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications.  The hope is that the proposal will find favour in the next round of capital funding.  As it stands, however, the funding gap that exists makes the project unviable without the benefit of capital funding.  Members will be aware that we discussed the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Bill 2021 at length in this House over the past two weeks and indeed we have been discussing it for much longer than that.  The truth is that this is an innovative, timely proposal from a capable and far-sighted local authority.  It has the potential to replace carbon-intensive peat-fired energy production with a carbon neutral energy source and, through the extended gas line, also decarbonise other difficult areas.  However, it can only be delivered with investment at scale.  It is crucial that the next round of capital funding acknowledge the well articulated case to extend the gas line to Longford and Edgeworthstown.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051800067#PPP00600","speaker":"1597","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1621380000,"counter":630,"content":"<p>I appreciate Deputy Flaherty providing me with the opportunity to respond to this important issue.  I am answering on behalf of my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Ryan.  The routing of gas pipelines, or the connection of towns to the gas pipeline network, are matters for Gas Networks Ireland which is a commercial State-sponsored body under the aegis of the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, and for the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, the statutorily independent energy regulator.  Gas Networks Ireland is mandated under section 8 of the Gas Act 1976, as amended, to develop and maintain a system for the supply of natural gas that is both economical and efficient.  The Commission for Regulation of Utilities has, since 2002, been charged with all aspects of the assessment and licensing of prospective operators which wish to develop and-or operate a gas distribution system within the State under the Gas (Interim) (Regulation) Act 2002.  The Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, therefore, has no direct statutory function in relation to the connection of towns to the gas network.<\/p>  <p>  The programme for Government commits to an average 7% per annum reduction in overall greenhouse gas emissions from 2021 to 2030, which is a 51% reduction over the decade, and to achieving net zero emissions by 2050.  Any measures taken to reduce energy emissions will be coherent with our overall decarbonisation goals.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy also raised the issue of how large energy users can reduce their energy emissions, utilise energy efficiencies and apply renewable technologies.  In this regard, a range of other supports and schemes for businesses are also funded by the Department under the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI.  These include the excellence in energy efficiency design, EXEED, grant scheme supporting businesses to undertake design, construction and commissioning projects using the EXEED certification process.  It also includes the support scheme for renewable heat, which financially supports businesses in adopting renewable energy for heat, including heat pumps and heating systems using biomass or biogas.  Project assistance grants help to fund feasibility studies and business cases for energy performance improvements.  They also include SEAI's training, information and advisory services, which include the online, free-to-use SEAI energy academy and the SEAI's large industry energy network where members work together to improve energy performance and share experiences.<\/p>  <p>  While I cannot specifically provide any assurance in relation to extending the gas grid to Longford, I hope that some of the information about how businesses can be supported to reduce their emissions is of benefit to the Deputy.<\/p>  <p>  I will provide further detail on the importance, as the Deputy mentioned, of the just transition.  We have a strong programme for Government commitment on the just transition for the midlands region, including the Deputy's home county of Longford, counties Westmeath, Offaly and Roscommon and many other areas currently affected by the transition process and our decarbonisation goals.  The ongoing investment in the midlands region and its strengthening will be important for jobs and also in ensuring that communities are brought with us in a constructive, collaborative way.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy referred to the importance of the just transition and investment in the midlands region.  I will provide further detail on that in a moment.  I will also bring the specific information about this proposal to the attention of the Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051800068#QQQ00200","speaker":"1475"},{"type":"speech","time":1621380000,"counter":631,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.  I know that he appreciates that the proposal from Longford County Council is far-reaching and on the button as we work on climate action and towards our hefty 2030 targets.  There is considerable debate in County Longford on the future of the now dormant Lough Ree energy plant.  Local man and engineer, John Hanley, has ambitious plans for an energy hub on the site.  A transition to a renewable gas network for high energy use industries would certainly create the opportunity to potentially utilise the existing infrastructure at the ESB Lanesborough site.  Crucially, the proposal would also increase the attractiveness of Longford as a destination for inward investment in line with identified Project Ireland 2040 rural development initiatives.  As the Minister of State correctly said, just transition is important for the midlands but, crucially, it needs to do exactly what it says on the tin.  For half a century, Longford and the midlands were the cradle of Ireland's energy production.  Extending the gas line, the development of an anaerobic digester and the creation of an alternative energy hub on the grounds of Lough Ree power plant would certainly put the county back centre stage in the quest for decarbonisation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051800068#QQQ00300","speaker":"1597"},{"type":"speech","time":1621380000,"counter":632,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Flaherty for the opportunity to respond.

The Government announced provision of funding offers to over 60 projects throughout the region, including private sector and local authority projects for communities to create a strong, green, sustainable economy.  These projects will contribute to making the midlands a more attractive and sustainable place to live and work.  The Government has signed contracts with 17 projects so far.  Some 16 projects are already up and running in the midlands, supported through the fund.  They have created 28 full-time jobs and will result in 175 indirect jobs.

Its engagement in the North has been successful but it wants recognition on an all-Ireland basis.  We had the tragic death of Jo&atilde;o Carvalho.

The sport of MMA has grown immensely over the past decade.  Participation in MMA in Ireland is very diverse.  If one walks into any MMA club, one will see a mix of people ranging from office workers to construction workers, young and old.  One will see a real mix of nationalities training side by side.  We have also seen the great potential MMA can offer young people through programmes such as the MMA coaching and education programme in Drogheda.  The aim of this programme is to provide support for young people caught up in antisocial activity and to help them move off that particular path.<\/p>  <p>  Following the tragic death of Jo&atilde;o Carvalho in 2016, which has been mentioned, the Coroner's Court recommended the introduction of standardised safety procedures and protocols for MMA events in Ireland in addition to raising the need to expedite the endorsement of a national governing body, NGB, for MMA.  The IMMAA, was founded in 2017 and has introduced exceptionally high safety standards for amateur athletes involved in MMA.  These standards are properly higher than those for any other contact sport under the remit of Sport Ireland.  IMMAA athletes have consistently represented Ireland very strongly.  At the 2018 world amateur MMA championships, Ireland came second in the context of the number of medals won.  These amateur athletes deserve proper recognition. <\/p>  <p>  There is currently no clear path for the IMMAA to become recognised as an NGB, despite its best efforts.

The death of Jo&atilde;o Carvalho in 2016 was an extremely tragic event and it is important that we remind ourselves of all four of the coroner's recommendations that followed.  It was recommended: that the endorsement of a national governing body for MMA be expedited; that all medical partners be clinical practice guidelines, CPG, providers; that all medical partners engage nationally qualified paramedics; and that, in the short-term, MMA in Ireland adopt the safety standards for boxing.  Before discussing the IMMAA's attempt to be recognised as an NGB for sport, it is important to note the coroner's recommendations in respect of health and safety and the medical care of participants and to state that, as we would all agree, it is always of paramount importance that these recommendations be upheld and that all appropriate procedures and protocols are in place to ensure the safety of participants.<\/p>  <p>  Sport Ireland, which is funded by my Department, is the statutory body with responsibility for the development and promotion of sport, increasing participation at all levels and raising standards.  It also has responsibility for the recognition of sports and NGBs of sport.  Sport Ireland operates a formal recognition process through which organisations can apply to become recognised as an NGB of sport.  This is a means for organisations that are not currently recognised to apply for Sport Ireland recognition and, in turn, to receive support and financial investment from Sport Ireland.  The recognition process for achieving the status of being an NGB in Ireland is solely a matter for Sport Ireland, which has the legislative responsibility for the development of sport, as set out in the Sport Ireland Act 2015.  Further information is set out on its website.<\/p>  <p>  Since the tragic death of Jo&atilde;o Carvalho in 2016, Sport Ireland has been in ongoing conversations with the IMMAA and the Irish Martial Arts Commission, IMAC, which is the NGB of sport for martial arts in Ireland, with regard to the development of a relationship between both parties.  As part of this process, Sport Ireland established a mixed martial arts working group.  The working group included decision makers from both organisations, along with an independent chair and an independent facilitator.  Following engagement through 2017, the working group produced a final report.  The content of the report was agreed by both IMMAA and IMAC.  One of the key recommendations of the working group was for \"IMMAA to make an application to IMAC at the earliest opportunity to become a member and to seek the technical support and advice of IMAC on putting in place appropriate guidelines for a modern sporting organisation and member discipline.\"  Notwithstanding this key recommendation in 2017, there was no proactive engagement with, or formal application made to IMAC until 2020.<\/p>  <p>  It should be noted that, since the completion of the report, Sport Ireland has remained available to the IMMAA and has met with representatives of both it and its international federation on a number of occasions throughout 2018, 2019 and 2020.  Each NGB establishes its own criteria for potential affiliates as independent autonomous organisations.  A primary requirement for IMAC affiliation is that the organisation's international federation be a member of the Global Association of International Sports Federations.  This is also a minimum criterion with the Sport Ireland recognition criteria.  While Sport Ireland does not work directly with international federations, it is aware that a mixed martial arts federation has been unsuccessful in its application for membership of the Global Association of International Sports Federations.<\/p>  <p>  In April 2021, Sport Ireland undertook to recommence the work of the working group.  The same independent chair, Professor Jack Anderson, and independent facilitator, Morgan Buckley, will support the work of the group.  The preparation work of the working group has commenced, with all parties having agreed to take part in the process.  Further meetings involving IMAC and the IMMAA are scheduled for June.  <\/p>  <p>  As I said previously, I have no direct role in the recognition of national governing bodies of sport.  However, I assure the Deputies that Sport Ireland, as the statutory body with responsibility for such matters, has been engaging with the IMMAA since 2016 and will continue to do so.  As I said, that is the process.  The Deputies asked about that.

This information was obtained through a freedom of information request.  It was said that MMA, in its current form, is not a sport, and, like dog fighting, did not deserve to be legitimised.

The development of a formal relationship with IMAC remains the recommended avenue and pathway to advance this.  The application was also in line with both the recommendations of the working group and the Sport Ireland recognition criteria.  Given the status of the international federation as a primary requirement of IMAC affiliation, the initial IMMAA application was unsuccessful.  In November 2020, Sport Ireland met representatives of the IMMAA to discuss the development of the IMAC application.  Sport Ireland recommended that the IMMAA continued to engage with IMAC on the broader affiliation requirements while the international federation continues its journey for GAISF recognition.  In April 2021, Sport Ireland undertook to recommence the work of the working group, as I have mentioned, with all parties having agreed to take part in this process.
