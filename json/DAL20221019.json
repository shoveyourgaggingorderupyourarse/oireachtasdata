I put on record my thanks and those of the staff who work at my constituency office in Limerick to the staff in the regional office of the Department of Social Protection, who do tremendous work, including especially earlier in the pandemic, and that has been, and is, very much appreciated.<\/p>  <p>  I have been contacted by many Limerick residents who have applied for urgent payments such as the additional needs payment but who have not received a timely response to the status of their application.  As the Minister of State will be aware, this is an exceptional payment that can support families when unexpected issues and essential expenses arise that they cannot afford to pay from their weekly income.  Traditionally, the queries my office receives regarding this payment are in response to sudden expenses such as help with funeral costs, temporary assistance while awaiting a decision from the appeals office or following an unexpected incident such as a fire in the family home.  More and more, however, we face queries on this payment from people who are finding their energy and food costs too high.  The number of exceptional needs payments made towards heating and household bills has, historically, been quite low.  For instance, in the first months of 2022, only 1,001 payments were made in the entire State.  The community welfare service delivers the supplementary welfare allowance scheme as well.  Unfortunately, the feedback we are receiving from applicants suggests that applications to the community welfare service are taking a very long time to process.<\/p>  <p>  Since the sudden centralisation of the community welfare service during the summer, I have observed two major failings, the first of which is that people awaiting a decision from the appeals office are now being advised not to apply for the supplementary welfare allowance because the wait time is likely to be longer than the wait for an appeal decision itself.  That was never previously the case.  The second major failing is that those who have been allocated social houses are waiting a minimum of eight to ten weeks to receive their new home kit, which would enable them to buy some of the bare necessities such as cooking appliances and beds.  This is putting a severe strain on the most vulnerable families.<\/p>  <p>   I might give the Minister of State an idea of some of the people I am talking about.  One lady I am dealing with has two autistic children, who, as she will be aware, need a daily routine.  She previously rented for 13 years and was delighted to be offered a local authority home in May.  Due to delays, she received the keys in August and, unfortunately, could not apply for the new home kit until then because she had to wait until she had the keys.  It is ten weeks later and she has not received the payment.  Two autistic children are not eating properly because they have no fridge or cooker.  Another person I am dealing with is an elderly man who was placed in housing specifically for elderly people.  He had no furniture of his own because he had rented privately for years.  He has applied for the new home kit for furniture and is currently sleeping on the floor because the additional needs payment has not yet been approved.<\/p>  <p>  These delays are, in many cases, turning what should be a celebratory event - gaining a home forever - into a nightmare.  Other delays are leaving innumerable people without any sort of income for months on end.  I appreciate the recent response from the Department outlining that an estimated 63% of payments are decided within four weeks of the application and I think the next 2% are decided within eight weeks, but my local area, where the staff do exceptional work, now has delays of up to ten weeks.  Furthermore, that response outlined that a back-office team undertakes preparatory work on applications and that this process frees up community welfare officers, CWOs, from such administrative tasks.  Will the Minister of State outline how these applications are dealt with?  Are they triaged, with the most urgent cases addressed first, as was suggested in a recent reply to a parliamentary question, or is it first come first served, as I have been told is the case by CWOs?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900003#A00500","speaker":"1509"},{"type":"speech","time":1666167120,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I am taking this matter on behalf of the Minister for Social Protection.  The additional needs payment is available from the Department of Social Protection to assist people who are experiencing genuine financial hardship.  As of the end of September 2022, almost 66,000 applications for additional needs payments had been processed and awarded, representing a 60% increase in the number of applications awarded compared with the same period in 2021.  This rise in the number of applications in 2022 reflects a return to pre-pandemic levels and a number of positive new measures introduced by the Minister earlier this year to try to simplify the process and make it easier for people to access additional needs payments.  These measures include the removal of the 30-hour rule and the establishment of a national helpline phone number.  In addition, there was a major public awareness raising campaign by the Department to increase awareness of the payments, which many Deputies will have heard on national radio over recent months.  It is clear from the statistics that those efforts have worked and, as I said, the number of applications awarded so far this year is 60% ahead of the same period in 2021.<\/p>  <p>  There are a number of different ways to apply for an additional needs payment.  A person can apply over the phone, by visiting a local Intreo office, by visiting a community welfare officer clinic or, where necessary, a CWO can call to a person&rsquo;s home by appointment.  Where it is obvious a person has an immediate need, every effort is made to ensure he or she will receive a payment on the same day.  In fairness, we all deal with CWOs through our constituency offices and where the CWO recognises there is a clear and urgent need, he or she is normally good at making sure the person is looked after.  Where an application is complete and the required documentation is supplied, it is generally processed in a matter of days.  Where there are delays sometimes, this is generally due to additional information or documentation being requested from the person to support the application.<\/p>  <p>  I listened to the specific concerns the Deputy raised regarding the mother of two autistic children and the elderly man with the furniture issue.  It would be helpful if he could bring those details to the attention of the Minister, who can check with her Department as to the status of those individual queries.  He also mentioned appeals and the new home kit.  I have noted those comments and will convey them to the Minister.  The criteria for the additional needs payment are quite broad and the decision on any emergency payment is taken by the CWO, who has discretion.  In general, the requirement is that the money be needed for an essential expense the customer cannot pay from his or her weekly income.  Someone can get this payment, therefore, even if he or she does not receive any social welfare payments, not least if he or she is on a low income.  The Deputy mentioned some examples and asked about the payment in respect of energy costs.  Increased costs of heating and electricity would fit the criteria, as would essential repairs to property and replacing household appliances or furniture, and assistance with deposits for private rented accommodation, as well as furniture, bedding and other items if a home is being set up for the first time.<\/p> <p>Funeral costs are covered, as are recurring travel expenses such as for hospital appointments or visiting relatives in hospital or prison.  Assistance is provided for immediate needs such as food, clothing and accommodation expenses following an emergency event such as a house fire.  The payment does not cover non-essential household or personal expenses, or costs that are the responsibility of another agency or government body.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900003#A00600","speaker":"1472","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666167720,"counter":12,"content":"<p>In her response the Minister of State said that where it is obvious a person has an immediate need, every effort is made to ensure he or she receives a payment on the day.  That used to be the case but the reason I am raising this issue is that it is not the case anymore, unfortunately.  It is fine for us to stand here and discuss figures and percentages, but the reality is that the people who are most in need are not receiving payments from the Department in a timely manner.  That is the problem I am trying to raise.  There are people waiting 12 weeks for decisions on initial applications for long-term payments such as the invalidity pension, the disability allowance and the carer's allowance, and people waiting up to ten weeks for an exceptional needs payment.  These are good people who, in many cases, have never contacted the Department previously.  Many are providing an invaluable service to both the community and to the State.  They apply for these payments out of necessity.  They are not doing it for anything else.<\/p><p>I encourage the Minister for Social Protection to put the application form online.  It would make it much handier seeing as the Government is centralising the service, which is a mistake.  This is the minimum people should expect from the State during a stressful period of their lives.  The community welfare service, which exists to help, should be able to step in immediately when people are most in need, be in good working order and be able to deliver on these needs promptly, as had always been the case.  The centralisation of these processes seems to have been done in a rushed manner, with confirmation of the change provided after it had become a <i>fait accompli<\/i>.  Since then, timelines for applications have increased on a near weekly basis.  Timelines have jumped from six weeks when the community welfare service was first centralised, to eight and then ten weeks, and now the responses from the Department are without a specified timeline.  As this centralisation has not worked, the community aspect has been removed from what was supposedly a community service.  It is now just a welfare service.  We have made a big mistake in the centralisation of it.  It used to be that the CWO would know the people coming in and it was an easier service to administer.  It is taking too long.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900004#B00200","speaker":"1509"},{"type":"speech","time":1666167720,"counter":13,"content":"<p>We all recall that during the pandemic, and the Deputy mentioned this about Limerick, the staff in the Department of Social Protection went above and beyond to ensure people got the support that they needed in a timely fashion.

The Minister has confirmed that she will allocate additional staff to deal with the processing of payments.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy mentioned delays.  A lot is being done.  We have to remember that this is taxpayers' money.  Where all of the necessary information and documentation is provided, payments are usually processed within a matter of days.  Where there are delays, it is normally where additional information is required but, as I said, the Minister is allocating additional staff to assist with that.  The Department is also currently examining the introduction of an online application option.  The Minister has been approached by a number of Deputies about that.  That is worth looking at and the Department is actively looking at it.  At the moment, a person can apply by phone, or by visiting an Intreo office or a CWO clinic.  More than &euro;38 million has been paid out under the scheme.  As I said earlier, that is a 60% increase on the awards last year.  The Minister and her Department want people to be able to access these payments.  That is what they are there for and that is why there has been such a comprehensive communications campaign to promote and raise awareness of this payment.

They will be asking questions of the HSE and the manufacturer, Vertex.  A resolution has to be found immediately.  It is unbelievable that others living with CF have access to this drug.  It is hugely beneficial.  Even in Europe, the vast majority of people living with cystic fibrosis have access to it.  These parents and children are being denied and delayed.  That is a terrible injustice for these children.  I understand the Minister for Health will be meeting with some of the parents next week regarding this cohort of children.  It is disappointing that the meeting has not taken place thus far.  There is huge frustration and anger about this situation.  I always try to put myself in the shoes of a parent of a child with CF  Imagine knowing there is a medication that is being denied to your child.  That is immoral.  I am sure the Minister of State and everybody else will agree with that, given that a drug is available to people but these children cannot get it because of what seems to be a price dispute between the HSE and Vertex.  A resolution has to be found.  No financial burden should be put on parents and children at this stage.  There is speculation that this could be referred to the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics, NCPE.  That is an arduous and lengthy process, to say the least.

Cystic fibrosis is a devastating disease for patients and their families, with Ireland having one of the highest <i>per capita<\/i>CF rates in the world.  Many of us will have seen its effects and the cost to families.  Access to effective treatment offers hope to those suffering from this disease and the Minister aims to make this possible for every patient who needs it.<\/p><p>Kaftrio has been a life-changing drug for CF sufferers.  Access to drugs like this is what we expected when we signed our agreement with the manufacturer Vertex in 2017.  The deal stipulated that our patients would have access to Vertex's whole portfolio of CF drugs for a capped yearly cost.  We made a ten-year commitment, which has already seen us pay hundreds of millions of euro to Vertex.  We entered this agreement in good faith, expecting that as new licences were approved for its medicines, we would receive access at no additional cost.  This has been the case previously when new indications were licensed.  Our agreement was amended in 2019 and 2020 to include these patient groups at no additional cost.  However, for this particular subtype affecting a small number of children, Vertex is requesting additional funds to provide access.<\/p><p>The HSE has statutory responsibility for community drug schemes.  It has structures in place to ensure our health service is able to provide the right care suitably and sustainably.  The corporate pharmaceutical unit has engaged extensively with Vertex, holding 11 meetings to try to get this patient group included in our pre-existing agreement.  Considering the significant budgetary impact of additional resources, Vertex is requesting it engage with the pricing and reimbursement process that all our medicines are required to undergo.  The HSE continues to engage proactively with Vertex, meeting as recently as 12 October, hoping to better understand why the company has chosen to take this position.  The Government is committed to providing access to innovative new medicines for Irish patients.<\/p> <p>The last three budgets have seen almost &euro;100 million dedicated to new medicines, with 90 new medicines or the expanded use of existing medicines made available by this funding, and 21 of these are for the treatment of rare diseases.  The Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association, IPHA, a group representing the industry, has described this dedicated funding as a game-changer.  The Minister thanks Cystic Fibrosis Ireland for its efforts in bringing attention to the situation.  He shares a common goal of making this drug available to the children who need it.  The Minister is eager to gain their insight on possible routes to a solution.  To that end, he will meet with the CEO soon.  This meeting will include clinical experts and patient representatives.  I hope this is the meeting that the Deputy referred to as being next week.  It is a timely meeting giving a voice to those with real-world experience of this debilitating disease and the difference that Kaftrio could make.  The Minister is optimistic that their meeting will be fruitful and will contribute to making this drug available to every person who needs it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900004#B00600","speaker":"1484","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666168320,"counter":18,"content":"<p>I do not blame the Minister of State, but if I was a parent of a child listening to this, I would believe the fault lies with the manufacturer, Vertex.

To say it is eye-watering is an understatement.  It has a stock valuation of $70 billion.  Its turnover two years ago just for the drug, Kaftrio, was $5.7 billion.  Two years ago, it made a profit of $4.3 billion.  It is incredible the amount that a pharmaceutical company can make and at the same time go into a dispute with, and almost blackmail, governments around the access to this drug.  It is absolutely immoral that pharmaceutical companies, most of which are based in Ireland, have governments and families over a barrel.  They make an amazing profit, but the Minister of State said in her statement that they are looking for extra funding.  I am sure they have done very well out of the Irish State just with this particular drug.  They have made tens of millions of euro in profits but they will not compromise on this issue.  The Minister of State must agree that it is absolutely immoral.  I do not know how these people sleep at night while at the same time children are being denied this drug.  In one guise Kaftrio is being hailed as the closest thing to a cure for those with CF, yet this is being denied to children.  It is absolutely immoral.

It is unfortunate that when one hears of a drug company reneging on their ten-year agreement, it puts other rare diseases at risk.  It is important also to ensure that Mazars' report is published, which was our report.  This review into how we do business on the licensing and funding of rare drugs is such an important piece in protecting and ensuring that people have access to rare drugs.

I am sure he will also raise it in his own right.<\/p>  <p>  I would like to discuss the significant and troubling work that the Office of the Planning Regulator, OPR, has been undertaking over the past 18 months in respect of the ongoing development plans of local authorities in Ireland.  I want to raise this matter because in today's society we are living in an era of independent State agencies, which, though merits were hugely attributed to their creation, are stripping the State of the democratic vehicles that we should be relying upon.  One of the agencies that I feel is guilty in this regard is the OPR.  This is with regard to a number of key decisions the regulator has taken around county development plans within my county.  There have been huge inadequate inadequacies in the decisions that have been taken on the county development plan.<\/p>  <p>  I will give one key example of one town in my constituency.  Fermoy is reliant on the M8 motorway between Cork and Dublin for its future growth, the provision of new jobs, and ensuring the town has a viable economic future for the development of industry within its own area.  The OPR has been interfering with Cork County Council and members of the local authority in their desire to see that lands already zoned and that are serviced provide all of the infrastructure required for industry in that location and stripping them of their zoning for industrial use.  I believe this is absolutely and utterly appalling.<\/p>  <p>  We need to make a decision in this country about who runs it.  We are seeing red tape, and now green tape, added to the decision-making process around what is zoned and what is not.  Quite frankly, it is insulting to members of local authorities and to democratically elected members of this D&aacute;il that we continue to see such gross interference in county development plans of local authorities across the country.  If we keep going in this direction it will come to the point where zoning as an issue will not be the responsibility of councillors any more.  I have a major problem with this.  I want to know what the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage thinks but, unfortunately, he is not present this morning to address what is a crucial issue for members of local authorities.<\/p>  <p>  His Department has responsibility for local government for a reason.  The actions of the agency under that Department's auspices show that it is not behaving in a manner that reflects this responsibility.  It urgently needs to be dealt with now.  For towns throughout the country, having an office of civil servants based in Dublin making decisions about what is in the best interest for locations such as Carrigtwohill and Fermoy, and for local authority areas across the country, is profoundly inappropriate.  Those decisions should, by right, be made at a local level.  Deputy O'Sullivan and myself have a serious issue with that.  I would like to hear what the Department has to say in response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900005#C00900","speaker":"1516"},{"type":"speech","time":1666168320,"counter":26,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his question and I also thank Deputy P&aacute;draig O'Sullivan.<\/p>  <p>  The Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended gives the OPR a statutory basis to carry out three main functions.  One core function of the OPR is the independent assessment of all local authority and regional assembly statutory plan making processes.  This includes county and city development plans, local area plans, and regional spatial and economic strategies.<\/p>  <p>  The OPR provides observations during the drafting of statutory plans.  In cases where the OPR finds that a local authority's plans are ultimately not consistent with relevant regional or national policies, the OPR can recommend the use of Ministerial powers of direction to bring plans back in line with statutory requirements and best practice.  These OPR recommendations must be published.  If the Minister does not agree with the recommendation of the OPR and refuses to use the powers available to him or her, the Minister must prepare a statement of reasons for this decision, which is then laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  It is a robust system.<\/p> <p>Recommendations issued by the office relate to clear breaches of the relevant legislative provisions of the national or regional policy framework or the policy of Government, or both, as set out in ministerial guidelines under section 28 of the Act.  As such, the planning authority is required to implement or address recommendations made by the office to ensure consistency with the relevant policy and legislative provisions.<\/p> <p> The Minister's powers pursuant to the section 31 process are invoked on receipt of a notice issued by the OPR in accordance with section 31AM(8) of the Act.<\/p> <p> Since its establishment in April 2019, the OPR has assessed and evaluated 22 city and county development plans to adoption stage.  Of the 22 plans, 13 have been the subject of a section 31 notice letter from the office to the Minister of State with responsibility for planning and local government recommending that the Minister issue a draft direction.  Twelve of the 13 draft directions have been issued by the Minister, and the Minister's final decision is due to be issued on 24 October in regard to the remaining recommendation.<\/p> <p> Regarding the 12 draft directions issued by the Minister and pursuant to section 31AN(4) of the Act, the office subsequently recommended that the Minister issue final directions on nine.  Of these, six have been issued.  The remaining recommendations are under consideration by the Minister.<\/p> <p> The planning issues that were the subject of the six section 31 final directions issued by the Minister on county development plan reviews can be summarised generally as follows: excessive and inappropriate land-use zonings for a variety of land uses, mainly residential use, often in peripheral locations at a remove from settlements and subject to a number of specific site constraints, including flooding, access and servicing; the inclusion of conflicting wind energy development policies; and prohibitive policies related to the banning or limiting of certain types of development.<\/p> <p> There have been four occasions on which the Minister has decided not to include all of the recommendations made by the office in issuing either a draft or a final direction.  These are listed as follows.  The section 31 draft direction on the Kerry county development plan for the period 2022 to 2028 did not issue on one of the recommendations made by the OPR relating to renewable energy targets, specifically wind energy.  The section 31 final direction on the Cork county development plan for the period 2022 to 2028 did not issue on two of the recommendations made by the OPR relating to retail planning policy.  The section 31 final direction on the Westmeath county development plan for the period 2021 to 2027 did not issue on one of the recommendations made by the OPR relating to renewable energy targets, specifically wind energy.  The section 31 final direction on the Laois county development plan for the period 2022 to 2028 did not issue on one of the recommendations made by the OPR relating to renewable energy targets, specifically wind energy.  For each of the four listed, the Minister has prepared and submitted a statement of reasons to both Houses of the Oireachtas as to why he has not agreed with the recommendations of the OPR.  Eight development plans are still in the review process and will remain subject to evaluation and assessment by the OPR.<\/p> <p> I will refer specifically to the points raised by the Deputy when responding to supplementary questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900005#C01000","speaker":"1512","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666168920,"counter":28,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for the information he has brought before the House but wish to raise the fact that the manner in which the OPR has dealt with the attempts of Cork county and city councils to provide a retail outlet centre in their development plans raises serious concerns about its judgment and understanding of its role in this particular process.  The OPR's attempt to quash a variation of Cork's plan was rejected by the courts not on one but on two occasions.  This indicates why I feel we are right to highlight this extremely concerning issue and the erosion of democratic power at local government level in this country.  The judge stated this was not a borderline case, a decision on points or a line call but that it was a win in straight sets.  I refer to the issue of going against legal advice.  In raising this issue, I want to hammer home to the Department that there seems to be a growth in interference in county development plans.  It is highly insulting to members of local authorities that this continues to happen.  It is happening on a national basis.  That an office in Dublin is trying to tell councillors in places such as Cork how they should conduct their affairs is highly concerning and should be stopped.<\/p>  <p>  I am also extremely concerned about the future of rural development.  In recent days, not only with the OPR but also with An Bord Plean&aacute;la, huge projects have effectively been shelved as a consequence of new legislation related to environmental targets.  I have to question that.  I am concerned about what it will do to local democracy if we do not put a stop to it now.  I ask the Minister of State to take these points on board and bring them back to the Department.<\/p>  <p>  I congratulate the Minister on the decision he took on the outlet centre.

The office plays a critical role in our planning system.  It exists to guide and support the work of local authorities.  There is robustness in that the Minister does not have to accept the recommendation.  It is worth remembering that the OPR was formally established in 2019 on foot of recommendations made by the Tribunal to Inquire into Certain Planning Matters and Payments, the Mahon tribunal.  The appointment of an independent planning regulator empowered to oversee the planning system in Ireland was one of the key recommendations of the tribunal.<\/p>  <p>  I note the concerns raised by the Deputy on Cork but it is critical to note that the OPR is playing an important role, one that we and local authority members should value.

As the Leas-Cheann Comhairle will know, I have taken opportunities over the year to highlight the names of victims of femicide &ndash; women identified by Women's Aid as having been killed since 1997 &ndash; to keep their names in the debate on domestic, gender-based and sexual violence.  My doing so follows the outpouring of grief after the death of Ashling Murphy in Tullamore in January of this year.<\/p>  <p>  The 19 women who died from domestic, sexual and gender-based violence in the month of September since 1997 are Elizabeth McCarthy, Maeve Byrne, Bettina Poeschel, Anna Finnegan, Theresa Doherty, Lisa Doyle, Ingrida Maciokaite, Linda Dunne, Ann Henry, Janet Mooney, Brenda Ahern, Sharon Coughlan, Melissa Mahon, Sheila McDonagh, Margaret Fahy, Eileen O'Sullivan, Marie O'Brien, Patricia Kierans and Raonaid Murray.  I will never forget when Raonaid Murray died.  We were about the same age.  It was the first week back at college after the summer.  Raonaid was a very young girl.  Her killer has still not been found.  Her family is from Glenageary, in my constituency.  Her death was one that I remember with particular pain.<\/p>  <p>  The 22 women and girls who died in October since 1997 are Charlene McAulliffe, Rachel O'Reilly, Amanda Jenkins, Geraldine Kissane, Manuela Riedo, Christina Hackett, Rebecca French, Meg Walsh, Joanne Mangan, Gillian Thornton, Marion O'Leary, Lorraine O'Connor, Amanda Carroll, Joselita da Silva, Kathleen Cuddihy, Rosemary Dowling, Aoife Phelan, Anne Colomines, Rachel Kiely, Natalie McGuinness, Seema Banu and Catherine Mullins.  A number of those women's children were killed at the same time.<\/p>  <p>  Doing this every two months is to give the women a name and voice on the D&aacute;il record, because they were voiceless in death, and to remember them.  It is also with a view to our being consistent in our follow-up and response to the very violent incidents that can happen.  There is little point in expressing grief, shock and outrage without follow-up actions, whether these involve remembering all the women in a consistent way, in the way we do, or the follow-up that the Department of Justice has been engaged in for some time, particularly through the publication of the third strategy earlier this year and the funding that goes with that.<\/p>  <p>  I congratulate the Department on its work over recent years on consolidating its policy and delivery role regarding domestic, gender-based and sexual violence of services.  As the Minister of State will know, I have been critical of the disparate approaches across agencies and of how this led to a lack of delivery in some circumstances.  It was not the primary role of Tusla, for example.  Domestic violence services, in particular, lost out as a consequence of that.<\/p> <p>The most important way they have lost out is through the lack of clarity on their funding.  I refer particularly to a lack of multi-annual funding that would allow them to plan for the development of their services not just this year, but into next year, and to engage in capital project planning alongside the day-to-day delivery of services.  I am keen to hear the Minister of State's update on the Department's perspective on this matter, particularly with regard to the multi-annual funding element, which would be of great significance to domestic violence service providers and partners of government all over the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900006#D00400","speaker":"1480","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666169520,"counter":33,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Carroll MacNeill for raising the very important and serious issue of domestic violence and the funding granted by the Government to deal with this very serious matter.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, earlier this year the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, launched Zero Tolerance, our third national strategy to combat domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.  It is an ambitious five-year programme of reform and a whole-of-society plan of action.  It builds on the substantial progress made through the implementation of the second national strategy and will further progress a number of important actions contained in Supporting a Victim's Journey.  It was developed in partnership with the sector to ensure it is targeted, comprehensive and effective in achieving all of the goals set out and is built on the four pillars of the Istanbul Convention, namely, prevention, protection, prosecution and policy co-ordination.<\/p>  <p>  A central element of the strategy is that everyone who needs a refuge space should be able to access one.  As a start, this strategy commits to doubling the number of refuge places.  This will be the fastest ever expansion of refuge spaces.  We will also work to deliver additional safe home and step-down accommodation.  When people are faced with the difficult choice to leave an abusive situation, the Minister wants them to know exactly where they can turn to for help.  This will be done through the creation of clear integrated local pathways for adults and child victims and survivors to access information, services and supports.<\/p>  <p>  Implementation of the third national strategy is a whole-of-government priority, backed up by a substantial funding commitment under budget 2023.  Under budget 2023, the Minister was able to secure an extra &euro;9 million for 2023, a 22% increase representing record funding for combating domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.  This &euro;9 million includes increased funding of &euro;7 million for organisations funded by Tusla to address acute service demands in existing services throughout the country and for investment in new services as outlined in Zero Tolerance.  This brings the total allocated to Tusla for funding domestic, sexual and gender-based violence services up to &euro;37 million. <\/p>  <p>  Separate from this, we have allocated over &euro;6 million for measures to tackle domestic, sexual and gender-based violence such as awareness raising campaign measures and funding the Choices programme for reforming perpetrators of domestic violence.  Again, this represents a record level of funding in this area.<\/p>  <p>  A further &euro;5.8 million has been allocated to promote and assist the development of specific support services for victims of crime within the criminal justice system, which of course includes victims of domestic and sexual crime.  These services provide important information and support such as emotional support, court accompaniment, accompaniment to Garda interviews and sexual assault treatment units and referral to other services.  Tusla will be engaging with funded domestic, sexual and gender-based violence organisations on service and funding agreements for 2023 over the coming weeks.  Specific funding to individual organisations will be agreed as part of that process and the Minister will be able to provide more information to the House once the details on core funding have been notified to the individual organisations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900007#E00200","speaker":"1618"},{"type":"speech","time":1666169520,"counter":34,"content":"<p>The Government is to provide funding agreements for 2023 in the coming weeks.  That is a big improvement.  It seems so obvious that funding for 2023 should be agreed in 2022 but I have worked with organisations that have received funding for a given calendar year which was only signed off on in November of that same year.  Obviously, they cannot work in that way.  Not all of those people whose names I have read out were in situations of domestic violence.  The violence against some, including Ashling Murphy and Raonaid Murray, which was at the most extreme end of the scale, was random in nature.  However, that is not to say that domestic violence does not need to be treated with the same seriousness.<\/p>  <p>  I have two questions.  To what degree have domestic violence spaces been expanded already in 2022?  Is there any update on the provision of a refuge in D&uacute;n Laoghaire, which does not have one?  The funding is available, the local authority is behind the proposal and the Department has been engaged but it has still not been delivered.  An update on that would be very helpful.<\/p>  <p>  I will make one more point.  As the Minister of State has said, refuge spaces are needed for people to get out of violent situations but they can also be needed at different stages of the criminal justice process.  I am working with a woman and, with regard to her case, there is an arrest pending in whatever period of time.  Even where people have already managed to very bravely get themselves out of difficult and violent situations, new moments of risk and threat can be created throughout the criminal justice process.  It is really important that the Department is aware of that and of the safety needs of individuals, as I know An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is.  There can be a requirement for people to go into safe and protected spaces at different stages of the criminal justice process.  I ask that the Department anticipate that as it builds out refuge spaces.  They are not just needed in emergency situations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900007#E00300","speaker":"1480"},{"type":"speech","time":1666169520,"counter":35,"content":"<p>I again thank the Deputy for raising this very important issue.

It is a priority of the Minister for Justice to tackle domestic violence through the provision of victim-centred supports and services and ensuring that perpetrators are punished, along with the important prevention work to address the behaviour and attitudes that underlie these types of violence.

The agency will have a specific mandate to drive the implementation of the new strategy across government, bringing the expertise and focus required to tackle this complex social issue.  The new agency will work collaboratively with the NGO and domestic, sexual and gender-based violence services sector to ensure that the best possible services are in place to meet the needs of victims and survivors.  It is our objective to establish the new agency on 1 January 2024.  In the interim, a memorandum of understanding solidifying the working relationship between the Department of Justice, the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth and Tusla ensures services continue and expand and keeps me up to date on developments in the domestic, sexual and gender-based violence sector.

and<br \/><br \/>&mdash; provide immediate interim payments to survivors while the redress scheme is being developed. <\/blockquote>  <\/blockquote> <p>In mother and baby homes, there have been thousands of unexplained infant deaths, missing children, forced labour, the ripping apart of families, immoral medical trials, mass unmarked graves, young women, many of them children themselves, incarcerated because they were pregnant - sometimes non-consensually, their being victims of rape and incest - and the throwing of children and women into situations of abuse.  So many imaginable horrors were perpetrated against some of the most vulnerable in our society.  If British forces had committed these atrocities, there would be unending calls for justice.  If we learned about these acts of evil happening in another country, we would rightly condemn the regimes responsible.  However, because it happened here and was Government policy, perpetuated by the church, and because it is the result of our cruel humanity, there has been nothing.<\/p> <p> For decades, survivors were denied even the acknowledgement of what happened to them.  When we look at the entirety of the crimes, abuses and human rights violations, it is almost unimaginable in its scale, brutality and immorality.  It was an intentional system designed to contain and punish single mothers.  It penalised and abused them for being pregnant and for being women, Travellers, disabled or persons of colour.  This was State policy and church strategy.  Each Government between the 1930s and 1990s had a part to play in it and history is clear on what happened to the few people who tried to stand up for the rights of women and children.<\/p> <p> Control, fear and silence were all central to this system.  Sparse records were kept of infant deaths, illegal adoptions and incarcerations because the people responsible knew what was being done was wrong.  Religious leaders, State officials and Ministers collaborated to hide and deny the truth for decades.  These cover-ups became codified in law and practice.  At all stages, these crimes and human rights abuses were intentional and the denial of justice and refusal of access to information or recognition were part of the same system protecting itself.  Thousands of unnatural deaths are still not being investigated.  Whole groups of survivors have been denied the dignity even of a meaningful apology, not to mention any form of redress.  Information on illegal adoptions is still being covered up.<\/p> <p> On paper, the Government looks like it is taking a different approach from that of its predecessors.  It has introduced the Birth Information and Tracing Act and the Institutional Burials Act.  From its press releases, it looks good.  However, once we dig only a little deeper, it is clear it is just as committed to putting barriers in the way of justice and accountability and abetting those responsible.  The Government and the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman, have ignored the pleas of survivors again and again.  The glaring errors and misuse of testimony in the report of the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes are wilfully ignored and even defended.  The Institutional Burials Act is designed to ensure Tuam will be the only mass grave ever excavated.  The Birth Information and Tracing Act comes with barriers and limitations.  At the same time, the religious orders and pharmaceutical companies are allowed to get away with murder.<\/p> <p> The Government continues to facilitate the cover-up of crimes and human rights abuses and, most cynically and callously, it does so in full knowledge.  The Minister knows the long history.  He knows what survivors are asking for and what the public wants but he clearly seems not to care.  His mantra seems to be to do just enough.  He will do just enough for a good headline, just enough to look good and just enough to misrepresent the reality.  This is just another form of abuse.  Survivors are still being refused their rights.  The basic tenets of our justice system have not been applied.  Suspicious deaths, disappearances and sexual assaults are all going uninvestigated on purpose.  The Minister's proposed redress scheme is the latest example of his approach to the issue.  It is designed to give as little compensation to as small a number of survivors as possible.  He is excluding people who spent less than six months in institutions as children, those who suffered forced family separation and those subjected to non-consensual medical trials.  He is disregarding the wishes of survivors, international human rights bodies and the Joint Committee on Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.<\/p> <p> Our motion is based on what many survivors have asked for, what human rights experts have said and what the Irish people want.  We are calling on the Government to correct the findings of the report of the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes, pay compensation proportionate to the suffering caused and hold the church and the State to account.  No one I talk to disagrees with this.  These are the most basic elements needed for any form of justice, yet the Government is refusing to do any of them.<\/p> <p> The most sickening aspect of the mother and baby homes report was the findings that exonerated the church and State by claiming all of society was to blame.  Of course, if everyone is to blame, then no one is to blame and survivors can never get justice.  This is a deep insult to those who suffered and still suffer today.  It gives the Government cover to push through a pathetic redress scheme that excludes so many survivors and ignores the reality of illegal adoptions and other crimes.  What about now?  When those same people are being denied basic justice again, will the Minister blame society once more?  Is it the fault of people watching today or people in Blanchardstown or west Cork?  Are they to blame for this failure?  When there is an inquiry into all of this in years to come, and that inquiry might conclude that \"Oh well, those were the times\", I want this debate to be on the D&aacute;il record.<\/p> <p> I do not know what the tactic of the week will be from the Government.  Will it be to pass the motion and then ignore it or to vote it down?  The Minister might let us know in his reply.  Ultimately, it seems clear this motion will not achieve what we want it to achieve.  At the very least, I hope people know many of us tried.  I want people to know society does not agree with the Government on this.  This utter disgrace is on the Minister.  He knows the findings of the commission's report were inaccurate.  Indeed, he called for an independent review before quietly abandoning it.  The High Court case last year revealed the serious flaws in the report, not to mention the evaluation from the Special Rapporteur on Child Protection and other human rights experts.  That flawed report is the justification for the Minister's disgraceful and exclusionary redress scheme.<\/p> <p> He knows what survivors have gone through.  He knows the scale and breadth of abuses perpetrated against women, children and infants by the State and the church.  Yet, he is imposing arbitrary time limits with no basis in evidence, excluding people who suffered forced family separation, precluding those who were boarded out and choosing to deny the harm caused by forced labour, mistreatment, racial abuse and much more.  His own consultation with the survivors and others, the OAK report, called for a universal, inclusive scheme that recognised the \"loss of the mother child bond and relationship which was reported to be the cause of widespread trauma and mental health issues for many survivors\" and the harm caused by psychological, physical and sexual abuse, including degrading and dehumanising treatment endured in the homes.  The practice of unvetted family placements through adoption, fostering or boarding out was also clearly identified, as well as racial and ethnic discrimination and non-consensual inclusion in medical trials.  Moreover, the United Nations Human Rights Committee and the Special Rapporteur on Child Protection have sought an inclusive scheme that compensates all survivors of this system, with the removal of the time criterion and the legal waiver.  Somehow, the Minister has decided to stick with the criterion of time spent in an institution.  It is unbelievable.<\/p> <p> Today, the Social Democrats are again joining the vast majority of Irish people in asking for accountability.  Is any religious order or pharmaceutical company going to pay a cent to this scheme?  Why is the Minister not pursuing them?  Last week, we learned he is still in negotiations with religious orders.  These are bodies that perpetrated horrific abuses, profited from vulnerable people and conducted unauthorised medical trials.  Why is he not seizing property?  Where are the arrests?  The religious orders, in particular, are responsible for mass graves around the country.  They are complicit in illegal adoptions and illegal vaccine trials, from which they profited.  What is the Minister's response?  It is to talk to them and go cap in hand to them as if it were the 1950s.<\/p> <p>Can the Minister please explain why he cynically and cruelly commissioned a consultation with survivors only to ignore their wishes?  Can he outline why he is purposefully disregarding the UN Human Rights Committee and several special rapporteurs?  They have called for all survivors to receive compensation, the removal of time-based restrictions and the removal of any form of waiver.  In other debates, the Minister has misrepresented the position of UN human rights experts, but their calls are black and white on this.  Can the Minister elaborate on why he has rejected the recommendations of the Joint Committee on Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, which are based on our detailed engagement with survivors, their advocates and human rights experts?  Can he tell us why he is not pursuing religious orders and pharmaceutical companies for every penny they owe survivors and their relatives?  Finally, can the Minister state for the record why he is committed to continuing the systematic abuse of these people?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900007#E00600","speaker":"1525","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666170720,"counter":40,"content":"<p>There are at least three elements to redress, the first of which is acknowledging what happened to those to whom it happened as it is their truth.

That trust was abused, with their own testimonies labelled as \"contaminated\" and \"unreliable\" by the report of the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes.  The commission decided that it alone knew the truth; denying the lived experience of survivors in the official narrative.  It was paternalistic and cruel.  The commission decided there was no evidence of women being forced to enter mother and baby institutions by the church or State authorities; no evidence of forced adoption, racial discrimination or children injured in vaccine trials; and very little evidence of physical abuse.  The report is fundamentally flawed to the point of being an outright attempt to rewrite history.  Yet, the Minister chose to base his redress scheme on that report, excluding people who were boarded out or put into abusive adoptive placements, those who were subjected to vaccine trials and those who spent less than six months there as a child.

He stated that \"children who were in for less than six months would not have been aware of their experiences, would have been too young to remember their experiences.\"  I wonder why we even have maternity leave when one considers that kind of thinking.  Those few months are really critical in human development.  I do not believe the Department understands early childhood trauma because if it did, this would not be put forward.  Those people were not excluded from the scheme due to the lack of understanding; they were excluded because of costs.  It seems like the primary lesson the State has learned in the past is not how to better conduct a redress process, but how to limit the cost to the State.  There is a narrative here.<\/p>  <p>  There were 13 unlicensed vaccine trials carried out on approximately 1,135 children from the institutions.  Pharmaceutical companies like GlaxoSmithKline knew these children were being used as guinea pigs.  They were treated as lesser than children who had parents or guardians to speak up for them and advocate on their behalf.  These companies have an absolute moral responsibility to acknowledge that, even at this at this very late stage.  The idea that redress is not being sought from the religious institutions, or that it is being gingerly sought from them, is just not acceptable.<\/p>  <p>  We might look at the properties that were owned and have been sold recently by the Sisters of Mercy.  They sold more than 45 properties.  A convent based beside Beaumont Hospital was sold to the HSE for &euro;2.7 million.  The State has paid the Sisters of Mercy more than twice as much cash as it received in redress from the previous redress scheme.  Really, there are no exceptions to culpability in what is happening, and that retraumatises people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900009#G00200","speaker":"1489"},{"type":"speech","time":1666170720,"counter":41,"content":"<p>It can become overwhelming when we stop to consider the full enormity of what we are here to discuss today.  That enormity is that for four fifths of just over the 100-year history of this Republic, a collusion of church and State saw fit to incarcerate <i>en masse<\/i>women and girls of all ages and backgrounds, and young working-class boys, who committed no wrong other than to be in the way of a cruel war of morality that was waged upon them.  This same collusion of church and State permitted vaccine trials to be performed on children within their horrid form of care.  The church, with the full facilitation of the State, stole babies from their mothers, often at birth, and sold those children for profit to families in the US, Canada and the United Kingdom, leaving a longing in those mothers that I cannot even begin to comprehend.  The Minister must have met those mothers.  These women went to convents day in, day out asking if they could have their children back.  The Minister must have met them; I have.  We are here today to discuss the form of redress that derived from a report that included, and let me be clear, false incarceration, beatings, medical experimentation and kidnap to name but some.  These were crimes, regardless of who committed them or what cloak of religious order they wore.  These heinous acts are crimes and the Government is saying nobody is culpable.  It is not even close to being acceptable.<\/p><p>More cruel than the fallacy that nobody was to blame for these horrors is the Taoiseach's assertion that society itself was to blame.  Let me challenge that.  That is just an ahistorical version of history that shifts culpability from the State and the church for their very direct complicity in these crimes.  When I say, &quot;the State&quot;, I am very much referencing the same parties with which the Minister is in government today.  The Taoiseach's party, Fianna F&aacute;il, first came to Government in 1932 and although the counterrevolutionary abdication of State responsibility for basic provision to the church had already begun under Fine Gael's forebears in Cumann na nGaedheal, the grip of John Charles McQuaid's Catholic Ireland was strengthened by de Valera&rsquo;s Fianna F&aacute;il.  Society as a whole does not hold or bear responsibility for that.  At no stage were the people of Ireland consulted about the transfer of State provision in health, education and welfare to the church.  They were not consulted.  More than that, society was never consulted and was not an architect in the system of containment that resulted in mother and baby homes, Magdalen laundries, asylums and institutions.  People certainly may have been scared of ending up in one but they were not complicit in that.<\/p><p>At its very basis, that is what these <i>ex gratia<\/i>schemes are about.  This is about the form of history we allow ourselves to tell about the history of Ireland.  It suits the narrative of Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and others to have a very plain, linear narrative in this country with regard to our history that at one point: we took up arms against an overseas oppressor and that was the extent of it.  We can fight over who owns it.  Rather, what did independence mean for the average working-class woman, man and child in this country?  That is what these <i>ex gratia<\/i>schemes are about.  The Government is going to pay women who suffered extraordinary wrongs.  The Government is going to pay them and for that payment, it is going to demand that they seek no more justice or truth.  The absolute antithesis of restorative justice is the retraumatisation of victims.  The Minister has met those victims, as have I.  They are telling the Minister that the system being inflicted on them, whereby they will get paid and must seek no more justice, is cruel.  It is simply not acceptable.  It cannot be.  We have to be better than that.<\/p><p>The Minister has become a custodian of this history because of his place in government at the minute and because of the responsibility that has been laid before him.  We ask the Minister today whether he will become complicit in that.  Does he just become another brick in the wall of that cruel system of containment; that architecture of horror that locked people up who did no wrong <i>en masse<\/i>in this country?  Does he allow them to tell their truth or does he tell them to seek justice or truth no more?  He is a custodian of that now and he gets to be responsible for those histories.<\/p><p>Let me ask the Minister about the children who have been excluded from these schemes because they did not spend six months or longer in the mother and baby homes.  Did those children not suffer forced family separation or disappearance?  Did those children, who are now adults, not suffer psychological trauma and harm?  Did they not also suffer from vaccine experimentation, lack of supervision, the vetting of their families, physical harm and injury?  If a child was in an institution for five months, did he or she not suffer that trauma?  Do they not also get to seek justice and get a form of reparation?<\/p> <p>We have to wrap our arms around the women and children who have suffered in this country, in the true history of this country, not drag them through a system and tell them to be silent.  We have to be better than that.  Our Republic does not emerge while we cover up the horrors of our past.  The Minister is now responsible for that.  I ask him to be better.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900009#G00300","speaker":"1560","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666171320,"counter":43,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to address the issues raised in this motion.  Everyone here will agree that the State, together with the religious congregations, must acknowledge the indisputable wrongs that were visited on the women and children who spent time in mother and baby and county home institutions.  As the Taoiseach said in his apology on behalf of the State in January of last year, they should not have been there and the shame is ours, not theirs.  Throughout my two years in this role, I have worked to progress the State&rsquo;s response to mother and baby institutions, mindful of the decades of complicity and inaction that have marked the State&rsquo;s involvement in mother and baby institutions and their legacy.  I know how deep that legacy runs, and the very personal pain and trauma that so many of our citizens endured.  I have met many survivors over the past two years.  I have had many people approach me and tell me their own experience in institutions, and the impact it has had on them.  The different impacts of time spent in these institutions is impossible to disentangle and there are no easy answers when it comes to trying to remedy the grief and anguish.  For each survivor of these institutions, the experience has had a unique and deeply personal impact.<\/p>  <p>  It is not possible to monetise the suffering or the losses experienced in any payment scheme.  It is also not possible to provide one remedy by way of compensation to all and for all, nor is it sufficient to do so.  The Government&rsquo;s Action Plan for Survivors and Former Residents of Mother and Baby and County Homes Institutions aims to provide an enduring response to the priority needs of all those concerned.  The action plan, which recognises that redress means different things to different people, spans significant commitments across the areas of apology; access to personal information; health supports; financial payments; memorialisation; records, archives and databases; education and research; and dignified burial.  Delivering on these commitments for survivors is a priority for myself and for the Government, with eight of the 22 commitments achieved and intensive work under way on many others.<\/p>  <p>  First and foremost, the Government has ensured that counselling support is available to all survivors free of charge and with prioritised access.  The Birth Information and Tracing Act 2022 became law in June, and from 3 October statutory information and tracing services under the Act opened, guaranteeing people a long overdue legal right of access to their birth and early life information.  After two decades of promises, this Government has finally delivered full and unredacted access to identity rights for adopted people and those who were boarded out.  In the first two weeks, over 4,000 applications have been received under the new Act.  In July the Institutional Burials Act 2022 also became law, and the Government approved my proposal to establish an independent office to lead an intervention at the site of the former mother and baby institution in Tuam.  The treatment of children&rsquo;s remains in Tuam is a stain on our national conscience.  My hope is that this process will deliver answers that can bring some solace to the families who have been so deeply affected by this abhorrent situation.  In March, the Government approved proposals for a national centre for research and remembrance.  The centre will stand as a site of conscience, and will be a national memorial to honour equally all those who were resident in mother and baby homes, industrial schools, reformatories, Magdalen laundries and related institutions.  It will comprise a museum and exhibition space; a research centre and repository of records related to institutional trauma in the 20th century, which will form part of the national archives; and a place for reflection and remembrance.  The site for this centre, at Se&aacute;n MacDermott Street, has already been transferred from Dublin City Council to the Office of Public Works.<\/p>  <p>  Deputies will also be aware that I secured Government approval last week for the Mother and Baby Institutions Payment Scheme Bill.  Following its publication by the Bills Office, I will present this to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann next week.  The scheme set out in the Bill, which is the largest of its kind in the history of the State, is nevertheless just one element of the overall Government response.  The redress scheme proposed goes far beyond what the commission proposed, and, indeed, what was proposed by the interdepartmental group established to draw together a scheme.  The commission recommended that pregnant women who entered mother and baby homes or county home institutions before 1974 would be eligible.  We have gone beyond that recommendation, to ensure that the scheme includes all women who were resident in an institution at any point.  The commission recommended that only children who were unaccompanied in a mother and baby home or county home institution would be eligible for a payment.  We have gone beyond that recommendation, and the scheme will now include all children who were resident in a mother and baby home or county home institution for more than six months.  The commission recommended a scheme in which 6,500 people would benefit, at a total cost of &euro;400 million.  We have gone substantially beyond that.  The proposals contained in the State scheme will benefit 34,000 people, at a total cost of &euro;800 million.  Some 19,000 former residents will receive enhanced medical cards.  It will be, in terms of numbers of beneficiaries, the largest redress scheme in the history of the State, recognising the huge impact of these institutions on Irish society.<\/p>  <p>  For children who spent very short periods of time in an institution during their infancy, the Government&rsquo;s action plan provides a response to their needs through the Birth Information and Tracing Act and the investment which has been made in new services under that Act.  The legislation provides guaranteed access to birth certificates, as well as wider birth and early life information for those who have questions about their origins.  This is the overwhelming priority need which has been expressed by people who as children were adopted or otherwise separated from their birth family.  The Act also supports contact and family reunion by establishing a statutory tracing service and a contact preference register.<\/p>  <p>  Since the Government approved the institutional payments scheme proposals, I have made further enhancements.  I have improved the overall payments approach by introducing more refined payment bands that will benefit many applicants to the scheme.  Previously, a person who was in an institution for five years and one month would have received the same payment as a person who was there for five years and 11 months.  Under the new banded system, the person who was in the institution for five years and 11 months will receive a proportionately higher payment, recognising the longer period.  I have also introduced a feature in the calculation process that will include periods of temporary absence of up to 180 days in the records of some applicants, enabling a more just approach for those impacted.  It would be unjust to deny or limit access to the scheme on the basis that a person was absent from the instruction because they spent time in a hospital as a result of an illness contracted due to the appalling conditions in the institution.  The scheme will recognise harsh conditions, emotional abuse and all other forms of harm, mistreatment, stigma and trauma experienced while resident in a mother and baby home or county home institution.  However, in keeping with the views of survivors as expressed in the consultation process, the scheme will be non-adversarial with a low burden of proof.  Applicants will not have to bring forward evidence of abuse, harm or mistreatment in order to benefit from the scheme.  Rather, a general payment approach, based on time spent, will allow the State to shoulder the burden of proof and seek to ensure this scheme causes no further harm or trauma.<\/p>  <p>  I am acutely aware of the need to deliver this scheme as swiftly as possible so that benefits can be accessed by many thousands of survivors and former residents.  As the Bill travels through the Houses, I know I can count on the goodwill and good intent from all Deputies and Senators so that we can complete the legislative process promptly.  In parallel with finalising the legislation, the significant work required to establish the scheme is under way.  This work includes establishing an independent executive office, based out of my Department, to respond to applications and administer the payments.  I want to assure survivors that we will be doing everything in our power to deliver the scheme as quickly as possible and to prioritise applications from older and more vulnerable survivors.<\/p>  <p>  In closing, I would like to pay tribute to the immense resilience, courage, patience and constructive engagement of survivors and their supporters as the Government continues to work though these complex issues.  No amount of money, legislation or memorialisation can ever truly undo the hurt that was done by these institutions.  However, by vindicating the identity of people who were adopted or subject to illegal birth registration, by ensuring that the remains of the children buried at Tuam receive a respectful reburial and by bringing forward a payment scheme that will benefit 34,000 former residents, we are humbly acknowledging the State&rsquo;s duty to atone for these appalling wrongs and seeking to rebuild the relationship of trust with the people who were so grievously wronged.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900010#H00200","speaker":"1477"},{"type":"speech","time":1666171320,"counter":44,"content":"<p>Every parent knows about milestones in their children's first two years.  They know about the importance of them.  <\/p> <p>They know when they are meant to hit particular developmental targets.  They await the targets anxiously and burst with pride when their children meet the targets.  This is ingrained into every parent but it is also ingrained into every children's medical specialist.  It is through these milestones and timelines that we can ascertain how a child is developing, whether there are any difficulties or issues and how the child is growing.  These milestones are based on science, evidence and clinical evidence.  The Minister has created another milestone with this redress scheme.  It is an arbitrary milestone that is not based on any science or evidence.  It goes against every single bit of scientific knowledge that we have about children's development.  It also flies in the face of Government policy.<\/p> <p> By excluding children under six months from this scheme, the Minister is essentially saying that what happens in the first six months of their lives does not matter.  He said, \"children who were in for less than six months would not have been aware of their experiences, would have been too young to remember their experiences.\"  That goes against everything we know.  If one looks at the HSE website, one will be informed that by the age of one month, children are starting to develop socially and emotionally.  Babies are getting to know you and to bond.  By the age of three months, they give warm smiles and laugh.  They enjoy looking at your face.  By the age of six months, they get upset when they cannot see their main caregivers.  The Minister is saying that does not count and does not matter.  He said that people can essentially do what they want to babies under six months of age, because they will not remember and it will not make any difference to them.  The Minister launched the First 5 programme, which states that \"Time together with parents especially in the first year\" is so important for children.  It does not refer to time with parents in the seventh to 12th months, but to the first year, because it is based on science.  I have serious concerns about a Minister with responsibility for children who does not understand the developmental and psychological needs of children.<\/p> <p> The Minister's policies for the redress scheme are contradictory to his other policies and to what we know about childhood trauma.  It is not that this has not been raised with the Minister.  A group of psychologists contacted him to explain this to him and to say that everything he is doing with this is wrong.  As a public representative, and particularly as a mother, I know that this is retraumatising.  I know and science knows how important those six months are.  The Minister is saying those six months do not matter.  I do not understand how he can completely ignore experts, scientific advice and his own policy in this regard.<\/p> <p> The Minister needs to go back to look at this scheme again.  He cannot exclude people based on that six-month rule.  Not only is he excluding their experiences within those six months, but he is also completely ignoring what happened to them after the six months, with the shame, the trauma, the fear of not knowing what their future held, and the sense of isolation and feeling alone due to not knowing who their mother was and not knowing what their names are.  That would stay with people whether they were in the home for six months or for six years.  The Minister is ignoring that.  He will retraumatise many survivors.  Some 40% of survivors were in a home for less than six months.<\/p> <p> I want to make a point about the Minister's speech.  He said all the right things.  I listened and said to myself that he gets it.  We need to see the Minister do the right things.  What is written in the speech does not matter if he does not put this into action and make sure that all survivors are heard when it comes to this issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900010#H00300","speaker":"1627","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666171920,"counter":46,"content":"<p>I thank my colleague Deputy Cairns for tabling this motion.  I will take up the point that Deputy Whitmore made.  It is profoundly worrying and disturbing that the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth and the Minister do not seem to understand the importance of the early stages of childhood development up to five or six months.  One would have thought that, of all the Departments, such an understanding would be ingrained in the thinking of the Minister's Department.  When we meet children of homeless families who are in emergency accommodation, we see what a profound impact a number of months can have on them in their early development.  It can cause childhood trauma and have an impact throughout their lives.  For that not to be fully acknowledged and understood by the Department and the Minister is disturbing and worrying.  In the Minister's comments today, he spoke about how children who were resident in mother and baby homes for more than six months would be included.  He said that children who spent very short periods in an institution would be excluded.  To dismiss four, five or six months as a very short period in infancy is wrong.  It is a long time in a child's development, not a short time.  That is something fundamental, which we all need to understand and recognise.<\/p>  <p>  This was an opportunity to do the right thing and to cast away the shameful practices of the past, when the voices of survivors of mother and baby homes were not fully listened to.  It was an opportunity to break with the power structures that treated people as if they were invisible, to end the grave injustice that was done to thousands of survivors, and to end the practice of othering, shaming and excluding people.  It was an opportunity to treat people with the dignity and respect that they deserve, as equal citizens of this Republic, and to respect their human rights and fundamental dignity.  It is disappointing that the opportunity to do that has not been taken.  This excludes people from a redress scheme when mother and baby homes were all about exclusion, segregating people from Irish society, making them invisible and putting them in a place where they would not be seen in the hope that they would be out of sight and out of mind for mainstream society.<\/p>  <p>  The redress scheme is trying to tackle some of the harmful effects of that societal exclusion and segregation.  To exclude people is fundamentally wrong.  I do not know how the Government can stand over that exclusion, especially when this redress scheme should be seeking to address, to some degree, some of the harmful effects of people being excluded and segregated.  The thinking where people are excluded, put out of sight and out of mind, is continued in the thought process of the redress scheme.  People were exploited by the fact that they were segregated from society.  They were exploited through forced family separation, kidnappings, forced medical trials and forced vaccination trials without consent.  Assault is another abuse that happened.  The segregation and exclusion were exploited and to carry on with them is shameful.<\/p>  <p>  We did not hear from the Minister about why the June 2021 commitment to appoint an international human rights expert to re-examine the testimony given to the mother and baby homes inquiry was dropped.  We and every survivor deserve to hear a full explanation of why that was dropped.  The commitment that was given needs to be reinstated and acted on by the Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900011#J00200","speaker":"1550"},{"type":"speech","time":1666171920,"counter":47,"content":"<p>I thank the Social Democrats for tabling this motion and giving us an opportunity to discuss the mother and baby institutions redress scheme.<\/p> <p>The make up of the scheme is very disappointing.  It is exclusionary rather than inclusive.  People who were resident in mother and baby institutions for six months or less are deeply disappointed and distressed to find out that they remain excluded from the scheme.  Inclusion and equality are clearly missing from the proposed scheme.  It seems to be more about achieving reduced costs and reduced liability.  What it has achieved is an increased mistrust among survivors, which was already high as a direct result of their appalling treatment by successive Governments.  Provisions seeking to deny or limit liability by the State or other private entities should not be included in this legislation or in the payment scheme.  It is simply not good enough.  It is time for this Government to respect all mother and baby home survivors and families.  <\/p> <p> It is also vitally important that the relevant religious congregations and pharmaceutical organisations do not avoid accountability.  They must contribute significant finances to fund the scheme.  Substantive recourse from these bodies needs to be insisted upon immediately.  It is time that religious institutions and pharmaceutical companies are forced to compensate survivors for the harm and suffering they caused.  <\/p> <p> There is no recognition of the hurtful trauma experienced by children separated at birth from their mothers.  The exclusion of children resident in a home for less than six months is a dereliction of the State&rsquo;s responsibility to all survivors.  The recommendations and views shared by survivors conducted by Oak Consulting have been largely ignored.  The concerns raised by Dr. Niall Muldoon, Special Rapporteur on Child Protection, in a report commissioned by the Minister are not reflected in the redress plans either.  The UN special rapporteur, UN Human Rights Committee and UN human rights experts have individually called for appropriate compensation, removal of legal waivers and for any scheme to address child victims of racial discrimination within Irish institutions from 1940 until the 1990s.  These calls have also been largely ignored.  This is totally unacceptable.  It is time to change the redress scheme to meet the needs of survivors and families.  <\/p> <p> What this current scheme does is effectively create a hierarchy of suffering.  We know the majority of survivors spent six months or less in a mother and baby home or county home.  The commission&rsquo;s authors state this.  The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC, is calling for the legislation to be amended to remove the requirement of a six-month stay to ensure that all children who were resident in a relevant institution and-or were adopted are eligible to apply to the scheme.  <\/p> <p> The Minister's rowing back on appointing a human rights expert to examine testimony given to the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes is unacceptable.  The Irish Council for Civil Liberties wrote to the Minister setting out exactly why this is essential.  The Minister has once again ignored this plea.  Instead he has opted to introduce a new initiative to support survivors to tell their personal stories so that they can be formally recorded and accepted as part of the official record.  <\/p> <p> While we welcome the development of a national site of remembrance and interpretation, as proposed for Se&aacute;n MacDermott Street, new testimony will not remedy the problem that came to light in June 2021 that the vast majority of the evidence given by survivors to the commission was not effectively considered.  An independent examination of the testimony given to the commission is vital to ensure justice is done because a human rights legal expert will be able properly to assess whether there is evidence of human rights abuse and potentially crimes that must be investigated in the original testimony given by survivors.  <\/p> <p> The gathering of stories outside of a formal legal process does not meet Ireland&rsquo;s human rights obligations to ensure truth, justice and accountability under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, ICCPR, the European Convention on Human Rights, ECHR, and our Constitution&rsquo;s protection of due process and fair procedures.  No justice can be delivered if the evidence never comes to light or is maintained in a parallel system of evidence gathered outside a formal legal process.<\/p> <p> All those affected need to be treated equally and fairly regardless of how long they spent in an institution.  It does not matter what age a person was when he or she was removed from their families.  It has had an impact on him or her.  The Government must respect all mother and baby home survivors and families.  It must change the redress scheme to meet the needs of all survivors and families and it must force religious institutions and pharmaceutical companies to contribute significant finances for the compensation of survivors and families.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900011#J00300","speaker":"1513","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666172520,"counter":49,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputies for tabling the motion and giving us the opportunity to debate an incredibly important issue.  It had not been my intention to speak but I looked for time to speak on behalf of two of my constituents.  Many of my constituents are victims.  As the Minister knows, there are many victims, many of whom will be excluded.  One is a man who thinks he is aged 79; he does not know exactly how old he is because his records have been falsified.  He lives in Balbriggan.  He wants to know who he is and where he came from and who his family is - all the basic information that we take for granted.  He tells me that he felt as though he was shoved to one side, put in a box so that people could not see him, would not hear from him and would not have to think about where he was from or the circumstances of his birth.  He talks of the shame associated with coming from the county home and how he was viewed by other people in his community.  The other constituent is also a man.  I will not name either of them because God knows they have been treated badly enough without parading their names through the House.  He showed me his arms and some of his side where he had been injected as a baby and there had been some sort of infection.  Arising out of that he was left permanently scarred.  This is a man in his 50s.  He talks about the shame, the exclusion and the feeling of being outside and wanting to be brought inside and feeling that society wanted to other him and put him somewhere out of sight.  That gets right to the heart of what is missing from the scheme.  The fact is that 70% of survivors effectively stayed for six months or less and that means they are going to be excluded.  That is a huge number of people whom the Minister claims he wants to help, does not want to ignore and wants to support, who are in fact going to be excluded.  That is shameful.  He can address that.  I would give him the benefit of the doubt actually.  I would not say he is unaware of the importance of the first six months of a child's life.  I would say he is acutely aware of its importance and that makes what he is doing worse.  He is not ignorant of what he is doing.  He is doing it to limit the cost and because it is politically expedient to do it.  He is also doing it so that he can stand in the House and say that something is being done when he knows that effectively people are going to be excluded.

The fact that claims are still to based on length of time rather than the degree of abuse or other factors is worrying.  The most recent revelation regarding the pharmaceutical tests is also worrying.  Those horrific practices have been part of the recent past too.

There were 5,882 children in care at that time with 90% in foster care and 450 in residential care, yet recently in the budget there was no increase of any significant amount for the foster carers who shore up the system and keep it afloat.  The State has a duty to all those who by accident of birth found or find themselves in desperate circumstances.  I also want to refer to - and the students who are here from the Intermediate School in Killorglin will be interested to hear about - the boarded-out children.

James was aged eight and Michael was seven.  The State had a duty of care to these children but sent them to work and allowed them to work in servitude.  \"You are here to work\", they were told.  They were sent to a house that had no lighting and no heating.  They were not properly fed. <\/p> <p>There were not adequate inspections.  James said he was physically and sexually abused over many years.  He was then failed by social workers.  His school and Kerry County Council declined him a grant for further education.  That is the legacy of the State.<br\/><br\/>James went to Hammersmith and made a life for himself in England but Michael was not so fortunate.  He suffered with addiction and mental health issues and was found dead in Crystal Palace, south London in 1993.  <br\/><br\/>Later in life, James was forgotten by every redress system.  He was not recognised and was denied a full Garda investigation.  At every hand&rsquo;s turn, he was told, &quot;There is nothing we can do.&quot;  There is still no apology and nothing for those children who were boarded out.  Having listened to James, why is he still being ignored?  Back in January 2021, the Minister said that people have waited too long for recognition.  He stated:<\/p><blockquote>\t...the State will engage with empathy, humility and generosity with those who were wronged [and] will strive to rebuild the trust so grievously shattered. <\/blockquote> <p>James is asking still to this day to put an end to this &quot;eternal atonement&quot;, as he calls it, and an end to the turbulence in his life.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900012#K00300","speaker":"1488","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666173120,"counter":52,"content":"<p>As the Minister knows, I am on the Joint Committee on Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth with Deputy Cairns.

I am on the committee that was tasked with the pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bill.

I met several survivors and it was very traumatising for me to hear their experience, and I was not the person who had to through the experience that they had to.<\/p><p>Their experiences must be validated.  The exclusion from the redress scheme of infants who spent less than six months in a mother and baby home tells me that survivors have not been listened to.  This is one of the things that survivors called for.  Infants were taken from their mothers; they were stolen and, in some cases, they were shipped overseas.  The Government is effectively telling these children that their forced separation and suffering is not worthy of compensation and telling women that their suffering will not be validated.  This is an absolute scandal.  <\/p><p>Will the Minister explain the rationale as to why children will only receive a general payment if they were in an institution for six months or longer?  We heard an expert witness testimony at the committee as well who stated: &quot;All who passed through mother and baby homes have been affected and these experiences will have shaped and influenced childhood and adult development.&quot;  That is regardless of whether someone spent one day, six months or six years in a home.  She continued:<\/p> <blockquote> \t...the impact is still relevant and applicable.  It is not about the time which someone spent in one of these homes; it is about the quality and nature of the experiences there.  Indeed, children who experienced this at six months or younger are arguably the most affected because of the experiences around brain development and growth at that time.   <\/blockquote>  <p>This is not from me; I am not an expert.

Unfortunately, they should not have had to do this.  We are coming back here time and time again.  My colleague, Deputy Funchion, tabled a motion some months ago quite similar to this.  We keep coming back to the same issue, which is that this legislation is exclusionary.  Even at this stage, we are excluding people.  We have to stop and think what we are doing.  When some of these horrific things were done to these children and mothers, some people can proclaim that they did not have full knowledge so they did not know.  However, now we have the full knowledge and we know what we are doing.  We have to go back and do this right.<\/p>  <p>  The particular thing that sticks in my neck is the fact that we are saying that babies under six months of age do not matter and what happened to them in those six months does not matter.  Yet, we have all kinds of evidence now and everything else to say that the first six months, and even before that, of a child&rsquo;s life is crucially important.  What happened to these babies in the first six months of their lives is important.  We need to stand up and acknowledge that it is important.  We need to show how important it is by doing the right thing in this situation.  It is crazy; it is just six months.  Why not seven, five or eight months?  It has to stop here today.  I hope that the motion will have the effect of stopping that.  It is past time to respect all of the mother and baby home survivors and their families. <\/p>  <p>  The people who are watching this debate today who spent less than six months in these institutions are adults now.  They are mothers, fathers, brothers, sisters, grandmothers and grandfathers.  They all have children as well who are impacted.  We have an intergenerational impact from what has happened to these babies.  That is why we have a responsibility.  Those are the ones who survived.  When we talk about this, we always have to remember the ones who did not survive, such as the 796 children who died in Tuam and whose lives were taken away.  We have to remember them. <\/p>  <p>  I want to acknowledge Seosaimh Mulchrone from Aughagower, Westport, County Mayo who was born in a mother and baby home and has climbed Croagh Patrick seven times this year to remember those children because he needed to make sure that they are not forgotten and the suffering that they and others went through is not forgotten.

However, it has come to the stage where I kind of dread getting up here and talking about mother and baby homes because so many of the people who were excluded from our society back in the dark old days of the State are still being excluded by the Government&rsquo;s proposals.  At the time of their first exclusion, their behaviour was perhaps too high a price for our prim and proper society and our respectability - we had our own morality police stalking the streets - even if that behaviour was sometimes just getting raped.  Now they are being excluded again.  Their inclusion is too high a price financially for a Government that goes to great lengths to present itself as righting wrongs.  In truth, it is underwriting the wrongs done to these women and their children in its bullheadedness in reducing costs and liability for the State.<\/p>  <p>  I told the Minister previously that he drew short straw.  He and his party have had to clean up the way successive Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael Governments put away women and children.  Now, when the State has a chance to look after them, the stooges in their Departments are looking at the liability instead.  There are billions of euro to splash around in overruns and billions to euro given to the private sector to provide public services, but there is not enough money for the women and children who were abused by the State.  This must change immediately. <\/p>  <p>  The exclusion of children in an institution for less than six months is not just neglect; it is vindictive.  It is completely lacking the understanding of the early days of a child&rsquo;s life.  The last time I spoke on this I told the Minister about Mary, who spent less than six months in Bessborough.  Her mother took her home, but she was called names all through school.  She was reminded that her mother had her outside marriage, as if that was something shocking.  She left her village and never told a single person about her earlier life.  She asked me to ask the Minister a question last time about the babies aged under six months in Tuam and whether the Government would bother to exhume them or not or just leave them in the septic tank.  It was a rhetorical question and she was not expecting an answer.  However, the Minister replied in his summary, which shows that it just did not hit home for him.<\/p>  <p>  The commission&rsquo;s authors state that 70% stayed six months or less.  This means Mary was not alone.  No money can ever compensate for the trauma.  No sum of money, millions or billions of euro, can ever make up for the separation of child from his or her loving and devastated mother.  However, as a mere token of remorse and sorrow in a desire to restore, money can recognise the wrong that was done.  <\/p>  <p>  Drawing the short straw does not get the Minister off the hook.<\/p> <p>He has to be able to take on the protection of the <i>status quo<\/i>in his Department.

I note the motion put forward by that party on 24 February 2021, to which the Labour Party tabled an amendment relating to medical cards.  The amendment was accepted and the motion, as amended, agreed to by the House.  The amendment called on the Government to issue an enhanced medical card to all survivors who presented to mother and baby homes for any length of time, including while pregnant or on a post-natal basis.  That motion has been passed by the D&aacute;il.  With the announcement of the scheme, there now seems to be a rowing back on that democratic position that was taken.<\/p><p>In the context of the publication of the questions and answers document relating to the mother and baby institutions payment scheme, it is important that we convey to people that the scheme is not up and running and that it requires the Mother and Baby Institutions Payment Scheme Bill 2022 to be passed before it comes into operation.  Many Deputies are being contacted by people who think the scheme is up and running and it is important that a message goes out to clarify that it is not yet in operation.  The publication of the questions and answers paper has given the impression that the scheme is in place.  There is a need to clarify for the public, especially survivors, that it is not yet in existence.<\/p><p>Like everybody else, I am perplexed as to why there is such an arbitrary cut-off point with regard to babies below six months of age.  I can only surmise that the Minister and the Department have put some quantifiable monetary value on the cost of compensation or redress that would significantly increase the overall cost beyond &euro;800 million that is allocated.  I can think of no other reason the Government would act in such an arbitrary way in respect of babies aged less than six months.  The Minister stated: <\/p> <blockquote> \tThe commission recommended a scheme in which 6,500 people would benefit, at a total cost of &euro;400 million.  We have gone substantially beyond that.  The proposals contained in the State scheme will benefit 34,000 people, at a total cost of &euro;800 million.  Some 19,000 former residents will receive enhanced medical cards. <\/blockquote>  <p>If I am interpreting the scheme correctly - I am open to correction in that regard - the Minister is saying that for mothers who spent less than three months in a mother and baby home or a county home institution it is &euro;5,000, for mothers who spent between three and six months it is &euro;10,000, and there is then a &euro;1,500 work payment for mothers who qualify in that regard.  That means the total amount for those who qualify for the general payment and the work payment is &euro;11,500.  What I am trying to convey, possibly awkwardly, is that I do not understand the quantum for babies between birth and six months and whether there is a value put on that.  When I say &quot;value&quot;, I am asking whether the Government kicked the tyres from a financial perspective when it was doing the financial calculations and came up with a figure of &euro;800 million.  How much extra would it have cost the State to include babies between birth and six months?  I am not an accountant and I do not want to sound like one.  Ultimately, the point I am making is that the fact that a person spent a period in one of these institutions should, morally and ethically, be sufficient for the person to, at least, be given some recognition by way of redress for that period.<\/p><p>The Minister will present his Bill in the week of 26 October.  There is still a sword of Damocles hanging over us in the context of the testimony of people who presented to the confidential committee.  Respectfully, that has not yet been fully addressed by the Minister.  He has stated previously that he is going to create an archive but it adds insult to injury if people who have presented to the confidential committee are now being told that testimony will be archived and housed elsewhere.  There must be all sorts of difficulties in respect of the general data protection regulation, GDPR, and the ethics or lack of ethics when it comes to taking all of that information and putting it into an archive without going back to each person who presented to that confidential committee.  They rightly feel aggrieved that their testimony was not treated with the respect it deserved.  There are issues in that regard that still need to be dealt with in the context of the Bill that will be brought before us.  I suspect that much play will made by members of the Opposition in respect of that issue because we cannot hive it off; we need to deal with it face on.  We in opposition have consistently said that our generation of politicians needs to deal with this issue as comprehensively as possible.  It is one of the issues that must be addressed.  <\/p><p>The issue of GSK, formerly GlaxoSmithKline, has not yet been put to bed either.  Dare I deign to give the Minister advice on what he should do?  If I was in his position, I would call in GSK and tell the company that it needs to do more than apologise.  I refer to the lack of ethics shown.  This company still exists and all it has done is given an apology.  There would be a moral obligation and responsibility on any pharmaceutical company to deal with an issue such as this.  In the context of the vaccine trials alone, there also needs to be a greater degree of accountability and culpability from the religious institutions.  I am repeating points that have been well made to the Minister.  He will be acutely aware of all this and I know he will have internalised all of these complexities in his own thinking on the Bill that will come before us.  However, I ask him not to forget that there is a moral obligation on companies such as GSK, particularly where they are IDA Ireland clients and have been the beneficiaries of significant supports from the State through the years.  They have a moral obligation and there is leverage on the part of the Government to be able to flex its muscles in that regard.<\/p><p>The Labour Party supports the motion wholeheartedly and thanks the Social Democrats - I nearly said &quot;the Progressive Democrats&quot; - for bringing it forward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900014#M00300","speaker":"1514"},{"type":"speech","time":1666173720,"counter":58,"content":"<p>I thank the Social Democrats for tabling the motion.  It will be a comfort to survivors and campaigners that these issues are again being raised in the D&aacute;il.  There is an attempt by the Minister and the Government to say that outstanding issues and concerns of survivors have been dealt with, but that is not the case.  It is a gross injustice that these issues are outstanding.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to briefly address three of the outstanding issues and how painful they are, and show how the State continues to fail survivors and the women involved.  First, there is the redress scheme and what we know of it.  It continues to look like the work of a cold-hearted accountant whose chief job is to minimise the cost to the State.  I hope I am wrong in that regard and that when it is debated in the House, the Minister will have listened to the women and survivors and experts and designed a scheme that does not draw an arbitrary line at six months spent in an institution or ignore those who were farmed out as forced labour, in effect, or suffered additional trauma from abuse as a result of their colour or ethnicity.  By insisting on this, the Government is ignoring expert advice and the needs of thousands of people directly affected by the legacy of these institutions.<\/p>  <p>The Minister said the design of the scheme was based on a cold calculation of time spent in institutions and would ensure that survivors did not have to face a re-trauma of being called in and asked questions.  That is very good but what about those who do not qualify and who have suffered trauma because of that, and believe me they do?  The Minister needs to understand that their exclusion is re-traumatising.  It is unconscionable and must be addressed.<\/p> <p> The second issue is on the cost of the scheme.  It may cost &euro;800 million in total, with some 34,000 survivors being eligible but I question these figures and many have.  I want to ask where the religious order and institutions are in their contribution to this.  My argument here is not about saving the State money but is a fundamental issue of justice, redress and atonement for the wrong that was done.<\/p> <p> I make no apology for repeating what I said last year.  Those who bear particular responsibility for those centres, particularly the religious orders who ran them, should be made to pay for what they did.  The Bon Secours Sisters ran the Tuam home.  That order is now the second largest provider of private healthcare in the State, with revenue in 2019 of &euro;314 million, including &euro;5 million in public funding.  In 2019, the HSE gave out more than &euro;1.3 billion in public funding to services owned by five religious-owned healthcare facilities.  In 2021, well over 90% of primary schools and a large majority of secondary schools remained under the control of the Catholic Church.  Rather than giving them a slap on the wrist and a packet of public money, we should be seizing the assets of religious orders to fund the redress properly for all victims and move towards fully separating church and State.<\/p> <p> My final point is tied to this.  In designing the scheme as it stands, in ignoring the promise to have the testimonies reviewed by an independent expert and in refusing to expunge or amend the insulting passages and narrative of the commission&rsquo;s report, the State and the Government are compounding the injury and historic injustices done.  As with the failure to seek contributions from the religious orders to pay for the redress scheme, they add insult to injury by leaving unchallenged the official account of what has happened and leaving the gross and multiple inaccuracies contained in the report to stand.<\/p> <p> The overwhelming impression of that report was that society and everyone in society was responsible for what happened in these institutions, and equally responsible.  As someone said at the time, if everyone is responsible then no one is responsible and we have reached the logical conclusion here of that narrative.  This is a redress scheme that seeks nothing from the orders who ran the homes, with a neutral and frankly inane promise to hear the testimonies again, but without any idea of restorative justice or holding the church and State to account.  We essentially end up with the State shrugging its shoulders and saying it happened, so let us move on.<\/p> <p> These institutions, the deaths in them, the forced labour camps, the beatings, the humiliations and the abuse did not just happen.  It was not the natural outplay of a society at the time; these were worked for, planned for, defended, known at the time and justified by both the church and the State.  They were resisted and fought against at the time by some by some women and children and even by many on the outside.  Even some civil servants campaigned against them.  Those who saw and knew and implemented what was happening were responsible and need to be made accountable and that is the church and the State. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900014#M00400","speaker":"1486","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666174320,"counter":60,"content":"<p>I want to talk about the mother and baby homes and the vaccine trials.  According to reports, there were more than 1,000 babies and young children involved in these vaccine trials, that is 1,135 persons.  Those babies and young children were taken from six mother and baby homes including Bessborough in Cork city.  This happened between 1930 and 1973.  There was no parental consent.  The babies and young children were tested in these trials for vaccines relating to diphtheria, measles and four-in-one vaccines.  Some of their mothers at the time of the trials were suffering from real mental health and psychiatric issues, and some of the children were Down&rsquo;s syndrome children.  The mothers were not present at the trials and the trials were in breach of the regulatory and ethical standards of the time.  Those babies and young children were guinea pigs and there were real financial benefits from the companies which worked with the orders to organise those trials.<\/p>  <p>  In passing, I make the point on the window that this provides into the reality of capitalism that would put profit above all else and use children in these vaccine trials without the consent of their parents in this way.  The companies involved in the trials were Glaxo and Wellcome, companies which merged to form GlaxoSmithKline in 2000.  That company has not paid one penny of compensation.  Can the Minister say if that company has been asked for compensation?  Has he called them in and asked them for compensation in this case?  This company or companies have received large sums of money from this State in grant aid, where the IDA has been mentioned and so on, down through the years.  It should make a very significant contribution to this redress fund.

The discovery of 796 babies buried in a mass grave is something that shocked the world.  This watershed moment came when the very diligent work of Catherine Corless, a researcher, revealed what was happening in the site and what had happened in the past.<\/p>  <p>  Over the years since I became a Deputy, I have met with and spoken to members of families who have had children or siblings there, or whose mothers were there in the Tuam home.  I have also spoken to survivors of the home and have met some of the finest people that one would ever like to meet.<\/p>  <p>  They built a resilience in themselves but at this stage they are beginning to tire because, when the discovery was made, there was an expectation that things would happen.  I grant that former Minister, Ms Zappone, the current Minister&rsquo;s predecessor, and the Minister himself have done enormous work in trying to get things done and it takes time to get things done.  The redress scheme which is in place - I am receiving this feedback from many people representing mothers, babies and survivors, including the Tuam Mother and Baby Home Alliance - is one where there are issues which are not sitting comfortably with them.<\/p>  <p>  The first thing people said to me when we had all of the discovery as to what happened in Tuam and in other places across the country was that the State should apologise.  The State has apologised.<\/p>  <p>  People were then talking about looking for supports to help people who had mental issues, were traumatised, and this trauma was re-visited on them when these events came into the public domain again.  Many discoveries were made in families as a result of the good work Catherine Corless did.<\/p>  <p>  There are three areas which are of serious concern.  The first one, as one survivor said to me, is where these people had to serve their time of six months before they would be included in the scheme, as if one had to do one's apprenticeship first.  The way it was put to me, which I believe is a good way, is that it is not so much how long one spent there, but what one's experience was when there.  How did the person suffer and get on when in there and what legacy issues have been left with that person?<\/p> <p>I do not think that is time-related.  It is an experience, whether someone was a month or six years in a mother and baby home.  There is something here that we need to address very urgently so that anybody who was in a mother and baby home will be considered to have had an experience for which they need support, which is a mild way of putting it, rather than cutting it after six months and saying they needed to have served that amount of time to get into a scheme.  That is creating division and creating two tiers among people who are survivors or their families.  That is very important.<\/p> <p> I want to stress the area of medical trials.  I note there were 13 vaccine trials over that period and over 43,000 children in Ireland were used for these trials, of whom almost 1,200 were from the mother and baby homes.  In my estimation, we have had a lot of discussion in the last couple of weeks since the budget was announced around a levy on the construction industry to pay for the sins of people and of quarries that had the bad materials that caused mica or pyrite issues.  However, we are not talking about a levy on anybody to try to pay for the redress scheme that is coming.  It is important that we look at that.  I think the Minister would get full support from across the House if a levy was put on the pharma industry to make sure it paid something towards what happened in the past.  That would be more palatable than putting a levy on blocks and concrete at this time.<\/p> <p> I know the Minister is talking to the religious orders.  It is important that the discussions are concluded and the orders demonstrate in a tangible way that they are going to contribute towards the redress scheme - that it is not just talk and a soft landing.  There are people who would say they have plenty of money.  I do not know whether they have but I know they have plenty of property.  At a time when we are looking for places in which to house people, they can be of enormous benefit to the State and they would also be doing something that would compensate for the ills of the past.<\/p> <p> Looking to the future, no more than the situation in the construction industry, given the ills and how things went wrong in the past, the question is how we make sure things like this do not happen again.  It is also about how we educate our children.  I know the Tuam Mother and Baby Home Alliance is working with the university to try to create a teaching programme for today's children in order to educate them on what happened in the past and make sure it does not happen in the future.  To be transparent is very important.<\/p> <p> I have no doubt the Minister's efforts are 100% focused on getting things done, and done right.  In my discussions with him, he is very much engaged and knows exactly what is going on.  I appreciate all of that.  However, there are a few things that we need to look at.  It is not political or anything like that, but survivors need to know that they have the Minister&rsquo;s backing, whether they were a day, a week, a month, six years or ten years in these mother and baby homes.  I will leave it at that.

I do not know what is wrong with our departmental system that we cannot come up with sensitive and timely schemes.  The six-month requirement is as if people were on six months&rsquo; probation, and if people were not there longer than that, they are out.  That is very strange to me.<\/p>  <p>  We need to conclude the negotiations with the religious institutions.  I remember that Michael Woods, as Minister, made the first arrangements with them and, in fairness to the religious institutions, they have been getting bashed ever since, up and down the street.  They were badly needed when they were there.  Did everything go right?  No.  Were they all bad?  No, and some great work was done there.  We need to draw a line under this and stop bashing them and blaming them for everything else.<\/p>  <p>  The victims, the people who suffered, must be the centrepiece here.

We saw the near-calamitous issue in Killarney recently, where the system was transporting bus loads of people &ndash; in fact, I am not sure how they were going to be transported.  This was a group of newcomers who had settled into the area and then, all of a sudden, at the stroke of a pen, they were sending them to Mayo.  We do not seem to have learned.  Now, we have one of the most vicious and pernicious abortion regimes of any country in the world.  What trauma is that going to have on women going forward?

On 16 November 2021, the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth published details of the mother and baby institutions payment scheme.  At the time, the Minister stated that the legislation underpinning the scheme would be developed by the Department as a matter of priority.  The Bill was eventually published on Monday of this week, 17 October 2022, almost one year on.  This legislation will allow for the establishment of an independent executive office, housed within the Department, with responsibility for administering the scheme.  The delay in publishing the Bill means it is now unlikely that the scheme will open for applications until well into 2023.<\/p>  <p>  The establishment of the mother and baby institutions payment scheme is a centrepiece of the action plan for survivors and former residents of mother and baby county home institutions which seeks to implement commitments made by the Government in January 2021 to respond to the priority needs of the survivors.  Following the findings of the OAK report in February 2021, the Minister established an interdepartmental group to develop detailed and costed proposals for the scheme.  The interdepartmental group commissioned OAK Conflict Dynamics Limited to consult survivors and their representatives and the consultations took place between March and April 2021.  The purpose of the consultations was to obtain the views of survivors, their families, representatives, advocates and other interested parties on what should be included in the proposed financial scheme, including a form of enhanced medical card.  The majority of the stakeholders who participated in the consultation process support a universal, inclusive scheme.  The largest proportion of written submissions stated that all mothers and their babies who resided in an institution for any length of time should be eligible for the redress, regardless of whether children were accompanied or unaccompanied by their mothers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900016#O00400","speaker":"1461"},{"type":"speech","time":1666174920,"counter":66,"content":"<p>I appreciate and acknowledge the work of the Social Democrats on this very important motion and thank them for it.

The six-month requirement is not an indicator of whether a child suffered harm, such as from the forced separation of mother and child.  The IHREC is of the view that all survivors who were resident as children in relevant institutions for any length of time should be eligible to apply for the scheme.  There have been numerous calls nationally and internationally for the redress scheme to be extended.  The decision is at odds with the view of the group of 34 clinicians who argue that trauma should not have a six-month minimum applied to it.  The UN Human Rights Committee and the Oireachtas committee on children are calling for the scheme to be extended.<\/p><p>Several UN human rights experts have criticised the Government's response to the systematic racism faced by mixed-race people who passed through State and religious institutions between the 1940s and 1990s.  These experts believe that the Government has not sufficiently addressed this issue and that its planned redress scheme is inadequate.<\/p><p>Many survivors have been critical of the scheme, describing it as a cost-saving exercise.  I agree with them.  Mr. Joe McManus, who spent his early years in St. Patrick's mother and baby institution in Dublin, believes that people are being excluded from the new scheme, or are only eligible for small amounts, in a bid to keep costs down.  Recently, he stated that the final report of the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes and its redress scheme were defined by those reports that went before it.  He said that the redress scheme set up following the Ryan report, which detailed the endemic sexual and physical abuse in many industrial schools and reformatories, cost the State in the region of &euro;1.5 billion.  He stated: &quot;It's just sad that the most important lesson learned by the State [after the Ryan Report] was not what could be done for the casualties of the process, but how they could limit the financial cost.&quot;<\/p><p>When the Minister announced the Bill, I received a number of calls from people who were very distraught.

The Social Democrats will forgive me if I do not thank them too much because I wish to use the remaining four minutes.  However, I appreciate that they have given us this opportunity and put on the D&aacute;il record the fact that there are voices in the House that care.  I am not saying that the Minister does not care, but he has been captured by the mantra of the Department and the society that was portrayed in the final report of the commission of investigation.  In his speech, which I listened to carefully and read, he spoke about the apology given by the Taoiseach, but let me set out what the IHREC and the UN have said about apologies.  At the most basic level, public apologies have been placed on a statutory footing in other jurisdictions.  The motivations for public apologies are:<\/p> <blockquote> \tgenerally both backward- and forward-looking, acknowledging past harms but also signalling a better future.  The backward-looking elements include the taking of responsibility for past human rights violations, the honest acknowledgement of what occurred and naming the wrongness of those harms.  The forward-looking components [which are missing in this instance] address the image of a &quot;redeemed individual or nation&quot;, the beginning of a new era and a break from past cultures of violence, but also signal the social and political transformation required to ensure that such atrocities will never be repeated. <\/blockquote>  <p>Will the Minister look at this description and see where his scheme fits into it?  To me, it does not.  The scheme is piecemeal and the Minister is doing a certain amount but going no further.<\/p><p>There are nine requests in this motion.  They are the most basic requests.  One of them is that we rely on the OAK consultation and what it found.  One of the findings was that losing a child or losing the bond with a child was the most traumatic part.  The Minister has excluded babies who were in institutions for less than six months.  On reflection, what is his opinion on this provision?  In his RT&Eacute; interview, he called it the best approach, but on what is it based?  I do not mean to be flippant, but I might as well ask why I spent six months of my life breastfeeding, minding and being up all night with two children if it did not matter?  I say this with the greatest of respect to men and women.  What was the point of me investing all of that love, which I regard as my duty as a mother, when it was all unnecessary?  The child is a <i>tabula rasa<\/i>at nought and a <i>tabula rasa<\/i>six months later.  The harm only starts after that.  Trauma experts have written to the Minister.  The cross-party committee has asked him to remove this provision, as has the IHREC, and the UN has serious difficulties with it.<\/p><p>When I look to see what transformative action is being taken, all I see are figures.  The interdepartmental group told us that 24,140 people spent less than six months in a mother and baby home.  Clearly, the Minister is excluding these people deliberately.  He is the representative and I do not mean to personalise this at all, and I wish we could sit down and talk about how to do this right, given that it is a golden opportunity, but it is down in black and white that these people will be excluded.  The scheme will exclude those who were boarded out.  It will also not address the systematic racism that is being brought to our attention repeatedly by people who suffered from that racism and by the UN.  On we go, though, and the Minister will come forward next week with another prepared script to put matters in perspective.<\/p><p>He congratulated himself that the scheme was much better than what the commission had recommended and that he had gone further than the commission in extending the scheme, including the times, but he did so without acknowledging something about the commission's conclusions.  While I pay tribute to the body of the commission's work, its conclusions were absolutely without foundation.  The Minister has admitted this, yet he is praising himself and basing his scheme on an extension of those faulty conclusions and recommendations.  That any commission would describe testimony from survivors as &quot;contaminated&quot; begs serious questions about what was going on, as does claiming that their testimonies were not in accordance with the narrative without telling us what that narrative was.  I grew up with the narrative and I knew what it was, namely, that &quot;They knew best&quot;.<\/p> <p>The institutions knew best, the priests knew best and the judges knew best.  This was the narrative.  This commission has perpetuated that narrative.  I thank the Social Democrats.  I hope, but do not think, this will be a momentous change and a way of saying enough is enough i nd&aacute;ir&iacute;re agus t&aacute; g&aacute; le rud eile at&aacute; bunaithe ar chearta daonna ach n&iacute;l d&oacute;chas agam beag n&aacute; m&oacute;r.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900017#P00500","speaker":"1577","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666176120,"counter":73,"content":"<p>There has been a huge and entirely appropriate outcry in recent years over the shameful way some of our most vulnerable citizens were treated.  We have all been moved by this.  As the realisation deepens regarding how unfairly some of our citizens were treated in the past, we more fully understand that the effects continue to ripple through to today.  We witness the pain felt so deeply by those who have not been able to access information about their origins or those who have succeeded in doing so but found the toll of the struggle to be substantial.  We recognise the importance of lifting the veil of secrecy and honouring those who suffered because a misplaced sense of shame cast them aside when they most needed help and compassion.  A veil of secrecy which enabled dignity and respect to be trampled upon for decades has been lifted.<\/p>  <p>  As the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, set out for us, the Government's Action Plan for Survivors and Former Residents of Mother and Baby and County Homes Institutions outlines how the Government is responding to the painful legacy of these institutions in a holistic and wide-ranging way.  The proposed mother and baby institutions payment scheme is just one part of this significant work.  We have already heard some key updates from the Minister regarding other elements of the action plan.  Two important pieces of legislation have already been passed, enacted and commenced this year.  I refer to the Birth Information and Tracing Act 2022 and the Institutional Burials Act 2022.  Both of these Acts are significant demonstrations of the Government's commitment to the delivery of a holistic response to this painful episode in our history.  It is also important to emphasise that counselling support is available for all survivors and former residents of mother and baby home and county home institutions.  It is free of charge and includes out-of-hours support, and survivors enjoy priority access.  Proposals for the mother and baby institutions payment scheme were agreed and published alongside the action plan.  The proposals for the scheme mean that in terms of estimated beneficiaries it will be the largest scheme of its type in the history of the State and will allow for an estimated 34,000 survivors to be eligible for financial payment and approximately 19,000 survivors to be eligible for an enhanced medical card.<\/p>  <p>  The agreed proposals for the scheme, which have been reflected and strengthened in the proposed Mother and Baby Institutions Payment Scheme Bill 2022, were informed by an independently undertaken consultation with survivors' groups and an advisory paper from the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC.  Additionally, pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bill took place between March and July 2022.  Payments and supports under the scheme recognise time spent, harsh conditions, emotional abuse and all other forms of harm, mistreatment, stigma and trauma experienced while resident in a mother and baby or county institution.  Applicants, however, will not have to bring forward evidence of abuse, harm or mistreatment to benefit from the scheme.  Rather, the design of the scheme is predicated on being non-adversarial and as straightforward as possible, with the aim of mitigating the risk that applicants will be retraumatised by engaging with the process.  To achieve this objective, the payments will be based on residency.<\/p>  <p>  The payments schedule is designed so that those who spent most time in these institutions receive the highest levels of payment because, in the majority of cases, these were women and children who experienced the worst conditions for a prolonged time.  In the Bill approved by the Government, the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, has made improvements on the original proposals.  He has improved the overall payment approach by introducing more refined payment bands that will benefit many applicants to the scheme.  He has also introduced a feature in the calculation process that will include periods of temporary absence in the records of some applicants, which will enable a more just approach for those impacted.  <\/p>  <p>  The Government believes all relevant parties have a collective responsibility to respond to Ireland's legacy in respect of the mother and baby situations.  Discussions on seeking a contribution from the religious congregations towards the mother and baby institutions payment scheme are ongoing.  The Government is fully committed to delivering this scheme as soon as possible and the Minister's Department is making the necessary arrangements to establish an executive office within the Department to administer the scheme.  Once the legislation has been passed by the Oireachtas and the administrative infrastructure established, the scheme will be able to begin accepting applications.<\/p>  <p>  I reiterate that this scheme should not be viewed in isolation as the State's sole response to Ireland's legacy concerning mother and baby home institutions.  It is, of course, a very significant scheme and a centrepiece of the Government's action plan.  Important work, however, has also been under way on all other aspects of this action plan, which aims to acknowledge suffering, provide support, rebuild trust and promote healing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900018#Q00200","speaker":"1484"},{"type":"speech","time":1666176120,"counter":74,"content":"<p>We have heard about the wide range of concerns and shortcomings regarding the proposed mother and baby institutions payment scheme.  These concerns echo those raised by the survivor groups, which are yet again deeply disappointed by the failure to deliver on fair redress.  The scheme falls far short of the absolute minimum required to begin to address the great damage done to those abducted and incarcerated in mother and baby homes.  The scheme has many significant flaws, including that only 34,000 out of 58,000 survivors will be covered; that it fails to acknowledge the devastating impact of forced family separation; that children aged less than six months are not included; that forced adoption, fostering and boarding out are not covered; that racial discrimination of mixed-race children is not recognised; that payments are based solely on the length of time spent in an institution; that people must waive their rights to take legal action; that payments are <i>ex gratia<\/i>, meaning there is no accountability for abuse; that vaccine trials are excluded; and that no agreement has been reached for an equal sharing of responsibility and costs between the State and the congregations concerned.<\/p><p>Arguably, that last point is the most significant shortcoming of this payment scheme.  The scheme completely fails to acknowledge the full and equal culpability of church and State for the egregious harm done to so many mothers and children during that dark period.  There can be no coming to terms as a country with our past without proper accountability.  It beggars belief that the Minister has not secured agreement from those religious orders that ran these homes and are largely responsible for the cruel regimes that inflicted such human rights abuses.  Have any lessons at all been learned from the experience of the 2002 residential institutions redress scheme?  We must wonder about this.<\/p><p>This was a redress scheme where we were told that the State and religious orders shared equal responsibility for the damage done to so many people in residential institutions.  The religious congregations involved, however, pulled a fast one and persuaded a weak Minister to agree to cap their contribution at &euro;127 million.  The redress scheme, of course, ended up costing &euro;1.5 billion, meaning the religious contribution was less than 10% of the total cost.  I reiterate that it was less than 10%.  So much for equal culpability.  Not only that, but, shockingly, 20 years later the &euro;127 million has not even been paid in full.  This is incredible.  Then, in 2009, on foot of further horrific revelations and the Ryan report, pressure came on the orders to increase their contribution.  At that point, they offered to make a voluntary contribution of &euro;352 million.  This was 13 years ago.  <\/p> <p>Unbelievably, a mere &euro;120 million of that amount has been paid to date.  It is very disappointing, although I suppose not surprising, that the six religious orders which ran the mother and baby homes have yet to agree to contribute anything.  Most people would argue that culpability as well as responsibility for redress should be equally shared.  That, after all, is official Government policy.  That is what the Minister must secure - a full equal share of the final cost from the orders concerned.  If the Minister cannot achieve that, I believe that Government must consider repossessing those taxpayer-funded education and health properties for which those religious orders have assumed possession.  It really is very hard to stomach some religious orders squirrelling away assets into trusts of various kinds when these were publicly funded properties.  It is twice as hard to take that when the orders refuse to meet their moral obligations to provide redress for their wrongdoing and seek to put their assets beyond reach.  Will the Minister do the right thing?  Will he rethink this scheme?  It is clearly not fit for purpose.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900018#Q00300","speaker":"1567","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666176720,"counter":76,"content":"<p>Ms Mary Harney is a survivor who will be familiar to many of us as one of the women whose statutory right to comment on the draft findings of the commission of investigation was wrongly denied.  She once said, &quot;I am not a survivor.  I am a small, yet mighty, resisting worker for justice.&quot;  She has had to spend much of her life fighting for her rights, for her identity and for justice.  Unfortunately, the Government, like its predecessors, is continuing to force people like Mary to fight in the courts.  Thousands of survivors are excluded from the Government's scheme.  Many of them will never receive redress or recognition, if the Minister has his way.  They will get nothing for the life-destroying crime of forced family separation, just as nothing will be given to those boarded out to abusive homes and nothing will be given to those from whom pharmaceutical companies have profited.  Others will be given as little as &euro;5,000 for a lifetime of trauma.  One would get multiples of that for a whiplash injury.  It is truly despicable.  I thought that the six-month criterion was a red herring to distract all of the opposition from the ridiculously low rates that other survivors get.  I thought the Minister would go back on it.<\/p><p>This scheme shows nothing but contempt for survivors.  I cannot express how, as a public representative, it turns my stomach.  The rules of this House prevent me from expressing the anger that I know is out there today among people watching.  The Minister quite perfectly summarised it in his closing remarks.  He said that he wanted to &quot;pay tribute ... to survivors&quot; and that nothing &quot;can ever truly undo&quot; the damage caused.  He continued:<\/p> <blockquote> \t... by ensuring that the remains of the children buried at Tuam receive a respectful reburial and by bringing forward a payment scheme that will benefit 34,000 former residents, we are humbly acknowledging the State's duty... <\/blockquote>  <p>If the Minister was humbly acknowledging the State's duty, he would reword his statement to provide that the remains of the children in all known burial sites around the country will receive a respectful reburial and he would bring forward a payment scheme that would benefit all former residents.  That would humbly acknowledge the State's responsibility to some extent.<\/p><p>The Minister is being disingenuous.  Given the incredibly serious and personal nature of this topic, that is unforgivable.  The Minister claims to have listened.  That is blatantly untrue.  Survivors participated in the Minister's consultation.  They rightly called for a scheme recognising all survivors.  They know how others have suffered.  They know the evil of a system that separates them into different categories.  The casual manner in which the Minister disregards their wishes is sickening.  He proudly said he has gone beyond the commission's recommendations, as if that were admirable.  The commission's recommendations were arbitrary and inconsistent with the testimony given.  We must not forget all those excluded from the investigation in the first place.  Any scheme based on those recommendations is equally distorted and defective.<\/p><p>The Minister emphasised that the scheme will be non-adversarial, as if this is a benevolence.  He tried to set himself up as the good guy by stating that survivors will not have to provide evidence of harm but, of course, this position is based on the fallacy that there are only two options open to him.  The Minister can create a process that recognises harm in a way that trusts survivors because at the heart of the Minister's so-called non-adversarial system is the assumption that survivors would lie.  They are being treated in the same way they always have by the same judging and distrusting State.  It is wrapped up in kinder language but the core prejudice remains.<\/p><p>Why are the Minister and the Government letting the church and the pharmaceutical companies get away with this?  There is a deference to the church in some of the Government parties, and the pharmaceutical companies are major employers, but the Minister should be standing up for justice.  Honestly, will anyone be held to account for this litany of crimes?  Will anybody in the Bon Secours order be held accountable for Tuam?  It is an incredibly wealthy organisation profiting from private healthcare, here and internationally.  Why is the Minister not aggressively pursuing them, not only for accountability but for compensation for the victims?  The Minister should be giving every survivor every cent that he or she is owed and deserves.  He should be pursuing the church and the pharmaceutical companies for the costs they bear responsibility for.  Not only would it be the right thing to do, but also the Irish people would be squarely behind the Minister.  Instead, the Minister seems to think it better to divide the survivors, give as little as possible and hope that this goes away.  This will not go away.  His term in office will be marked as another disgrace and he will be seen as another failed Minister blatantly ignoring survivors and disregarding human rights.<\/p><p>I had genuinely hoped today would be a wake-up call for the Government but instead, it will cynically allow this motion to pass while ploughing ahead with its exclusionary and paltry so-called redress scheme.  I, along with others, will fight the Government every step of the way at all stages of the Minister's Bill because it ignores survivors, rejects human rights and facilitates religious orders and pharmaceutical companies getting away with crimes.  This Government is no different from or better than its predecessors.  It has learned nothing.

Our motion proposes a ban on disconnections now instead of waiting until December as the Government's plan suggests.  It would provide desperately needed protection and certainty for the hundreds of thousands of households using pre-paid meters.  The Government has stated it will not oppose the motion and this is to be welcomed.<\/p>  <p>  Those struggling to pay their energy bills need urgent action now to implement these measures without delay.  It is nearly three weeks since the Taoiseach stated nobody would be disconnected this winter, including households using pre-paid meters.  As the Taoiseach knows, I welcomed it at the time.  Since then, I and others have asked the Taoiseach repeatedly for his plan to deliver on this commitment but he has not provided an answer.  Instead, we hear that the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, is to publish a plan in the coming weeks.  Those struggling to pay their electricity bills do not have the luxury of weeks.  They are in trouble now.<\/p>  <p>  As we speak, more than 200,000 households are in electricity arrears.  The fear of disconnection is very real and very present for them.  This will only get worse as people scramble to keep up with the soaring cost of living.  The October bills are arriving now.  They are landing like a body blow.  I spoke to a woman last night who told me that the heart was put crossways in her when she saw her bill.  She said she felt winded.  That is how she described it.<\/p>  <p>  People work hard all day but are afraid to turn on the lights when they come home.  Parents worry that they will be disconnected and that their children will not have light to do their homework.  Many families using prepaid meters are forced to have dark days and to ration their electricity.  This is where it is at for so many people.  Asking these households to wait on the never-never for the Government's plan is not good enough.  They need the Government to act now to ensure every single household is protected from disconnection.  This has to include those using pre-paid meters.<\/p>  <p>  I have said before to the Taoiseach but let me repeat that there is a simple solution to what is a big problem.  Some pre-paid companies already have disconnection bans in place at weekends and some public holidays.  This ban should be extended to provide these households with 24-7 protection until the end of March.  The Taoiseach needs to grasp this solution.  Do not leave people waiting and waiting with unimaginable stress.  N&iacute; m&oacute;r teaghlaigh a chosaint &oacute; dh&iacute;cheangal fuinnimh an geimhreadh seo.

This means a ban on disconnections starting immediately.  It means including those on pre-pay meters now and providing them with an absolute assurance that they will not be disconnected.  Yesterday, I said sincerely to the Taoiseach that we will work with the Government to get the eviction ban in place as quickly as possible.  We need the same urgency and willingness to work together to ensure no household is disconnected this winter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900020#S00100","speaker":"1466"},{"type":"speech","time":1666177320,"counter":81,"content":"<p>We all share this view and objective.  The Minister has met with the companies and suppliers, with MABS, with the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and with other non-governmental organisations that are at the coalface in respect of challenges that certain families or people may experience, particularly during a winter like this.  The Government has taken a number of measures.  We are not standing by or waiting.  By any fair measure, the budget announcements are significant to ensure people have the wherewithal to avoid disconnection and, in particular, to meet the significant increase in electricity costs.  This is apart from the measures taken earlier in the year.<\/p>  <p>  The &euro;600 energy credit is a significant intervention.  There will be three payments of &euro;200 in the billing periods of November-December 2022, January-February 2023 and March-April 2023.  We go further then, with more than &euro;2.5 billion provided in the budget to support households.  There is a &euro;400 lump sum payment for fuel allowance recipients.  There is a &euro;200 lump sum payment for pensioners.  There is a &euro;500 cost-of-living lump sum payment for all families getting the working family payment.  There is a double payment of child benefit to support all families with children.  A &euro;500 cost-of living payment for people receiving the carer's support grant will be paid in November.  The &euro;500 cost-of-living disability support grant will be paid to all people receiving a long-term disability payment.  These are substantial interventions.  They are far stronger than what Sinn F&eacute;in proposed in its alternative budget.  We will leave that to one side.  I will not go through the list.  Its alternative budget was quite poor in respect of the fuel allowance and pensioners.  That is the bottom line.  It had major gaps.<\/p>  <p>  The winter moratorium on disconnections of all domestic customers for non-payment has been extended to three months, as I said yesterday, from 1 December to 28 February.  In respect of pay-as-you-go meters, the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, has decided to suspend the &euro;200 gas meter exchange siteworks charge associated with a customer moving from a pay-as-you-go gas meter to a bill-pay credit meter for all domestic customers.  This is welcome.  The level of emergency credit for prepaid meters was increased.  The CRU is examining this further.<\/p>  <p>  In the Minister's engagement with quite a number of NGOs, they warned against increasing the overdraft because it would increase debt for families.  It is called a credit but in essence it is an overdraft.  We would prefer for this not to happen and to seek more effective ways to support people who could end up in difficulty or may have challenges with pay-as-you-go.  The Minister will continue to engage with a number of stakeholders to make sure no one is disconnected.  Following his discussions with the companies and with the CRU, we do not believe disconnections will happen.  There are people who could be in difficulty and we are looking at what is the best mechanism to prevent anyone from being disconnected, as opposed to just increasing the credit and the overdraft, which could lead to further debt for families who do not need to get into further debt.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900020#S00200","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1666177320,"counter":82,"content":"<p>The difficulty lies in the Taoiseach's statement that the Minister \"will continue to engage\".

The Taoiseach's concern about people falling into debt is understandable but I need to say that a far greater concern for those using prepaid meters is that they will not have supply to their homes.<\/p> <p>We need to deal with that as a matter of urgency.

O'Connell Street and the surrounding area have been in decline for several years.  As we saw in the programme last night, a variety of problems are now endemic to the area.  There is widespread antisocial behaviour, open drug taking and drug dealing, persistent serious violent incidents, chronic dereliction and vacancy, and deeply ingrained dirt and grime almost everywhere one looks.  It has the look of an area where those in authority have simply given up.<\/p>  <p>  Walking along the O'Connell Street, almost everything on one side from the Spire to the Ambassador Theatre is derelict and deserted.  The area around the Abbey Theatre is similarly derelict, desolate and filthy.  This is our national theatre, the area around which should be one of the jewels in the crown of the cultural quarter of the north city.  Last night, Dublin City Council defended its performance by noting there would be a deep clean of O'Connell Bridge this month.  Seriously, is that the best it can do?  This would not be tolerated in any other European capital city.<\/p>  <p>  When it comes to tackling antisocial behaviour, a new Garda station was promised by the Minister for Justice in April, but that has now been downgraded to a Garda liaison office.  Perhaps this is unsurprising as we recently found out that the 800 new garda&iacute; promised this year will not materialise.  Just 460 new Garda recruits will have completed or be in the middle of training by the end of this year.  Even if there were a sustained Garda response, in isolation, it would not work to alleviate the problems.<\/p>  <p>  The scourge of drug addiction is often at the root of criminal justice issues, which, in turn, is a product of deprivation and poverty.  Successive Governments have promised better drug services and supervised injection centres for years, but they have yet to materialise.  We have just 23 dedicated hospital detox and stabilisation beds throughout the country.  The number of rehabilitation beds is also risibly low.  The issues are clearly multifaceted, but the question is: what is going to be done about them?  What we need is a multi-agency approach about which there needs to be urgency.  That is why I call on the Taoiseach to head up a task force to rejuvenate and clean up O'Connell Street to bring it back to some kind of level that we can be proud of as a capital city main street.<\/p>  <p>  Statements will be taken on this in the Chamber next month.  Will the Taoiseach agree to bringing forward a plan for a task force under the remit of his Department on that day? <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900021#T00500","speaker":"1567"},{"type":"speech","time":1666177920,"counter":88,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue.  I do not disagree with her that there are serious societal issues on O&rsquo;Connell Street, as shown on &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; yesterday evening.  One is struck by the extraordinary wanton violence perpetrated by people against others on our streets late in the evening.  There is no question that the free exchange of drugs on the streets is obvious to many people, and people have been commenting for quite some time about the drug activity on the streets of the capital, particularly around O&rsquo;Connell Street and the quays.  Many people say that they are afraid to walk some of these streets.<\/p>  <p>  It is a multifaceted problem but, in the first instance, I always reflect on the fact that there are times when Members speak enthusiastically about local authorities being delegated responsibility to develop their city.  We cannot take the view here that the local authority has no role or should not be a central driving force behind O'Connell Street.  There are significant plans for the fabric of O&rsquo;Connell Street, which became the subject of a lot of controversy in respect of the Hammerson site, for example, and the GPO and all the side lanes, and that went on for years.  Oireachtas Members sat on joint committees regarding that.  There is no question that the fabric of the street has to change.  There is a choice to be made by all of us and decisions have to be made, but the default position has been whether we can keep the campaign going, by opposing development, for another ten years.<\/p>  <p>  I have heard people talk about the rejuvenation of O&rsquo;Connell Street for 25 years.  Oireachtas Members formed a committee with local councillors and people.  A solution emerged but not everyone is happy with that and they want to go back to the drawing board and start again.  If we are being honest, given our planning laws and everything else, it will mean another decade of no development on the street, and, therefore, we have to make choices.  Sometimes politicians have to stand up and make decisions about the future of their city and country and not hide forever behind a campaign and pander to every interest, no matter how legitimate it may be.  Sometimes a solution has to be worked out and a consensus has to emerge, and not everybody will be happy with every aspect of that.<\/p>  <p>  The physical neglect of the street and the need to accelerate the development of the streetscape from residential to retail is important.  The drug issue is very important, but then again, people have objected to injection centres and various facilities that people and agencies have endeavoured to bring in, which is also a sad reality.  I believe in the health-based approach to drugs and drug addiction in particular.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has a range of operations on O&rsquo;Connell Street and in the capital, but it is not a Garda issue on its own by any definition.<\/p>  <p>  I am not opposing what the Deputy said but we need to discuss this further in terms of a task force being a panacea for this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900021#T00600","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1666177920,"counter":89,"content":"<p>I thank the Taoiseach for describing the problem, but I asked him about what he is going to do about it.

According to the Government's interesting figures yesterday, as welcome as the belated ban is it still means that 2, 273 people will face eviction after the ban ends, which means that the level of homelessness is likely to be up to 13,000 to 14,000 people.  Of course, we all know that, in any event, those figures are an understatement.<\/p>  <p>  Evictions and homelessness are the most horrible symptom of the deeper and more fundamental underlying failure of the Government to address the housing crisis and deliver the affordable and public housing we need to solve that crisis.  The Central Bank decision to change mortgage rules is yet another symptom of that failure.  We now risk repeating the mistakes of the Celtic tiger, saddling another generation of mortgage holders with potentially crippling debts, in particular if interest rates go up.<\/p>  <p>  All of this speaks to a situation whereby people who need a home are caught in a vice grip of extortionate unaffordable rents and house prices and a chronic lack of public and affordable housing.  What does the Government intend to do?  In the interests of being constructive, just as we proposed the eviction ban I want to make some proposals about what the Government should do over the coming months.  First, the State must buy up all the properties of landlords who are selling up and exiting the market.  That deals with the problem of landlords exiting from rental properties.  It should be a systematic policy.<\/p>  <p>  I see that the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, is whispering to the Taoiseach that that is happening.  Of all of the ones I have raised in my area, not a single property has yet got over the line.  We want to see that happen.  The State must buy up developer and investor properties to ensure that every new property that comes on the market is affordable.  There is no point in developers delivering stuff that nobody can afford.  The Government should buy up those properties.  There should be an aggressive campaign to take vacant and derelict properties into use, including a punitive - the one introduced in the budget is not - vacant property tax that forces them in.<\/p>  <p>  Private building is starting to slow down, therefore a State construction company should be established to equip and support local authorities to deliver public and affordable housing directly.  Can we raise the income limits, something that has been promised for more than a year, so that all of those who cannot afford extortionate rents and house prices get the support of the State in being housed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900022#U00600","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1666178520,"counter":96,"content":"<p>I have made it very clear, and I will say it again, that housing is the single most important social issue facing our society and country.  In the past two years we have dedicated unprecedented financial resources to deal with housing.  The fundamental approach has to be to increase supply.  We have had to deal with Covid-19 and two lockdowns, which hit construction hard.  We then had an exponential increase in prices brought about by the war in Ukraine and an inflationary cycle, all of which has dented confidence in builders and so on in terms of certainty for the future.  We intervened very quickly in respect of public contracts and tendering to enable builders to have more confidence in tenders in order to try to stabilise the situation.  That is the reality so far.<\/p>  <p>  We will meet the target of about 25,000 houses his year, but we need far more than that.  Supply is key.  That means all of us have to be very focused on making sure all the projects that are developed, designed and brought to the planning stage are allowed through, unless they are horrendous altogether.  By and large, we do not have the luxury of opposing projects because of their mix.  The Deputy may not like private housing being mixed with sociable or affordable housing on public lands.  In my view, we have to get houses built at a far faster rate than we are currently getting them built.  There are issues we will deal with, such as the review of the planning code to make sure it is more streamlined and can facilitate not just housing but also infrastructure projects.<\/p>  <p>  The State is buying properties that have been sold by landlords, where we have tenants on HAP or RAS.  The Minister has made it very clear to local authority managers that they may buy houses or apartments that are being sold and which are occupied by people on RAS or HAP.  That funding is there for local authorities to use.  Local authorities have to have some discretion.  That is only sensible.<\/p>  <p>  Also, 18,390 new social housing units have been added to the social housing stock under this Government up to quarter 2 of 2022.  That includes 11,301 new builds.  In addition to that, 6,000 social homes were brought back into us through the voids programme.  Such houses were derelict or not refurbished and we moved very quickly to bring them back into the system.  The same will happen with close to a further 2,500 homes in 2022.

Unfortunately, too many owners are at their wits' end in reassessing their current financial position.<\/p><p>The escalation in the cost of energy and the cost of living is certainly a factor, but the underlying cause is the fact that the fair deal funding model is not fit for purpose.  This is not something we are only discovering now.  It has been flagged time and again in many different reports.  There were two from HIQA, one from the Comptroller and Auditor General, one from the Department of Health and one from the Ombudsman.<\/p><p>HIQA's latest report states:<\/p> <blockquote> \tHIQA believes that the closure of small nursing homes should be considered in the context of the loss of a particular model of care and not just in terms of bed numbers.  Smaller nursing homes that are embedded in the local community offer person-centred care in a very homely environment.  Their closure sometimes means that older people in need of residential care have to travel further in order to receive care.  This has a knock-on effect for residents, particularly in terms of visitors, social activities and links to their preferred GP or pharmacy. <\/blockquote>  <p>The fair deal model is structured in such a way that private nursing homes receive in the region of &euro;600 less per person per week, which is an incredible difference.  In January 2022, the average fee payable under fair deal for a HSE nursing home was &euro;1,674 per person per week and &euro;1,047 per person per week for private and voluntary nursing homes .<\/p><p>When I raised this with the T&aacute;naiste previously, he suggested that public nursing homes often deal with people who have more complex care needs.  While this may have some validity in a restricted number of cases, it is not the universal situation and cannot explain the considerable difference in payments between private and public nursing homes.  An urgent review of the pricing model is needed.<\/p><p>It is also important to remember that nursing homes are a vital link in our health services at all times but especially now when our acute healthcare system is under such pressure.  It makes no sense that we are allowing nursing homes to close when our acute hospitals have ever-lengthening waiting lists and people waiting on trolleys and in emergency departments.  The Taoiseach can fix this almost overnight.  He should put in place a sustainable fair deal model because nursing homes are a vital link in the healthcare chain and that chain is at breaking point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900023#V00200","speaker":"1605"},{"type":"speech","time":1666179120,"counter":105,"content":"<p>There has been huge expansion in the nursing home programme over the years, particularly in terms of the nursing home support programme.  Approximately 80% of all nursing homes are private and 20% are under the HSE, which we call community nursing units.  The State is allocating approximately &euro;1.4 billion per year to support approximately 22,000 nursing home residents and that has seen a strong increase over the past two years in particular.<\/p>  <p>  During Covid-19, an additional &euro;144 million was allocated to nursing homes.  That cannot be dismissed.  It was a significant intervention by the State, correctly, to underpin nursing homes in respect of the challenges that Covid-19 undoubtedly presented to them.  All Deputies know the details of that intervention.<\/p>  <p>  The cases of residents in community nursing homes are more complex.  We should not dismiss the difference.  The cases are more complex by definition and there are more staff in community nursing units.  That said, we acknowledge the issues and challenges because the private nursing home sector is going through some change, with regard to financial underpinning of larger nursing homes, in the sense that large organisations are coming in and smaller and community-based nursing homes are feeling the pressure.  That is acknowledged and we accept it.<\/p>  <p>  That is why a significant package is being discussed and will be implemented, the announcement of which is imminent, for nursing homes to deal with the inflationary cost increases they are experiencing. Substantial funding is being made available to the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Butler, to do so.  Discussions have been taking place with nursing home organisations.  It will help to deal with the inflationary pressures that nursing homes undoubtedly face.  The temporary assistance payment scheme will also continue to the end of the year.<\/p>  <p>  There have been a number of reviews of the pricing mechanism and that is the subject matter of negotiations.  The National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, under legislation that was passed quite a number of years ago, is the body delegated to arbitrate on price for nursing homes.  An outcome is also imminent to get that resolved.  We acknowledge that needs resolution but legislation passed in this House has ordained that be done through an independent mechanism, namely, the NTPF.<\/p>  <p>  Changes are going on in the dynamic within the private nursing home sector and senior care.  The allocation to home-based care will grow and the nature and duration of stay or residency in a nursing home will change in the time ahead.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900023#V00300","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1666179120,"counter":106,"content":"<p>I acknowledge what the Taoiseach said in that there are various initiatives in the pipeline but two nursing homes closed in County Roscommon and one closed in Athlone, County Westmeath last week.

She said that her nursing home received &euro;950 per person per week but the local public nursing home received &euro;1,915 per person per week.  That is not tenable.  No private nursing home could survive that black hole in funding provision.<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach spoke about money given during Covid, which was most welcome, but we all remember the considerable restrictions and challenges and every cent of that was needed to deal with Covid.  It did not deal with the underlying problem, that is, the funding mechanism under fair deal.  I hope what I heard the Taoiseach say is that the initiatives he is now looking at will begin to deal with that.  According to its most recent report, HIQA believes that the closure of smaller nursing homes requires urgent attention to avoid further closures impacting on the lives of residents, their families and friends.

I get the sense that since Covid-19, State underpinning of nursing homes is growing.  It was a very significant intervention during Covid in addition to the nursing homes support scheme itself.  We have a significant inflationary package coming in before the end of the year to support nursing homes to get through the energy crisis.  Then there is the issue of the pricing arrangements, which are set by the NTPF, in terms of increasing those or at least having a serious discussion.

The first of these was introduced in 2018, another was introduced in 2020 and we sent this into Bills Office a couple of weeks ago.  It was due to be debated in the D&aacute;il and voted on next week.  <\/p><p>Last time we brought such a Bill forward, it prompted the Government to introduce the Covid temporary emergency evictions ban, although it had railed against introducing such a ban up until it was forced to do so.  Similarly, over months now we have sought to put maximum pressure on the Government to reintroduce a ban on evictions.  Perhaps not coincidentally, the week before this Bill was due to be voted on in the D&aacute;il, the Government yesterday introduced a temporary ban on evictions.  Although we are glad that it did that, we still want to have this Bill on the Order Paper.  It is not clear to us that what the Government is planning to introduce will be sufficient to deal with the blight of evictions into homelessness, which has resulted in nearly 11,000 families, households and individuals being in the appalling situation of being homeless, in emergency accommodation and often in the most dreadful of circumstances.  In most cases, it is because landlords are selling up.  <\/p><p>Importantly, this will be a test of the Government&rsquo;s proposed temporary ban.  In some cases, as has been said on many occasions in this House over recent months, the cost-of-living crisis literally means that people are making choices between paying the rent and paying the bills, and having the money to put food on the table for their children.  Our Bill is clear that where people are in financial difficulty - not wilfully not paying &ndash; as a result of a cost-of-living crisis that is spiralling out of control, they should be protected if they fall into arrears simply because of the extraordinary, unprecedented pressures of the cost of living, including food and energy prices, which are crucifying so many low- and middle-income households.  It would be interesting to see what the Government does on that.  <\/p><p>Our Bill proposes that such an eviction ban would last for a year.<\/p> <p>The Minister would then have the power to extend that, depending on whether the Government had actually addressed the housing crisis, the unaffordability of rents, the lack of social and affordable housing, the numbers of people in emergency homeless accommodation and, indeed, the cost-of-living crisis which is also fuelling the housing crisis.  Now that the Government has been forced to move, we will keep the Bill in waiting, but we will bring it to a vote if the Government fails to deliver the solutions necessary to prevent the blight of homelessness and evictions into homelessness and address the deeper underlying issues of homelessness and evictions.<\/p> <p> The Ministers and so on should take heed of the example of Jennifer, with whose case I am dealing and who featured on a news programme yesterday, or of Graham and Patricia King, whose case I brought to public attention in the D&aacute;il a few weeks ago.  They should they take heed of the example of a couple in Blackrock with whom I am currently dealing.  The couple are now overholding and are being evicted from a house in which they have lived since the 1950s with their kids.  They were terrified at the prospect of being evicted.   They and all the other thousands of people who face evictions need to be protected by the Government.  We need sustainable, secure and long-term solutions in terms of social and affordable housing.  If the Government does not deliver on that, we will have no choice but to push for the Bill to be voted on in the D&aacute;il.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900027#Z01400","speaker":"1478","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666182120,"counter":201,"content":"<p>Is the Bill being opposed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900028#AA00200","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1666182120,"counter":202,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900028#AA00300","speaker":"1475"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1666182120,"counter":203,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1666182120,"counter":204,"content":"<p>Since this is a Private Members' Bill, Second Stage must, under Standing Orders, be taken in Private Members' time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900028#AA00500","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1666182120,"counter":205,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be taken in Private Members' time.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900028#AA00600","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1666182120,"counter":206,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Estimates for Public Services 2022","time":1666182120,"counter":207,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900028#AA00800"},{"type":"speech","time":1666182120,"counter":208,"content":"<p>I move the following Supplementary Estimate:<div><\/p><p><b>Vote 29 &mdash; Environment, Climate and Communications (Third Supplementary Estimate)<\/b><\/div>That a third supplementary sum not exceeding &euro;1,362,000,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 2022, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, including certain services administered by that Office, and for payment of certain grants.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900028#AA00900","speaker":"1459"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1666182120,"counter":209,"content":"<p>Vote put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Ceisteanna - Questions","time":1666182120,"counter":210,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900028#AA01100"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Citizens' Assembly","time":1666182120,"counter":211,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900028#AA01150"},{"type":"question","time":1666182120,"counter":212,"qnumday":1,"qnumall":"[50103\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900028#AA01200","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he will provide a timeline for future citizens&rsquo; assemblies.","asker":"1478","askee":"1458"},{"type":"question","time":1666182120,"counter":213,"qnumday":2,"qnumall":"[50106\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900028#AA01300","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he will provide a timeline for future citizens&rsquo; assemblies.","asker":"1628","askee":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1666182120,"counter":214,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.<\/p>  <p>  The programme for Government commits to establishing four citizens' assemblies, on the topics of biodiversity loss, the type of directly elected mayor and local government structures best suited for Dublin, drug use and the future of education.

I read this morning that hundreds of records released to Coastal Concern Alliance, a citizens' group, under freedom of information rules raise serious questions about habitat protection in the offshore area.  The documents seem to suggest political interference in the designation of special areas of conservation and that areas which should have been designated as sandbanks were removed.  For example, in the context of areas of the Codling Bank, the Kish Bank and so on that should have been designated as sandbanks and almost certainly would have gained protection but have now been grabbed as sites by developers, there is a suggestion of interference in the designation and lack of protection of those sites where private companies are planning offshore industrial wind.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900028#AA01500","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1666182120,"counter":216,"content":"<p>New research shows that the world's wildlife populations have declined, on average, by almost 70% in the past 50 years.

The report suggests that land use change remains the driving factor behind the crisis and the loss of biodiversity.  In addition, there is overexploitation of natural resources, as well as pollution and climate change.  At the root of this is a system of ecocidal capitalism that is concerned only with maximisation of profit and cares nothing for the devastation of the natural environment and the consequences of that for all of humanity.

NESC is continuing to work on Ireland's well-being framework by examining how well-being frameworks are implemented in practice.  NESC has undertaken an extensive programme of research and consultation to support the shared island initiative.

In the bill from January to March, the tariff is 0.8 cent per kWh; in the next bill, it is 21 cent; in the next, it is 38 cent; and in the next, it is 49 cent per kWh.

He said it is a slimmed down version.  The tendering did not facilitate a race to the bottom.  We need efficiencies as well.  We need people to have good models.  From what the Deputy is saying, the local partnership won the contract.  It was not the Minister's intention that those who won contracts would lay people off, but neither is it on that the Government would micromanage every partnership and every agency across the country.  Government is a balance between delegation of its authority, as agreed by the Oireachtas, and, at a macro level, dealing with issues that are more appropriate to the Executive.  I often note that the Deputy's side of the House calls on the Government of the day to keep directing and keep instructing - keep dictating, basically - people to do it our way and no other way.  I am not sure that is the correct or the balanced approach to take.  That is just the view that I have.<\/p><p>Deputy Barry again raised the issue of choices and people being in significant difficulties.  First, there are moratoriums in respect of people in vulnerable situations.  Second, the measures that the Government has taken on funding have been significant in supporting people in need through the cash payments that we will make between now and the end of the year, the permanent measures from January onwards in terms of social protection increases and payments, including the working family payment, and a range of cost reductions that we have introduced, which will help people with their bills, with energy remaining the big one.  Regarding social protection, there is the additional needs framework to help families who are in difficulty, not just with energy, but across the board, to ensure that they are never in a position where they would have to make that choice.  These measures and mechanisms are robust.  We are being clear and insistent with the providers that we do not want any disconnections, particularly of families in difficult situations.  I do not believe, given everything that has happened under the various strands, that people should be disconnected in the circumstances that the Deputy has outlined where there is a genuine need and difficulty.<\/p><p>Deputy Bacik raised the housing <i>in situ<\/i>scheme and whether NESC could be deployed or a request made of it.  I am not clear that the scheme requires legislative underpinning.  We can ask NESC more broadly about the homeless housing issue.  I still believe that we need to allow discretion by, and the delegation of authority to, local authorities.  Substantial funding has gone to local authorities in respect of housing, and that will continue, but we are open to suggestions and discussions around that issue more generally in terms of what NESC could do.<\/p><p>Deputy Cathal Crowe raised the issue of the Limerick northern distributor road, about which he is passionate.  I am glad the first phase of that is under way.  He mentioned the investment by the University of Pittsburgh.  The new train station that was recently announced by the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, is a positive because I think that, in future, there must be a balance between road and active travel.  The Deputy also mentioned the industrial park, which is good news as well.  I understand the motivation behind, and have sympathy with, the proposal for a second phase.  Others are not as inclined towards phase 2 and have different views on it.  It was not in the original national development plan, NDP, so we have to try to work out how that can be progressed.

We know from a recent media report that the Courts Service has warned its board of potential reputational risk once the report is published.  It is the O'Farrell family who uncovered the full extent of the Courts Service's failures.

It was transformative for communities because we saw more of our garda&iacute; on the streets, but it was also transformative for garda&iacute; in their home environments.  For the first time in their lives, they were able to plan family events and know when they were going to be on and off duty.

Indeed, in my area, in the south inner-city, many constituents have expressed serious concerns to me about safety.  One local resident spoke about someone having been arrested outside his house who was wielding a knife at 11 a.m.  Clearly, therefore, a stronger response is required from the Garda.<\/p>  <p>  I have tabled several parliamentary questions on this matter.  The Ministers for Justice; Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, and Enterprise, Trade and Employment have all said they are satisfied that the various Garda operations in the area are sufficient.  Can it be ensured that a greater number of garda&iacute; are recruited to make sure we have community policing and visible foot patrols across the city centre area?  In 2022, 800 new garda&iacute; were meant to be recruited, but just 24 were added in the first eight months of the year and I understand that only 460 new members of the force are expected to have either completed or started training by the end of this year.

Equally, the service officers for some time have been looking for allowances for some of the additional duties they do and for which they do not get recognition for.

I worry that this reflects a certain approach by the Government of criminalising and stigmatising people when it is underfunding drug task forces right across the country.  I am on the Tallaght drug task force, which is massively underfunded and the same applies throughout the country whereby these task forces have not recovered from massive cuts ten years ago.<\/p>  <p>  I refer to the refusal by the Government to take a public health-driven approach instead of relying on criminalisation and stigmatising when Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael together have created the conditions of this crisis that exists in many of our communities because of the lack of investment in housing, social services and communities.  I would like a condemnation of this comment and a commitment that this is not the sort of approach the Government will take.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900032#EE00600","speaker":"1628"},{"type":"speech","time":1666184520,"counter":286,"content":"<p>Deputy McDonald raised the scoping inquiry into the death of Shane O'Farrell.  I met with the family during the summer.  The Government agreed to facilitate the family with a copy of the scoping inquiry report.  The Government has not yet considered the report in deference to the family's wishes at that time.  I will meet with the family again, and I understand a date has now been agreed by my office and the family.  The Government has to give consideration to the scoping inquiry.  It did take three years, but this was beyond my control.  The inquiry was established more than three years ago, and once such an inquiry is established, the chairperson goes through it.  This is a comprehensive report.  It is fair to say that not all of it meets with the approval of the family, but the Government must consider this report in respect of the next steps.<\/p>  <p>  Turning to Deputy Crowe's contribution, I commend him on his encyclopaedic knowledge of the detail of Garda rosters.  This is impressive work and I hear what he is saying but I do not interfere in the operational decisions of the Commissioner of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na regarding how the Garda is organised.  More generally, however, in terms of employees, and garda&iacute; in particular, if the home environment is better and so on, then people will perform better.  Likewise, with the work environment.  The Deputy said changes are coming on stream that could be difficult.  I will talk to the Minister for Justice who is the conduit in respect of matters concerning Garda policy more generally.  Turning to the Deputy's wider issue, disciplinary action taken in respect of any agency must always be balanced and fair.  People's names do need to be cleared if errors have been made, and I do not know any specific details regarding any specific cases, but speaking generally, people are entitled to natural justice and due process in all situations.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Bacik again raised the O'Connell Street issue.  More garda&iacute; are being trained on an ongoing basis.  This is process is continuous now concerning the number of trainees.  We do need more foot patrols and we also need a stronger community garda&iacute; presence.  A substantial number of those emerging from Templemore have been deployed in the capital.  This remains the case.  In addition, we need more specialisation and this is also happening.  There has been a fundamental reform of the policing system in recent years.  This has continued, as I said in my original reply.<\/p>  <p>  Moving to Deputy Boyd Barrett's contribution, we all have representatives on the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission which, essentially, runs these Houses.  It organises and is responsible for policy here.  I do not know whether these issues have been raised with the commission.  There are established employee&ndash;employer relationships and pay agreements, etc., and relativities apply in this context.  These, therefore, are issues that can be progressed through the existing channels in this respect.  I will look into this and ascertain the current position in respect of any discussions that may be under way.<\/p>  <p>  In respect of Deputy Paul Murphy's question, I did not hear Deputy Kehoe make those comments.  I would not agree with nor approve of those comments because drug addiction is very difficult for the individual in the first instance.  In our view, this must be about understanding the issues in respect of rehabilitation and helping people to come off addiction and providing the services to enable this to happen on a continuing and consistent basis.  I do not accept that our model is criminalisation driven.  I do not accept this at all.  For 30 years now, we have had a strong public health dimension to drugs in different iterations.  Fianna F&aacute;il has strongly supported drug task forces.  The Deputy should know this.  Previous Fianna F&aacute;il Ministers of State over the past 25 years did a hell of a lot in this area.  I think it was the former Deputy and Minister, Pat Rabbitte, who set up drug task force areas.  This approach was continued by subsequent Ministers of State such as Noel Ahern, John Curran, Eoin Ryan and many more.  <\/p>  <p>  We are anxious to intervene in communities at ground level.  We should condemn the traffickers and the drug barons who are destroying our young people and our city.  We have seen this in respect of the criminal gangs that have done great damage to the city of Dublin and to the country through selling drugs, getting people hooked on them and destroying the lives of those individuals and their families as a result.  We must have a health-based approach as the key approach to this issue.  Education is also important at the earlier stages, in respect of building up people's self-esteem in our education programmes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900032#EE00700","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Pre-European Council Meeting: Statements","time":1666185120,"counter":287,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900033#FF00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1666185120,"counter":288,"content":"<p>The European Council will meet in Brussels later this week on 20 and 21 October.<\/p>  <p>  Before turning to that meeting, I will briefly update the House on the first meeting of the European Political Community, which took place in Prague on 6 October, and on the informal meeting of the European Council that took place the following day.<\/p>  <p>  The first meeting of the European Political Community on 6 October was a welcome development in wider European political engagement.  It was hosted by the Prime Minister of the Czech Republic, Dr. Petr Fiala, with the support of the President of the European Council, Mr. Charles Michel.<\/p>  <p>  Forty-four states were invited to participate, including all 27 EU member states; the European Free Trade Agreement partner countries - Norway, Iceland, Switzerland and Liechtenstein; the UK; T&uuml;rkiye; the six Western Balkan countries - Serbia, Montenegro, Albania, North Macedonia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo; and five of the six Eastern Partnership countries - Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Moldova and Ukraine.  No invitation was extended to Belarus, given its ongoing facilitation of Russia's illegal and immoral war against Ukraine by permitting Russian armed forces to use its territory and by providing support to the Russian military.<\/p>  <p>  During the opening plenary session, interventions were made by the Prime Minister, Dr. Fiala, the President of Ukraine, Mr. Volodymyr Zelenskyy via video-conference, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Ms Liz Truss, the Prime Minister of Norway, Mr. Jonas Gahr St&oslash;re, and the Prime Minister of Albania, Mr. Edi Rama, on the opportunities presented by this new format for political dialogue and co-ordination.  The meeting achieved its primary aim of bringing together leaders from across the continent of Europe to recognise the considerable degree of common cause among us.  The formal agenda included Ukraine, energy and the European economy.  It was notable also for the welcome agreement reached in the margins with Armenia and Azerbaijan to accept a civilian EU mission alongside their border.<\/p>  <p>  The formation of a European Political Community, an idea originating with President Macron, was discussed by EU leaders at the June European Council.  There was broad agreement that there would be a value in a pan-continental political forum in which geopolitical challenges could be discussed candidly among leaders from the entire European neighbourhood.  I believe that its inaugural meeting demonstrated that it has a value and that it will neither cut across the process of EU enlargement as some had feared nor interfere with the important work of other pan-European bodies, such as the Council of Europe and the OECD.  Before leaving Prague, leaders agreed to meet again in the same format in the first half of next year in Moldova, and to meetings thereafter, in the second half of the year in Spain and in the UK in the first half of 2023.<\/p>  <p>  While I was at the European Political Community meeting, I participated in a round-table discussion on energy, climate and the economy co-chaired by the Greek Prime Minister, Mr. Kyriakos Mitsotakis, and the President of the Swiss Federation.  Common themes in the discussion included immediate-term pressures on energy costs for citizens and businesses in all of our countries, and the need for greater interconnection and an accelerated move to renewables as soon as practicable to ensure stable and secure pricing and supply on an ongoing basis.<\/p>  <p>  The meeting also offered welcome opportunities to meet with leaders from the wider European family.  I was pleased to have bilateral meetings with Ukraine, Albania and Bosnia.  The Prime Minister of Ukraine, Mr. Denys Shmyhal, once again expressed his heartfelt gratitude for Ireland's support for his government and people, as they continue to withstand Russian aggression.  He expressed his appreciation that Ireland continues to be to the forefront of advocating for Ukraine's membership of the EU, for the toughest possible sanctions against Russia and for holding Russia accountable, and that we are hosting more than 52,000 Ukrainian people in need of protection.  I assured him of our continued support at this time of terrible need and trauma in Ukraine.<\/p>  <p>  I also met with two of our partners in the Western Balkans - the Prime Minister of Albania, Mr. Edi Rama, and the Chairman of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina.  In both meetings, I expressed my support for them on their EU accession pathway.<\/p>  <p>  The members of the European Council held an informal meeting on 7 October.  Our discussion was a strategic one covering the topics of Ukraine, energy and economic issues to inform and prepare for our regular meeting later this week.<\/p>  <p>  The formal agenda for this week's European Council covers Ukraine, energy, economic issues and external relations.  The Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, will address external relations issues in his remarks later.  I will address all other issues.<\/p>  <p>  Leaders will discuss Russia's escalating war of aggression against Ukraine.  I expect leaders to send a strong message that the EU will stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes.  This week, the Council will discuss in particular how to continue to provide strong political, military and financial support to Ukraine, including for its liquidity needs, and how to step up our humanitarian response, in particular, as winter is approaching.  This week's meeting takes place against the backdrop of the despicable recent indiscriminate missile attacks against civilians and civilian infrastructure in Kyiv and across Ukraine.  It is also in the context of Russia's recent illegal annexation of the Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions.  As in the case of Crimea, we will never recognise these illegal annexations.<\/p>  <p>  The adoption of the eighth sanctions package on 6 October was very welcome.  Ireland has consistently supported imposing the strongest possible sanctions on Russia and we will continue to do so.  Ireland is also contributing to non-lethal military assistance to Ukraine via the European Peace Facility, which adopted its sixth tranche this week.  Even as war rages across Ukraine, life continues in cities and villages, farms, small businesses and public services across the country.  Ukraine faces challenges now in terms of immediate liquidity needs to ensure that basic state functions can continue to support the millions of Ukrainians at home.  I will discuss with fellow EU leaders the importance of agreeing quickly mechanisms to provide the liquidity support that we have agreed in principle to Ukraine without delay.<\/p>  <p>  When we meet this week, we will have an opportunity also to discuss EU support for Ukraine's reconstruction, which requires planning now and which will require a wider international partnership led by Ukraine with suitable governance structures.  Later this month, a conference hosted by the European Commission and the German G7 Presidency in Berlin will examine these issues in further detail.<\/p>  <p>  Leaders will also discuss the impact of Russia's war on global food security.  Russia's war has sparked a global food crisis causing disruptions to agricultural production, supply chains and trade that have driven world food and fertiliser prices to unprecedented levels.  The duration of the UN Black Sea grain initiative, which has been successful in ensuring the export of much-needed grain from Ukraine, is due to end next month.  I will join fellow leaders in calling for it to be extended beyond that time limit.<\/p>  <p>  As we see a continued uptick in hybrid attacks, EU leaders will also discuss how to ensure the security of critical infrastructure.  Deliberate acts of sabotage, such as those against the Nord Stream pipelines, need to be met with a united and determined response.<\/p>  <p>  At this week's meeting, EU leaders will further discuss energy issues, especially pricing and supply, which remain at the top of the European political agenda.  The issue was central to discussions at the informal meeting of the European Council in Prague.  The EU has since the illegal invasion of Ukraine taken significant measures in response to the use of energy as a weapon by Russia, both to underpin security of supply and to mitigate the impact of the dramatic prices increases we have seen for businesses and consumers.  These measures include: action to attract new supplies to support diversification away from Russian gas; a gas storage regulation to prepare the EU for a difficult winter; a gas demand regulation to seek to better balance supply and demand for gas; and a regulation on an emergency intervention to address high energy prices.<\/p>  <p>  The last of these - the emergency regulation - was adopted by the Council on 6 October and will enter into force on 1 December.  It provides for: a voluntary 10% electricity demand reduction over the winter, with a 5% reduction obligation during peak hours; a cap on the revenue of electricity producers using inframarginal sources such as renewables and nuclear; and a solidarity contribution from fossil fuel profits.<\/p>  <p>  The EU also adopted a temporary crisis framework on state aid to provide greater space for governments to support businesses affected by the economic consequences of the war, including those resulting from high energy prices.  As a result of these and other measures, we have seen a significant diversification away from Russian fossil fuels and towards more reliable suppliers, including Norway, the UK and the US.  Gas storage for the winter ahead across the EU now stands at more than 90%, with the targeted levels reached ahead of schedule.<\/p> <p>Nonetheless when European Union leaders met in Prague there was a clear view that more can and should be done at European Union level.  In advance of that meeting, President von der Leyen set out a roadmap of actions.  These include stepping up negotiations with reliable suppliers to reduce the price of imported gas, working with member states to develop an intervention to limit prices in the natural gas market, supporting a discussion aimed at limiting the inflationary impact of gas on electricity prices, and boosting investment to accelerate the green transition.<\/p> <p> Building on last week's discussions, and to inform our meeting this week, the European Commission yesterday published a communication on the energy emergency as well as an emergency regulation.  This is aimed at mitigating the impacts of high gas prices by addressing demand and supply, ensuring security of supply and enhancing solidarity.  The proposed package includes measures to facilitate joint purchase of gas using the EU's strength to ensure the best possible price, in particular to support the filling of gas storage next year.  It also includes provisions to increase solidarity and security of supply and measures aimed at dampening energy prices including development of a new benchmark for trading LNG in particular, and working with member states to develop ways to limit the impact of high gas prices on electricity.  Flanking measures being proposed include extension of the temporary crisis framework, making the cohesion framework policy more flexible and accelerating the transition to sustainable sources through RePowerEU.  Leaders will discuss these proposals this week, with detailed work to be taken forward by energy Ministers.<\/p> <p> As I have seen in my discussions with partners, these issues are complex and technical and need careful consideration, including to avoid unintended adverse consequences.  Any step we take must help us to reduce prices without risking security of supply.  Measures also need to take into consideration the very different situations in member states as well as their very different energy sources and mixes.<\/p> <p> In parallel with short-term actions, we need to accelerate the green transition and step up investments in future-ready energy infrastructure, including interconnections and innovative renewable technologies, to enhance our energy security and to meet our climate ambitions.  The European Commission will also speed up work on the structural reform of the electricity market to ensure it is fit for purpose in the future.<\/p> <p> As we have seen in recent months and weeks, Putin is prepared to use all means at his disposal, including disrupting international energy markets, to pursue his immoral war in Ukraine.  EU leaders have been clear that he will not succeed.  We will continue to stand in solidarity with Ukraine and with each other as we approach what may be a very difficult winter.  The European Council will also take stock of the economic situation more generally, which is dominated by the significant ramifications of the Russian war of aggression against Ukraine, which is pushing rising inflation to multi-decade highs.<\/p> <p> As the IMF highlighted last week in its latest World Economic Outlook, global economic activity is experiencing a broad-based and sharper than expected slowdown.  Global growth is forecast to slow from 6% in 2021 to 3.2% in 2022 and 2.7% in 2023.  This is one of the weakest growth profiles in recent times.  The 2023 slowdown is also expected to be broad-based, with countries accounting for about one third of the global economy poised to contract this year or next.  Our immediate priority must be to protect households, jobs and businesses, in particular the most vulnerable in our societies, while preserving the European Union's global competitiveness and the integrity of our Single Market.  In this context, I welcome the statement agreed by the Eurogroup finance ministers on 3 October on the fiscal policy response to high energy prices and inflationary pressures as well as their historic meeting with US Treasury Secretary Yellen in Washington on 14 October.<\/p> <p> As I said, the Minister of State, Deputy Thomas Byrne, will address the external relations issues on the agenda in his wrap-up statement.  This week's meeting of EU leaders will be an opportunity to take stock of the situation in Ukraine and the wider geopolitical context.  It will also be an important opportunity to discuss the energy challenges we face and their impact on our citizens as we face into the winter.  I will report to the House on our discussions after the meeting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900033#FF00200","speaker":"1458","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666185720,"counter":290,"content":"<p>The European Council will meet at a time of ongoing discussion on the Irish protocol.

To clarify further, I was being barracked and not <i>vice versa<\/i>.<\/p><p>The Taoiseach is aware that since Michelle O'Neill was elected First Minister designate in May, the DUP has refused to re-enter the Executive and appoint a deputy First Minister.  The DUP cites concerns around the protocol but the reality is it is holding democracy to ransom.  There is no justification for keeping Stormont on ice while these talks continue.  The DUP should be at the Executive table working to deliver for workers and families hit by a cost-of-living crisis.  People want to see their political leaders working together to tackle the big issues, such as investing in the health system and ensuring that people can pay their energy bills, and not the type of brinkmanship the DUP is currently engaged in.  I am sure the Taoiseach's message to the DUP when he visited the North recently was that it must get back into the Executive without any further delay.<\/p><p>The implementation issues around the protocol, and God knows they have been well rehearsed, can be resolved through dialogue, partnership and a genuine commitment to ensuring the needs of the people in the North and across the island are front and centre.  Our European partners are determined to resolve these issues.  It is imperative at this stage that this determination does not wain.  The determination from Europe must be matched with similar resolve from the British Government to reach agreement on any outstanding issues.  Therefore, it is crucial that the British Government, whoever might lead it, engages in good faith and constructive negotiations with the European Union.  It should not need repeating that the protocol exists because Brexiteers, including the Tories and the DUP, pursued Brexit despite warnings from far and wide on the effect of Brexit.  The protocol protects all-island trade, the Good Friday Agreement, communities and business in the North from the damage caused by Brexit.  Many businesses have spoken consistently of the effect of the protocol allowing continuing access to the EU market and the value of this.<\/p> <p>The protocol must be built upon and protected.  As the Taoiseach heads off to meet his European colleagues, I ask that he makes clear the ongoing need for the protocol to be protected and implemented in full, and that he encourages continued and steadfast engagement, such as we have seen from our European partners, so that no one is left with any misunderstanding that constructive, positive dialogue is the only way forward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900034#GG01400","speaker":"1466","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666186320,"counter":304,"content":"<p>Hopefully the Chair will be lenient with time due to the heckling and interruptions.<\/p>  <p>  Europe is arguably enmeshed in the most critical security crisis since the Second World War, a security crisis that continues to have national, regional and global ramifications.  Amid the horror of human rights abuses and war crimes committed by Russia, Vladimir Putin saw fit to introduce the unprecedented threat of nuclear attack, a development that has been utterly condemned by all right-thinking people across the globe for its utter recklessness.<\/p>  <p>  The effects of the war in Ukraine on climate change and regional instability have combined to produce a human crisis on a massive scale in the global south.  Without a commitment from the international community, the crisis in the Horn of Africa will continue to produce human suffering on an extraordinary scale.  I appeal to the Taoiseach and the Minister of State to ensure that humanitarian crises are placed at the centre of the EU agenda and that the clamour for war emanating from within sections of the EU is not allowed to overshadow the commitment to humanitarian and egalitarian principles, which the EU is purportedly grounded upon.<\/p>  <p>  As a militarily non-aligned nation, Ireland has a moral responsibility both to uphold that position and to harness the moral and ethical record of our role in international affairs as being the dissenting voice that can act as a counterweight, which places the humanitarian responsibilities of the EU at the forefront of discourse within the union.  In that vein, it is incumbent on us to draw attention to the recent totally unacceptable comments of Josep Borrell when he described Europe as the \"garden\" of the world and the world outside as a \"jungle\" trying to get in.  Such comments re-emphasise the need for countries such as Ireland to act as a moral counterweight to emerging narratives of European exceptionalism that, if left unchecked, could witness a return of the colonial mindset that wrought such a blight on the world in the past.<\/p>  <p>  I want to send solidarity to those in Iran who continue to protest against the unjust laws and human rights abuses that led to the death of a young woman in police custody, whose only crime was to offend a distorted and grotesque sense of morality through her refusal to wear a hijab.<\/p>  <p>  While I have spoken about Ireland's responsibility to be the voice in Europe that places international human rights at the centre of the EU agenda, the Government also has a central responsibility to address the needs of the Irish people both in Europe and Ireland.  The reality is the continuum of crises that have impacted on this Island in recent years have left large swathes of people in a very vulnerable position.  From Brexit, to Covid, to the ongoing impact of the war in Ukraine, the aggregate impact of these crises is being felt in almost every household.  In many respects, the failure of the coalition Government to provide the necessary leadership at home, in the face of the crushing cost-of-living crisis, has undermined its role in Europe.<\/p>  <p>  Current energy costs, the result of Russia&rsquo;s weaponisation of energy supplies, come at a time when many energy companies are enjoying record profits and have left many householders across the State with the stark and unimaginable choice of heating their homes or providing food for their families to eat.  The failure of the EU to address the energy crisis, coupled with the failure of the Government to address the crisis at home, merely compounds the misery for ordinary people and stands as a damning and unforgivable indictment of this Government's failure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900035#HH00200","speaker":"1625"},{"type":"speech","time":1666186320,"counter":305,"content":"<p>I thank the Taoiseach for outlining the developments at the meeting of the European political community on 6 October.  We know the meeting this week of European leaders, on 20 and 21 October, comes at a pivotal moment in the plans for tackling the energy emergency and cost-of-living crisis, as well as the ongoing response of Europe to Russia's brutal war against the people of Ukraine.  What matters most to people, however, is the tangible proposals that emerge from the Council meeting and whether they will be implemented before winter.<\/p>  <p>  Last weekend, I had the opportunity to attend the annual congress of the Party of European Socialists in Berlin on behalf of the Labour Party.  Among the addresses at the conference was that of German Chancellor Mr. Olaf Scholz, leader of the Social Democratic Party in Germany.  He spoke in support of the accession of western Balkan states.  I am glad the Taoiseach also spoke in support of the accession of Bosnia Herzegovina and Albania.<\/p>  <p>  At the congress in Berlin, socialists and social democrats from across Europe gathered to discuss policies on energy, inflation, climate change and social challenges.  I was privileged to meet with socialist prime ministers from the many countries across the EU who have already acted on energy prices.  I was privileged and proud to address members on the need for stronger collective bargaining rights and on the issue of a pay raise for workers, as well as the need for collective action on energy prices.  What I heard from leaders across Europe was about bold national actions being taken to reduce costs and tackle the energy crisis.  Unfortunately, here in Ireland, we have seen much slower progress by the Government on policies in this area.<\/p>  <p>  For many months, we in the Labour Party have been arguing for a comprehensive response to the energy in Ireland, including the introduction of a windfall tax on energy profits, a cap on the price of energy modelled on the Iberian approach, and the temporary nationalisation of the Corrib gas field.  Weeks on from the budget, despite the T&aacute;naiste confirming to me in this House last week that a windfall tax would be introduced, we still have no sense of when that will happen or, indeed, what type of tax it will be.  Will we have to rely on EU legislation for this tax or will provision be made for this in the Finance Bill?<\/p>  <p>  We have seen other member states take initiatives at national level, therefore, we do not need to wait for an EU-wide initiative.  As I mentioned, Spain and Portugal have already intervened.  The Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez of Spain and Prime Minister Antonio Costa of Portugal, with whom I engaged at the weekend, are both socialist prime ministers who have intervened to ensure there is state regulation of dysfunctional gas and electricity markets.  As socialists, they recognise that governments must act and intervene in the market to protect their people and they have saved billions of euro for their citizens by doing so.  Their Iberian model of energy cap has been the subject of intensive debate and interest in Europe over the past month, but it is still not clear if the EU will act or if something will come out of the European Council meeting later this week.<\/p>  <p>  I ask you Minister of State to speak to the Taoiseach and to confirm if Ireland will support the Spanish and Portuguese Iberian model introduced by our sister socialist parties.  The actions of Spain and Portugal have shown the sort of proactive measures that socialists in government can and have taken to protect their citizens from the fallout of Putin's brutal war in Ukraine.  We acknowledge that designing and costing an energy price cap is complex and that there are different ways to go about doing so, but we know that across this country households and businesses are suffering now and are fearful about the impact of the next energy bill upon their homes and businesses.  Once-off payments and energy credits of the sort the Government has introduced will simply not be enough because businesses are closing and people are struggling to heat their homes and we have not even entered the real winter months yet.  People cannot wait any longer for the EU to act and we are were calling on the Government to intervene now in the gas and electricity market in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  On the Council's deliberations on the war in Ukraine, it is good to hear the Taoiseach confirming strong solidarity across EU states in their opposition to Russia's brutal war and in their determination to give greater aid to Ukraine.  I ask that Ireland commits to giving more financial aid to support civilian social programmes, including funds to support education, health and social welfare, and to support local communities in welcoming Ukrainian visitors to Ireland, alongside investment for Ukraine in rebuilding and recovering from the despicable attacks we have seen on ordinary people.  I ask that the Council consider the escalatory attacks of Russia over the past week, assisted by Iranian-made drones.  We have seen the targeting of energy infrastructure and civilian apartment complexes by Russia, which are blatant war crimes.<\/p>  <p>  In response to a question from Deputy Howlin in the D&aacute;il last week, the Minister for Foreign Affairs confirmed there are 26 officers at the Embassy of the Russian Federation in Ireland, 11 diplomats and 15 administrative and technical staff.  What reason is there for 26 staff to be retained at the Russian Embassy here?<\/p> <p>We need to act and break off diplomatic relations with Russia.  We are seeing horrific war crimes being committed and escalating reactions in the past week alone.  Why can we not move to expel embassy staff?  I welcomed the expulsion of some embassy staff earlier in the conflict, but let us move further to expel the other staff.  At this point, we should flag the removal of our embassy from Russia.  It should and must become an international pariah.  I ask that stronger action be taken at EU level and here to express our outright condemnation of Russia's brutality and war crimes against Ukraine.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900035#HH00300","speaker":"1698","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666186920,"counter":307,"content":"<p>I welcome the Taoiseach's statement prior to the European Council meeting and the agenda for the meeting, which is to discuss Ukraine, energy, economic issues, external relations and the COP27 summit in a few weeks' time.

We have an opportunity to develop our indigenous energy resource, not just for our needs but to help Europe in the long run.  We can do that to become energy independent and also to solve this great existential crisis.<\/p>  <p>  COP27 is coming up in a few weeks' time in Egypt.  I watched a report on CNN today which discussed the importance of cities in the climate challenge we face.  Cities account for 75% of the world's emissions.  I read an interview with the mayor of Utrecht.  A delegation from Limerick city is in Utrecht this week to look at what it has done to become a sustainable city.  It is probably the lead city in the world in terms of sustainability.  As many Members will know, this centres around its approach to transport and liveability.  We have to follow cities like Utrecht, and I daresay in Limerick we are doing that.<\/p>  <p>  There was an incredibly positive announcement during the week, which the Taoiseach referenced, namely, the announcement of a new train station for Moyross.  It will be the first new train station in Limerick in a century.  It is not just a new train station; it is the first in a network of new train stations.  It is a new way of thinking about the development of our city and developing it in a sustainable way around a sustainable transport network.  We will see new stations in Ballysimon, Dooradoyle, Patrickswell, Adare, Lisnagry, Corbally and other places.  That is the vision we have, and Moyross is very much the start.<\/p>  <p>  I want to reference the OECD report published two weeks ago, which is very relevant to this discussion about cities and their importance in tackling the challenge we face.  The OECD report examined transport emissions in Ireland.  It found 20% of all of our emissions are related to transport and stated we need to change our system.  We cannot tinker around the edges.  Rather, we have to think about systems change, which is very challenging.  We have thought about the role of electric vehicles.  There certainly is a role for electric vehicles, but it is not the primary role in meeting the challenge we face.  In any decision we take we have to make sure that we do not reinforce the system we have.  The solution to transport emissions, which relates to cities as well as transport between cities, is to change our system completely to public transport and active travel.  Again related to Limerick, the work the active travel team is doing is wonderful and it has turned a corner.  Some of the schemes it has proposed in Limerick city will be held up as an exemplar for other local authorities in the country to follow.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900036#JJ00400","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speech","time":1666186920,"counter":310,"content":"<p>In 2016, the United Nations General Assembly proclaimed 2016 to 2025 the United Nations decade of action on nutrition.  It set out a concrete timeline for the implementation of commitments to meet a set of global nutrition targets by 2025 and identified what it called an unprecedented opportunity for addressing all forms of malnutrition.<\/p>  <p>  I do not know how I can make that commitment sit alongside what I heard on \"Morning Ireland\" today.  Paul Healy, Tr&oacute;caire's country director for Somalia, spoke to the programme from Dollow in south central Somalia.  He described a situation that he called an absolute disaster.  He said, \"Our stabilisation centre for severe and acute malnutrition is absolutely jam-packed with starving children\".  That is playing out all across central Somalia.  The lives of people have been completely destroyed by extreme drought.<\/p>  <p>  As Deputy Brady mentioned, the scale of the humanitarian catastrophe playing out across east Africa, the Horn of Africa in particular, is unthinkable.  In Somalia alone, over 1 million people have been displaced from their lands due to the scale of the drought.  Their land is gone; it is parched.  Their animals are dead and over 3 million livestock have been lost already.  The rains have failed for four consecutive years.  According to Paul Healy, this is deeper, longer and more severe than any drought in living memory.  He said on \"Morning Ireland\" that there are currently half a million children in Somalia on the edge of death.  I know the Minister of State has small children at home, as do I.  I cannot hear that statement and not relate it to my life.  If we think of the deep and lingering scar that we experienced on the Irish national psyche from the Great Famine, what is being played out in east Africa at the moment is worse.  Have no doubt that what we are seeing are climate refugees, among the first victims of a changed and changing climate.  They are paying a price for a crisis that is not of their making.  It is we in the global north who have historically had the greatest impact on the Earth's atmosphere, changing its composition through the use of fossil fuels.  It is we in the global north who continue to produce the greatest share of greenhouse gas emissions.  To put it in context, the average person in Ireland will generate over 90 times the carbon emissions of a Somalian in any given year.<\/p>  <p>  Mr. Healy welcomed Irish Aid putting forward &euro;30 million for the Horn of Africa.  I very much welcome it too, but the global community has to do a lot more.  Ireland was instrumental in the development of the sustainable development goals.  We co-chaired those sessions along with Kenya.  We cannot leave our involvement there.  We have to actively pursue the vindication of the sustainable development goals in any forum in which we have the opportunity to do so, be it in the UN or European Council meetings.  We also need to bring these issues to COP27, which this year will be hosted in Africa.  We have to put the issue of a loss and damage facility front and centre in those discussions.  Those who have contributed least to the issue of climate change are the ones who are on the front line and are suffering the most.  <\/p>  <p>  We talk about fairness in Ireland a lot.  We say, \"fair play\" to a Minister, cothrom na F&eacute;inne.  It is something that comes easily to our lips.  We need to apply the basic human principle of fairness across the board for us to have any hope of there being a just transition for people in the developing world.<\/p>  <p>  I will make a final comment on COP27.  I was, frankly, disgusted to see Coca-Cola, one of the largest, if not the largest, plastic polluters on the face of the earth announced as the event's sponsor.  If I brought a can of Coke in here or wore a Coca-Cola t-shirt, the Minister of State would eat me alive, and he would be dead right.  Yet, we see fit to splash it across the Conference of Parties where we are discussing the huge and driving need for us to work together to make a difference across climate change.<\/p> <p>This is greenwashing of the highest order.

As the Minister of State is aware, we have an exclusive economic zone, as do all coastal countries, of 200 miles.  It is estimated that we get approximately 15% to 20% of the fish in the waters of our exclusive economic zone, which are among the richest waters in the European Union.  Outside of the Common Fisheries Policy, can Members imagine any self-respecting country in the world accepting such a proportion of the wealth in its seas?  This precious resource should create wealth and jobs in coastal communities if we fish sustainably.  One of the features of the Common Fisheries Policy is that there is generally sustainable fishing and proper oversight of what is happening at sea, which is sadly not the case in many other parts of the world.<\/p>  <p>  We need to fish sustainably.  We need to get a balance of fish for our inshore and offshore fishermen.  That has not been attained.  It is shocking that even after Brexit, when we lost another 15% of the terrible share we had, that was not given back.  We got a redundancy payment called the Brexit adjustment reserve fund, which is now being used to invest in piers and harbours and decommission 60 vessels.  What will that mean?  I ask the Minister of State to remember this shocking statistic.  Our whitefish fleet will soon be one third of the size it was in 2005.  The potential of fishing in our coastal communities is being destroyed and we are not putting up a proper fight.  The world is not being told of the injustice that is occurring.  If we fought hard, that injustice could not be sustained because it is so profound.<\/p>  <p>  The latest development tells me everything about whoever runs the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, or the Department against the marine.  How can it be that every single fishing organisation in this State, from those representing local community groups and island and inshore fishermen to the co-operatives and producer organisations, has appealed and begged for financial assistance?  Such assistance is being provided by almost every other European member state with a coastal fishing community.  We have not done so and fishermen literally cannot afford to go to sea.  We have a disgraceful share of our fish, the impact of Brexit and we now have this.<\/p>  <p>  I appeal to the Minister of State, with his colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy McConalogue, to stand up for fishing in coastal communities in Europe and Ireland and confront the people in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine who are blocking doing what is right by our fishing communities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900037#KK00500","speaker":"1463"},{"type":"speech","time":1666187520,"counter":316,"content":"<p>I begin by welcoming the Georgian ambassador, Mr. George Zurabashvili, to the Chamber.  His presence is very welcome.  Our last pre-European Council statements coincided with the restrictions based on Georgia's accession to the European Union, following the advanced status given to Ukraine and Moldova.  In that time, 12 recommendations were attached to Georgia's candidacy.  It is very welcome that the Parliament of Georgia has established nine different working groups to advance those aims.<\/p>  <p>  There is an onus Ireland, as a country of a similar size, to extend the hand of friendship to Georgia.  The candidacy of Moldova and Ukraine will now be fast-tracked and, like Georgia, they also share a border with Russia.  Georgia has been occupied since 2008.  We cannot forget the Georgian people and their cause and I know we will not do so in this Chamber.<\/p>  <p>  These statements coincide with a period in which winter is descending upon us, as it is throughout Europe.  With homes becoming cold, people fear they will be unable to use their lights or heat their homes.  For the one in six people in Ireland experiencing poverty, the Government measures announced in the budget will keep the lights on for a while but rising costs mean that may not be the case for the whole winter.<\/p>  <p>  If the European Union is to mean anything - as a proud European, I believe it means a hell of a lot to us in Ireland - it has to stand up for people, especially in times of crisis.  We cannot simply say that rising energy costs or Russia's illegal invasion of Ukraine will mean that homes throughout Ireland may go cold this winter.  The European Union has to stand for far more than that.<\/p>  <p>  The greatest threat I see to the European Union is that of poverty and the poverty being experienced by the citizens within the Union who are not feeling the warmth of European Union membership.  We saw that in the case of Brexit when the communities in the UK that were suffering most at the coalface of poverty voted to leave the European Union.<\/p>  <p>  The last year of discussions on the European Union have rightly focused on Russia's illegal invasion of Ukraine.  Within the European Union, people are not only at risk of poverty but are experiencing hunger, malnutrition and inability to access heat in some cases.  My Green Party colleague, Deputy Leddin, highlighted that Germany was previously dependent on Russian gas for 70% of its energy needs.  Does that not encapsulate the problem when a leading EU member state is so closely tied to the Russian Federation?  If European Council meetings are to mean anything, they should be about how we move away from that as fast as possible and disentangle ourselves forever more from fossil fuel dependency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900037#KK00600","speaker":"1560"},{"type":"speech","time":1666187520,"counter":317,"content":"<p>I appreciate the opportunity to make a few points on the upcoming European Council meeting and also the inaugural meeting of the European Political Community, which is long overdue and extremely welcome.  It is a forum of aspirant and former member states that is much needed by everyone in the orbit of the European Union at a time when talking has never been this important.  Historically, the European Union has, sadly, treated many applicants from accession countries quite badly.  It has strung them along and put them on the long finger.  While at times there is a need for domestic reforms, this should not always be the responsibility of accession countries.  It is also the responsibility of the European Union to ease that process.<\/p>  <p>  This is a very welcome step forward.  The European Political Community is at the initial stages and is being done on a head-of-government basis, which is very welcome.  In due course, there must be an opportunity to provide for an interparliamentary and interministerial element in the European Political Community if it is to genuinely have a real endorsement from member state parliaments and have teeth.<\/p>  <p>  When it comes to Ireland-UK relationships, the inability to meet colleagues on the margins, as the Minister of State does at European Council meetings and parliamentarians do at meetings of the Conference of Parliamentary Committees for Union Affairs, COSAC, and elsewhere, has been diminishing to those relationships.  That has been very evident after a difficult couple of months.  We all hope we are starting to turn a corner, albeit a moving one.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the European Political Community, the Council of Europe, the OECD and other bodies and interparliamentary assemblies, we have to see a formalising of relationships and engagements between us and our British colleagues at interparliamentary and intergovernmental level, notwithstanding the desperate need to see the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement back up and fully running in due course.<\/p>  <p>  On the European Council meeting, which will take place later this week, like others, I welcome the eighth round of sanctions on Russia.  However, I fear that in the next month or six weeks, we will be talking about a ninth and, inevitably, a tenth round of sanctions.<\/p> <p>The scenes over the past few days of indiscriminate Russian bombing of Ukraine stand to that.  I would be making the point repeatedly at European Council meetings that sanctions on Russia or indeed Belarus, which we have seen extensively, are not good enough by themselves.  We also need sanctions on third-party actors that fuel the Russian war machine.  We are led to believe the Iranian Government has provided the drones for so many of the awful scenes we have witnessed over the last few days.  I also think more widely of the other states the EU has detailed and important relationships with.  These are countries that benefit from lucrative trade deals and other relationships with the EU and they have not put any sanctions on Vladimir Putin's vicious regime, or if they have they are fairly light-touch, to say the least.  Crucially, the biggest failures in that regard are within the EU itself.  They are within member states that are exploiting the loopholes and flagrantly breaching the sanctions or allowing business as usual to carry on as it suits them.  That is somewhere where we in the EU must get our own house in order.  We must make the point to other member states and other countries around the world that if they wish to continue to have a good, profitable and lucrative relationship with the EU on an economic, cultural and societal level, they need to start taking firm and genuine action against Vladimir Putin and his war machine.<\/p> <p> We can see how this ties into the situation with energy supply.  As we edge ever closer to the depths of winter and appreciate how much this is going to start to have a huge impact on every household across the EU and much more widely, we see the targeting by the Russian regime of power plants in Ukraine.  The regime has already used food as a weapon of war and now it is going to use energy and the ability to heat one's home as such a weapon.  It is an absolutely vile approach but when we look in an EU context at what is needed from this Council meeting, it is a swift decision on the level of intervention when it comes to the so-called windfall tax or to engaging with energy companies.  There is no point in individual member states, especially smaller ones, going it alone and it is disappointing when bigger ones do so.  Compare that with the vaccine roll-out when we worked as a collective EU 27.  That is how genuine improvement can be made.  I implore the Minister of State to ensure we see clear action at this week's Council meeting when it comes to energy.  There must be clear action that can be translated to the bills of people at home or in business to say this is something the EU has done and it is a saving the EU is ensuring every citizen can make the most of in advance of extremely difficult times.<\/p> <p> Another key point that will be discussed is the economy.  We are obviously aware of the impact of the war.  One of the areas I wanted to focus on was the resilience funds.  These were born out of the Covid-19 pandemic, which was a global pandemic the likes of which had not been seen for a century, but there is going to be a much greater need for them now and a much more diverse need.  That changing set of circumstances needs to be reflected in an ability for flexibility to allow member states to tweak their own resilience plans but crucially for the Commission to respond to any tweaks or alterations by member states in a swift manner.  Deputy Lahart and I attended a European Presidency meeting in Prague on behalf of the committees on budgetary oversight and finance.  The point was made that there is a huge concern that the needs of resilience and recovery plans will change or have changed but that unfortunately the Commission is being too slow in its response to member states.<\/p> <p> On the economy more widely, we can look at the data collected in the ESRI report on the UK's trading relationship with Ireland and the EU and how it has so drastically changed since Brexit.  There has been a massive drop in trade in both directions between Great Britain and the EU.  That is of huge concern.  We always said the impact of Brexit will be masked by the pandemic.  Now it is being masked by the war in Ukraine and the related crises that fall out of it, but we need increasing emphasis on engagement between Ireland and our EU member state partners.  The fact only 6% of SMEs are exporting to the Continent is worrying and shows the opportunity in these extremely challenging times for Irish businesses and the wider economy to limit the damage of Brexit and the more general economic challenges that are presenting, and to try to offset that as best as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900037#KK00700","speaker":"1473","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666188120,"counter":319,"content":"<p>I have less than two minutes so I want to focus on the issue of our neutrality.  One of the most formative experiences of my earlier political life was the beginning of the Iraq War in 2003.  That was a war built on lies.  It is estimated to have killed between 500,000 and over 1 million people.  The final chapter of the war and the resulting occupation was only closed in December 2021.  It was the opposition to the launching of the Iraq War that convinced me of the need for our neutrality.  I was not the only one as over 100,000 people took to the streets of Dublin and Belfast to protest that illegal invasion.  However, it is what I have learned since that has shown me the need for our neutrality to be protected.  I am shocked and outraged by the members of this Government who want us to join NATO and want to send our Defence Forces to war.  We would do well to remember that when this State canvassed for a seat on the UN Security Council, we made it clear to non-aligned countries that we would be champions for peace and pointed to our long and proud record of peacekeeping.  Now that we have won the seat, however, we seem to want to renege on our neutrality and I just do not get that.  The vast majority of people are in favour of neutrality and I am proud of our neutrality.

We have the power to act independently of the EU to decouple the price of gas, implement a windfall tax and cap electricity prices over the winter.  Gas prices have been at historically high levels for over a year and the Government failed to protect people last winter.  Artificially high electricity prices have meant the transfer of hundred of millions of euro from ordinary people to the coffers of companies.  For over a year the Government has repeatedly dismissed calls from Sinn F&eacute;in to stop gas from setting the price of electricity and to apply a windfall tax.  I have been asking since last November.  The Government did a U-turn on the reforms and the windfall tax as soon as it knew the tide had turned in Europe but the EU policies show an alarming lack of ambition.  We will still pay artificially high prices for wind energy, the windfall tax is far too low and will not even apply to electricity companies and we will still pay global gas prices for the gas from the Corrib field even though we are the only possible customers.<\/p>  <p>  If we continue to limit ourselves by the agreement that can be reached at EU level, the Government will again fail the people this winter.  There are real knock-on implications.  It may seem the Taoiseach and the Minister of State go to Europe and there are no consequences but there are real consequences when the electricity bills are hitting people's doormats, when people are living in fear and anxiety of those bills and when the Government could do something about it.  It is time to stop this nonsense of having electricity prices based on gas prices.

He revealed the cynical agenda and the attempt to condition Irish public opinion by exploiting the tragic situation in Ukraine to try to shred the last remnants of Ireland's neutrality.  We all of course condemn in the strongest terms Putin's bloody imperialist invasion and occupation of Ukraine and the attempt to crush the legitimate right of Ukrainians to self-determination.<\/p> <p>If anybody believes for one minute that this motivates Irish Government policy, the policy of the European Union or the major powers that dominate NATO, particularly the United States, France, the UK and so on, and that they have some principled opposition to military occupation, war, or that they support legitimate forms of resistance and struggles for self-determination, then they need to look again at what the European Union is doing.<\/p> <p> Let us look at Palestine.  A criminal siege of Gaza has been going on for 15 years, creating a permanent humanitarian crisis in a flagrant and ongoing breach of international law.  There is ongoing ethnic cleansing of Palestinians in the West Bank.  Some 750,000 illegal settlers are on land that, under international law, is Palestinian.  Are there any sanctions against Israel or any mention of sanctions against it in the Taoiseach's speech?  Is there any support for Palestinian armed resistance against an illegal occupation?  There is none at all.  If a Palestinian picked up a gun, there would be condemnation all round.  I am not proposing that they pick up guns, but could we at least take the guns out of the Israelis' hands?  Could we stop arming the Israelis and giving them favourable trade status?  There is not a word, because Israel is an ally of the powers that dominate the European Union and NATO, so Ireland does not care about the crimes it commits against the Palestinian people and it is not going to do anything about those crimes.<\/p> <p> Another particularly disgraceful example of the gross hypocrisy and double standards at work in the European Union and in our Government policy relates to the situation in Western Sahara.  We heard from representatives of the occupied, oppressed people of Western Sahara, who have been subject to a brutal military occupation by Morocco since the 1970s.  The United Nations believes it is an unjust occupation.  Most importantly, the European Court of Justice has issued three rulings saying that the trade deal and fisheries deal which have been concluded over the last years between the European Union and Morocco to steal the fish and phosphates from the people of Western Sahara is illegal.  The European courts annulled that deal, but the European Council and the European Commission have appealed the courts' rulings.  Ireland went along with it.  It is outrageous.  The only country which had the courage to stand with European legal decisions and international law, in insisting that the people of Western Sahara had the right to self-determination and to oppose a deal that they had not played any role in assenting to, which is required under international law, was Sweden.  Ireland, pathetically and outrageously, went along with it.<\/p> <p> Let us not forget about Saudi Arabia.  The irony is that we will increase our imports of energy from Saudi Arabia, which has simultaneously increased its oil and gas imports from Russia.  Saudi Arabia is effectively laundering Russian gas and oil, but we will do more deals with the Saudis to deal with our energy crisis.  It is the most brutal and autocratic regime imaginable.  Let us do away with the hypocrisy.  The Irish Government wants to shred our military neutrality and our political neutrality, which we should retain.  It wants to abandon the revolutionary traditions that founded this State and to join with the hypocrites and warmongers like the United States, France and Britain, which have foreign policy riddled with double standards.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900038#LL00400","speaker":"1478","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666188720,"counter":323,"content":"<p>Putin's brutal war on the people of Ukraine continues relentlessly.  His actions in recent weeks show that he is losing this war and the survival of his regime in Russia is now being questioned.  As we know, he has formally annexed four Ukrainian territories, Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia.  These areas constitute 15% of Ukrainian sovereign territory.  The annexation came about following sham referendums.  This is an illegal land grab which has no basis in international law.  Ireland, the EU and democracies of the international community will not recognise these Russian claims.  The fighting back and the counteroffensive by Ukrainian forces to take back control of these areas is extraordinary.  We are in awe of their exceptional bravery.  Some 300,000 reservists have been mobilised in Russia.  By all accounts, this move has been extremely unpopular with the Russian population.  Putin's threat to use nuclear weapons is chilling.  This threat has rightly been condemned by Ireland, the EU and much of the international community.<\/p>  <p>  In recent days, Russia has bombarded many Ukrainian cities, including Kyiv, with missiles, rockets and drone strikes.  Power plants are also being knocked out.  Civilian targets, including apartment buildings, have been singled out.  There have been many deaths.  Some of these strikes took place during the morning rush hour, thus causing the maximum possible casualties.  These activities surely constitute war crimes.  They must be investigated by the International Criminal Court.  There are also suggestions that the killer drones may have been manufactured in Iran.  If this is the case, the EU must consider imposing even tougher sanctions on that country.  If I have time, I will come back to the situation in Iran and recent events there.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the agreement reached by the EU on the eighth sanctions package.  I was pleased to see that Ireland, with others, was to the forefront in calling for these sanctions.  I note that EU foreign ministers, at their meeting in Luxembourg this week, agreed to send a two-year training mission for the Ukrainian Armed Forces, starting next month.  It will involve 15,000 Ukrainian troops.  This is an initiative under the EU's Common Security and Defence Policy.  Our Minister said that Ireland is agreeable to participating in this mission, given our skills in demining and dealing with improvised explosive devices.  The Irish response in this regard is reasonable, given the circumstances, but I suggest that the D&aacute;il should be kept fully involved about this matter as the situation evolves.<\/p>  <p>  Turning to the price of energy, we are all too well aware that wholesale energy prices have risen rapidly since the Russian invasion of Ukraine.  This is causing real hardship for householders and businesses.  Under European treaties, energy policy is a shared responsibility between EU member states.  The member states are free to decide on their own energy mix.  However, they are all subject to common energy market rules.  So far, the EU has agreed to a new regulation on gas storage.  The options for Ireland in that regard need to be finalised so that we can have gas storage in due course.  A new regulation has an objective of reducing the demand for gas.  There is a new regulation to deal with high energy prices.  As part of this, there will be a revenue cap for electricity producers with lower costs and a once-off windfall tax on excess profits in the energy sector.  These measures are welcome, given the complexity of the issue.<\/p>  <p>  Commissioner Kadri Simson will announce new proposals in respect of energy supply this week with a view to getting agreement of energy ministers when they meet on 25 October.  These measures include a new pricing benchmark to limit prices, a 15% cut in energy use which will be mandatory, the sharing of energy capacity through solidarity mechanisms and joint procurement of energy.  There is also talk of a longer-term reform of the energy market.  These new initiatives are all welcome.  They tie in with the goals of the European green deal and the objective of transitioning to net zero emissions by 2050.<\/p>  <p>  Of particular interest to Ireland is the aim to develop Europe's offshore wind energy.<\/p>  <p>Ireland is one of the most fossil fuel reliant countries in Europe.  It is reported that we spend &euro;1 million every hour on imports of fossil fuels.  We have a great deal of work to do to develop offshore wind energy in Ireland and we need to get moving in this regard.  It is clear that this energy crisis will extend into next winter too.  We need to be fully prepared for this.  I await developments at EU level concerning these matters.  I take a keen interest in how Ireland intends to implement these proposals in the weeks and months ahead.  <\/p> <p> It is worth highlighting that the first meeting of the European Political Community took place in Prague earlier this month.  This was an initiative of the French President, Emmanuel Macron.  The meeting was attended by 44 European nation-states, including Ireland.  The British Prime Minister, Liz Truss, also attended, thus giving the UK a chance to show solidarity with fellow European countries.  The European Political Community is a welcome initiative.  It is worth enhancing and developing this forum into the future.  No doubt it came about as a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine and, in particular, the need for democracies to come together and stand up to the threat posed by autocracies.  It also gives encouragement to applicants for full EU membership and demonstrates solidarity with them, which is a good thing.<\/p> <p> In the state of the Union address given by the President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, last month, she outlined the Commission&rsquo;s priorities for the coming year.  Her primary objective can be summarised as the goal of building up the EU&rsquo;s autonomy and self-reliance and of creating a strong alliance of democracies to confront the global threat of autocracy.  I look forward to seeing the details of the proposed defence of democracy initiative in the coming weeks.<\/p> <p> There is a great deal happening in regard to the EU and this European Council meeting.  I look forward to addressing the outcome of this meeting in due course - presumably next week - and to discussing the joint communiqu&eacute; which will issue from the European Council.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900039#MM00200","speaker":"1552","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666189320,"counter":325,"content":"<p>Since the beginning of this year, 140 Palestinians have been murdered by Israeli military forces in Palestine.

I begin by welcoming the creation of the European Political Community.  It is a good idea and a good initiative.  It is appropriate that EU and non-EU countries across Europe can sit around the same table and discuss the pressing matters of the day.  It was good that Belarus was not invited.  We have no cribs at all with the Belarusian people - quite the opposite in fact; we are supportive of them - but the Lukashenko regime should not be welcomed and it was not.  I am glad to see that.  It is important from Ireland&rsquo;s point of view that we involve ourselves in this new community, particularly in light of our new relationship with our nearest neighbour, which is now a third country.  I hope the Government and our diplomatic people are taking full advantage of that.  The best thing about the inaugural meeting in Prague was the decision to hold a subsequent meeting.  Next year&rsquo;s meeting is to take place in Moldova.  That is completely appropriate.  It sends all the right strategic signals, first of all to Moldova which wants to lean westwards and join the European Union.  It is important that we reassure it in that respect.  It also signals to Moscow that even though it has 1,500 troops in the Transnistria area of Moldova, the EU will not back away from supporting Moldova in that regard.  I welcome the creation of the European Political Community, which will make a positive contribution to the Continent.<\/p>  <p>  It is completely appropriate that the agenda for this week's meeting is quite rightly dominated by Ukraine.  I welcome the fact that the European Union continues to reassert its support from an economic, political, financial, diplomatic, logistical, military and humanitarian point of view.  That is also appropriate.<\/p>  <p>  I share the concerns about the possibility that the Black Sea grain deal will be wound down next month.  That would be bad for two reasons.  First, we need to get grain out of Odesa to the rest of the world and free up the silos for this year&rsquo;s harvest.  Second, it was the only chink of light from a diplomatic point of view over the past eight months.  It is something we should be building on rather than winding down.  I hope the Black Sea grain deal is expanded and extended into next year.<\/p>  <p>  I agree with the establishment of the European Union training mission that was announced on Monday, whereby Ukrainian troops will be trained most likely in Germany and Poland.  I welcome the fact that Ireland will make a very small contribution to that mission, particularly on de-mining and countering improvised explosive devices.  That is important because already we are starting to plan for a post-conflict situation.  Post conflict, there will be a great deal of ordnance in the ground.  This will disproportionately affect children who pick up these explosive devices and lose life and limb as a result.  The concern is whether our Defence Forces can actually facilitate that request.  We will not be able to provide a very meaningful contribution there.<\/p> <p>It will be tokenism more than anything else in light of the staffing and retention crisis in our armed forces at the moment.<\/p> <p> Turning to the energy issue, the Minister of State can correct me if I am wrong, but it seemed from the tone of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s opening remarks that we are trying to prevent energy prices rising further.  The focus should be on putting downward pressure on energy prices.  If the Minister of State can correct me, I look forward to it.  We should be looking to reduce energy prices rather than just stopping them from rising.  It is all about ambition.  Whatever that takes, whether it is price caps, windfall taxes or the decoupling of the gas market, we need to do this.  We know that there is a crisis in the EU in relation to the disconnect between the EU institutions and its citizenry across the Continent.  This was a classic example and a very important opportunity for the EU institutions to prove to the people that they can have a direct positive impact on their lives.  I would encourage as much ambition as possible from an energy point of view.<\/p> <p> On the Iranian situation, perhaps the Minister of State might be mentioning this in his closing remarks, but a very strong message needs to go to Tehran for two reasons.  The first and primary reason is that abuses of human rights and women&rsquo;s rights have been happening there over the past number of weeks &ndash; or number of years, one could argue.  The second reason is that loitering munitions, which are the so-called suicide or kamikaze drones, have been given to the Russians and have been used to devastating effect against civilian infrastructure in Kyiv.  <\/p> <p> In conclusion, I recognise the importance of the meeting on Thursday and Friday and the high stakes at play.  I wish Ireland&rsquo;s negotiating team the best.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900040#NN00400","speaker":"1587","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666189920,"counter":329,"content":"<p>I want to talk about the restoration land policy that is now being formulated by the Commission and the very significant impact it will have on this country.  At the outset, there needs to be much more discussion on this restoration policy.  It has to be modified greatly.  This country will suffer very severe consequences if it goes through as outlined in the proposals that we are seeing coming out of the Commission at the moment.  France and Germany seem to be pushing this policy.  As there are little or no peatlands in those two countries, it will have very little impact on them.  Sweden is fundamentally opposed to it, as is Finland.  We need to take a similar stance.<\/p>  <p>  This morning in the audiovisual room, we had a presentation on the economics of afforestation, on what it can do in respect of meeting our challenges on climate change and on the economic benefits it can bring to rural Ireland.  I met the chief executive of Coillte last week.  If the policy being proposed by the Commission comes forward in its present format, Coillte will be able to replant just 35% to 40% of its forestry land.  That land would have to be let grow wild, which would have an economic impact.  Consideration must also be given to the lack of calculation of the carbon sink of grown forestry.  The reality is that some of our peatland that trees are on at the moment is not suitable for forestry.  However, the majority of our peatland can grow Sitka spruce three times faster than other lands across continental Europe.  At the moment, Europe is only 80% self-sufficient in timber.  If we have learned anything from Ukraine, the energy crisis and the threat to food and energy security, surely it is that Europe has to concentrate and make sure it has security on all fronts as much as is practical.<\/p>  <p>  A representative from COPA-COGECA attended a meeting of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine two weeks ago.  The obligation that is being put on member states at the moment is that a minimum of 30% of land and sea, including all remaining primary and old-growth forests, has to come under this restoration law.  The devastation that this would have on rural Ireland would be immense.  <\/p>  <p>  The last time we had a significant designation of land in my part of Tipperary was for the hen harrier.  At the time, there was a promise that a good scheme, with adequate compensation, would be brought in.  The scheme lasted for two years.  The scheme which is there now is a pale imitation of the scheme that was there at the time when that this designation was introduced.  The designation on hen harrier land has managed to reduce the capital value of the land by 80% to 85%.  If the land was eligible for forestry, at the moment it would probably make &euro;6,000 or &euro;7,000 an acre as the price for forestry land is escalating rapidly.  However, if it was put on the open market with the designation, all it would make is &euro;1,200 to &euro;1,300 an acre.  This designation has had a huge economic impact on those landowners.<\/p>  <p>  That aside, they are saying that some of the arable land that has been drained over the years will have to be rewetted.  The Commission can hear this loud and clear.  There is no farmer in this country that will allow land that was painstakingly drained and put into arable production to be rewetted.  That is not a runner and it cannot be allowed to happen.<\/p>  <p>  This proposal on restoration is coming from Brussels.  Unless it is modified to properly suit this country, our forestry industry will be decimated.  We had representatives from the forestry sector there this morning.  They have huge challenges at the moment.  There is huge competition to get available land.  We had all the hassle with licences in the past.  They are waiting for a new forestry strategy that hopefully will mend some of their problems.  However, the restoration that is being proposed in Brussels at the moment has to be opposed by this country in the same way that Sweden and Finland are doing it, and it has to be modified.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900041#OO00200","speaker":"1611"},{"type":"speech","time":1666189920,"counter":330,"content":"<p>I commend the Taoiseach and the Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, on their work in Europe.  I want to especially welcome confirmation on the Commission&rsquo;s agreement on energy regulation to address high gas prices and security of supply.  It is unquestionable that the biggest issue facing businesses, small and large, in the country at the moment is rising energy costs as we face into the winter.  Obviously, the introduction of the temporary business energy support scheme, TBESS, in budget 2023 has been welcome.  However, there is still a genuine fear and a concern that it will not be enough.  Indeed, I have to echo the comments of my colleague Deputy Berry that we seem to be focused on just containing the price of energy, when the focus needs to be on driving it down.<\/p>  <p>  As I came into the Chamber today, I was contacted by Roy Davis, who runs the very popular SuperValu store in Longford town.  It is a run by a family who have continually invested in keeping their business modern and efficient.  As a result, their energy bills have been, in the main, manageable heretofore.  However, sadly, this is no longer the case.  Their energy bill has gone from &euro;10,000 per month to &euro;32,000 per month in the past year &ndash; an increase of 220%.  Even when we take into account the TBESS, their bills will still be &euro;14,000 per month higher than they were last year.  It is an incredible additional cost to have to carry.  The rain comes down upon us here in the Chamber, but we will persevere.  This is just one example of the many businesses struggling.  More needs to be done for them.<\/p>  <p>  I also welcome the announcement by the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, that a fleet of turbines will be bought to bolster the country's electricity supply and stave off outages.  They will account for &euro;350 million worth of the Government&rsquo;s emergency power generation capacity.  These mobile turbines are similar to what are deployed in countries in the wake of natural disasters, etc., where power plants have been destroyed.  Some 24 are to be bought and will be installed in two clusters at key points across the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900041#OO00300","speaker":"1597"},{"type":"speech","time":1666189920,"counter":331,"content":"<p>If the Deputy would like to relocate, I will pause the clock.

I do not want it to be raining down on top of them but what is going on is scandalous.  The Government has abandoned the people in this globalism and dragging us into a crowd we should not be in.  Does it have any idea of the impacts of this quarrel?  I spoke to the Minister of State, Deputy Thomas Byrne, previously about the import of grain.  He said there were no restrictions on grain coming into Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  I have before me a letter here from Paul and his partner Caroline, a wonderful couple from Cahir who adopted their son in Russia in 2014.  They brought him home to Ireland after a long and arduous campaign.  Their late grandad, John, who I knew well, set up a credit union account for him, as grandparents do.  In 2017, after John passed away, they transferred that few bob into the AIB branch in Cahir.  AIB has now sent a letter saying that he is one of the people affected due to the restrictions. It has not been easy for the parents of children adopted from Russia.  Can the Minister of State imagine their angst and anxiety on the evening they saw on television the outbreak of hostilities?  I praise Col&aacute;iste D&uacute;n Iascaigh, the school Kian is attending.  According to Paul, the school is incredible in how it offers supports for children in Cahir.  The town has one of the biggest populations of people from eastern Europe in Ireland per head of population.  Nationality does not matter in Cahir.  Now, however, courtesy of AIB, this boy's life has been devastated.

Will the windfall solidarity tax bring down the cost of energy for the 2.1 million domestic electricity customers in Ireland or is it just another tax?  Deputy Flaherty referred to mobile wind turbines.  It states on Electric Ireland bills that 64% of the electricity is from renewable energy, yet the costs are going up and Government Deputies are talking about mobile wind turbines.  If people go for paperless billing - which is a good idea - Electric Ireland will give them a percentage off.  That means it is built into the bill.  The energy providers say that those who pay by direct debit will pay less.  If a person pays on time, the provider gives the person money off.  That means it is all built into the original bill.  If the energy providers can take those charges off, that means they are built into the bill.  That is &euro;30 or &euro;40 on bills that could be done away with straightaway because it is an excessive charge.  The Government had control over the fuel taxes but it did nothing about it.  It is taking 50% in taxes on fuel.  Excise charges, VAT and everything else add up to 50% on petrol and 44% on diesel.

It is obvious what is going on.<\/p>  <p>  There are many issues that need to be raised at European level, such as why each member state has sat back while energy bills have spiralled out of control or how the price of a barrel of oil is spiralling downwards yet at the same time it has never been as high in Ireland as it is now.  It was &euro;2.05 a litre at the pumps in west Cork last weekend.  The Government takes 50% of that and throws it around to its little pet projects.<\/p>  <p>  In the short time I have, I will concentrate on the fishing industry as, when I attended the AGM of the Irish South and West Fish Producer's Organisation last Saturday week in Bantry, I was asked to raise a number of questions.  There is no doubt that the fishing industry is the industry that has been most abandoned by the State, not only years ago, but when this Government bought into a bad Brexit deal that almost wiped out the industry.  The only deal the Minister can speak about is decommissioning and tie-up schemes.  That is a shameful return for what could be one of the biggest employment industries in the country.  What the industry and I cannot understand is the current cost of fuel for boat users.  A fuel relief scheme is now in play in France and Spain for fishermen there and providing relief to hard-pressed fishermen, but there is not a cent from Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Green Party to fishermen in Ireland.  This is a further attempt to wipe out more Irish fishermen from our waters.  When will Fianna F&aacute;il learn how to treat Irish fishermen the same as their fellow fishermen in other EU countries are treated?  They do not want to be treated better.  All they ask for is equal treatment with their fellow Europeans.  That goes for quotas also.  There has been a lot of huffing and puffing but no delivery from the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy McConalogue.  All he ever mentions is decommissioning and tie-up schemes.  This is a shambles of a Government and that is obvious from the way it carries on with fishermen.  Its candidates should be run from every fisherman's door when the next election comes in.  That is certainly what will happen down in west Cork.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900042#PP00400","speaker":"1461"},{"type":"speech","time":1666190520,"counter":339,"content":"<p>In the two minutes I have, I will try to focus on certain issues.

I proudly canvassed against the Lisbon and Nice treaties on the grounds of the militarisation of Europe.  That militarisation continues unabated and I judge the comments of the Minister of State within that context.  If I was in any doubt at all, that was dispelled by the comments of Josep Borrell, the High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy.  He is unelected.  Addressing the former holder of that post, who is now the director of the College of Europe in Bruges, in the context of a pilot project for the training of diplomats, he stated:<\/p> <blockquote> \tBruges is a good example of the European garden.  Yes, Europe is a garden.  We have built a garden.  Everything works.  [He goes on to tell us everything that works]<br \/><br \/>The rest of the world - and you know this very well, Federica [His predecessor] - is not exactly a garden.  Most of the rest of the world is a jungle, and the jungle could invade the garden.  <\/blockquote>  <p>This is the man in charge of foreign policy in the EU.  He went on and on.  That is the language he used.  I have serious difficulties with that.  I wish I had time to elaborate on it, but I do not.<\/p><p>One year ago today, Israel declared six organisations to be terrorist organisations.  Many Deputies have asked questions on that issue and we have been told the Government remains seriously concerned.  Other than it being seriously concerned, not a step has been taken in respect of Israel's action.  Six human rights organisations were designated as terrorist organisations.  Arms conferences or arms fairs are hosted in Dublin.  There is a duplicity of language and a dual role in all this and, all the time, the Government is building up the State's military alliance with Europe - I absolutely deplore that alliance - without the permission of the Irish people.  The Taoiseach likes to talk about Orwell.  To refer to this as the European peace facility is to use Orwellian language.<\/p><p>It is terrible that there are now multiple layers in terms of how refugees are treated.  I am sure the Minister of State has seen the article published yesterday in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>in respect of naked refugees on the border between Greece and Turkey.

The incident is a direct result of what the EU has done in terms of its agreement with Turkey going back to 2016.<\/p><p>There is also the double role in Ireland when it comes to asylum seekers.

Britain will not be there, the EU is currently in negotiations with Britain, and the EU is fully united, thankfully, on the issue of the protocol.

I have quoted the Deputy exactly.<\/p>  <p>  I thank Deputies for their statements and it is very important that we engage in these debates before and after the European Council meeting.  The agenda was discussed and this was the main item yesterday in Luxembourg where I attended the General Affairs Council of the EU affairs ministers. <\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach said that a number of external relations matters would be discussed this week.  Leaders will discuss the EU&rsquo;s relations with Asia, in particular, with the ten Asian countries that make up the membership of the Association of South East Asian Nations, ASEAN, and in preparation for the upcoming EU-ASEAN Commemorative Summit on 14 December 2022.   Ireland is a strong supporter of EU-ASEAN relations.  The 45 years of partnership between the EU and ASEAN is a significant milestone.  A strong relationship with ASEAN is one of the most useful ways for the EU to deepen the political and economic relationship with southeast Asia.  The summit will be a key opportunity to give a strong political signal that we want to strengthen our strategic relations through concrete and practical co-operation so that the full potential of both regions can be realised.  It will also be an opportunity for the EU and ASEAN to demonstrate a shared political determination to address regional and global issues of concern.  The summit comes at a critical time in the current geopolitical context, with Russia&rsquo;s war in Ukraine, and the ongoing conflict in Myanmar.  It will be a welcome opportunity for the EU and ASEAN to clearly signal shared support for the international rules-based order.  Planned outputs from the summit will include a leaders' joint statement, signing of the EU-ASEAN Comprehensive Air Transport Agreement, and the signing of the EU partnership co-operation agreements with Malaysia and Thailand, respectively.<\/p>  <p>  Leaders will also have a strategic discussion on the EU&rsquo;s relationship with China.  China has long been recognised by the EU as a partner, a competitor and a rival.  The EU co-operates with China, for example, to address important global issues such as climate change and global health issues.  China is also a part of increasingly integrated global supply chains, as we saw clearly during the pandemic.  At the same time, this week&rsquo;s discussion takes place in the context of heightened geopolitical uncertainty, including as regards China&rsquo;s stance on Russia&rsquo;s war on Ukraine, credible evidence of crimes against humanity in Xinjiang, and genuine concerns about human rights in Hong Kong.  This week will be an opportunity to reflect on this important relationship for the EU and how we can, collectively, use our influence to shape developments. <\/p>  <p>  Leaders will also discuss the unjustifiable and unacceptable use of force by the Iranian authorities, as mentioned by Deputy Berry, against peaceful protestors, particularly targeted against women.  People in Iran, as everywhere else, have the right to peacefully protest and this must be protected.  On behalf of the Taoiseach, I asked at the General Affairs Council that this issue be raised at the European Council meeting and there will be conclusions on it.  <\/p>  <p>  The European Council will also take stock of one of the most important meetings coming up, which is COP27.  The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, UNFCCC, COP27, will take place in Sharm el-Sheikh, in Egypt in November.  This year will mark 30 years since the UNFCCC was adopted and seven years since the Paris Agreement was agreed at COP21.  The four goals of the incoming Egyptian Presidency are for increased ambition in the areas of mitigation, adaptation, finance and collaboration.  Ireland strongly supports the climate ambition of the EU and is committed to playing its part in achieving the target set by the EU to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by 2030.  There is an urgent need to strengthen the global response to the climate emergency in the face of increasingly intense and frequent extreme weather events, such as heat waves, wildfires and floods.<\/p>  <p>  To keep our 1.5&deg;C objective within reach, it is essential that collective efforts across the globe are strengthened.  Ireland also welcomed the outcome from COP26 last year that urged developed countries to double the collective provision of climate finance for adaptation.  In July this year, Ireland published its International Climate Finance Roadmap, which sets the pathway for achieving the target set by the Taoiseach at COP26 to provide at least &euro;225 million by 2025. <\/p>  <p>  Leaders will also take stock of preparations for COP15 of the UN Convention on Biological Diversity, which will take place in November to agree anew a global framework that provides for the transformative change that the biodiversity crisis urgently demands.  Ireland is committed to continuing to working effectively together in order that the EU and member states present a strong and coherent voice for nature and biodiversity at COP 15 to help bring about this change.  This will support our role in the High Ambition Coalition for Nature and People and also the commitments underpinning the leaders&rsquo; pledge for nature, signed at the UN Summit on Biodiversity in 2020.<\/p> <p>Ireland is currently developing its fourth national biodiversity action plan.  This will be underpinned by the objectives of the Convention on Biological Diversity, particularly the outcomes of the discussions at COP15.<\/p> <p> I thank Members for their participation in the debate.  Before I conclude, I want to give a flavour of the energy issues, which everybody has rightly raised.  What I feel is sometimes absent from the debate in this country is any acknowledgement of the complexity of the issues that surround us.  We go from one extreme, with Deputy O'Donoghue talking about direct debit mandates and paperless billing, but the issue is just far more complicated than that.  I agree those are issues we have to consider.  What we find is that every country has specificities.  We are specific because we are on an island.  The Corrib gas field was mentioned, but it provides a declining share of our gas and we have to import gas from elsewhere.  As the British Government has seen recently, none of us has complete control over this.  We only get results when we work together, and we must acknowledge that.<\/p> <p> Deputy Bacik mentioned the Spanish and Portuguese solution.  Yes, it is an attractive solution but it works for them because they have large volumes of renewable energy, particularly from solar energy.  However, it does imply a tax on the bills to pay for it.  It works for them at the moment but that is because they have a different situation from us.  We are not opposed to that but other countries have shown that they have different issues and not everybody agrees with that.<\/p> <p> We heard lots of talk about the decoupling of natural gas.  I would love to do that in the morning but no Member has put forward any plan to decouple natural gas prices from electricity prices.  They have simply asked for it.  One way of doing that is what we have done, which is the windfall tax on renewable producers.  That is a way of getting money back into the system from people who are earning too much money.  The reality is that the only way to completely decouple the gas price is not to use gas, or at least reduce it dramatically, and increase our renewables.  That is why we talk about increasing our renewables all of the time.  It is because we want, as was said, to decouple gas prices.<\/p> <p> The Commission put forward proposals yesterday and departments in this country and throughout the EU are examining those proposals relating the price of natural gas, which is clearly of huge concern.  This will be on the agenda tomorrow evening as the leaders make their decisions.  This is complex and there are different positions in every country, but we have achieved a lot already by working together.  When the leaders get into that room and the meetings are well prepared by officials and experts, and even through this debate, for example, with all of the ideas flowing into it, we can achieve results.  We achieved that last month with the windfall tax.  We must acknowledge that the way to do this is to work together.<\/p> <p> In fairness, if we consider the Taoiseach's contribution, the objective is clearly to reduce prices.  However, what he is concerned about on this island, where we only have the small Corrib gas field, is to ensure that we have a supply of natural gas.  I hear a lot of people asking for low prices, and the Government and myself want low prices, but nobody talks about making sure that we secure our gas supply in the short term, and we secure our energy and, hopefully, our renewable energy sources in the short-, medium- and longer-term.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900043#QQ00400","speaker":"1503","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1666191720,"counter":348,"content":"<p>Cuireadh an D&aacute;il ar fionra&iacute; ar 4.01 p.m. agus cuireadh t&uacute;s leis ar&iacute;s ar 5 p.m.<br \/><br \/>Sitting suspended at 4.01 p.m. and resumed at 5 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Message from Select Committee","time":1666192020,"counter":349,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900045#XX00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1666192020,"counter":350,"content":"<p>The Select Committee on Tourism, Culture, Arts, Sport and Media has completed its consideration of the National Cultural Institutions (National Concert Hall) (Amendment) Bill 2022 and has made amendments thereto.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900045#XX00200","speaker":"1511"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Central Bank (Individual Accountability Framework) Bill 2022: Second Stage (Resumed)","time":1666192020,"counter":351,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900045#XX00300"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1666192020,"counter":352,"content":"<p>Question again proposed: &quot;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&quot;<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1666192020,"counter":353,"content":"<p>I will continue from where the Minister of State, Deputy Fleming, left off.  I believe he made reference to the Bill's policy background and was on the verge of going into the key provisions.<\/p>  <p>  Part 1 deals with technical matters such as the interpretation provisions and the commencement of the Bill.  As the Minister of State referenced, the Central Bank will be undertaking a consultation process on the individual accountability framework.<\/p>  <p>  Part 2 provides for individual accountability and standards.  It amends the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013 to provide the Central Bank with a new regulation-making power.  In regulations, the bank will specify those responsibilities that are inherent to each pre-approval controlled function for the purposes of the senior executive accountability regime, SEAR, and prescribe other responsibilities that firms must allocate to appropriate senior individuals.  There will be also a provision allowing firms to allocate other responsibilities to senior individuals so that all relevant responsibilities within the firm are appropriately assigned.  The arrangements that firms will be required to adopt will include documenting how these responsibilities are assigned within the firm.  This process will provide the Central Bank with a clear picture of how each firm is operated.<\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank Reform Act 2010 will be amended to provide a new power for the bank to prescribe business standards with which regulated firms must comply.  This regulation-making power will allow the Central Bank to provide clear details of what is expected of firms to ensure they act in the interests of customers and the integrity of the market, that they act honestly, fairly and professionally, and that they act with due skill, care and diligence.  Amendments to the 2010 Act will also insert a duty of responsibility on senior executives subject to SEAR to take any reasonable step to ensure the affairs of the regulated firm for which they are responsible are conducted in such a way as to avoid a contravention of financial services legislation.  A similar duty will be imposed on all persons performing controlled functions to ensure they abide by the common conduct standards.  These standards will be spelled out in the legislation together with some examples of the expected behaviour.  These examples are intended to assist those subject to the common conduct standards to understand what is required of them.  In addition to the common conduct standards, senior individuals in regulated firms will have a similar duty to ensure they abide by additional conduct standards in accordance with the firm's obligations under financial services legislation.  The Bill sets out factors that the bank must take into account when assessing the reasonableness of the steps taken.<\/p>  <p>  Part 3 will make a series of amendments to Part 3 of the 2010 Act, which deals with the Central Bank's fitness and probity regime.  These amendments will extend the regime to certain categories of holding companies and persons performing controlled functions relating to them.  The extension of the regime to financial holding companies in their own right will make the regime available to the Central Bank as a supervisory and enforcement tool.  The amendments will also make changes to the operation of the regime to make it more efficient and effective and to ensure it conforms to the required standards of fairness in the administration of justice in light of the Zalewski case.<\/p>  <p>  Regulated financial service providers, RFSPs, and holding companies will be required to certify that they are satisfied that each person performing a controlled function relating to them is fit and proper.  The power of the Central Bank's deputy governor and head of financial regulation to conduct an investigation into the fitness and probity of a person performing a controlled function will be extended.  It will now apply to any person who performed a controlled function within the six-year period before the commencement of the investigation.  This will ensure that a person who anticipates being the subject of an investigation cannot thwart it by resigning before the investigation commences.<\/p>  <p>  The maximum period a person can be suspended by the head of financial regulation from performing a controlled function is extended to six months.  Under the Bill, the period for which the suspension can be further extended by the High Court is 24 months.  This will allow for a maximum suspension period of 30 months from the time the head of financial regulation confirms the suspension.  That decision to confirm a suspension notice will be appealable to the Irish Financial Services Appeals Tribunal, IFSAT.<\/p>  <p>  Where a person is prohibited by the Central Bank or the Governor from performing a controlled function either for a specified period or indefinitely, the bank or the Governor will be required to apply to the High Court for confirmation of the prohibition.  This requirement will not apply where the bank or the Governor enters into an agreement with the prohibited person whereby the person agrees to abide by the terms of the prohibition notice.  The existing legislation allows for a prohibition of up to two months without court confirmation.  The greater oversight role for the High Court is in line with the Zalewski decision.  The Bill also provides that the Central Bank, the Governor or the prohibited person can apply to the High Court for an order to vary or revoke a prohibition notice where this would be justified by a relevant change in circumstances since the prohibition was confirmed.  The Bill introduces additional safeguards to ensure the independence of decision makers in respect of the fitness and probity process.<\/p>  <p>  Part 4 will make a series of amendments to the Central Bank Act 1942, in particular Part IIIC of that Act, which deals with the Central Bank's administrative sanctions procedure, ASP.  These amendments will make changes to the operation of the ASP to clarify the processes involved, to ensure it conforms to the required standards of fairness in the administration of justice, and to adapt the ASP to provide for individual accountability.  A number of the changes to Part IIIC are necessary to break the \"participation link\".  This will facilitate individual accountability by removing the requirement that, before taking action against an individual, the Central Bank must first establish that a prescribed contravention has been committed by an RFSP in which the individual participated.  As under the individual accountability framework, there will be much broader individual accountability.  It is necessary to break the link and, to a large extent, do away with the concept of a person concerned in the management of an RFSP.  Participation in a prescribed contravention by a regulated firm will, however, continue to be a stand-alone contravention for which an individual can be held accountable.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill makes changes to Central Bank procedures in an inquiry to determine whether someone committed or participated in a prescribed contravention.<\/p> <p>The Bill also makes changes to the requirements for confirmation by the High Court of a decision of the Central Bank to impose a sanction following an inquiry.  Every such decision or, where the decision is appealed, any decision of the appeals tribunal in relation to such a decision, must be confirmed by the High Court before taking effect.  The High Court shall confirm such a decision unless there was a manifest and fundamental error of law or the sanction is manifestly disproportionate.<\/p> <p> The Bill introduces additional safeguards to ensure the independence of decision makers in relation to the operation of the ASP.  This will ensure that the same person does not perform functions or exercise powers of the Central Bank such as could result in unfairness to any person concerned.  There will be an appointment process for inquiry members involving the bank and the Minister.  A new chapter 4 will be inserted into Part IllC of the Act to provide that proceedings of an investigation or inquiry under that Part shall be absolutely privileged.<\/p> <p> Part 5 will make amendments to the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013 regarding the treatment of privileged legal material.  These amendments will provide for a process whereby a person may agree to provide privileged material to the Central Bank for specific purposes without waiving the privilege to any other person.  This process will provide a legally robust and clear mechanism to facilitate this limited disclosure to the Central Bank should a person voluntarily wish to disclose legally privileged material for the purposes of the performance of the Central Bank's functions under financial services legislation, and should the Central Bank agree to such disclosure.<\/p> <p> Part 6 provides for various miscellaneous amendments to the Central Bank Reform Act 2010, the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013 and the European Communities (Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities) Regulations 2011.<\/p> <p> Part 7 includes savings and transitional provisions to ensure there is certainty as to the provisions that apply to any investigation or inquiry already under way at the time certain provisions are commenced.<\/p> <p> The general scheme of the Bill has been considered by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach.  I thank the members of the joint committee for the time and effort they put into the preparation of its report.  While broadly supportive of the measures included in the Bill, that report made several recommendations.  I have written to the joint committee concerning these recommendations.  I look forward to the House's engagement on this legislation.  I commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900045#XX00500","speaker":"1558","continuing":true},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Visit of Portuguese Delegation","time":1666192620,"counter":355,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900046#YY00200"},{"type":"speech","time":1666192620,"counter":356,"content":"<p>Ba mhaith liom c&eacute;ad m&iacute;le f&aacute;ilte a chur roimh Uachtar&aacute;n na Portaing&eacute;ile, an tUasal Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, at&aacute; in&aacute;r measc inniu.

T&aacute; m&iacute;le f&aacute;ilte rompu agus t&aacute; s&uacute;il agam go mbainfidh siad sult as an turas.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the opportunity to speak on this legislation.  Many have waited a long time for the introduction of this legislation, too long a time.  All customers, whatever the company, product or service concerned, have the right to be treated fairly and have their interests upheld.  At the very least, they should be safe in the knowledge that they will be protected from gross misconduct, unethical behaviour and corporate mismanagement.  For far too long, customers of banking and financial services have not been afforded that protection and have not confidence that when they are the victims of misconduct or mismanagement at the top of our banking and finance sector that those responsible will be held to account.<\/p>  <p>  More than a decade since the Irish banking sector plunged our economy into crisis, it is shocking that we are only today debating legislation that would allow senior bank and financial services executives to be held to account for their failures.  The financial crisis revealed a culture at the heart of our banking sector that prized corporate greed at the expense of good governance and consumer welfare.  Unfortunately, that culture was allowed to fester when Irish citizens were paying the price.  The deep mistrust felt towards the sector finds its origins in the financial crash of 2008, but this by no means is the only reason or explanation for the public mistrust of the banking sector.<\/p>  <p>  As a result of the tracker mortgage scandal, banks have been fined more than &euro;270 million, with &euro;680 million paid out to more than 40,000 customers in compensation.  This scandal saw banks move customers onto more expensive interest rates, depriving them of the benefits of the cheaper interest rates they were entitled to.  These headline figures fail to convey the harm and devastation that the banks visited on citizens and families.  The banks' actions led to the loss of 327 family homes.  As well as the financial harm inflicted on families, the impact of the banks' actions on the mental health of customers will never be quantified.  As the Central Bank of Ireland has noted, when the examination began in 2015, some lenders initially attempted to minimise the number of affected customers to whom they would have to pay redress and compensation.  <\/p>  <p>  The fines imposed by the Central Bank on retail banks highlight a litany of failures that should bring shame to those responsible.  The enforcement actions published by the regulator spoke of the unacceptable and avoidable harm caused to their customers by the devastating impact of the banks' failures.  Shockingly, the Central Bank found that banks, including the Bank of Ireland, KBC, Ulster Bank and AIB, continued to mete out harm to their customers even during the tracker mortgage examination.  Failing to comply with the stop-the-harm principles of the examination, they adopted a culture of continuing to harm, with family homes being lost even during that time.<\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank described in shocking detail the unacceptable harm Permanent TSB caused to its tracker mortgage customers, from extended periods of significant overcharging to the loss of 12 family homes; the impact of KBC's failings on its customers, which was devastating and included significant overcharging and the loss of 66 properties; how Ulster Bank caused unacceptable and avoidable harm to its impacted tracker mortgage customers from extended periods of significant overcharging to the loss of 43 properties, 29 of which were family homes; how Bank of Ireland, when faced with a choice, prioritised its own interests with little or no regard given to the impact on its customers, resulting in a significant and, at times, devastating impact on nearly 16,000 customers and leading to the loss of 25 family homes; and with respect to AIB, a litany of failings resulted in significant financial strain and distress for those affected and their families and the loss of 13 family homes.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to read these devastating findings into the Official Report.  As I said, however, these fail to convey the financial, emotional and mental devastation that these actions caused to those affected.  It should be a cause of astonishment and deep anger that banks were found to have breached regulations even as recently as this year.  Despite the devastation visited upon borrowers and families as a result of this scandal and the behaviour of the banks, not one individual has been held to account.  That is truly shameful.  The Public Trust in Banking Survey 2022, published by the Irish Banking Culture Board, IBCB, found that only 22% of people believe Irish banks have leadership teams that act with integrity, particularly when things go wrong, with general trust in the banking sector remaining low.  This lack of trust is not a general feeling that banks prioritise themselves above the needs of their customers, but a demonstrable fact that has been established by each enforcement action published by the Central Bank in recent years.<\/p> <p>Public mistrust in the banks is driven by real examples, by real lives and by real harm caused by real actions.  It is clear is this public mistrust is well founded.  This mistrust, together with banking failures - the tracker mortgage scandal, for example - demands an outcome-driven response.  For too long, a rotten culture has been allowed to fester at the heart of the banking sector.  Bad behaviour has been unaccountable.<\/p> <p> In July 2018, the Central Bank published its report, Behaviour and Culture of the Irish Retail Banks, on foot of the tracker mortgage scandal.  Its recommendations included a call for legislation to introduce a new financial accountability framework including new conduct standards, a senior executive regime, enhancements to the fitness and probity regime and an enforcement process.  The recommendations sought to ensure that senior bankers would be held to account for their actions.  They were not radical or novel proposals.<\/p> <p> In January 2017, Sinn F&eacute;in brought a motion to the D&aacute;il calling for legislation to ensure that individuals in financial institutions would be held to account.  A senior accountability regime was introduced in Britain in 2016 and in Australia in 2017.  It is disappointing that it has taken nearly six years since we brought the motion to the D&aacute;il, and over four years since the Central Bank made its recommendations, for this legislation to be brought before this House.  This delay reflects what I believe has been the lack of priority and urgency attached to the issue by this and previous Governments.<\/p> <p> The Central Bank (Individual Accountability Framework) Bill aims to finally bring individual accountability to bear on the financial services industry.  Its enactment would be followed by the Central Bank issuing draft regulations and guidelines for public consultation and it would grant the Central Bank the powers to implement a new individual accountability framework for senior executives and regulated financial service providers.<\/p> <p> There are four key pillars to the individual accountability framework.  First, there will be a new senior executive accountability regime.  This will involve the regulator setting out details of inherent and allocated responsibilities and requirements, including statements of responsibility and management responsibility maps.  Senior executives with pre-approval control functions, such as executives and non-executive directors, chairpersons of the board and key committees, heads of finance and heads of audit, will now be subject to the new regime.  However, the definition of senior executive function is not given in the Bill but will, instead, be given in the Central Bank regulations that will follow its enactment.  Similarly, the Bill does not detail the sectors that would be included under the regime, with these, too, to be set out in the Central Bank regulations.<\/p> <p> Second, there will be new conduct standards for firms, their management and staff.  These will include new business standards, such as requiring firms to act in the best interests of consumers and not mislead their customers.  It will also include common and additional conduct standards that will apply to performing control functions, such as requiring individuals to act honestly and with integrity.<\/p> <p> Third, there will be enhancements to the fitness and probity regime.  For example, a new certification requirement will be introduced similar to that already in place in Britain.  An important provision of the Bill is that it extends the scope of investigations to include individuals in a control function position in holding companies and allows the Central Bank to undertake an investigation with respect to the fitness and probity of any person who performed a control function up to six years prior to the investigation.  At present, the regulator can only investigate individuals who are in the position at the time when the investigation begins.<\/p> <p> Fourth, the Bill strengthens the enforcement capabilities of the Central Bank.  A crucial part of this is breaking the participation link.  This means that the Central Bank will no longer be required to prove breaches against a firm before it can pursue sanctions or hold individuals to account who held positions within that firm.  That is a crucial provision.  The Bill further includes provisions giving the High Court oversight of the settlement process under the administration sanction procedures and requiring it to confirm sanctions imposed by the Central Bank.<\/p> <p> I welcome the provisions of the Bill.  They are long overdue but, plainly, the D&aacute;il, the regulator and the public have waited far too long for legislation that will finally enable the regulator to hold senior bankers to account.  Citizens who have been subject to untold and significant harm at the hands of the banking industry have had to suffer while those responsible have gone unnamed and unpunished and that should never have been the case.<\/p> <p> It is long overdue that accountability and individual responsibility are being put at the centre of how banks and financial firms operate so that consumer welfare is a priority rather than an afterthought with devastating consequences.  I welcome the provisions of this legislation, while noting that many details of the scope and application will be set out in regulations to be published by the Central Bank.  It is crucial that what we have on paper is enforceable in practice.  Sinn F&eacute;in looks forward to scrutinising these elements of the Bill on Committee Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900046#YY00600","speaker":"1462","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666193220,"counter":360,"content":"<p>This legislation aims to improve the accountability - perhaps I should say it will \"introduce\" accountability - of senior executives in the banking, insurance and wider financial sector and should ultimately protect customers and even the wider economy, which can suffer when the financial sector is left unregulated.  This legislation, as has been said, is sorely needed and well overdue.<\/p>  <p>  An individual accountability regime was introduced in Britain in 2016 in the form of the senior managers and certification regime and in Australia in 2017 with the introduction of the banking executive accountability regime.  In 2017, Sinn F&eacute;in brought forward a motion to the D&aacute;il calling for legislation that would ensure individuals in financial institutions could be held to account.  The proposal that provides the basis of this legislation came from the Central Bank four years ago.<\/p>  <p>  All of these reforms were really put in motion by the experience of the global financial crisis.  The financial crash in 2008 utterly destroyed public confidence in the financial sector.  Indeed, it utterly destroyed this country and we are still paying the price for it in much of what we talk about today in education, health and elsewhere.  The staggering lack of accountability of the financial and banking sector was laid bare and trust has not been restored to date.<\/p>  <p>  By comparison, days after the collapse the Icelandic authorities designed a comprehensive policy of accountability based on two overlapping objectives - establishing the truth and punishing those responsible.  An independent truth commission was mandated to document the causes of the meltdown and an office of the special prosecutor was established and tasked with thoroughly investigating and prosecuting those who were responsible for any crimes committed.  The special prosecutor's office successfully prosecuted 40 bank executives.  That is the standard we should be aiming for.<\/p>  <p>  Fundamentally, it should be a question of trust.  There should be sufficient Government safeguards and people should be held to account for their actions.  The most effective way to manage bad behaviour and reduce bad outcomes is to have real accountability.<\/p>  <p>  The senior executive accountability regime has the potential to delivery greater levels of accountability but much work needs to be done in terms of the detail.  It will provide a duty of responsibility.  I would be interested to know why the language proposed by the Central Bank, to the effect that executives must take all reasonable steps, has been changed to provide that they must take all steps that are \"reasonable in the circumstances\".  I hope this does not represent an attempt to water down this legislation.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the management responsibility maps as a mechanism to ensure that senior managers understand what is expected of them and that there are no overlaps or, more importantly, underlaps in who is responsible for what.<\/p>  <p>  The legislation will also introduce a conduct of standards.  As the Minister of State said yesterday, the conduct standards are \"unremarkable\" and \"outline the expectations of financial sector executives to act with honesty and integrity, due skill, care and diligence [and] to co-operate with the regulator\".  However, these are basic standards that have too often not been adhered to.  This was all too obvious in the pain and stress suffered by individuals and families during the tracker mortgage scandal.  In many cases, the overcharging ran into tens of thousands of euro.  In the worst cases, people lost their homes as a direct result of the bank action.  The Minister, Deputy Donohoe, will remember that when I was a member of the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach, some of the people who were impacted by the tracker mortgage scandal came before the committee.  It was devastating to see the way their lives had been destroyed.  That is reflected somewhat in the &euro;680 million compensation and the &euro;270 million in fines, but there were 327 homes lost.  The time that was lost by families who suffered and the quality of life that was impacted was devastating across this State.  In many cases, the overcharging ran into tens of thousands of euro.  In the worst case scenarios, as I said, people lost their homes.  It is often blamed on the toxic culture in the banks and financial services sector.  I note there is somebody else here to contribute.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome this Bill.  I hope it will do what it is intended to do.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900047#ZZ00200","speaker":"1501"},{"type":"speech","time":1666193820,"counter":361,"content":"<p>When speaking about regulations such as these it is hard not to think about the financial crash.  I did my leaving certificate in 2008 and went on to study finance.  It was ever present in all I studied at the time.  An acronym that was referenced a lot was \"IBGYBG\", which stood for \"I'll be gone.  You'll be gone\".  I will have got my commission and the person I sold to will have sold on and neither of us will be held accountable when something goes wrong.  After studying finance I worked in banking and derivatives.  This was always in the background.  When we began looking at these particular proposals, it came to mind again.<\/p>  <p>  The introduction of a new financial regulation with an emphasis on individual and personal accountability and responsibility is very welcome.  We cannot have a situation where financial professionals who have engaged in wrongdoing and failed in their fiduciary duties can hide behind a corporate veil.  We recognise that we live in an era of financialisation when financial markets and institutions are gaining greater influence.  We now have banks that are seen as being too big to fail.  In advanced countries the banking sector has become concentrated.  This provides it with significant power.  Our banking sector concentration is high even by international standards.  With great power there needs to be great accountability.  The Minister's new framework will introduce new conduct standards.  It will enhance the existing fitness and probity regime.  It will lay out the individual responsibilities of each senior executive and strengthen the Central Bank's administrative sanctions procedures.  This will mean that individuals can be pursued directly for their misconduct as opposed to general participation of a firm's wrongdoing.  I welcome these changes.<\/p>  <p>  I have a query and the Minister can correct me if I am wrong, which I am sure he would.  From what I can see the Bill only applies to certain customer-facing firms.  This would mean those non-bank firms engaged in bank-like activities, that is, shadow banks, would not be included.  Let us consider the size of the shadow banking sector compared to our domestic banking sector.  In 2021, the sum total of the assets of AIB, Bank of Ireland, KBC, Ulster Bank and Permanent TSB was &euro;343 billion while the size of the shadow banking sector is estimated to be in the trillions of euro.  It has approximately &euro;4.6 trillion worth of assets under administration here.  Directors of these firms will not be held to the same standard.  I worry this is a major weakness in the Bill.<\/p>  <p>  We know from the financial crash that many large banks used shadow banks for a variety of reasons.  They are not mutually exclusive.  There can be the creation of grey areas where regulatory arbitrage might occur and enforcement issues could arise.  If we take a securitisation transaction, when a bank makes a sale of a portfolio of non-performing mortgage assets to a special purpose vehicle, SPV, if there is a lack of clarity on the legal ownership of the collateral in this situation, the legal title to the security is splintered into many hands.  This makes enforcement difficult.  I would like the Minister to address this in his response.<\/p>  <p>  I am concerned that a similar problematic enforcement situation could occur with the senior executive accountability regime.  Senior executives of banks will be under the regime but the directors of a connected SPV will not.  If some wrongdoing were to happen that was part of a complex chain of transactions involving various SPVs, and that wrongdoing occurred at the level of a vehicle, would the senior executive at the bank be able to credibly say it was nothing to do with the bank and to take it up with directors of the nominally independent firm?  Those directors would not be under the senior executive accountability regime.  This is an issue.  I have more points but I am running out of time and this is the particular issue I would like the Minister to address his closing remarks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900048#AAA00100","speaker":"1579"},{"type":"speech","time":1666193820,"counter":362,"content":"<p>This is a good but long overdue day.  Several years after the Central Bank recommended that our laws be amended to make individual decision-makers and financial institutions responsible for their actions, we finally have a Bill before us to make it a reality.  The recent history of banking in this country has been well documented.  There was an absence of strong regulation and too close a relationship between bankers and regulators, all egged on by Governments in the 2000 that were satisfied to leave them at it for as long as the stamp duty kept rolling in and mortgage loans were approved.  Our society is still damaged by the effects of the financial crash.  The victims of the crash and the policies that allowed the collapse to occur are to be found in the lines of those queueing to rent a home they will not get or to view a home they cannot afford.  There is a direct line to be drawn between the behaviour of the banks in the early 2000s and the hands-off regulation at the time and the housing crisis we are now experiencing.<\/p>  <p>  Since 2010, the banking regulatory environment has changed dramatically.  Serious restrictions are now placed on banks with regard to their capital requirements.  Stress testing of potential homeowners in mortgage applications is rigorous.  We know that changes have been proposed by the Central Bank.  We have a strengthened Central Bank with teeth and a good and functioning Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman.  We have a new banking culture board that aims to drive culture change across the retail banks.  These are all welcome developments that will make a major difference to the way in which the retail banking sector operates in this country.  It will be better regulated, more customer focused and more transparent but far from perfect.<\/p>  <p>  One piece has always been missing.  While this is a good day, the question that must be asked is why we had to wait so long for an individual accountability regime to be established.  Earlier I mentioned how our dysfunctional housing system owes much to the continuing playing out of the socioeconomic impact of the financial crash and the collapse of the public finances.  It is important to understand that the tracker mortgage scandal of epic proportions, which deprived people of their homes, cost them relationships and cost lives, can be traced back to a culture of impunity at corporate and individual level in all the major retail banks.<\/p>  <p>  Less than one month ago, the Central Bank issued a fine of more than &euro;100 million for a series of significant and long-running failings with regard to 16,000 tracker mortgage customers between 2004 and 2022 in respect of Bank of Ireland.  These failings involve the loss of 25 family homes.  The Central Bank said this could have been avoided if Bank of Ireland had met its most basic and fundamental obligations.  Bank of Ireland is not alone.  Mention must also be made of AIB, Permanent TSB, KBC and Ulster Bank.  They were all at it.  No major bank escapes our gaze on this.<\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank report of 2018 pointed to the fact the tracker mortgage examination noted the cultural failings when it came to the tracker mortgage scandal, along with poor systems, weak internal controls and poor governance.  All of these when taken together caused devastating impacts on consumers.  We need to reflect on this.  We must remember that at the most basic level it is human beings who make decisions, individually and collectively.  People make decisions and not just firms.  One of the biggest stains on our society is that a single individual has yet to be held to account for the horror the banks perpetrated against thousands of tracker mortgage customers who, when we strip it all down, had money stolen from them in a calculated and deliberate way.  This is what the tracker mortgage scandal amounts to.<\/p>  <p>  It is worth reminding the House that to date there has been only one inquiry into the involvement of an individual in the tracker mortgage saga.  I understand the person worked for PTSB and the investigation is ongoing.  If ever proof were needed of the demand for a functioning fit-for-purpose set of laws and regulations to make individuals accountable for their decisions, it is the very existence of only one investigation regarding tracker mortgages.<\/p>  <p>  We should not be surprised that the level of trust in Irish banking is low.  This has been referenced by previous speakers.  The chair of the Irish Banking Culture Board, Mr. Justice Hedigan, said when the board published its &Eacute;ist survey this year that more work needs to be done to address the deeply ingrained feelings of distrust towards the banking sector among the public.  Mr. Justice Hedigan went on to remark that continued positive behaviour on behalf of the retail banks is necessary to further restore public trust in the sector.  He said this in good faith.  It was a week before AIB tried to railroad through a plan to slash its branch network without consultation and with no thought for those who would be most impacted.  This was followed by a hasty retreat after a series of significant political interventions.  I hope AIB has learned some valuable lessons in this regard.  This is not how to win back trust; in fact, it is quite the opposite.<\/p> <p>These proposals, which will be exceptionally important in rebuilding that trust, are overdue and it is a pity we had to wait so long for the establishment of a system of individual accountability, the kind of system that has been operating well in the UK and Australia for some years.  It is encouraging that reviews of the UK and Australian systems have reported positive impacts on culture and governance and, significantly, that no challenges were experienced in attracting skilled and experienced staff to the financial services sector as a result of the robust accountability regime introduced in those jurisdictions.  This is important from the point of view of the financial services sector here, a sector which is becoming increasingly important for the economy and the provision of good jobs throughout the country.<\/p> <p> People who work in the financial sector ought not to fear anything from improved regulation and enhanced accountability; in fact, it should be embraced.  This new regime should and can be worn as a badge of honour for Ireland and could be seen as another important step towards better governance and compliance with international best practice.<\/p> <p> Both the Minister and the Minister of State, Deputy Fleming, have highlighted in some detail many of the key elements of the Bill.  The Labour Party supports the Bill and will propose appropriate amendments on Committee and Report Stages.  It has been through the regulatory impact assessment process, which has summarised the purpose of the Bill in a succinct way.  It states that the intention of the legislation is to act as a driver for the recognition of responsibilities by individuals to mitigate the risk of misconduct by firms and deliver better outcomes for consumers and protected markets.  It will introduce conduct standards for controlled function roles in all firms and clarify the lines of responsibility and decision-making processes within relevant firms.  It will build on the Central Bank's existing powers and enhance the bank's ability to hold senior executives and other individuals to account.  It will bring efficiencies to the supervisory and enforcement work of the Central Bank by enforcing greater transparency in respect of who is responsible for what and how roles and responsibilities work together and interconnect.<\/p> <p> The Bill will introduce a new regime of responsibility, governance and sanctions for senior executives who are managing and operating regulated financial service providers, RFSPs, by means of a senior executive accountability regime, SEAR.  It will set out codes of conduct for both businesses and individuals, thereby making clear the standards of allowed behaviour, as well as sanctions that would be faced if responsibilities are breached.  It will introduce a new duty of responsibility obliging senior executives to take reasonable steps to ensure the firm does not breach its obligations under financial services legislation.  It will also revise the processes of the Central Bank to make them more effective and efficient, and to ensure they conform to standards of fairness in the administration of justice.  These include the fitness and probity regime and the administrative sanctions procedures, which the Minister provided detail on earlier.<\/p> <p> The Bill is detailed and technical in places and I do not intend to give views on every aspect of it.  In any case, it seems the efficacy of this legislation will very much depend on the way in which the regulator, the enforcement authority and the Central Bank produce and enforce regulations and how they work with individuals and financial institutions that fall within the scope of the legislation.<\/p> <p> Turning to individual accountability, the Bill sets out a clear legal framework on where individual decision-making and responsibility lie.  The new laws will place an onus on the RFSPs to assign clear functions and responsibilities to pre-approval controlled functions, PCFs, which is welcome and provides transparency.<\/p> <p> Chapter 2 sets out the business standards that must be adhered to, including the legal requirement to act honestly and professionally and to engage in good faith with the regulator.  There is also a clear obligation to disclose to the Central Bank any matter relating to the RFSP for which the bank could reasonably expect to receive notice of, and this is a good thing.<\/p> <p> Chapter 3 covers duties of responsibility and the new standards of conduct.  It is important that the precise parameters of the duty of responsibility are described in the Bill as well as what constitutes inherent and allocated responsibilities.<\/p> <p> Throughout the legislation, we will see reference to the need to show the regulator, through the taking of reasonable steps at all times, how an individual or organisation remains compliant with the standards of conduct and behaviour that will be demanded of those who come under the scope of the new legislation.  This requirement makes sure that this onerous legislation is balanced and proportionate and will allow the regulators to fully consider the context of any breach that may come to their attention for investigation and, if a contravention occurs, to impose a sanction.<\/p> <p> Sections 53E and 53F describe in detail the common conduct standards and additional conduct standards.  Section 53G is important in that it empowers the Central Bank to develop guidelines and guidance for those who will be governed by the legislation.  It is imperative that an intensive programme of outreach and training be afforded to those who will come under the remit of the new laws.  This is only fair and proper, which is recognised in the Bill and acknowledged by the Minister and Central Bank in their commentary on this new regime.  This will help to drive compliance and limit the room for excuses.  Ignorance will be no defence.  The legislation cannot be clearer on what is demanded and required of those who are governed by it.<\/p> <p> Part 4 is crucial.  It relates to the changes that will be made to the Central Bank's administrative sanctions procedure under the new laws, including the process of investigating breaches and how they will be investigated and so on.  It is important this process of investigation and sanctions for contraventions is robust, that it complies with the principles of natural justice and fair procedures, and that it is not at odds with the Constitution.  The process has been carefully laid out, step by step, in the legislation and that is a good thing.<\/p> <p> The Bill is at pains to reflect the lessons of the Zalewski judgement, as the Minister mentioned earlier.  It is critically important when administrative tribunals and regulators undertake the important job of investigating breaches of laws and regulations, and where they pass down serious sanctions, that it is done in a fair and balanced way on the balance of probabilities.  In this regard, I raise two points that we in the Labour Party see as important and is something to which we may return on Committee and Report Stages.  The Bill has two features we believe are ripe for scrutiny.  The first is the rule under section 23, which the Minister referred to earlier, that inquiry decisions do not take effect unless confirmed by the High Court.  While he went some way to describe the meaning of \"confirmed\", we are left to work out what confirmed means in this context and, therefore, I would appreciate further elaboration on precisely what confirmed by the High Court means.  What the procedure intends to achieve is quite unclear.  It seems the High Court will have no option, if we take a literal view of this legislation, but to apply its confirmation rubber stamp unless it finds an error of law, which is both manifest on the face of the record and so fundamental as to deprive the decision of its basis.  If the High Court cannot find such an egregious error of law, the decision of the inquiry and its sanctions must stand.  This is what the section seems to insistent upon and it will require further interrogation.  I do not see how the participation of the courts at this stage of the process, and to the limited extent as described in the Bill, can cloak it with any greater constitutional legitimacy than it would have without the involvement of the court.<\/p> <p> The second provision is in section 67, which prohibits the High Court from granting a judicial review in respect of these decisions, and this requires further elaboration and explanation.  The combined effect of these two provisions means we are being asked to legislate for a procedure where the Central Bank can get the law on legal procedures wrong but there would be no legal remedy or access to the courts unless the error can be held to be both manifest and fundamental.  The question could be asked why we have such little faith in our regulators that we feel the need to legislate to allow them to get things wrong, even badly wrong, and we only draw the line at them getting things manifestly and fundamentally wrong.  These two provisions require additional elaboration.<\/p> <p> This is a good day for transparency.  We finally have legislation before the Oireachtas that will require banking executives to be responsible for the decisions they make.<\/p> <p>It is legislation that we support in principle.  It is strong and robust legislation.  I look forward to seeing the regulations the Central Bank will be empowered to make to ensure the Bill achieve its objectives.  I look forward to engaging with the Minister in more detail on Committee and Report Stages on amendments to the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900048#AAA00200","speaker":"1599","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666195020,"counter":365,"content":"<p>I am glad to see the Leas-Cheann Comhairle has arranged for the roof to be fixed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900050#CCC00200","speaker":"1519"},{"type":"speech","time":1666195020,"counter":366,"content":"<p>I managed that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900050#CCC00300","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1666195020,"counter":367,"content":"<p>I was worried we might have to bail out to the convention centre, which was quite a miserable place to be stuck in.  At least we are here for the time being.<\/p>  <p>  I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  It is a positive Bill and empowering to consumers and all who walk through the doors of a bank to avail of services.  It provides for greater levels of accountability in the financial services sector.  It sets out the standards and behaviour expectations of the financial sector for individuals and firms that operate within it and holds them to very high standards.  This is good for consumers, transparency and doing business above board.  There are also improved mechanisms for the Central Bank to have a supervisory role to uphold the high standards we expect of the sector.<\/p>  <p>  I do not intend use all of my time but I will make a few points.  Earlier this year, AIB announced it would go cashless, a decision it rolled back on.  It was the right thing to do.  It was anti-consumer and anti-rural.  It was very insulting to a taxpaying public which bailed out the Irish banking sector in 2008.  At the time, many Ministers in government explained that the Government cannot intervene in operational banking matters, but I hope that as legislation continues to evolve and be refined, we can have a mechanism whereby we can have a greater hold over the likes of AIB and other financial institutions to ensure we do not end up with another August 2022 announcement that a bank is going cashless.  It caught the whole country by surprise.  It caught AIB by surprise that there was such a backlash from the public, and rightly so.  I hope that in time we can have mechanisms that bring more responsibility to the banking sector.  It is not all about the ethics of banking, although that is important and is in the Bill.  It is also about the onus on banks to provide, under licence from the Central Bank, a service at community level in the country.<\/p>  <p>  On community banking, other models could be worth examining in due course, such as the Kiwi banks and Sparkasse banks in Germany, which operate very well.  Too often, they are misunderstood as being akin to the Irish credit union model.  They are not; they are quite different.  They are very successful models that work very well at community level.  A lot of money is reinvested at community level.<\/p>  <p>  I and many other Members have a bugbear about the Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) Act.  Section 37 of the Act makes every person who serves in this House a politically exposed person.  We have faced an electorate, regardless of which, if any, party we represent, and have a mandate, through the ballot paper and electoral process, to stand in this House but we have that Act hanging over our heads.  I cannot reconcile that with any Member of this House, past, present or future, being subject to legislation that would define his or her as being in the same bracket as terrorists.<\/p>  <p>  The genesis of this goes back to a different era in politics when business may not have been quite as clean.  All it takes is a few individuals in any work environment to stain the reputation of many.  There was corruption and people who abused office over many years, but the reality is that many politicians are politically exposed persons due to section 37 of the Act.  If they, their spouse, partner, children or grandchildren want to avail of a very small and minor financial product, they cannot get it.  I recently celebrated my 40th birthday and group of us went out to celebrate.  As now happens in bars and restaurants, the bill came out and out came the Revolut cards.  I was embarrassed to be the only one at the table who had no Revolut card because I have to go through hoops and loops and back over and beyond.  It is impossible to get one.  That is just one financial product; there are many others that are being denied to people.<\/p>  <p>  I accept that the public lens in its full wrath is cast over us; that is part and parcel of the job.  We should be scrutinised and held to a high ethical bar, but I do not think all of our family members and extended family should have a net of suspicion thrown over them.  I do not think the Act can be reconciled with the positions we hold and our families who do not seek public life.  The Act is not up for debate today.  Maybe it is legislation born out of a requirement of ten years ago and perhaps it needs some refinement.  I fully support the Bill before the House.  It is good legislation and has my full support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900050#CCC00400","speaker":"1519"},{"type":"speech","time":1666195020,"counter":368,"content":"<p>Progress in bringing this Bill forward has been slow.  The updated version was published on 28 July 2022, a year and a day after the publication of the general scheme of the Bill.  It comes four years after the publication of the Central Bank's report on the behaviour and culture of the Irish retail banks, which first set out the general outline of the new individual accountability framework.<\/p>  <p>  While the details of the proposed framework have been refined since the publication of the report, its four main elements remain the same.  They are conduct standards; fitness and probity reform; reform to simplify regulatory enforcement against individuals; and the senior executive accountability regime.  The Bill aims to enhance individual accountability in the financial services industry.  It grants the power to make regulations to the Central Bank to effectively implement the individual accountability framework in respect of senior executives in regulated financial service providers.  <\/p>  <p>  As the Minister knows, and as others have mentioned, Britain and Australia have introduced similar legislation in the past six years.  It is to be hoped the introduction of such legislation here will give rise to improvements in internal governance and help to concentrate the minds of senior individuals on the standards of conduct expected of them.<\/p>  <p>  In January 2017, Sinn F&eacute;in brought forward a motion in the D&aacute;il calling for legislation that would ensure individual in financial institutions could be held to account.  In July 2018, the Central Bank called for similar reforms to enhance its ability to promote what it described as a culture of ethical compliance by firms and individuals.  It is regrettable that the legislation is being introduced four years after these reforms were called for.  It is a long overdue Bill.  As a result of the tracker mortgage scandal, thousands of families lost income and 327 people lost their homes.  While banks have been fined a combined total of &euro;278 million, not a single individual has ever been held to account.  The Bill must ensure that this never happens again.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the senior executive accountability regime in the Bill which will make individual directors and managers of banks and financial services companies personally liable for regulatory breaches by their firms.  We all saw the rogue behaviour that led to the near collapse of our banking system and the biggest transfer of State wealth to private hands in the history of the State.  The Government, and previous Governments, know well how to transfer public money to private hands.  We see this with direct provision, housing assistance payments and private bus operators.  It is all around us.  Little has been learned from the &euro;64 billion bank bailout.  The rich got richer and the poor got poorer.  The same happened during the pandemic.  We need change, greater redistribution of wealth and a republic where workers get a greater share of the profits they generate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900050#CCC00500","speaker":"1588"},{"type":"speech","time":1666195020,"counter":369,"content":"<p>I want to start by welcoming this long overdue Bill, which the Central Bank first called for in 2018.  It is clear from recent history that the senior executive accountability framework is sorely needed, along with the enhanced Central Bank powers, so that the wrongdoings of the past are not repeated.  Why has it taken over four years to progress this Bill?  We have the very same Minister for Finance that we had when the Central Bank first called for this framework.  The Minister is at pains to stress that the Bill has always been a priority, but if that is the case I wonder why it has taken four years to produce and publish it.  Given the costs and misery caused by the banking crisis, it is hard to know why there was such a delay.<\/p> <p>The delay has obviously been in producing the legislation but that, in turn, will delay the implementation of what is a much-needed new framework.<\/p> <p> I accept that engagements with the Central Bank and other relevant stakeholders were needed to iron out the details of this new framework but this legislation is not exactly inventing the wheel.  The UK has had very similar legislation in place for years along with other countries such as Australia and Singapore.  It would have been preferable if we had debated this legislation a couple of years ago, but it is welcome nonetheless.  I am pleased this reform is finally taking place because trust in Irish retail banks is on the floor, as I think most people would agree.  It is understandable that it is so.<\/p> <p> In July, a report on public trust in banking from the Irish Banking Culture Board found that almost 80% of people still do not trust bank bosses to act with integrity, especially when things go wrong.  Although the board bizarrely tried to dress its findings up as a positive result for the sector, it is blatantly obvious that the banks have failed to build any social capital since the crash.  That is no surprise in many ways, given the scale of destruction that domestic banks have caused in this country.<\/p> <p> It is now 15 years since the then Fianna F&aacute;il-Green Party coalition gave a blanket guarantee to cover nearly all the liabilities of the six main domestic financial institutions.  With that decision, the Government walked blindly into unknown and rapidly escalating commitments that would amount to the Irish public bailing out the banks to the tune of more than &euro;60 billion.  While there were undoubtedly global influences on our banking crisis, the core characteristics of the problem were home-made.  The root cause can be found in a domestic property bubble that was fuelled by an under-regulated banking sector that was over-reliant on property-related lending both at home and abroad.<\/p> <p> Unfortunately, this catastrophe for the State and its citizens was not followed by the kind of root-and-branch reform which is still desperately needed.  The interests of the financial sector continue to trump good governance.  One can see this in the tracker mortgage scandal and the Davy bond scandal.  The latter is the most recent scandal in Irish financial services and it drives home the need for individual accountability in the upper echelons of the sector.  Is it any wonder the public does not trust these people when there seems to be a litany of impropriety and rogue personal gain at the heart of some financial institutions?<\/p> <p> This is the type of conduct that must be rooted out and tackled.  The repercussions must be felt by the individuals involved.  Imposing fines on institutions that amount to little more than a slap on the wrist just does not cut it and does not change the culture.  That is exactly why the Central Bank identified the need for the framework we are discussing here today.<\/p> <p> In June 2018, the Central Bank published its report, Behaviour and Culture of the Irish Retail Banks, following a request from the Minister to examine significant cultural failings within Ireland's banking sector.  It focused primarily on the behaviour of the executive leadership teams of the five main Irish retail banks: AIB, Bank of Ireland, Permanent TSB, Ulster Bank and KBC Bank.  It also looked at the interplay of senior executives and internal stakeholders in the context of strategic decision-making. <\/p> <p> Importantly there was also a clear focus on the key decision-makers in each firm and the tone they set from the top.  One of the key recommendations from the Central Bank was on the need for legislation to introduce an enhanced individual accountability framework, which I am pleased to see forms a key part of the legislation before us.  As the report outlines, every single member of an organisation should be clear as to what is expected of him or her and the consequences of deviating from such standards.  This is especially pertinent when we are talking about senior executives among whom clearer accountability is undoubtedly needed.<\/p> <p> Other aspects of the Bill are also very welcome, such as the duty of responsibility provision which would impose a legal obligation on senior executives to ensure their area of responsibility within the company is compliant with the law.  Measures such as this, which underpin accountability and are in the interests of consumers, will always have the support of my party and, I am sure, all parties in this House.  However, it will take much more than this legislation to restore trust in the banking sector.  While the arguments in favour of these changes are undeniably true, perceptions will not change until customers can see positive changes on the ground.  Unfortunately there is no sign of that in our towns and cities.  The only changes we see are regressive ones.<\/p> <p> While we must ensure the era of light-touch regulation is behind us and there is never a repeat of the kind of circumstances and the culture associated with the period up to 2008, we must also ensure the remaining banks that now enjoy a powerful monopoly are not allowed to cut services to the bone.  Cultural and behavioural changes in the sector, without a commitment to reinstating services, will not put a stop to the erosion of trust that is evident in survey after survey.<\/p> <p> In the 2022 trust survey, the highest-scoring attribute of banks was high-quality and competent staff.  It is clear that staff in branches are very much valued locally and are key drivers of trust, as they understand their customers and their communities.  The rush to adopt digital services has underestimated that vital human element.  There is no doubt that online services will continue to grow in popularity but when people need advice or find themselves in financial difficulties, most will still want to speak with a trusted staff member in their local branch.  That is something that retail banks have yet to fully grasp.  I hope that the outcry in respect of AIB's botched decision to remove cash services from 70 branches was a wake-up call for the sector.<\/p> <p> I will take this opportunity to make the case once again for a public banking model.  The Social Democrats have been calling for this since 2016 and with trust in retail banks shattered and the exodus of providers from the market, the case for a public model has never been more compelling.  We know that people have lost faith in private banking institutions and they are seeking alternatives to the pillar banks.  The creation of a publicly owned community banking system, as operates successfully in many other European countries, would give people an option to manage their finances in a way that is not entirely about making profits for banks.  Instead, they could bank with an institution with a social conscience and with a primary remit of ensuring local banking facilities and services are available to local people.<\/p> <p> The Social Democrats have long proposed an ambitious project whereby the State and the Central Bank would work with credit unions and post offices to build a strong community banking sector.  Not only would this create much-needed competition in the banking sector, but it would also support financial inclusion.  It is very disappointing, but not surprising, that successive Governments have chosen not to proceed with such a model.  We have heard much about banking culture during this debate but unless we become culture makers, we will continue to be culture takers who put up with people being treated badly by the banks that we bailed out.<\/p> <p> During the current cost-of-living crisis, improving access to local finance through publicly owned institutions that can be trusted, would be a considerable value to customers and, indeed, to small businesses.  <\/p> <p>Otherwise, many vulnerable customers will continue to rely on high-cost and often shady sources of credit.  The pillar banks have shown themselves not to be especially interested in low-income customers and have made it difficult to have any interface with staff in the bank.  It is important, therefore, that there is an option for low-income communities to access financial services to avoid the high risk of people being driven into the hands of moneylenders, legal or illegal.<\/p> <p> There is also a sense across the board that people have really had it with Irish banks.  They have had it with the dismissive attitude the banks show to regular domestic customers.  Services are being cut back all the time, it is virtually impossible now to speak to somebody even on the phone and it is quite clear our pillar banks are only interested in bigger and business customers.  In circumstances such as this it is a real sickener for people who have managed to survive through what have been 12 very difficult years since the bank bailout to be treated with such disdain and disrespect.  The public is definitely seeking an alternative type of banking, a conscientious type of banking that is not all about profit-making and where there is a return to the local community.  It stands to reason that we should be doing that.<\/p> <p> I have serious concerns about the extent to which Government policy over many years has been propping up our banks.  An example of that is the insistence on credit unions placing the bulk of their deposits with the two pillar banks, which is a real obstacle to them playing a more active role and providing a wider range of banking services.  The same applies to property prices.  It is in the interests of the banks that property prices are maintained at a high level given the debts the banks incurred, but there has been very little sharing of the burden there.  To a large extent, the rest of the ordinary people in this country continue to pay higher interest rates, high house prices and high charges in order to continue to prop up the banks.  That is just not acceptable to the public.  I have no doubt that if there was a public option available to people, it would be in enormous demand.  I for one would change account in the morning if such an option was available.  An awful lot of people feel likewise.<\/p> <p> I reiterate my support for the changes proposed in this legislation.  As I have said, much more is needed from the banks and this Government to restore trust and fundamentally change the Irish banking landscape but the Bill is certainly a step in the right direction.  The retail banking sector is changing at an extraordinary rate but we must ensure it shows a willingness to change course.  Ordinary workers should not have to accept a banking system that puts the needs of its shareholders above those of its customers.  The reforms set out in this legislation will address some of the shortcomings in the retail banking sector but competition is urgently required.  A strong, not-for-profit banking sector would achieve this and ensure local banking facilities in our communities.  Ultimately, the State should not be afraid to intervene in a market that is utterly failing so many of its citizens.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900050#CCC00600","speaker":"1567","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666196220,"counter":372,"content":"<p>N&iacute;l aon duine &oacute;n Rialtas.

It affected the lives of millions of people in this State and forced hundreds of thousands of people to emigrate, many of whom have never returned.  People who left due to the collateral damage of the banking crisis are living in Canada, Australia and all over the world.  It loaded tens of billions of euro of debt onto this country and significantly reduced the level of investment in Irish society for a decade afterwards.  We have less money to invest in housing, infrastructure, health and education as a result of the damage done by the banking crisis.  The infrastructure deficit we experience as we travel to and from work, etc., is a result of the millions of euro that were spent paying off debt rather than being invested in this country.  Every single man, woman and child in this State owes &euro;47,000, which is a massive burden for individuals to have on their shoulders, especially in this time of economic crisis.<\/p>  <p>  The shadow of the banking crisis reaches into the lives of people in today's world.  The banking crisis was fuelled by years of light touch regulation, credit illiteracy among the Fianna F&aacute;il Governments of the day and the bargain basement European interest rates available during the period.  Of course, the European Union sets its interest rates on the basis of the larger economies such as Germany and does not pay any heed to the needs of the Irish economy.  Before the banking crisis, we needed higher interest rates to cool down the housing market.  Subsequently, the damage was magnified by a Fianna F&aacute;il Government and the European Union, which saddled the people with the costs of the crisis.  Greed, the absence of oversight from the administrations in Dublin or Brussels and the refusal to protect the Irish people when they needed it have cost us massively, right up to the current generation.<\/p>  <p>  In the middle of all the human carnage that was caused, Ireland managed to maintain its impeccable record of never holding anybody to account.  It was an amazing feat.  To think that such a disaster could have been wreaked on every single household and practically every business in the country and is now being experienced in hospital wards, schoolrooms, creaking road infrastructure, etc., and nobody was held to account.  This contrasts with what we saw in other countries such as Iceland and the United States where the architects of the damage were brought to account at some level.<\/p>  <p>  While this Bill is welcome, it is 14 years late.  That is the unfortunate, costly reality for many people&rsquo;s lives.  That it is before the House is welcome and many aspects of the legislation will lead to significant improvements in oversight, including the provisions to ensure individuals in these institutions fulfil their responsibilities properly and cannot be involved in practices that will be dangerous and costly to the companies in question and society.  It provides for an ability to investigate properly and enforce decisions from those investigations.  I welcome all those aspects of the Bill.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill seeks to give significant regulation powers to the Central Bank to implement the individual accountability framework in respect of senior executives in regulated financial service providers.  There is much in this Bill and good work in it.  I wanted to mention those positive elements to the Government, the public service and the Central Bank.  However, I am concerned about a couple of aspects of the legislation, although I stand to be corrected if I am not accurate.  While there is no doubt the Central Bank is a repository of considerable expertise, this Bill feels like we are leaving much of the detail to be filled in by the Central Bank.  In other words, we are giving a canvas that has a rough sketch of how this should exist in the future but asking others to fill it in.  As the elected representatives of the people, we are ultimately responsible.  We have a history of outsourcing responsibility to others.  When we do that we lose control of that responsibility and oftentimes the result is not what it should be.<\/p> <p>If the detail was filled in here, we would, with the advice of the Central Bank and financial and economic experts, be able to go over every aspect of this Bill to make sure it is robust enough to ensure that if we hit another crash in the future, the systems are in place to deal with it.  I worry that there are gaps in this and that we are outsourcing it.  I believe that is wrong.<br\/><br\/>I will raise a couple of elements.  Will the Minister of State address the role of the High Court regarding decisions that have been made and any enforcement or penalties that are decided on?  Does the role of the High Court mean that we will see litigation?  One problem that we regularly discuss here with regard to commissions of inquiry is that they nearly get tied up for decades in litigation.  The level of defence that is used costs the State and individuals significant amounts.  It means that justice is kicked down the road by as long as 14 years.  Justice denied for that long is no justice at all, truth be told.  How will the oversight of the High Court work in real terms?  I understand the High Court has to confirm decisions.  I understand that citizens have rights under the Constitution which cannot be impugned unfairly.  Will the Minister of State address that in his responses?<br\/><br\/>Enforcement is an important element in Irish society.  We are heavy with legislation but light with enforcement in many areas, whether employment law, environmental issues or taxation.  There is no proper enforcement.  We can produce this wonderful Bill, but if the enforcement is not right, we will have a difficulty.  This Bill seems to outsource that enforcement to the Central Bank.  Section 48 of the Bill provides:<\/p><blockquote>\tIn determining under section 33AQ or 33AR whether to impose a sanction on a natural person, what sanction to impose on a natural person, or the level of any monetary penalty to be imposed on a natural person, the Bank shall have regard, together with any other relevant considerations, to any of the following that appear to it to be relevant. <\/blockquote> <p>This critical element appears not to have crystallised in the Bill.  We will not have an effect on that critical element.  We will not own it.  We will not be able to design it.  Therefore, it is in somebody else's hands.  I feel that is a weakness.<br\/><br\/>We have another banking crisis on our hands in this country which leads from the previous banking crisis.  It is the overconcentration of the market in the hands of just a few banks.  This has not happened by accident.  Michael Noonan designed the two-pillar bank system.  He basically designed an oligopoly.  Anybody with any understanding of economics knows that concentrated oligopolies such as this do not work for the good of the people.  They have enormous power and can have influence over every aspect of engagement with the customer, whether it is on the price of the interest rate, the cost of handling cash, or retreating from towns and villages across the country with bank closures.  In all of those aspects, the power lies with the banks rather than the people.  If there is a far more fractured market, which is called a perfect competition market, with smaller banks, it means that more power and influence over those aspects of engagement is in the hands of the consumer.  That is one reason banks are moving towards digitisation of all of this.  It also means that smaller banks are finding it hard to compete effectively and profitably with larger banks because they have such small elements of the market.<br\/><br\/>I have no doubt that a focus on changing the market structure of the banking system in Ireland is needed.  It is a pity that the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, has left the building.  One way to do this is through a public banking system.  It seems that every party, including the Minister of State's party, Fianna F&aacute;il, is in favour of a public banking system, bar one.  It seems that Fine Gael is the only political party that is building a barrier to the development of a public banking system.  I want to find out why that is the case from Fine Gael.  Why is a stakeholder public banking system, which operates successfully in other mature, well-functioning economies, deemed to be a threat in Ireland, given the overly concentrated market here?  Stakeholder banking systems tend to have a more regional focus.  They tend to be oriented more towards small businesses and small farmers.  They tend to make sure that profits are pushed back into the sectors in which they are operating.  They tend to be far more resilient.  The German experience is that when the last banking crash happened, the public banking system was far less likely to suffer a significant loss.  It is mind-boggling, given the overconcentration in the banking system, the flight of so many banks from the country and the alternative opportunity that public banking represents, that Fine Gael is so against it.  It is probably why Fianna F&aacute;il has not managed to lever Fine Gael into making a positive decision.  Some might say that Fianna F&aacute;il has done that with the ban of evictions over the winter.  Why is there weakness with regard to the public banking system?<br\/><br\/>Sula gcr&iacute;ochn&oacute;idh m&eacute;, caithfidh m&eacute; a r&aacute; go bhf&aacute;ilt&iacute;m roimh an mBille seo.

We welcome that the Government is finally moving on it.  It is long past time for white-collar crime to be dealt with by the law and treated as what it is.  It is not a victimless crime.  Those who suffered during the financial crash will say that.  I am still dealing with families who were affected by that financial crash.  There was news today that the Central Bank will increase mortgage-to-income ratios and reduce the deposits required for second-time buyers, which is yet another indication of just how badly this Government has failed with housing.  Unfortunately, once again, we see measures that will only be inflammatory.  Experts are already telling us that this will drive up house prices.  People cannot afford to pay more.  They need their Government to step in to build truly affordable homes.  The Government is thankfully backtracking on the ban on evictions.  It is missing housing targets every year.  We have the highest number of homeless people ever.  We now have a case study on why market-led home delivery is not just a bad idea, but a disaster.<\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank rules were introduced in the fallout of the crash to prevent it from happening again.  The reality is that the crash could happen again and again because no one paid for the bad financial decisions that got us here.<\/p> <p>At that time, we bailed out the banks but not the people.  We had a Fine Gael Deputy in here yesterday using dehumanising labels to describe people in addiction.  He refused to withdraw that comment.  He has been a Deputy for 20 years and has only referred to the bank bailout once.  We are faced with the reality that Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael Deputies are more concerned with labelling vulnerable people than with holding those in power to account.<\/p> <p> The root cause of addiction is poverty.  That has been shown through research.  Yet instead of tackling poverty this Government is too busy subsidising developers, speculators and the banks.  The people feel the Government let the bankers away with daylight robbery in the last financial crash.  Thankfully, this Bill goes to address some of the issues.  It tackles concerns on white-collar crime and that is welcome.  We need a financial banking sector for the people and that is why the Government needs to do more with An Post and credit unions to ensure that ordinary people have access to banking.  That is about banking for people and not for major profits.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900053#FFF00200","speaker":"1453","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666197420,"counter":377,"content":"<p>I welcome the fact that this Bill is before the House and that I will have the opportunity to address issues within it on Committee Stage.  The Bill is long overdue.  We witnessed a massive financial crash from which we are still recovering.  That still has consequences for individuals in this State, particularly those trying to raise a mortgage and paying high interest rates.  While this will hold bankers to account, at least that is what the short note said, I hope it does.  What steps will the Minister take in regard to this Bill to include vulture funds?  They have wreaked havoc throughout the country.  They continue to do so.  They are the arm of the mainstream banking system that provides the muscle necessary to allow the banks to get some money out of the process by selling the loans to vulture funds.  It then allows vulture funds to appoint receivers and again to ride roughshod over the rights of individuals, families and small businesses.  If the Bill does not go to that extent to protect those who find themselves in the hands of vulture funds, then we are not doing the banking system any good.<\/p>  <p>  We are not addressing the issues of accountability and transparency in the banking system.  The vulture funds refuse to come before the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach.  That has been the case this term and last term.  As we demand accountability and ask them to appear, they just turn a blind eye to us and continue on with the devastation they are causing.  Time and again in this House, I and many other Members have raised this issue and asked for the matter to be addressed.  We were told by various politicians in the past that these vulture funds are necessary and are good for the economy.  Let me make it clear that I have not come across any activity of a vulture fund that would lead me to believe that they are good for the economy, particularly the Irish economy or Irish society.  While they may help to address the bank balances and the positions within each bank, they do not do any good for society or families that are affected by them.<\/p>  <p>  What section in this Bill deals comprehensively with vulture funds?  What section puts the onus and an obligation on them to appear before the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach?  If that matter is not addressed in the Bill, perhaps on Committee State or Report Stage we will see a change emerge in that regard.<\/p>  <p>  It is also clear from what is going on with the banks currently that they are almost back to treating customers in the same way that they treated them in the past.  The tracker mortgage issue is an example of the outrageous behaviour of banks.  The Central Bank imposed fines on the banks that were found guilty of not treating tracker mortgage holders properly.  It is said that those fines were significant, but they were not.  In each of those cases, they were reduced by 30%.  I want the Central Bank to be able to impose a fine that does not represent nickels and dimes to the bank in question but that it is a really substantial sanction for the bank and that there is some mechanism whereby we can show that the bank cannot pass the sanction on to its customers in fees and charges.  That has to be examined, and the Central Bank has to have a significant role in policing it.<\/p>  <p>  I would also like to see that when a bank is fined and when it is stated that there was significant poor practice in the bank, the Central Bank can outline clearly what it found in its investigations.  Not enough is said about the investigations.  Not enough information is given on the outcome of those investigations.  Until such time as this House is prepared to pass legislation insisting on that and on naming and shaming the individuals concerned in the bank, we will continue to have bad practice in banks.  I have looked at the boards of directors in different banks.  They have not changed substantially since 2008.  There have been no moves by the banks to ensure that, from a public perspective, it would be seen that they and their boards have changed.  A decision had to have been made somewhere in the banks regarding tracker mortgages.  That is a fact.  A decision had to be made about various investment funds that went wrong, about tied agents that were involved with banks and are now being treated badly.<\/p>  <p>  All of this is part and parcel of a banking culture that was the biggest aspect of the cause of the crash in 2008.  The political response has been weak.  It has taken too long to come to this in regard to holding individuals to account.  Will the Minister of State ensure that not only the regular banks are caught in these regulations but that the vulture funds are made to answer to the committees of this House in the context of the regulations and legislation we put in place?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900054#GGG00200","speaker":"1496"},{"type":"speech","time":1666197420,"counter":378,"content":"<p>If the House and the Minister of State agree, I propose to take the Rural Independent Group slot now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900054#GGG00300","speaker":"1617"},{"type":"speech","time":1666197420,"counter":379,"content":"<p>I thank the Acting Chairman.

We thank the Acting Chairman for allowing us in to contribute to the Second Stage debate on the Central Bank (Individual Accountability Framework) Bill 2022.  That is a mouthful.<\/p>  <p>  I have great respect for the Minister of State.  I have great time for him as a colleague, a backbencher and now as a Minister of State.  However, the banks are running amok.  It seems to me that the Government wishes to allow them to run amok.  It introduces legislation and tell them this and that but there is a monopoly in there.  It is a very worrying situation now.  Deputies Michael Collins, Nolan and I visited a number of banks on behalf of customers.  KBC was one of those banks.  KBC is exiting the market and the country now along with Ulster Bank and others.<\/p> <p>We will have less competition.<\/p> <p> I will never forget the night of the bank guarantee, and I am tired of repeating this.  My single biggest political mistake was voting for that, following the pleading of the late Brian Lenihan and others.  However, I pressed the button, although there were no buttons at that time and we had to walk through the lobbies.  Ever since, they have created a crisis and pushed us all into a state of collapse.  They got a bank guarantee and debts written off.  Then it came to the so-called bailout, which I described as a clean-out, and I voted against it.  <\/p> <p> The Taoiseach is running off admiring, and is beholden to, the globalists in Europe even though the French and Germans are going to destroy our agriculture and other aspects as well.  We have a very troubled European project now as far as I am concerned and we are net losers all over the place.  When we got the so-called bailout, we got money from the IMF at 2.9% but we paid 6% to our European friends.  Can you imagine that?  At that stage, the bondholders were insured as well.  They laughed all the way to the bank.  Not only were the insurers not called in, the Irish taxpayers were the patsies.  The Minister of State&rsquo;s grandchildren, if he has any, and my grandchildren and their children will probably never pay it off.  It was an enormous, savage amount of money.  It was unbelievable.  <\/p> <p> What we have seen happening in the past couple of years has been totally distasteful.  Retired Members of this House, of Members of European Parliament and of different places are now advocates for the banks.  They are only out the door here a wet month or wet week.  Surely, in this legislation, we must have a barrier put in so that politicians and public servants, who are in senior positions in the Department of Finance, cannot become advocates, advisers or you name it name for the banks.  This is putting the fox in charge of the hen house.  The Minister of State has much work to do.  However, I do not see any appetite within the Department of Finance and within the Government to deal with the banks.<\/p> <p> I refer to the tracker mortgages and the massive fines that were imposed on banks.  Whose money did they pay the fines with?  Account holders' money was used to pay the fines, so it was the public&rsquo;s money that was used to pay the fines.  The fines were minuscule compared the billions of euro in profits that they made.  The Minister of State has no appetite to tackle the banks or CRH Roadstone, plc.  He wants the taxpayers to pay the cement levy and for bad products as a result of no regulation.  <\/p> <p> The Government has no appetite to go after the insurance companies.  I am tired of talking to the Minister of State about insurance companies.  That wonderful thatched-roof pub in Ballylooby got flooded the other night, making it worse.  The has pub closed.  The wonderful Keating family had insurance all their life but now they cannot get insurance for it as a domestic building.  It was flooded on Sunday night so when it rains, it pours on some people.  It is unfortunate.  The Government cannot tackle the insurance companies, the banks or anything.  <\/p> <p> We are bringing in feeble and inept legislation here.  It is pathetic.  The public is sick and tired of it and we are seen all over the world as having a soft touch.  We will table amendments on vulture funds.  Michael Noonan welcomed these people to this country.  Imagine the word &ldquo;vulture&rdquo;.  How many people would want a vulture when they see what it would do to a pet lamb when it is being born?  There are connotations there and the name is appropriate.  They must be accountable to the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach and the Committee of Public Accounts.<\/p> <p> We have seen recently where Departments have refused to come before several committees, including some of which I am a member.  That cannot be allowed.  We are tasked to legislate and be accountable to the people and we must make sure that we do that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900054#GGG00400","speaker":"1612","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666198020,"counter":381,"content":"<p>Governance, oversight and holding people to account is of massive importance to everybody, especially when it comes to the banking sector.  Today, colleagues and I met with the Central Bank to discuss changes that it announced.  Again, like everything, it seemed to have left many people behind.  It still is insisting on 10% being made available from people&rsquo;s savings if they are looking to purchase their first home and take out a mortgage for it.  That is putting awful and undue pressure on those people.  If they could prove the ability to pay a larger amount - in other words, 95%, if not the full amount - why not loan them the full amount?  There would be absolutely nothing whatsoever wrong with that.<\/p>  <p>  Coming back to what we are discussing here, as recently as 27 September, in what has become the largest fine to date issued by the Central Bank, Bank of Ireland was fined more than &euro;100 million for what was noted a series of significant and long-running failings in respect of nearly 16,000 tracker mortgage customers&rsquo; accounts between August 2004 and June 2022.  These failings by Bank of Ireland resulted in the loss of 50 properties, 25 of which were family homes.  I will repeat that.  Some 50 properties were lost, 25 of which were family homes.  This could have been avoided if the Bank of Ireland complied with its most basic and fundamental obligations. <\/p>  <p>  However, despite the massive and life-changing impact of this awful scandal by Bank of Ireland, not a single banker there was personally held accountable.  In fact, those responsible continue to work at the bank and obtain bonuses and pay rises, while some of the impacted families are left with no homes.  I, sadly, know people who were affected by this.  They came to me at clinics throughout County Kerry.  They were obviously traumatised by what was done to them.  I do not want to say the bank responsible walked away scot-free, because of course it was fined, but there was not really an implication for it.  However, where were the real people - the mothers, fathers, sons, daughters and grandchildren who were deprived of their homes and properties &ndash; left?  They were left nowhere.  What satisfaction did they get?  None.  One of the most valuable things that can be stolen from somebody is time.  Everyone of us will run out of time before we run out of money.  We have to think about that.  Those people&rsquo;s time and property was taken from them by a bank that would not adhere to proper governance.  That is inexcusable.  When you rob an individual of that, you are robbing them of something you cannot get back to them.  Compensation or anything else will not put them back to where they were.  <\/p>  <p>  Remember, our banks owe us a lot.  When I say &ldquo;us&rdquo;, I mean the people of Ireland.  We bailed them out.  I want to remind people when they are going to the bank with their cap in their hand, looking for a loan and assistance, that they are our banks.  We own the banks.  They would not exist in the first instance if it was not for us.  If a young couple or a businessperson can prove that they have the ability to pay back a loan and if they have a track record, they should be able to get a loan.  If they are working and can prove that they are workers and are looking for money, the bank should not be putting them down or make them beg, scrape or plead for their money.  It is our bank in the first instance.  <\/p>  <p>  Going back to how banks started, the whole ethos behind them was the gathering and disbursing of money and the charge of interest to make people&rsquo;s lives better and to let them get on with their lives.  However, we seem to have a situation now in our main banks, including AIB, Bank of Ireland and the others, that they will make a small, little thing out of you.  They will push you down and grind you down and leave you without money if they thought they could get away with it.  It is fine for other people who can stand up for themselves.  However, what about the young couples?  They are the people starting out in life and the ones who I am worried about.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900055#HHH00200","speaker":"1487"},{"type":"speech","time":1666198020,"counter":382,"content":"<p>I thank the Acting Chair for giving us the opportunity even though our time had gone.

She has spent the past 14 years trying to hold onto her home.  She bought the house 16 years ago based on an engineer&rsquo;s report that the bank requested.  She was able to buy her brand new home for herself and her unborn child at the time.  The engineer&rsquo;s report told her and the bank that her home-to-be was structurally sound, so she was fine to go ahead with her mortgage.  Less than two years later, she found out that there were huge structural problems in her home.  She contacted engineers, HomeBond, solicitors, etc., to try to resolve the situation.  Finally, after months and months, she had some repairs carried out by the original builders.<\/p> <p>Between HomeBond, engineers and solicitors, however, she was conned on every corner.  She was told by Bank of Ireland representatives at the time to stop paying the mortgage.  She was advised by the bank representatives - these were the people who had the house structurally checked initially and cleared it - to sue her engineers.  The Bank of Ireland representative in question has since been fired, apparently, and the saga has gone on for 14 years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900055#HHH00300","speaker":"1461","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666198620,"counter":384,"content":"<p>I remind the Deputy that it is not the practice to make individuals identifiable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900056#JJJ00200","speaker":"1617"},{"type":"speech","time":1666198620,"counter":385,"content":"<p>I do not think I have named anybody here yet, thank God.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900056#JJJ00300","speaker":"1461"},{"type":"speech","time":1666198620,"counter":386,"content":"<p>We are getting to a point where he is going into specific details.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900056#JJJ00400","speaker":"1617"},{"type":"speech","time":1666198620,"counter":387,"content":"<p>Yes, but I have not mentioned anybody by name.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900056#JJJ00500","speaker":"1461"},{"type":"speech","time":1666198620,"counter":388,"content":"<p>I am asking the Deputy to take care.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900056#JJJ00600","speaker":"1617"},{"type":"speech","time":1666198620,"counter":389,"content":"<p>I will not mention anybody's name.  I well know the rules and regulations here.<\/p>  <p>  This morning, after 14 years, she got a call to say the bank was repossessing her home - the home she owns and lives in with her child.  This is only one of many stories.  There is much more involved in the case than I have the time to relate to the Minister of State here today.  The banks and others need to give honest answers in respect of this case but they will get away with it.  <\/p>  <p>  I was talking to another lady, a constituent of mine, today.  She was seeking to remortgage her home and initially she got mortgage approval from ICS Mortgages.  All of a sudden, however, the ICS had no funds, so she went to Permanent TSB, where she got approval.  All she was looking for was an amount equal to twice her salary.  It should not have been a problem and, in fairness, it was not - she got approval.  Two months later, she is still waiting for the documentation to come from the bank.  Her solicitor has all her documents ready to go yet she is still waiting.  She wanted these funds to do up her home so that she can rent out two rooms.  That would mean she is going to look after two extra people who are probably on a housing list.  This lady has done everything right but the delay in her mortgage papers being sent is going to cost her more and more.  Two months ago, building material was cheaper than it is today.  Furniture was cheaper than it is today.  She and others believe this whole scenario of delaying mortgages is happening across the board and behind it all is ripping people off and driving the price of property even higher.  Of course, interest rates are increasing as well.  That lady would have had a deal done some time back but the bank is not signing off on it.<\/p>  <p>  I suggest that the Bill does not go far enough when it comes to the regular person on the street.  From what I have heard and seen, the behaviour and culture of Irish retail banks is despicable.  I have no faith in what this legislation is intended to do as I and my constituents believe the banks are a law unto themselves.  One just has to look at what happened with tracker mortgages.  Bank of Ireland was fined more than &euro;100 million for what was noted as a series of significant and long-running failings relating to nearly 16,000 tracker mortgage customer accounts between August 2004 and June 2022.  Despite the massive and life-changing impact of that grotesque scandal at the hands of Bank of Ireland, not a single banker at the bank was personally held accountable.  In fact, those responsible continue to work at the bank and obtain bonuses and pay rises, while some of the impacted families are left without a home.<\/p>  <p>  In the little time I have left, I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Fleming, why we still have had no answers regarding the fiasco during summer when AIB tried to pull the wool over customers' eyes by deciding to withdraw its cash facilities to customers.  Did the Minister of State know about that?  Did the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, or the Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, know about it?  The Minister of State opposite has no interest in what I am saying anyway because he is continually going across the floor to talk to somebody-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900056#JJJ00700","speaker":"1461"},{"type":"speech","time":1666198620,"counter":390,"content":"<p>The Minister of State is engaging with his officials-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900056#JJJ00800","speaker":"1617"},{"type":"speech","time":1666198620,"counter":391,"content":"<p>I know that, but I am engaging here and the least the Minister is supposed to do is to engage with Deputies when they are speaking.

I understand the Minister of State, Deputy Fleming, is speaking to an official but I would appreciate it if he were to listen when I am speaking to him.  I just mentioned that &euro;1 billion was the cost of the tracker mortgage scandal and the Minister of State went across the floor to speak to his official while I was speaking.  Please do me the courtesy of listening to me.  I was speaking about &euro;1 billion and the Minister of State disappeared to speak to his official.  Do me the courtesy of listening to me when I am talking.  The cost of the tracker mortgage scandal, between compensation and the cost to the banks in fines, was &euro;1 billion.  The intention of the Bill is to change the culture across firms and ensure that individuals will no longer be able to evade personal responsibility for the conduct of the companies they run.<\/p>  <p>  It is well documented that the banking crisis cost &euro;5.4 billion, yet Irish Nationwide was only fined &euro;23,000.  That is likely to continue under the Bill.  I could go on all day long about what the banking crisis has done to families and farm owners.  A case in the High Court last year involved the banks having sold on the debt from farm to a third party but the law states that one cannot sell on land as a third party debt.  One can sell on a property, such as a house or a business property, but one cannot sell on third party land.  The banks continued with that practice, however, and accrued more fines in the courts, and pushed farmers to the pin of their collar even though the banks are not supposed to be able to do it.  That is the farmers.<\/p>  <p>  Then we go to business owners.  They were scraping to survive through hard times.  At one stage, banks were ringing people and trying to hand them money.  They were telling people they could borrow more.  The second that there was any bit of a slowdown, however, they closed the doors on everyone and took everything out from underneath business owners and bullied their way through and took back properties.  They pushed families that were trying to pay for their homes out of them.  They demanded full repayment and refused to meet with lenders.  They told homeowners that they wanted the full amount or they would take back the house.<\/p>  <p>  The banks then dealt with multinationals that were buying hundreds of houses.  They put them together in a package and sold them off to the banks.  The banks sold them off for peanuts even though the people who were going to repay those loans would have repaid more in the long term if the banks had stuck with them.  The bail-out of the banks in this country was a scandal.  The people of this country were there to back the banks but, when the crunch came, the banks and the Government were not there to back the people.  That seems to be repeating itself every time there is a new Government.  Not only do the banks not back the people, now the Government does not back them.<\/p>  <p>  Now we are in another crisis yet every time my colleagues and I come up with a solution, the Government lets its Departments come up with crazy ideas on how to fix things but all they do is drive inflation and put more hurt on top of people who are trying to pay their way.  Let us not repeat the mistakes of the past.  The Minister of State has been here long enough to learn that.  What this Government has not learned, however, is that the Rural Independents are the only true voice of the people in this country.  In spite of that, the Government has failed to listen to us.  Every time it makes a mistake, it has to do a U-turn and come back to exactly what we said in the first place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900056#JJJ01200","speaker":"1499"},{"type":"speech","time":1666198620,"counter":395,"content":"<p>All Deputies accept the absolute need for standards, sanctions and accountability in the context of the banking sector, so there will be general support for the idea behind the Bill.  I do not think any Member will have a major difficulty with the four tenets, whether that is the senior executive accountability regime or new conduct standards for the regulated financial service providers, particularly in the context of management and staff.  There is no difficulty in the context of enhancements to the Central Bank's fitness and probity regime and, obviously, all Members would all call for greater enforcement capabilities for the Central Bank.<\/p> <p>That goes without saying.  We need to ensure that we have a framework that can deal with the problems that we have had in banking.  Yes, many have said before that this all should have happened earlier.  We all know the pain and hurt that was caused by the tracker mortgage situation and it is not just the financial impact but also the societal impact it had on families.  We know if we go back to the banking crisis, we had untold damage done across the board to significant sections of this society and to very significant numbers of families who are still reeling from the pain.<\/p> <p> It is fair enough to say that there was a failure of Government at that particular time to stand up, an absolute failure by the European Union, and beyond that, an acceptance on some level that that journey or direction towards austerity was not the correct methodology.  This is a conversation one has when one is talking to stakeholders across Europe, whether one is talking about parliamentarians from other European countries or those directly involved with the European Commission.  It was an abysmal failure and we are very lucky to have got through it to the degree that we did.  As bad as it was, it could always have been worse.<\/p> <p> We need to ensure that we give a sufficient amount of capacity to the banking sector in not having to revisit that situation.  I would also add my voice to what has been said on the absolute necessity to ensure we do the pieces that are necessary, whether we are talking about An Post or the credit unions.  I know that Connect Credit Union Limited has set up a new current account hub in Clanbrassil Street in Dundalk and is taking on those customers from the banks which are leaving these shores.  That is good to see but we know that there are certain rules and regulations that need to be changed in respect of freeing credit unions up to be able to provide the financial services which are offered by banks.<\/p> <p> We all see why the Central Bank has changed some of the rules on lending but the problem is that we are doing this within a dysfunctional set-up which will not be sorted until we deal with the supply issue.

It is the intention of the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, to have this Bill examined by the Select Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach in the coming weeks, where he looks forward to a more detailed consideration of the provisions of this Bill, and will engage with Deputies on any proposed amendments.<\/p>  <p>  In the meantime, the Department officials and the Minister will reflect on the points raised and will give further consideration, in consultation with the Central Bank and the Office of the Attorney General, to any amendments that may be necessary to ensure that the objectives of the Bill are achieved as fully as possible.  <\/p>  <p>  This is an important Bill which aims to provide for greater levels of accountability in the financial services sector.  It clarifies the standards of behaviour expected of individuals and firms in the sector and it should help raise the standards in practice.  The most significant measures in the Bill are designed to improve individual behaviour and the overall culture in the financial sector, including the individual entities.  Special standards of behaviour in financial institutions should achieve better outcomes for customers and an improved culture in the running and management of financial service firms offers significant benefits in preventing improper behaviour by individuals and organisations.  The Bill also facilitates the Central Bank&rsquo;s use of its supervisory tools to ensure that firms are well-run and, where necessary, deal appropriately with individuals who contravene the financial services law.  <\/p>  <p>  The one thing that has been very clear from this debate so far, which I am very pleased with, is that there is general agreement that this Bill should be passed and, in fact, the general theme from many people is to ask why it has taken so long.  In that spirit, it is important that we get the Bill moved to Committee Stage for detailed assessment on a section-by-section basis.  Many people fully support the Bill.  In the past other Members had other Bills also on this issue.  From listening to Members today, there is a need for this Bill, they generally support it, and I accept and know that they will come forward with amendments on Committee and Report Stages.<\/p>  <p>  Another point which came through the debate is that there was extensive criticism of what happened during the bank crash, how customers were treated, how banks were arrogant, of the mistakes made, the lack of supervision, and how the culture was wrong.  That was a very extensive theme raised by many people.  I understand and agree with all of that, and that did happen. The point they were making, without saying it, is that they implied that there was an absolute need for this type of legislation which we did not have on that occasion.  If we had this legislation in place then, perhaps those issues would not have happened.  The point these Members were making is that this did happen in the past.  There was egregious behaviour by many banks and unfair treatment which has been listed by different Deputies here in the debate.  All of this goes to show and prove the absolute necessity of having this legislation published, enacted and approved by the Oireachtas as soon as possible.<\/p>  <p>  I take on board all of the criticisms of past behaviours.  I make no apologies and on many occasions I criticised many of the activities of the banks and financial institutions over the years.  That has completely made this Government and the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, determined to pursue this legislation and have it enacted to prevent those types of issues happening again.<\/p>  <p>  The focus on the senior executive accountability regime, SEAR, is on preventing this behaviour or mismanagement by senior management.  The institution did not make all of these mistakes in the past, it was individuals and a culture which operated at senior level.  It is important that we have measures in place to ensure that there is individual accountability.  This is what the people of Ireland would and do want and that has been said here today.<\/p>  <p>  There were no sanctions because there was no regime in place at the time.  The essence of that is in this legislation to ensure that people will be held accountable for their actions and it is not just some corporate body which makes all of these decisions.<\/p>  <p>  In response to the point made by the Deputies T&oacute;ib&iacute;n, Doherty and Conway-Walsh as to why it has taken so long, this is a very complex piece of legislation and it has taken that time to get to where we are today.  It is important to remember that we are giving very significant additional powers to the Central Bank and it is vital that the correct balance be struck between these powers and the protection of individuals' constitutional rights.<\/p>  <p>  It is also imperative that any new provisions can withstand legal challenge, and for this reason very careful consideration had to be given to these proposals.  This has involved lengthy engagement with the Attorney General&rsquo;s office and the Central Bank to ensure that the legislation is both effective and constitutionally sound.  We could have rushed it but we know that it might be subject to challenge.  It is important that all of that effort is put in at this stage in advance of the legislation being enacted.<\/p>  <p>  Due to the fact that the legislation will significantly expand the number of persons subject to enforcement actions by the Central Bank, and potential sanction, the Attorney General&rsquo;s office was clear that we ensure that the provisions before the House should include adequate checks and safeguards so that sanctions would be proportionate.<\/p>  <p>  It is also important to ensure that the safeguards intended to protect the rights of more junior persons would not negatively impact on the Central Bank&rsquo;s enforcement processes in respect of more senior persons in the firms.  Over the course of the legislation, various safeguards, checks and balances had to be put in place and I believe that the effort that has been put in will prove effective.<\/p>  <p>  Deputies will be aware and there was a long discussion on tracker mortgages.  Several Deputies raised what happened over that episode and I would point out that the enforcement actions taken to date demonstrate the effectiveness of the Central Bank&rsquo;s existing powers.  People mentioned the fines and the amounts that had to be repaid were in the order of &euro;1 billion.  It is important that the Central Bank has the authority, the mandate and the constitutional legislation to enable it to do its job.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Shortall mentioned the issue of constitutionality and I believe that I have covered that particular issue in my remarks a few moments ago.<\/p>  <p>  Deputies Doherty and Ryan referred to the Private Members' Bill proposed in 2018 by Deputy Doherty.  The Government did not oppose that Bill at that time.  It agreed with the high-level objectives in that Bill but noted at the time that there were serious concerns with the details and with the way in which the Bill was drafted.  The primary legal difficulty was that it sought to impose new criminal liability without being clear as to the scope of the new offences, in accordance with the principles of legal certainty in criminal matters.  The broad principles of that Bill are addressed in these proposals and the Government Bill is far broader than the proposals in the original Private Members' Bill, notwithstanding the fact that the high-level objectives in that earlier Bill were very significant at that time.<\/p> <p>Perhaps the passage of time and the detailed discussion with the Attorney General has improved the legislation to where we are today.<\/p> <p> Deputy Mair&eacute;ad Farrell mentioned the role of the senior executive accountability regime, SEAR.  It will be rolled out on a phased basis and the Central Bank will issue the regulations on a phased basis as time goes on and we must give it the statutory power to do that.  There is significant regulation in most of the shadow banking system within the EU.  Within Ireland, resident money market funds, investment funds and finance companies are regulated entities.  It is also worth noting that all regulated firms, whether included in the scope of SEAR at the outset or not, will be subject to business standards and individuals working in those firms will be subject to the common conduct standard and additional conduct standards.  That is a matter that the Central Bank, as the regulator, will be implementing.  People have asked why we did not give more detail in regard to those particular matters.  The reason is that this House is not the regulator; the Central Bank is the regulator.  We are passing the framework and the legislation within which it will operate, but they are the people who have been entrusted with the legislation heretofore to ensure the regulatory function is carried out.  It is a function of the Central Bank to issue those various regulations on a phased basis over time.<\/p> <p> Deputy McGuinness mentioned the issue of tied agents.  We cannot legislate in a way that would retrospectively impose sanctions and penalties.  A lot of the debate was about what happened in the past but people know we cannot retrospectively have legislation to deal with that.  People highlighted what happened in the past and said it should not happen again.  That is why we are here in the House today.  Of particular relevance in a case of tied agents are the standards for businesses.  While much of the emphasis of the Bill is on holding individuals accountable, it is recognised that businesses, as corporate entities, should also be held to high standards of conduct.<\/p> <p> The Minister, Deputy Donohoe, looks forward to the opportunity to deal with the issues that have been referred to today and other matters that will inevitably come up on Committee Stage.  We want to ensure that this legislation, with which everybody agrees in principle, should be passed as urgently as possible.  I look forward to the co-operation of the Houses of the Oireachtas in ensuring the timely passage of this Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900057#KKK00200","speaker":"1590","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1666199820,"counter":399,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Central Bank (Individual Accountability Framework) Bill 2022: Referral to Select Committee","time":1666199820,"counter":400,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900058#LLL00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1666199820,"counter":401,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThat the Bill be referred to the Select Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach pursuant to Standing Orders 95 and 181. <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900058#LLL00400","speaker":"1590"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1666199820,"counter":402,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Courts and Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2022: Second Stage","time":1666199820,"counter":403,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900058#LLL00600"},{"type":"speech","time":1666199820,"counter":404,"content":"<p>I will have to ask the Minister to adjourn the debate at 7.20 p.m.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900058#LLL00700","speaker":"1617"},{"type":"speech","time":1666199820,"counter":405,"content":"<p>I move: \"That the Bill be now read a Second Time.\"<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the opportunity to introduce the Courts and Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2022.  The Bill introduces a number of important reforms in the law across a broad range of areas.  These amendments reach across many aspects of people's lives and have the potential to make a real difference.  These include court-related amendments that will facilitate centralisation and automation of certain court offices and processes.  This is part of a suite of measures that my Department continues to introduce which will improve access to justice and modernise our courts system.  The Bill also includes amendments across a diverse range of areas, including bankruptcy, Irish nationality and citizenship, international protection, immigration, legal services, civil legal aid and the Judicial Council.  The amendments proposed by this Bill will have a positive impact on citizens, assist in making our courts and legal services more accessible, update the civil justice legal framework and further modernise and reform key areas of our civil law.<\/p>  <p>  I would also like to indicate to the House that I intend to bring forward amendments on Committee Stage to the Occupiers' Liability Act 1995 in line with the Government policy objective of restricting the liability of occupiers.  There is a shared determination across the Government to remove the impediment that high insurance costs have on our economy and communities - on community groups, organisers of community events and small businesses.  I believe the proposals I intend to bring forward will strike the right balance between ensuring that businesses, community groups and organisers of events fulfil their duty of care responsibilities, while also acknowledging the importance of personal responsibility on the part of customers and members of the public.<\/p>  <p>  I also intend to introduce a number of other amendments to this Bill on Committee Stage.  I intend to propose amendments in areas including data protection and citizenship, as well as measures streamlining internal procedures in the probate process, cost orders and civil liability, and further amendments in regard to bankruptcy and arbitration.  I will provide further information on these important proposed amendments shortly.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill before the House today comprises 35 sections laid out across nine parts.  I will highlight the main provisions of the Bill.  Turning to Part 2, which covers amendments to the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, these will enable certificates of nationality issued by the Minister for Justice to be authenticated by the signature of an authorised officer of the Minister, instead of requiring the ministerial seal to be attached to the certificate in every case.  This will lead to a more efficient and streamlined process.<\/p>  <p>  Part 3 contains amendments to the Bankruptcy Act 1988.  These changes are designed to further modernise and streamline the bankruptcy process and to reduce unnecessary costs and delays for debtors, creditors, the High Court and, in effect, for taxpayers.  Modern bankruptcy is very different from its Victorian predecessor.  Important reforms, culminating in the Bankruptcy (Amendment) Act 2015, have reduced the normal duration of bankruptcy to one year, though the court can extend this if the debtor is not co-operating with the bankruptcy process or tries to conceal certain assets.  This shorter timeframe benefits both creditors and debtors.  Creditors receive a return much more promptly, as far as the debtor's means permit.  Debtors can return more rapidly to normal economic participation and, indeed, most bankruptcies are now initiated by the debtors themselves.<\/p>  <p>  These major reforms make it even more important to ensure that bankruptcy procedures support a thorough assessment and efficient administration of bankruptcy estates.  For example, the amendments in Part 3 of the Bill include: allowing for the appointment of a second bankruptcy inspector, if needed - this is a prudent amendment, given the complexity of some bankruptcy cases and current economic uncertainties; removing outdated and expensive requirements for bankruptcy notices to be published in a national newspaper, as well as on a dedicated website; empowering the official assignee to check that the debtor's financial statements to the High Court are complete and accurate before the debtor is adjudicated bankrupt; and ensuring that if the court directs a debtor to make payments to creditors from his or her surplus income, then delaying tactics by the debtor do not have the effect of reducing the number of payments that creditors can receive in practice.<\/p>  <p>  Part 4 amends the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004.  These amendments primarily deal with provisions in regard to the transfer and use of certain court funds.  This includes a provision allowing the Chief Justice to order dormant accounts funds of the Circuit Court and District Court to be encashed every five years.  These moneys were lodged into the court office as a result of proceedings in civil matters, and which subsequently were not claimed by the litigants after a number of years, following efforts by the Courts Service to return the moneys to the appropriate people.  This part includes other amendments which allow, subject to the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, proceeds of the dormant accounts of the courts to be used for the provision, management and maintenance of court buildings, the courts and the Courts Service's ICT facilities.  A final provision will allow the inclusion of the dormant funds of the Circuit Court and the District Court in the register of funds maintained by the accountant of the Courts of Justice and allow for details of the various proceedings to which these funds relate to be recorded in that register.<\/p>  <p>  In Part 5, amendments to the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015 provide for the commencement of the section of the Act allowing for the introduction of legal partnerships.  This is an important step which will enable partnerships between solicitors and barristers or between barristers and other barristers.  The introduction of legal partnerships is a key development in the modernisation of how legal services can be provided to consumers, private or enterprise, on a more competitive basis.<\/p>  <p>  Part 6 amends the International Protection Act 2015.  The amendments include provisions for the service of notices and documents by electronic means, and extension to the timeframe for which voluntary returns to country of origin may be confirmed from five days to 30 days.<\/p> <p>Other amendments relate to a decision of the Circuit Court where an appeal of a revocation of a refugee or subsidiary protection declaration may be appealed to the High Court on a point of law.<\/p> <p> Finally in this Part is an amendment to increase from three to five years the term of office of the members of the International Protection Appeals Tribunal.

John was probably one of the foremost members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in securing prosecutions against sex offenders across the west.  In fact, 26 of the 28 cases that he brought to the Central Criminal Court secured convictions.  Of those 28 cases, 27 also involved the late Detective Garda Colm Horkan and Garda Maeve Carthy, who is still within the force.<\/p><p>Amendments Nos. 2, 4 and 5 address the issue in the legislation where there is a requirement for a sex offender who has been put on the sex offenders register to notify the divisional headquarters.  Divisional headquarters are spread across the country.  For example, the divisional headquarters for my area of Longford, Roscommon and Mayo is located in Castlebar, County Mayo.  For someone living in Longford, Roscommon or Mayo, the nearest location to register is Castlebar.  The Bill states that a sex offender can inform any divisional headquarters in the country.  A situation could arise where someone who was convicted of a serious offence, was considered a high-risk sex offender and resided in, for example, Roscommon or Galway notified Wexford town Garda station.  The person would have complied with this legislation as drafted by doing so.  My amendments state that such persons must present themselves to the nearest public office of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, preferably the local 24-hour station.<\/p><p>Let us remember that it is the local garda&iacute; who will be responsible for monitoring these sex offenders, yet we are not even asking the sex offenders to comply with the legislation by presenting themselves at the local stations where they will be monitored.  This is wrong.  It facilitates high-risk sex offenders going undetected by allowing them to contact any divisional headquarters.  This comes on the back of a culture in the overall thrust of much of the legislation in this area that puts the rights into the hands of the offender rather than the victim or future potential victims.  I want the Bill to reflect a sex offender's responsibility to register at the local Garda station.<\/p><p>As the Minister knows, the register is there in name only.  Every year, in excess of 70 breaches of it are recorded.  These involve individuals who have come to the attention of the Garda, usually for some other reason.  They are then prosecuted for breaching the sex offenders register.  We need to put a robust system in place that facilitates the Garda in monitoring these individuals.  That can only happen if the Garda is given the tools to do so.<\/p><p>When I raised this issue with the Minister on Committee Stage, she stated that the inclusion of &quot;any&quot; divisional headquarters was to capture a situation where the sex offenders to be monitored were away from their local stations but that the intention of the legislation was to ensure that they would register at their local stations.  She stated that she would consider making this clear in the Bill, but that has not happened.  We need to see such clarity being provided.<\/p><p>In the Minister's letter to me of 28 September, she pointed out that, where a sex offender did not register at his or her local Garda station and instead registered at another station, something as significant as a change of address would lead to an automatic email emanating to notify all persons who had access to the sex offender's details on the PULSE system.  A difficulty with this is that a high-risk sex offender who is released from prison can call into a station in Wexford town and give an address in a rural townland in the west of Ireland.  We are supposed to rest assured because an email will be sent to Garda stations across the country saying that this individual has registered in Wexford town, but it is the garda based in Castlebar who has to make contact with this individual, has to try to track him or her down within seven days and have him or her fingerprinted and photographed.  The system does not allow that to happen.  Even if that member of the force is not on holidays or on leave and gets access to the information, it is likely that he or she will have to sift through hundreds of activity reports on every single sex offender in the country.  On a daily basis, a large volume of activity reports come to every garda in the country who is monitoring sex offenders.  A garda will have to sift through all of them to identify someone who has recently registered in another divisional headquarters but will now reside in his or her area and will then have to track that person down within seven days.  We are asking too much of garda&iacute; and giving too much power to sex offenders who want to remain underground and undetected.  The only way to put an effective system in place is to oblige in law convicted sex offenders who require monitoring to present themselves at their local Garda stations rather than at stations at the other end of the country.  I urge the Minister to accept the amendments that I have tabled to reflect this fact.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900059#MMM00700","speaker":"1603"},{"type":"speech","time":1666200420,"counter":413,"content":"<p>As the Deputy outlined, the Bill provides that a sex offender can notify at any Garda station that has been designated by the Garda Commissioner for that purpose or at any divisional headquarters.  In this way, we are not limiting the offender in notifying at his or her local station.  By drafting the provision in this way, a sex offender who regularly resides in Cork but who might by chance be in Donegal for three days can and will notify garda&iacute; in Donegal that he or she is in the area.<\/p>  <p>I reassure the Deputy that the way we have set this out has been undertaken in consultation with the Garda.  If, therefore, an offender notifies garda&iacute; at a different station than the one in the area where he or she would normally reside, that information will be reported on the PULSE system.  It is not only available to be viewed nationally but, in cases where a core change has been made to an offender's details, such as, for example, a change of address, in cases where a person is not just visiting another area, an automatic email will notify all persons who have access to the sex offender's details on the PULSE system, including the sex offender's management and the intelligence unit.<\/p> <p> The Commissioner will designate the various stations throughout the country at which sex offenders can register and notify, and this information will be published on the Garda website.  What we have set out in this legislation, therefore, has been done in consultation with the Garda Commissioner.  It is not to restrict where sex offenders can register themselves but to try to ensure that if they are moving or are outside the home places where they are designated, they can still register, even if they are moving for only a short time.<\/p> <p> Compliance in this area is high.  There is nothing in the figures applying to this section to suggest there is significant non-compliance.  Compliance is still high, and everything we have set out here has, as I said, been done in consultation with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The force feels it will operate and support the work it is doing.

The Minister is looking at this issue from a particular perspective, but if we turn it on its head and look at it from the opposite perspective, rather than looking at this provision and how it facilitates sex offenders, it will be seen it is not limiting them to the local Garda station.  What the Minister is saying to a convicted sex offender, who must be monitored and who poses a high risk in the community, is that he or she can go to any Garda station in the country, in Wexford town, for example, present there and tell the garda&iacute; in that station that he or she is going to live in rural west Roscommon.  The offender in that case will have complied with the law.  The difficulty is that it will be the Garda members in Roscommon who will have seven days from that point to try to track down that individual and have him or her present himself or herself in the Garda station in Castlerea to provide his or her fingerprints and photographs.<\/p>  <p>  This is a mechanism to ensure sex offenders remain underground, those that deliberately want to remain underground.  What we need, and what we must have in the legislation, is a legal requirement that a sex offender must attend his or her local Garda station when registering and not some far-flung location somewhere else around the country, because it is the local Garda members who will be responsible for monitoring this individual.  I refer to the Minister saying everything will be okay if a sex offender were to go to Wexford town to register because an activity report on the PULSE system will be circulated to every garda in the country who is monitoring sex offenders.  These garda&iacute; get hundreds of notifications.  The Minister is asking them to sift through these hundreds of notifications and to identify a new individual who has moved into their area and who is trying to remain underground and trying to conceal his identity so it will not be monitored.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900060#NNN00200","speaker":"1603"},{"type":"speech","time":1666201020,"counter":416,"content":"<p>We are not doing this to facilitate sex offenders.

Having again engaged with the Garda on this aspect now, the force is happy and clear that this is the appropriate way to approach this specific part of the Bill.  It is important we take on board the Garda's requests and requirements in this context.  I refer to how this legislation will work best for the people who, as the Deputy just outlined, will have to monitor and engage with sex offenders and make this work.<\/p>  <p>  Compliance in this regard now is high.  It can always be better.  Any non-compliance is not a situation we want to find ourselves in when we are talking about sex offenders.  This, however, is about ensuring we have a system that works.

We engaged again with the Garda in this regard, and it is happy with how this provision is being set out.  For me, this is the appropriate route to take in this regard and this is why I cannot accept this amendment.<\/p>  <p>  I will give this commitment, however.

I must go now, though, on what I am being told will work for the people who will be monitoring these sex offenders and this is why we have not changed this provision.  This is why it has remained as it was set out on Committee Stage and this is, unfortunately, why I am not going to accept this amendment.  I accept, however, that if issues arise, if there are significant concerns and if the Garda tells me the force is having problems in respect of being unable to access information and this means people are going underground, or however it might be phrased, then we will obviously have to respond and to act.

The Minister is telling us the Garda is saying it is happy with what is in this Bill.  I have been at this for 13 years and I can tell the Minister that garda&iacute; throughout the country enforcing these measures now are saying that a coach-and-four is being driven through this scheme by having this flexibility built into it.  They are saying this because it will be used and it will be exploited.<\/p>  <p>  Compliance is not high in this regard.  The Garda identifies 70 breaches of this legislation annually where sex offenders are not found at the addresses they have specified and listed.  I reiterate there are 70 breaches annually, on average.  This has been happening for the past two decades in this regard because the system, as it is structured, puts all the cards in the hands of the sex offenders.  This has left garda&iacute; in a situation where their hands have been tied behind their backs.  We are now asking garda&iacute; in different parts of the country to try to track down these individuals and ensure they comply with what is very worthily set out in this legislation, without the members of the force even knowing what these offenders look like.  I say this because, as the legislation is written, to comply with the law a sex offender can present himself or herself at a Garda station in Wexford and then reside in the most isolated parts of Roscommon or Galway in the west.  It will then be the responsibility of the local garda&iacute; in the west to try to figure out exactly where this person lives and ensure he or she complies with the law without even knowing what this person looks like.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900060#NNN00400","speaker":"1603"},{"type":"vote","time":1666201620,"counter":418,"content":"<p>Amendment put:<\/p><p>The D\u00e1il divided: T\u00e1, 9;

This amendment is at the request of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to make sure offenders coming into the State, who were convicted outside the State, are subject to the same requirements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900063#QQQ00800","speaker":"1502"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1666202520,"counter":438,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1666202520,"counter":439,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 11 to 33, inclusive, are related and may be discussed together.

It deletes the original provision under section 14D that concerns the disclosure of information relating to a relevant offender to police services or other law enforcement agencies outside the State.  This was to allow An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to enter into agreements with other police forces to share information on sex offenders.  However, on the basis of further consultation with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, we now know this section is not required as there is legislation in place on the sharing of information with other police forces that is robust.  Agreements already in place should not be jeopardised.<\/p><p>Amendments Nos. 11, 13, 15 to 19, inclusive, 21 to 31, inclusive, and 33 are all technical changes that arise from amendment No. 12.  These deal with numerical and grammatical changes brought about by the deletion of section 14D.  For example, the original section 14E will be named &quot;14D&quot;, 14F will be named &quot;14E&quot;, and so forth.  These are very technical changes.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 14 will allow An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na separately to provide a photo as part of any necessary disclosure where there is a risk of harm to the public or a member of the public by an offender.  This amendment will contribute to the further protection of our communities in respect of disclosures and will be in addition to information about a registered sex offender already provided by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to a member of the public where deemed appropriate to do so.  Again, this is an amendment that came on foot of a discussion with Deputy Naughten on Committee Stage to make it explicit that a photograph could be provided as part of the information that is disclosed.  The Bill had provided generally for any other information deemed necessary by the Garda, but specifying that a photo can be provided is an important measure.  I again thank Deputy Naughten for his proposal and his continued support of the Bill.<\/p><p>The first main amendment is so that we do not replicate or in any way jeopardise a legal system or structure that already exists within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The second main amendment, separate to the technical amendments, is to make sure the Garda, where it deems it necessary, can provide a photograph if someone is in danger or there is an immediate threat.  I thank Deputy Naughten for putting that suggestion forward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900063#QQQ01100","speaker":"1502"},{"type":"speech","time":1666202520,"counter":441,"content":"<p>Will the Minister clarify that she is satisfied the other provisions already in legislation will ensure that reciprocal arrangement will be in place within the common travel area and outside that more generally?<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the provision in amendment No. 14 to allow a photograph of a convicted sex offender to be provided to a third party where it is necessary to identify that offender to protect either a vulnerable adult or child.  I will not dwell on this, but I again highlight amendment No. 20, which is in my name.  I do not think the convicted sex offender should be given notification in this regard.  The most likely scenario is that of a high-risk sex offender, who has exploited young children in the past, being in a relationship in which there are young children.  To contact that sex offender to tell them you will inform the person they are in a relationship with that they have such a conviction and that there is a risk to those children will only drive that individual underground.  The sex offender should not be given that forewarning and I will, therefore, be pressing amendment No. 20.<\/p>  <p>  Amendment No. 32, which I tabled, relates to section 13, which provides that the Commissioner shall publish or cause to be published information he or she considers appropriate in setting out the manner in which sections 14D and 14E operate, which relates to the disclosure of information.  All the information available and collated under sections 14A to 14E, inclusive, should be made available.  This would be important in the monitoring of the effectiveness of this legislation, ensuring it is kept current and up to date, and ensuring any weaknesses in the implementation of the legislation could be identified through making those statistics available.  The legislation in relation to what data the Commissioner must publish should be broader, and I ask the Minister to accept this amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900063#QQQ01200","speaker":"1603"},{"type":"speech","time":1666202520,"counter":442,"content":"<p>On my own amendments and the changes, there were concerns what we were proposing would in some way jeopardise the system that is already in place.  As it currently stands, the sharing of information regarding sex offenders travelling into and out of the State is carried out by way of police-to-police information, that is, intelligence information exchange via Interpol.  This allows the relevant police forces to manage the risk posed by such individuals while they are resident either temporarily or, indeed, permanently in a different jurisdiction.<\/p> <p>A memorandum of understanding was signed in 2006 between the Irish and UK Governments to ensure the sharing of information between different organisations with regard to sex offenders.  In 2008, an agreement relating to the sharing of personal data regarding the investigation of sexual offences and the monitoring of sex offenders was signed by the PSNI and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This agreement provides for the sharing of personal information through a single point of contact in both police services.  <\/p> <p> Since Brexit we have made sure that all of the memorandums of understanding or co-operation agreements continue and there is no lapse so that there is no challenge to the work of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSNI or on the UK side.  I am confident, based on this and discussions with the Garda, that it is happy with how information is currently exchanged.  We would not want to in any way jeopardise the work that is ongoing.<\/p> <p> Regarding amendment No. 20, it is something we considered carefully.  We sought advice from the Attorney General on fair procedure.  Each individual, irrespective of who he or she is and what he or she has done, is entitled to fair procedure.  This is an opportunity for a person to correct the record if information is incorrect.  I appreciate what the Deputy is saying about giving someone a heads up that this is going to happen.  The most important thing is that if information needs to be shared with the person that it is shared with that person.  If a woman or man are a difficult situation and something comes to light, the most important thing is that the Garda shares that information with the person.  The requirement to inform the person that the information is being shared is clear from a constitutional perspective, and has been outlined clearly to me from a constitutional perspective as something we need to do.<\/p> <p> If there is an immediate danger or threat, the Garda can bypass that.  If it feels that by telling the person it will make this information available to somebody else and that that would pose a risk to somebody in a similar household, be it a child anybody else, the Garda can bypass this.  There is a provision to make sure there are safeguards to protect people.  If it is the case that people do not live together and are not in the same town or engaged with each other and there is no immediate threat by the Garda notifying the person, that is the route it has to go.  There is a clear provision in the Bill that if a woman, man or child is at immediate risk the Garda can tell the person directly without having to raise it with the other person first.  It is an important provision.<\/p> <p> The Deputy's second point is more technical.  It relates to amendment No. 32, which seeks to expand the information the Commissioner can publish.  Section 14A relates to interpretation.  Section 14C provides for the Minister to make regulations, and I do not think it would be practical for the Commissioner to publish this information.  Section 14B concerns the composition of the SORAM teams, which are already available on the Garda website.  It is already public information.  The Bill allows for the Commissioner to publish information on how disclosures to the public will operate and this still stands in what was section 14E.  That is why I am not accepting the amendment.  Some of the specific parts the Deputy referenced relate to the Minister, therefore it would be not be appropriate for the Commissioner to deal with that.  Some of it is already available and one part of it is more about interpretation.  What information the Commissioner needs to provide is set out and there is enough in the Bill to make sure that the Commissioner can provide as much information as possible where there is a risk, harm or threat to somebody.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900063#QQQ01300","speaker":"1502","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666203120,"counter":444,"content":"<p>I want to come back on amendment No. 20.

I agree with her.  The difficulty is that in the circumstances I have spoken about, if an individual is given three days' notice in respect of information, he or she will disappear.  The immediate threat will be gone.  The information would not be shared with the individual.  What happens if, down the road, the individual then gets back into a relationship and on that occasion is very conscious of the need to make sure that what has happened goes under the radar with the Garda?  The Garda would then not be aware of what had happened.  My understanding of the Bill, as drafted, is that where an individual hightails it, disappears and goes underground, the Garda cannot disclose that information to a partner.

Be it stalking, harassment or whatever we call it, it absolutely ruins peoples' lives and can have a devastating impact.  There is a certain situation of which we are both aware where a horrendous crime has been committed and a person has served time and is now potentially continuing that level of harassment.  I gave a commitment that this would be dealt with in a separate Bill.<\/p>  <p>  The Harassment, Harmful Communications and Related Offences Act 2020 was obviously dealt with but more recently, last week, we had Second Stage of the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2022, which introduced stalking as a stand-alone offence for the first time.  The Bill expanded the harassment offence but it also introduced a new system of civil orders around stalking-type behaviour.<\/p>  <p>  One big challenge here is for somebody to have to go back to court and go through a criminal case again with a person with which he or she has gone through it before.  It can be quite daunting and difficult and the threshold to have that succeed may be much higher.  What we are saying with the civil order is that it does not require criminal prosecution.  It would require a lower threshold whereby one can make it clear that a person's behaviour might likely impact on a person's well-being, mental health or state of being and it would be much easier, either for an individual or a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, to get a protection order against another person in the civil courts without having to go through a criminal trial.<\/p>  <p>  I appreciate it means that a person has to go through another process through which he or she might have already gone but we have to accept that if a person is convicted of a crime and has served a time, obviously, there is no way to go back on that unless a particular order has been put in place by the judge at the time to the effect that the person must comply with certain conditions on release.  It is still the case that this can be said by a judge or that certain conditions can be put in place but if that does not happen, what I have set out here is a much easier and more simplified process that would allow somebody to impose a restraining order on someone whose actions and behaviours might not meet the threshold for stalking or harassment but whose actions, certainly to a reasonable person, could inflict considerable harm on an individual.<\/p>  <p>  That Bill passed Second Stage just last week.  With the support of the Committee on Justice and others in the House, I hope that legislation will be enacted by the end of the year.  It would very much be in line with the timing of this legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900065#SSS00100","speaker":"1502"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1666203720,"counter":496,"content":"<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1666203720,"counter":497,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 35:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 25, line 28, to delete &ldquo;for a specified term&rdquo;.  <\/blockquote>  <p>We have discussed this matter previously.

I have highlighted the first key weakness in my amendments earlier.  The second key weakness is the failure to close off the loopholes that allow sex offenders to have their offences effectively forgotten through the change in the offender's name by deed poll or by using the Google right to be forgotten.<\/p><p>For the sake of victims who have to live with the consequences of these perpetrators and any potential future victims, those convicted of sexual offences should lose the right to be forgotten permanently.  As I have said to the Minister, the only test that Google seems to apply to a request to be forgotten online and have the court reports erased is the length of time since the material went online.  That is not in the public interest.  Google does not consider what is in the public interest when it removes access to information about a court conviction permanently.  <\/p><p>Regardless of any court conviction there should not be the possibility of having that information erased because, as the Minister knows, court hearings are to be held in public except in exceptional circumstances.  The decisions are to be given in public.  In general the names of those convicted are published and all of that information is now available through the electronic format.  It is the main primary record of courts and public proceedings in this country.  There is no legitimate reason the likes of Google should be allowed to remove those listings because it is an exploitation of EU privacy laws.<\/p><p>There is provision with the general data protection regulation, GDPR, privacy laws to ensure that the public interest is protected.  GDPR, in circumstances where a convicted sex offender looks to have the record of his or her conviction erased, allows for a situation to arise where Google and other organisations can refuse to erase that information but that does not apply here.  Google, to date, has defended its handling of requests to delist articles relating to such criminal convictions on the basis of the amount of time since the conviction took place.  That is the only consideration it is giving to this.  That is not satisfactory or good enough.<\/p><p>I ask that the Minister take a proactive approach to this by bringing Google and other relevant organisations into the Department and making it crystal clear to them that we will not tolerate their allowing happen a situation in which the records of sex offenders are delisted from Google searches or any other similar organisation.  This is a further abuse of the victims of these crimes in that the stories have been erased.<\/p> <p>Unfortunately, a huge degree of pressure is put on victims, albeit inadvertently, to waive anonymity in many cases so it can be ensured the sex offender is named.  It is wrong, after the victim has gone through that trauma and released their name into the public domain so the names of the perpetrators could be exposed and published, for them to find out down the road the likes of Google has delisted that.  That is a far greater abuse again.  We, as a country, and the Minister, in her role, need to ensure this practice is stopped immediately and that those records remain permanently available.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900065#SSS00800","speaker":"1603","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666204320,"counter":504,"content":"<p>The GDPR is determined and interpreted by the European Court of Justice and I think the court has been clear in saying that where there is a serious offence, including rape, sexual assault and abuse, there is absolutely no right to be forgotten.  There is a right where it is a minor offence.  We talk here about trying to work with people who want to change their lives and turn their lives around following minor offences.  There can be an impact on their applying for jobs or on their personal life.  Where it is a minor offence I think we can agree it is something that is not at the same level as a serious offence.  I stress a sexual offence of any nature is never going to be allowed to be forgotten.  I am not aware that there have been cases won by any of the companies because time has elapsed.  If there are cases they can be presented to me but this is absolutely clear.  I share the Deputy's concerns that if these types of cases were being removed it would be a very serious offence but at the moment the court is clear on how this is interpreted and any type of sexual offence cannot be removed.  There is no right to remove it.  It is in the public interest and it is vital victims know that and that they are reassured by that.<\/p>  <p>  I engage with different companies.  I recently met Meta, or Facebook, on the issue of working with it to ensure every protection and measure is put in place to protect and support victims of sexual abuse, domestic violence and assault.  There was discussion of ensuring technology is used for the better to support people because as we know, as technology evolves there are those who wish to use it for their own reasons and that can obviously have significant negative impacts on people, whether it is for abuse or other reasons as well.  There is an obligation on the companies themselves to protect the people who use their platforms.<\/p>  <p>  The law is very clear here, namely, there is no right to be forgotten in any type of a sexual offence.

He went on to give examples of where this has been used to delist very serious criminal offences, stating \"The Irish Independent is also aware of the delisting of at least three articles relating to the conviction of men for possession of child sex abuse material.\".  The article is only from last year so that is in the public domain.  It talks about other cases relating to the same issue.  This is going on; it is happening.  Google is facilitating this as we speak.  It is regulated from this country.

Those are just a couple of brief examples within the time I have.

I thank my colleague, Sarah Champion MP, from the UK and her advisor Lucy Cserna for their assistance on this issue, which is one that affects both Ireland and the United Kingdom.  A sex offender may change their name by deed poll in order to circumvent the monitoring under the sex offenders register.  There have been published examples of this happening in the UK.  I have previously given the example in the House of a Terry Price who committed a string of sexual offences over three decades and changed his name on five occasions.  Having spoken to garda&iacute; involved in the monitoring of sex offenders, it is nearly standard procedure now that convicted sex offenders are changing their names by deed poll to ensure they can avoid monitoring and that they do not come to the attention of people.<\/p><p>I have not been able to draft an amendment to the legislation here.  My colleague in the UK has not been able to do it either.  This is a problem across both jurisdictions with the use of deed polls to change names to restrict the ability of the authorities to monitor these offenders and we need to address it.  The Minister is going to come back in and tell me that if a sex offender changes their name under this legislation they have a responsibility to inform the Garda of that.  I ask that the Courts Service, when someone changes their name, make the information available to the Garda so garda&iacute; do not have to wait for a sex offender to come and declare themselves.  It will be done through a third party, namely the Courts Services, and the Garda will be advised of that fact as it happens rather than at some stage down the road.<\/p><p>The difficulty is we have a very high rate of breaches of the existing sex offenders register.  This legislation will give the Garda tools to effectively monitor sex offenders but leaving loopholes in the legislation that can be exploited by convicted sex offenders makes it more difficult.  This is one loophole that is being exploited both in this jurisdiction and in the UK.  The mechanism to change one's name by deed poll is being used to try to avoid monitoring and detection and this is an issue that must be addressed.  It is one the garda&iacute; who are monitoring sex offenders around the country have brought to my attention and told me is a specific problem they are dealing with and that they need the tools to do so.<\/p> <p>I accept that it is a complex area.  The easiest mechanism to use involves having a clear provision or direction to the Courts Service to make garda&iacute; aware of changes that would happen.  That would get around this issue and ensure far more effective monitoring of those high-risk sex offenders who have a determination to exploit again.  We need to ensure that every possible avenue is closed off where that is feasible.  I accept that there will always be risks.  We can never be entirely certain.  Let us ensure that we close as many of these loopholes as possible.  I ask the Minister to consider my proposal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101900066#TTT00900","speaker":"1603","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666204920,"counter":513,"content":"<p>There is no legislative basis to change one's name by deed poll, so we cannot stop an offender from changing his or her name.

There are strict monitoring requirements, so if a person were to change his or her name and not engage and not notify that this had happened, he or she would face prosecution and be liable for fine of &euro;10,000 or a prison term from 12 months up to five years.

I would like to see the Courts Service inform the Garda authorities and for them to then inform the member of the force who is monitoring that sex offender in County Roscommon, County Galway or wherever of the change in name.
