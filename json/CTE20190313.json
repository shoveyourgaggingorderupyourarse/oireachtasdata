This is the third time the committee has given me the opportunity to address it.  Last year, the committee invited me to present the country specific recommendations adopted by the Council.<\/p> <p>  The country report for Ireland was published by the Commission on 27 February, together with the country reports of the other member states.  On the same day, the Commission also adopted a communication summarising the main findings in the 28 reports.<\/p> <p>  The country reports are mid-way in the cycle of the European Semester.  As the committee will be aware, the European Semester is the process within which member states co-ordinate their economic policies.  The current cycle started on 21 November last year with the adoption by the Commission of the annual growth survey, the alert mechanism report, the draft joint employment report and the recommendations for the euro area.  For the committee's convenience, we have distributed a few slides supporting this presentation.  The European Semester cycle is shown in Figure 1.  I do not propose to go through the slides and figures, as I did last year, but I can come back to them, if need be, during the question and answer session.<\/p> <p>  We open the dialogue phase with the authorities and the stakeholders in order to prepare the country specific recommendations of this year.  My presence here today is part of this dialogue phase.<\/p> <p>  Before summarising the findings in the country report, let me highlight a distinctive feature of the current European Semester cycle that the current European Semester cycle runs in parallel with the negotiations of the Multiannual Financial Framework, MFF, for the period 2021 to 2027.  As the committee will be aware, this is the moment when the EU establishes the public investment priorities for the coming ten years.  This is the reason the Commission considers this as an opportunity to reinforce the synergies between economic policy co-ordination within the European Semester and the allocation of EU funds.<\/p> <p>  This year, the European Semester is putting a particularly strong focus on identifying and prioritising national and regional investment needs to guide the programming of cohesion policy projects.  In practical terms, this means that all country reports have included a specific annex on investment areas that the Commission considers a priority for the European Regional Development Fund, ERDF, and the European Social Fund Plus over the period 2021 to 2027.  This annex will serve as a basis for the dialogue between member states and the Commission in view of programming these funds.  In this regard, I am happy to announce that my colleagues responsible for regional and social funds are coming to Dublin on 20 March to present this Annex D to the Irish authorities and the stakeholders.<\/p><p>The analysis of investment needs, however, is not just confined to this annex.  The Commission has also identified the priority areas for public and private investment in each country.  These priority areas are the ones that underpin inclusive and sustainable economic growth and intense job creation.  Let me finish this introduction by confirming that this is not the only event to discuss the findings of the country reports with the authorities and social and economic stakeholders.  I will have the pleasure of meeting many stakeholders tomorrow when a Commission team will present the findings of the country report in the European Commission representation here in Dublin.<br\/><br\/>Let me now turn to the main findings of the report for Ireland.  As with past editions, the report provides an analysis of the economic and social situation in the country.  Starting with the macroeconomic framework, I emphasise that the current economic policy co-ordination cycle takes place in a context of sustained but less dynamic economic growth in Europe.  Although the European economy is expected to grow for the seventh year in a row in 2019, the pace of growth is projected to moderate and the outlook is subject to major uncertainty.  Ireland is not an exception.  Economic growth in Ireland was robust in 2018 supported by strong labour market developments and construction investment.  Real GDP growth, however, is forecast to moderate in 2019 and 2020, although compared with many other member states it will remain solid.  The growth profile and composition can be found in figure 2 of my accompanying submission detailing the growth forecast.  This benign outlook is clouded by heightened uncertainty, mostly related to external factors such as the terms of the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the European Union and changes to the international taxation and trade environment.<br\/><br\/>Since I have mentioned Brexit, let me highlight that the publication of the country reports occurred this year just 30 days ahead of the deadline for the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the EU.  Despite the closeness of the deadline, the terms of the UK&rsquo;s future relations with the EU were uncertain at the moment of preparing and publishing the report.  This again led us to avoid speculations in the report about possible scenarios and, instead, we use a technical assumption of the <i>status quo<\/i>in respect of trading relations between the EU and the UK.  The vote yesterday in the British Parliament has not much clarified the situation.  I understand there is a vote today and probably another tomorrow, so we are still in an uncertain environment.  The Commission very much regrets the outcome of the vote yesterday.  We are, to some extent, disappointed that the UK Government has been unable to ensure a majority for the withdrawal agreement concluded by both parties in November.<br\/><br\/>Returning to the contents of the report, labour market outcomes remain favourable, with the unemployment rate approaching pre-crisis levels.  As the labour market tightens, however, skills shortages are becoming increasingly apparent in fast growing sectors, most notably for information and communication technology and highly skilled professionals in the construction and property sectors.  Against this background, wage growth is picking up.  This could be a sign of an economy operating at its potential.  This is the reason we have indicated that the Irish economy could show some signs of overheating.  In this context, it is worth highlighting that we observe a relatively low rate of labour market participation, notably by women, and also in voluntary part-time work, which could show the existence of underused human capacity.<br\/><br\/>Moving to a more detailed summary of the main findings, I would like to recall that within the macroeconomic imbalances procedure, Ireland was identified last year as recording macroeconomic imbalances, although they were not considered excessive.  As has been the case of other member states where the possible existence of risks of macroeconomic imbalances were identified in the alert mechanism report in November, the report for Ireland undertakes an in-depth review of possible macroeconomic imbalances.  A summary of the decisions and the different allocations of the member states in the macroeconomic procedure and the Stability and Growth Pact can be found in the accompanying document.  The report finds that Ireland continues to face macroeconomic imbalances related to the large stocks of private and public debt and net external liabilities.  Challenges remain despite notable improvements on the back of robust economic growth and policy action.<br\/><br\/>In particular, public debt relative to GDP is diminishing, but remains vulnerable to unfavourable shocks.  In addition, as also highlighted by this committee in the recent post-budget report, the reliance on potentially volatile revenues and recurrent overspending in healthcare put the long-term sustainability of public finances at risk.  In the context of a strong cyclical position, better than expected tax revenue intakes provide an opportunity for accelerating debt reduction and building up buffers against adverse future shocks.  Private indebtedness is further reducing, with the private debt to GDP ratio being below the macroeconomic imbalance procedure threshold when we discount the effects of multinational corporations.  Household debt relative to gross disposable income, however, continues to be among the highest in the European Union.  This makes Irish households vulnerable to negative income shocks.  Figure 4 in the accompanying document provides information on private indebtedness, its evolution and composition.<br\/><br\/>Vulnerabilities in the financial sector are declining.  Domestic banks have significantly reduced non-performing loans.  This reduction has taken place through portfolio sales and restructuring activities.  Banks have also remained profitable and well capitalised.  Although these findings are positive, the report also concludes that long-term arrears continue to be relatively high.  More than half of total non-performing loans have been in arrears for more than two years and relate to mortgages.  The net international investment position of the country, although highly negative, continues to improve.  It is difficult to determine to what extent this points to a vulnerability.  The investment position of Ireland is strongly influenced by the presence of multinational companies and the International Financial Services Centre.  In such a case, the possible vulnerabilities would not strongly affect the domestic sector.<\/p><p>In the area of housing, we observe that the broad range of measures implemented by the Government to tackle the undersupply of housing are bearing fruit.  Housing supply is rapidly recovering, although it is true it is from low levels and still falling short of demand.  As a result, house price inflation remains high, although it has recently moderated.<\/p><p> Where investment is concerned, and investment has a prominent role in the report this year, let me summarise the main investment priorities identified in the report.  The report concludes that more investment in research and development, skills and digitalisation would address the lagging productivity of domestic firms.  It could also address the sizeable regional differences in competitiveness, productivity and skilled labour that exist in Ireland, mostly due to the concentration of multinationals around Dublin.  In addition, more investment in clean energy, transport, water, broadband and housing, as well as to decarbonise sectors with high emissions, could foster sustainable growth.  Decarbonisation is important, not only for its environmental benefits, but also because a lack of action could involve costs by 2030.  In general, but also in the context of Brexit, the report considers that Ireland could benefit from diversifying its maritime transport and energy connections with continental Europe.<\/p><p> Last but not least, access to employment for all jobseekers could foster inclusive growth.  Here, the lack of sufficient affordable childcare is weighing on women&rsquo;s labour market participation.  In addition, rising homelessness requires continued attention.  It is worth emphasising that the national development plan addresses many of these investment needs by increasing the capital investment effort to &euro;116 billion over the period 2018 to 2027.  Moreover, the announced future jobs programme may help to increase the productivity of small and medium-sized enterprises.  Nonetheless, incentivising private investment in areas such as clean energy, transport, housing and skills remains a challenge.<\/p><p> The report also includes the customary assessment of the progress on implementing the country-specific recommendations.  The conclusion is that some progress has been made.<\/p><p> To sum up, the economic outlook for Ireland remains positive but it is clouded by heightened external risks.  The implemented structural reforms oriented towards enhancing the resilience of the Irish financial system and the rainy day fund may provide a buffer to future external shocks.  However, the strong dependence on the activities of a limited number of multinational firms, the efficiency of healthcare expenditure and closing remaining investment gaps remain challenges.  Let me recall that the publication of the country reports marks the start of the dialogue between the Commission and member states on policy options to address identified challenges.  I am, therefore, very interested to hear the committee's views on our new report for Ireland.  I remain ready to answer any questions the committee may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2019031300002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Carlos Mart&iacute;nez Mongay","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1552483800,"counter":12,"content":"<p>Thank you very much for that interesting statement.

I have several questions.  Does Mr. Mart&iacute;nez Mongay have a view in regard to future ECB interest rate rises, given we read something recently in regard to the susceptibility of mortgage holders here, particularly early mortgage holders who are on tracker rates, to increased ECB rates?  Mr. Mart&iacute;nez Mongay might give us a view and a timeline for that.<\/p> <p>  A figure Mr. Mart&iacute;nez Mongay may not be able to give us now, but which is important, concerns reports the committee has received recently suggesting Ireland is going to rely more and more on an immigrant workforce, especially in the construction industry.  A counter-balancing fact in that regard would help in terms of what number of the Irish labour force are working in the other 26 or 27 EU states.  It would be politically useful to let people know it is not just a one-way flow but works two ways.<\/p> <p>  We have had the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council at the committee on a number of occasions.  It tells us the implementation of the common consolidated corporate tax base, CCCTB, would have even more negative consequences for our economy than Brexit.  Mr. Mart&iacute;nez Mongay might speak to that.<\/p> <p>  A repeated theme in presentations to this committee, which we take on board and listen to, concerns Ireland's perceived overdependence on and vulnerability to corporation tax receipts from a small number of multinational companies.  Does Mr. Mart&iacute;nez Mongay think this issue could be adequately addressed by siphoning off more tax income into the rainy day fund that has been established?<\/p> <p>  To some degree, and I mean this very respectfully, it is interesting to hear the Commission's report because it chimes with a number of reports the committee receives and with a number of themes that arise in them, such as the over-reliance on corporation tax, overspending on health and, if that continues, future volatility in public spending.  We know all that but what is the Commission's suggested solution?  These reports are very interesting but what do we do?  What advice does the Commission give the Government?  On the over-reliance on corporation tax, for example, what does Mr. Mart&iacute;nez Mongay suggest we do?  What policy changes does he suggest, apart from things like the rainy day fund?<\/p> <p>  Mr. Mart&iacute;nez Mongay highlights non-performing loans, which is fine from an accountant's point of view and very objective, and I agree we should be dealing with non-performing loans.  However, many of these are mortgages of people who are in their homes.  If they are put out of their homes, they have to rent homes at colossally high rents, particularly in Dublin, so they just go from the frying pan into the fire.  There is a particular context to this and I am not sure if the Commission appreciates that enough.  It is one thing talking clinically about non-performing loans but there are realities and people who live behind those loans.  It has been the practice and objective of successive Irish Governments to keep people in their homes.  Will Mr. Mart&iacute;nez Mongay speak to that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2019031300002#F00300","speaker":"1311"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1552483800,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Lahart.

I can refer to what Mr. Draghi said a few days ago.  The ECB follows economic developments very closely and is aware of developments, not only in the real economy, but also concerning inflation.  In my view, it will be taking all of this information into account which it comes to the normalisation of monetary policy.<\/p><p>I suppose, therefore, that the ECB will adjust its interest rate policy in accordance with the economic environment.  We have to take into account that sometimes the impact of monetary policy on the specific conditions concerning mortgages in a country is not passed on immediately or fully.  It depends on the policies of the banks.  The business models of the banks depend on a series of macroeconomic and financial stability policies implemented by the supervisor.  This would be good news in a case where an economy recovered very quickly and would allow the normalisation of interest rates by the ECB.  In my view, according to what Mr. Draghi explained some days ago, it will go hand in hand simultaneously with the macroeconomic environment.<\/p><p> I know information on the number of Irish nationals living outside Ireland and EU nationals living in Ireland exists but I do not have it with me.  We will be very pleased to send this information to the committee.  I have seen the information for a number of countries and it exists in the same way on the number of EU nationals living in Ireland.<\/p><p> With regard to the implementation of the CCCTB, the Commission's idea on this proposal has been to avoid a race to the bottom in which companies in the EU can use different criteria to define the corporate tax base to elude or avoid taxation.  I do not think the introduction of the CCCTB would be more harmful than other shocks.  It depends on how the entire system would adapt.  The proposal the Commission has in mind on homogenising and harmonising the corporate tax base is precisely to avoid a race to the bottom whereby we would have the opposite effect to what we want, namely, that, in principle, it would stabilise the levels of tax revenues that are necessary to finance expenditure.<\/p><p> If I understood correctly the question on the rainy day fund, the idea and the goal of the authorities is to use extra revenues in good times so as to be able to have more expenditure or less taxation in bad times.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2019031300002#F00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Carlos Mart&iacute;nez Mongay","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1552483800,"counter":18,"content":"<p>Is it an effective way to reduce our perceived vulnerability or reliance?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2019031300002#G00200","speaker":"1311"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1552483800,"counter":19,"content":"<p>Indeed.  One of the vulnerabilities of the Irish economy is that it is more open and, therefore, subject to external shocks.  The fund would show that the economy, the Government and the public finances are sound enough to compensate or fight against these shocks without endangering sustainability.  It is important to reduce vulnerabilities.<\/p> <p>  What we must do in the context of the report, not only here but in general - and this is why I am here - is listen to views on our analysis.  People do not need to agree with the analysis but we would like to understand their views on various issues.  We want to open a period of dialogue during which there will be an exchange between the Commission and the various stakeholders, including the authorities and the parliaments, in which we try to arrive at a common diagnosis and from there we can agree on certain policies.  This should be reflected in the national reform programme which, if I am not mistaken, will be discussed and presented to the Parliament.  The Government will present its policy proposals to address the diagnosis on the vulnerabilities and challenges that have been identified by the report.<\/p> <p>  On rents, the report contains very clear analysis and warns about the fact that rents have increased by more than 20%.  This is linked to the fact, also identified in the report, that it is clear there is an undersupply of housing, which affects not only the price of new houses but also rents.  The report draws the attention of the authorities and the Government to this in order that policies are discussed to increase the supply of housing.  It is clear the reduction of non-performing loans is not intended to put people on the streets but to help them to reduce or repay mortgages and, at the same time, support the profitability of the banks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2019031300002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Carlos Mart&iacute;nez Mongay"},{"type":"speech","time":1552483800,"counter":20,"content":"<p>I welcome the Deputy director general and his colleagues.  Is the full report not, to some extent, a total cop-out in the context of our country having to deal with Brexit?  We are following what is happening in the British Parliament on an hourly basis and we cannot believe that we are in the situation in which we find ourselves.  We will have a debate on Brexit later this evening in which a number of us will speak.  The report's projections are based on the status quo but surely that is a total cop-out.  This is a cataclysmic event for our country because our economy is so intertwined with the British economy.  The publication this morning of the suggested no-deal British tariffs has caused grave anxiety and anguish in our farming and business communities.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Mart&iacute;nez Mongay mentioned growth.  In recent years we have the amazing growth figure of 7%, which is a lot higher than all of our EU partners but we have projections from the Central Bank, the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council and other bodies that brief us that it could collapse to zero by 2020.  We are faced with an existential threat to our economy but this is not apparent in the report as far as I can see.  It is as if this is not going to happen.<\/p> <p>  This morning, our Sinn F&eacute;in colleagues asked about a redress fund to support businesses and farmers.  People have asked for the rainy day fund to be utilised in this regard.  We almost certainly will have a second budget if there is a no-deal Brexit in the coming weeks.<\/p><p>Is it not the case, therefore, that this report does not address the challenge we face?  That challenge is absolutely profound.  A part of the other economy to which I refer is located on our island.  We are so intertwined in every conceivable way with the UK and its destiny.  This connection is literally within our families.  This is the probably the biggest challenge in the 100 years since Independence and certainly since the Second World War.  I do not see that reflected in the report.<\/p><p> The overall assessment at the end of the report draws attention to public and private debt.  These levels remain elevated.  We have our concerns about the levels of household debt, private sector debt and the national debt, which, of course, resulted from the imposition of certain polices on our country by the EU in the period after 2011.  We are still facing that.  In addition, we have to address the situation relating to Brexit.  That seems to be the report's fundamental final assessment.  We are very aware of the high levels of private debt.  Much of it seems to relate to housing.  Why is the Commission not prepared to state the case much more strongly and say that the housing market in this economy is dysfunctional?  Many of us regard it as a completely dysfunctional market that is not delivering a fundamental, basic economic product at affordable prices for the public.  Throughout our history, we have gone from boom to bust to boom and so on.  It is the people we represent who suffer.  Why has the Commission not been much more strong on that?  Why does it not state that Ireland needs to sort out its dysfunctional housing market?<\/p><p> The report indicates that 79% of recommendations have been delivered on to some extent in different budgets and through the actions of various Governments since 2011.  What stands out in the other 21% of recommendations that the Government has blithely ignored?  On a brief final point, wealth inequality is addressed on page 9 of the report.  Again, it is related to the property market.  The Commission puts us among the most unequal countries in the 28 member states - 27 if Brexit happens.  Is it not a very profound situation where we score so relatively badly in that area?  Is this a situation the Commission should highlight more?<\/p><p> Those are some of my concerns about the report.  I thank our guests for the report.  It is very stimulating and interesting and echoes many of the briefings we get from our domestic agencies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2019031300002#G00400","speaker":"1361","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1552483800,"counter":22,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  I will start with the most important question, the first one the Deputy asked.  Why did we prepare this report without looking at Brexit?  We saw what happened yesterday, and the committee is aware of all the uncertainties we face regarding what may happen today, tomorrow and in the coming days.  The Deputy would agree that it is extremely difficult to consider alternative scenarios at the current juncture.  We simply do not know.  As such, instead of preparing one report per scenario, we have assumed that the economic relationships between the European Union and the UK will not change.  In other words, that there will not be disruptions in trade or fundamental changes in the way it takes place.  That will be the case if the coming two or three years are a transition period, but we do not know.  I agree with the Deputy that there is a risk and his has been clearly highlighted in the report.  We note that there is a downside risk, which is the possibility of a no-deal Brexit or any other alternative scenario concerning the relationship between the EU and the UK.<\/p> <p>  I agree that in some months we may have to reconsider a number of priorities or challenges.  In the meantime, does this imply that the report is not useful or does not address fundamental issues?  I would not say that.  With or without Brexit, we will have these problems.  One of the problems highlighted in the report is the low productivity of domestic indigenous companies, which calls for a series of policies related to skills, human capital and knowledge capital.  This challenge will need to be addressed in any case.<\/p> <p>  Another issue that will be fundamental in any case is the need to maintain sound public finances.  Again, I refer to the rainy day fund and the need for buffers in order to improve the resilience and reduce the vulnerabilities of the Irish economy.  These challenges will always be there with or without Brexit.  Moreover, tackling these challenges will make it easier to deal with unfavourable Brexit scenarios.  That is why we felt we did not need to consider all the alternative scenarios; we simply do not know.  We preferred to work on the basis of a kind of central scenario in order to analyse the various challenges and issues for the Irish economy and the problems in every market.  We know that to a large extent all of this is conditional on the kind of Brexit that materialises.  Even today, we do not know.<\/p> <p>  We are aware of the impact that the imposition of certain tariffs by the UK may have.  The Commission has already made a series of preparations in order to make trade as fluid as possible in the worst-case scenario.  This decision has been taken unilaterally by the Commission.  The Government is also taking steps and considering a series of measures to reduce the frictions in trade in that case.<\/p> <p>  Public and private debt is still high.  We have to be aware of this because if levels of debt are too high before a shock, there will not be room for manoeuvre in dealing with it.  The Deputy says that the housing market is dysfunctional.  I do not think we even suggest this possibility in the report.  We state that there is an insufficient supply of housing and that this sometimes relates to the shortages of skills in the country's labour market.  Ultimately, whether or not a market is dysfunctional depends on the regulatory framework.  We also recognise that the Government has taken a series of steps to reduce regulatory barriers that could prevent the development of the sector.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked about country-specific recommendations for which progress in implementation has been more limited.  I refer to measures related to the sustainability of public finances, particularly measures to increase the cost-effectiveness of healthcare.<\/p><p>Expenditure in that regard has increased rapidly without clear improvements in the quality or clear reasons behind this increase, such as ageing or the fact that diseases have become more significant.  This relates the Deputy's first question.  We still find that there have not been sufficient measures to stimulate the productivity of domestic firms.  By becoming more productive, Ireland can even tackle the increase in tariffs.  These are the two areas in which we think the progress has been more limited.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2019031300002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Carlos Mart&iacute;nez Mongay","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1552483800,"counter":24,"content":"<p>Two of the questions I was going to ask were posed by previous speakers.  I will not repeat them.  I want to touch on Deputy Lahart's comments regarding non-performing loans, which are raised as a concern in the report.  The Deputy put it very well when he stated that there is political consensus in this State.  While we recognise non-performing loans as an issue, how they are being addressed is a concern to many of us.  Those loans are being sold to vulture funds and there is a feeling among all political parties that we should do everything we can to help the indebted mortgage holders involved to remain in their properties.  To do otherwise would only worsen the housing situation.  We need to find a balance in continuing to reduce the number of non-performing loans while not impacting on the housing crisis.  We need to find the right policy to get to grips with that.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Mart&iacute;nez Mongay mentioned the rainy day fund.  I have concerns about that fund.  I am a member of one of the parties that opposed its establishment.  We have already outlined some of the reasons for our opposition.  We are in the middle of a crisis across many sectors, particularly housing and health.  We do not believe it is prudent to establish a rainy day fund at this time.  We also have concerns regarding the legislation the Government used to establish the fund.  That legislation provides for withdrawals from the fund in three circumstances: to remedy exceptional circumstances; for capital injection into the banking sector; and to support major structural reforms.  Our reading of the legislation is that the rainy day fund cannot be used as a stabilisation mechanism.  It is not countercyclical; it cannot be used on general spending above the expenditure benchmark.  While it can be used for the purposes set out in the legislation, the only definition of \"exceptional circumstances\" we can find relates to terrorism and migration flow.  We have concerns, therefore, that in order to withdraw money from the fund, we would need to seek approval from the European Commission.  Despite repeated requests, there has been no indication from the Government whether any discussions have taken place with the European Commission on our ability to withdraw from the fund.  I ask Mr. Mart&iacute;nez Mongay for his analysis on that.<\/p> <p>  The Commission's report refers to the need to underpin the national development plan by means of a robust monitoring system, adequately resourced Departments and a sound system of project selection.  Does this mean that the European Commission has concerns regarding the existing monitoring system?  Does the reference to adequately resourced Departments relate to personnel, finances, skills or labour?  What resources need to be put in place?  In light of the reference to a sound system of project selection, are there concerns about our current project-selection systems?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2019031300002#J00200","speaker":"1280"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1552483800,"counter":25,"content":"<p>Perhaps in my introductory statement should have given more detail on non-performing loans.  The report makes clear reference to the measures the authorities have introduced to provide support to vulnerable borrowers in arrears.  We are not saying the level of non-performing loans must be reduced at any cost.  Vulnerable borrowers must be protected.  I thought that was clear in the report, but I take note that perhaps it is not that clear.  There is also a need to alleviate the impact of the working out of non-performing loans on households facing severe difficulties.  I agree that the reduction of the number of non-performing loans must balance both concerns - on the one hand, the profitability and the soundness of the financial sector, and , on the other, the situation of vulnerable borrowers.<\/p> <p>  On the use of the rainy day fund, the flexibility clauses the Deputy mentioned - these exceptional clauses - are on in addition to the flexibility embedded in the Stability and Growth Pact.  The Deputy mentioned that this rainy day fund could be used in cases of economic disruption or shocks.  In such instances, the economy goes from the positive phase of the cycle, as now, to a kind of recession.  In that context, the Stability and Growth Pact has enough flexibility when calculating the expenditure benchmark.  It is not only for exceptional circumstances, the flexibility can also kick in depending on the phase of the cycle.  It is not the same.  The restrictions on expenditure imposed by means of the benchmark are not the same for a country which is at the medium-term objective, which is the case for Ireland, with a declining debt, which is also the case for Ireland, and, for example, which could be the case for Ireland ahead of a shock.  If going from a positive or zero-output gap to a negative output gap, the matrix that the Commission uses in agreement with the member states allows for much more room for manoeuvre than in the other case, even without any of these exceptional circumstances.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2019031300002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Carlos Mart&iacute;nez Mongay"},{"type":"speech","time":1552483800,"counter":26,"content":"<p>Can the funding be used on general expenditure without the permission of the European Commission?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2019031300002#J00400","speaker":"1280"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1552483800,"counter":27,"content":"<p>In the next round on the country-specific recommendations, the European Commission will inform a country - it might not be Ireland - to keep the increase of expenditure net of discretionary revenue, what we call the expenditure benchmark, below a set percentage.

My fear is that the economic aspect of the Commission's decision-making promotes intervention in individual choices in a way that favours one decision above another.  If we continue that for 20 or 30 years, my concern is that when my children reach the age when they have to decide what to do, they could be in an environment in which it is impossible to make the choice.  I am worried that one option will have been favoured over the other to the extent that it is economically impossible to decide to choose one of those options.  If the Commission promotes everyone working as much as possible, an environment will be created in which the price of housing increases to that extent that it will be impossible to make a free choice.  My children will not be able to live in this city if every household is a dual-income household and house prices increase to reflect that.

This country's housing crisis is a critical problem, particularly in our cities.  If we are to move to change our housing model, we need a model of cost-rental housing that involves using public land in the market to build publicly-owned housing for long-term rental, with the cost of construction being covered by the rental agreement over 20 years.  We are being restricted in that regard by the EUROSTAT assessment of whether this constitutes State borrowing, or what the nature of the borrowing is.  If we are to solve our housing problem, it is critical that we do not simply rely on increasing the volume of private market housing to be sold, or indeed on going back to the old social housing model.  The cost-rental model exists in places like Vienna and Holland, where EUROSTAT historically allowed this kind of borrowing to take place.  Now I am informed that it is being stopped or restricted.

We need to know if there are bottlenecks in supply, whether it is in land, whether there are regulatory constraints that prevent housing in one way or the other for either ownership or renting.  The Commission is trying, in the country report, to identify why house prices grow faster in one country than others, whether there is a problem in demand or supply and, if there is a problem in supply, from where it comes.

Following on from Deputy Broughan's references to Brexit, there is something slightly surreal today about discussing the economic situation in Ireland with an assumption, technical or otherwise, that things remain the same when there is a very significant chance that we are going to get a shock.  I would like to know what the Commission representatives can say on what discussions they have had about Europe's response in the event of that shock.  It may be limited but I would like to know.<\/p> <p>  Today, for example, Britain has laid out some of its stall in respect of what it intends to do.  One element of that, the tariffs, in terms of east-west trade would be extraordinarily damaging to certain export sectors here, particularly beef.  Something that everyone in this country would like to know is whether there will be extraordinary and substantial assistance from the European Union in the event that Ireland takes a massive hit because of those tariffs.  <\/p> <p>  The second aspect of that issue, which is even more important, relates to the North-South Border issue.  Today there was welcome news from Britain, notwithstanding the tariffs threat which is a very big problem, to the effect that it does not intend to put tariffs, checks or controls North-South in the event of a crash-out Brexit.  Europe has played its cards pretty close to its chest on this.  We have asked the Government repeatedly what Europe will do in the event of a crash-out.  While we all hope there will be a deal, if not we need to know whether Europe will insist on checks, controls, and border infrastructure from North to South to protect the integrity of the European Single Market.  That would be very damaging and must not happen.  There will be active resistance to it and it would endanger the peace in this country in a very serious and existential way.  Can Mr. Mart&iacute;nez Mongay shine any light on that, given that Britain has, on that point at least, laid out its stall?  Can Europe do likewise?<\/p> <p>  The reports are very interesting and I agree with much of their analysis in terms of the broad brushstrokes that are identified as needing investment, the imbalances, debt situation, housing situation, health overspends and some of the key areas such as decarbonisation and childcare.  However, I find it a little bit rich, to be honest, for Europe to point out the things of which most of us are aware when many of the imbalances and deficits result precisely from demands the Commission put on us in the post-2008 period during the troika programme.  Has Mr. Mart&iacute;nez Mongay any comment on that?  If one takes the deficit in public housing, to which he rightly alludes, while the crisis in public housing pre-dated 2008, the actions of the troika, which included the Commission, directly impacted on it.  Our public housing programme came to a complete standstill for effectively a decade because of demands the troika put on us.  Even now, in relation to our capacity to catch up in that area or in the areas of childcare or decarbonisation, the &euro;5 billion or so that we are paying out in debt repayments on a grossly inflated debt because of the Commission's rules, seriously hampers our ability to address those capital infrastructure deficits.  What does the witness have to say on that?  Particularly in light of Brexit, does he not think that Ireland deserves a bit of a debt interest holiday on some of that excessive debt in order that we would actually have the funds to deal with some of these very significant deficits?  <\/p> <p>  The country report referred to skills shortages, bottlenecks and possible overheating relating to that.

On Brexit, I could go to the long list of measures and decisions the Commission has taken but they are public.  We can provide them to the Deputy.  In terms of the framework of the preparedness, the Commission has identified a number of sectors and issues, including air transport, electricity and financial markets, in which contingency plans should be implemented.  The Commission has distributed a series of documents at the sectoral and country levels to raise awareness among Governments but also the private sector in order to prepare for this possibility.  I saw the statement from the Minister the day before yesterday precisely enumerating the number of preparedness measures the Irish Government is taking.  It is clear that the private sector must also get ready for this possibility.<\/p> <p>  I would not try to discuss now the kind of measures that could be taken within the treaties while preserving the essence of the treaties and doing what the treaties allow us to do even, as mentioned by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, in respect of state aid.  In particular, the agrifood sector was mentioned but I do not believe this is the moment to determine or explain what measures could be taken.  Let us see exactly what is going on, the magnitude of the shock and then decide the kind of measures are needed, within the treaties because the treaties also envisage derogations while preserving the principles of the treaties and, in particular, the functioning of the Single Market.  It is possible to do many things within this framework.<\/p> <p>  Few institutions are more aware of the importance of the Irish Border.  Since the beginning, the chief negotiator has established as a priority the need to prevent a hard border in Ireland.  That is the reason we have the backstop as one of the principles, together with the guarantees of preserving the rights of the citizens.  The Commission will do as much as it can do.  In terms of the governments of the other member states, there would be collective action but I am sure the Commission will do and is doing all it can to avoid a hard border.<\/p> <p>  It is difficult for me to agree with the Deputy that the current situation in Ireland is due to the demands of the troika during the time of the programme.  I will give my reasons for saying that.  First, the housing bubble burst, the housing market collapsed, the construction sector collapsed and access to markets in Ireland was cut.  As the Deputy said, the troika then came lending money to Ireland, incidentally at interest rates that were not particularly high.  As I said, it would be premature to say what the member states would be ready to do in the future in terms of the situation of Brexit.  I do not believe that the current situation of Ireland, which is not very bad - that is clearly spelled out in the report - is because of the requirements of the troika.  The requirements of the troika have nothing to do with the undersupply of childcare or other issues which simply reflect choices to be made within the budget and which must be made in every country when preparing the budget.<\/p> <p>  Concerning the skills shortages, what we are saying, and I tried to explain this in my introduction, is that we see those in a number of sectors and in particular sectors that require higher skill levels.  In addition, we have said there are labour shortages in sectors such as construction, which also require certain skills.  At the same time, we see that wages are increasing and therefore, we conclude on the basis of our calculations, which are made within the framework of the commonly agreed methodology - the same methodology that applies to every member state - that Ireland is in the positive phase of the cycle.  At the same time, the report acknowledged something the Deputy mentioned.  What we observe is that on one hand, the participation of certain groups of the population is low and we therefore should eliminate the barriers while on the other, the report refers to the fact that the number of people in Ireland who are working part-time on an involuntary basis is also high, which would suggest that perhaps there is still some labour underutilisation.

It is more of a statement.  This is part of the conversation happening in this member state.  We must learn lessons from Brexit.  We should not take the sentiment among citizens of member states, or how they view the European Union, its reach and the changes it proposes, for granted.  While we might rubbish those suggestions, this is a concern, whether reasonable or not.  We should never disregard those concerns because they can take root and cause problems further down the line.  We have learned a very important lesson from the Brexit process here in Ireland: not to disregard the concerns of citizens.  It is something to bear in mind as we move forward and discuss those issues as a Union and as a community.  This is an area of particular concern for Ireland and would be quite contentious if it was to progress in the manner that some member states would like it to.  I would like to put that on the record.<\/p><p>I know Mr. Mart&iacute;nez Mongay has been asked this question by other members of the committee.  We have been pressing our own Government to answer questions about the discussion happening at Commission level about the financial aid that would be available to Ireland in the event of a no-deal hard Brexit.  I share Deputy Boyd Barrett's surprise that the report on Ireland is based on the continuation of the <i>status quo<\/i>.  We are in the Brexit bubble and it is part of our daily discussions, and the hope of maintaining the <i>status quo <\/i>is dwindling.  In that context, the report may not stand the test of time.  Things could change in the next several weeks.  They are changing almost on an hourly basis.  We in Ireland will be looking to the European Union and the Commission for support if things go badly.  Reports came today of the tariff regime the UK is planning to impose in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  If that comes to pass, our agriculture, agri-food and beef sectors will be decimated in a matter of weeks.  We are really worried.  I would like to ask the Commission what financial aid will be available to us the day after it happens, if it happens. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2019031300002#N00600","speaker":"1336"},{"type":"speech","time":1552483800,"counter":62,"content":"<p>As is tradition in most committees, I wish to take account of the fact that Mr. Mart&iacute;nez Mongay has answered this question before.

Along with public housing, one of the big issues for us is affordable housing.<\/p><p>What freedom and latitude do we have to develop an affordable-purchase scheme where prices will be below market prices?  I ask because fiscal treaty rules say one cannot distort the market.  However, we must distort the market if we are going to deliver affordable housing because the market is dysfunctional and the average Dublin house price is &euro;450,000, which is completely unaffordable for normal working families.

Another matter is how one finances the cost of this.  That is a choice that is made within the budget.  For example, within the budget, one may decide to prioritise investment in highways, social housing and childcare.

In fact, Deputy Lisa Chambers alluded to it in her contribution.  It is the question of taxation and subsidiarity in respect of Mr. Mart&iacute;nez Mongay's comments.  I am a very strong pro-European and a strong believer in the EU.  I appreciate that Mr. Mart&iacute;nez Mongay's job as an official is to convey views from member states back to the political side of it.  The support Ireland has received in relation to Brexit is magnificent.  However, it is a two-way street.  It is not support of the EU for Ireland's position.  Rather, it is Ireland as an equal member of the European Union having a position which benefits all member states.  There is no expectation of any <i>quid pro quo<\/i>.  We must be genuinely careful about the fact that stories are always out there about why things are being done.  My firm belief is that the negotiations on the European side went well and a good withdrawal deal, which has now unfortunately been rejected by the British Parliament, was arrived at because it was in the interests of all member states to arrive at that common position.<\/p><p>Having put that marker down, I have to say that the way the Commission thinks about taxation is a real problem.  We are not a federal state.  We are a collection of states which work together.  It is a long-standing principle of that arrangement that subsidiarity, in particular in the tax area, is crucial.  I will point out where my thinking on this comes from.  I appreciate Mr. Mart&iacute;nez Mongay speaking repeatedly in his contribution about a race to the bottom by inducements or whatever.  There is also a feeling among smaller member states that there is a power grab by the top.  As such, the economic policies that are most beneficial for the larger member states are being progressed by the Commission because there is a benefit in the ability to reduce subsidiarity.  The point I make to Mr. Mart&iacute;nez Mongay ties in particularly with where we are going with the future direction of Europe.  It is that type of thinking that turns the European citizenry off.  It is the type of feeling that there is a centralisation whereby one or two larger member states make pronouncements of their view and that is then quickly mirrored in what the Commission states as its view.  I am thinking of one or two particular leaders of large European countries who have quite a bit of difficulty running their own states.  Every time they encounter those difficulties, they seem to think it is appropriate to pronounce on how they would like to run the Continent of Europe, as if they were presidents of that.  When one then hears that mirrored by the Commission, however, it is an example of the type of thing the Commission should be guarding against, in particular in the area of taxation.<\/p><p>It is a sovereign right of a member state to control taxation.  All we are looking for as a country when we talk about this is the respecting of that right.  That is why I was very glad to see the digital tax go the way of the dodo the other day.  It was a lesson in what happens when there is an attempt to bully smaller member states with certain proposals.  I will let Mr. Mart&iacute;nez Mongay come back on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2019031300002#O00300","speaker":"1310"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1552483800,"counter":80,"content":"<p>I take good note of the Chairman's concerns.  It is difficult to discuss perceptions.  I know that small member states sometimes have the perception that the Commission only looks at large member states whereas I can tell the Chairman that at the same time, a number of big member states complain about the Commission looking I do not know where.  We do not look at the small member states or the big member states.  I do not know where we look.  The Commission looks at what the Commission has to look at, namely the treaties.  Its role is to guarantee that the treaties are implemented.  In this regard, one need only look at the discussion and debate on industrial policy where the Commission is considered to be against the interests of certain European champions.  The Commission is precisely trying not to get out from the treaties.  It is trying to apply the treaties which, at the end of the day, are what member states have signed.  This is what they signed, not the Commission.<\/p> <p>  We are aware that the European Union is not a federal state.  However, we are also aware that the taxation of companies is becoming a capital issue.  This is related to a number of changes that are taking place at a global level in technology.  The idea behind the digital tax is that certain companies are clearly escaping the obligation to contribute to the common good while at the same time using the common good.  This is important to keep in mind.  We are not a federal state but we were not a federal state when we decided to harmonise VAT either.  However, the member states decided at a given moment that there was a need to harmonise indirect tax in order to underpin the functioning of the Single Market.  When we see the mobility of certain tax bases and the fact that certain companies are able to shift the tax base from one country to another, a certain degree of harmonisation is needed.  These companies are using the Single Market, which is a high-level rental market, to make profits to which they do not contribute.<\/p><p>Taking into account all the social needs in our countries, it was worth considering the possibility of harmonising certain tax bases and certain taxes.  It is true that the ECOFIN rejected the proposal, but at the same time we have a very good technical document, which has been acknowledged by everybody as being technically good, to allow the member states who want to implement it to do so.  As I said, however, the needs are there and we need to finance those needs to avoid inequality going out of control and so on.  I have to accept the ECOFIN result the other day but at the same time we need to consider all these issues collectively because these companies which do not have a flag are using certain tax circumscriptions to avoid paying taxes and contributing to the common good.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2019031300002#O00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Carlos Mart&iacute;nez Mongay","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1552483800,"counter":82,"content":"<p>Thank you.

Through the provisions of the Act, it is intended to raise awareness of child abuse and neglect, provide for mandatory reporting by key professionals, improve child safeguarding arrangements in organisations providing services to children and provide for co-operation and information sharing between agencies when Tusla is undertaking child protection work.<\/p> <p>  The policy intent is that the Children First legislation will operate side by side with the existing non-statutory obligations provided for in the Children First national guidance for the protection and welfare of children.  The Children First Act 2015 places specific obligations on organisations that provide services to children and young people.  These include requirements to keep children safe from harm while they are using the service, to carry out a risk assessment to identify whether a child or young person could be harmed while availing of the service, to develop a child safeguarding statement that outlines the policies and procedures in place to manage the risks that have been identified and to appoint a relevant person to be the first point of contact in respect of the organisation&rsquo;s child safeguarding statement.<\/p> <p>  I will give some detail on summary role of our child safeguarding statement compliance unit, CSSCU.  The Children First Act 2015 requires organisations that are providers of relevant services to prepare a child safeguarding statement.  A \"relevant service\" is any work or activity in an organisation or centre that results in a person or persons having access to or contact with children.  This is a universal requirement and the list of relevant services is detailed in Schedule 1 to the Act.  The CSSCU was established in March 2018 in Tusla to monitor, support and, where necessary, enforce compliance with this requirement.  It is underpinned by sections 10 to 13, inclusive, of the Children First Act 2015.  The unit only acts on the receipt of unsolicited information that a relevant service does not have a child safeguarding statement in place.  The CSSCU has been engaged with Scouting Ireland since November 2018.  This engagement culminated in the child safeguarding statement being deemed compliant in February 2018.<\/p> <p>  I now want to outline the role of our child protection services.  This is pertinent to our discussions today.  Tusla&rsquo;s child protection and welfare teams have primary responsibility to promote the safety and well-being of children.  In this respect, Tusla receives referrals in respect of children under 18 years of age and also referrals in respect of adults disclosing childhood abuse.  In the context of the emergence of a significant number of retrospective allegations of abuse by adult complainants alleging they were abused by scout leaders as children, an analysis of current cases referred to Tusla by Scouting Ireland was undertaken.  <\/p> <p>  This gave rise to concerns regarding the management of current cases of child protection referrals within Scouting Ireland.  Tusla communicated with Scouting Ireland on 18 February regarding these concerns and in respect of the organisation&rsquo;s policies, procedures and practice and overall compliance with Children First.  This communication to the chief executive officer, CEO, of Scouting Ireland set out eight recommendations for Scouting Ireland.  These were the recommendations published in the letter last week and read into the record of the D&aacute;il by the Minister.  <\/p> <p>  I will turn to subsequent communication with Scouting Ireland.  This letter of 18 February 2019 was sent to the CEO of Scouting Ireland.  It advised that Tusla was available to meet and discuss the issues raised.  For clarity, the letter was not copied or issued to any person outside of Scouting Ireland or Tusla, certainly not by Tusla.  On Wednesday, 27 February 2019, Tusla received a request from the Department of Children and Youth Affairs to provide a copy of the letter.  The Department had received a direct communication from Scouting Ireland&rsquo;s interim safeguarding manager in connection with this letter.  At the request of the Department, Tusla provided the letter to the Department and the Minister.  As stated, the recommendations were published on the Department's website and the Minister read those recommendations into the D&aacute;il record.<\/p> <p>  For further clarification, Tusla did not have any direct contact from Scouting Ireland from the date of issue of the letter on 18 February 2019 until the chairperson of Scouting Ireland wrote to the chair of Tusla on 28 February.  Subsequently, after a request was issued by us for a meeting, the CEO of Scouting Ireland and I had a discussion last Monday week and agreed to set up a meeting to be held last Thursday.  Scouting Ireland and Tusla then met on Thursday, 7 March 2019, and agreed to address the issues raised in the letter of 18 February 2019 through an action plan.  A copy of this action plan was sent to the committee last night.  I do not know if the members of the committee have it, but I can summarise the actions at the end of this note.  This work will be progressed over the coming weeks to put in place improvements to policy, procedure and practice and to provide assurance to Tusla in respect of the concerns raised.<\/p> <p>  It is worth noting the action plan.  I am not sure if that document has gone to members.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2019031300002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat Smyth"},{"type":"speech","time":1552471200,"counter":95,"content":"<p>It has been circulated.

I understand that is scheduled for April.  Scouting Ireland is recruiting a safeguarding manager to be directly managed by the CEO.  The safeguarding manager role will date from 14 March, that is, this week, and he or she will be the liaison person with Tusla.  Scouting Ireland will share its updated implementation plan with Tusla regarding implementation of a range of items in respect of Children First.<\/p> <p>  This strategy will include mechanisms to review the implementation of Scouting Ireland's child safeguarding statement, the updating of policies and procedures and supporting the subsequent implementation of these measures throughout the organisation.  The strategy will also include mechanisms for monitoring and quality assuring safeguarding policies and procedures in place and the implementation of those aspects.  Scouting Ireland will meet with Tusla and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to discuss the management of the allegations regarding the samples that were outlined and referred to in the letter of 18 February.  Scouting Ireland will review its safeguarding risk assessment and the relevant procedures, particularly its code of behaviour regarding overnight trips and jamborees in collaboration with Tusla.

Was it ever Tusla's intention that the letter written by the Children First information and advice officer, CFIAO, would enter the public domain?  If so, that is fine.  If not, what would Tusla not have made available?  The observation made to me by members of the scouting movement in Ireland, as distinct from Scouting Ireland, was that individuals are identifiable in the three examples provided.  It is fair for this committee to ask about that.

Regarding the first case, it is important to say that.  Regarding issues concerning child protection, Children First and working with organisations, it is always Tusla's intention to work directly with those organisations.  The letter sent to Scouting Ireland was addressed to it.  Our expectation was that Scouting Ireland would respond directly to Tusla on the matter.  In the first case, it is not, and was not, our intention for the letter to make its way into the public domain because we would have expected it would have been worked through, and that the issues in it would have been worked through in the normal course of business.  That underlies part of the answer to the second question.  In this case, the detail in the letter was especially for the benefit of Scouting Ireland.  It was aware of these cases.  The matters raised in those cases were about trying to point to the seriousness of the concerns of the people who wrote the letter.  That is the reason for the detail.

Being clear about the wording and terminology used would greatly assist us.  Ultimate responsibility lies with organisations to have in place safeguarding measures that assure them that children and other young people are safe from harm.  Recommendation No. 6 states clearly there should be an immediate review.  We were asking Scouting Ireland to review the current arrangements across its organisation.  I am referring to the service in totality and the number of dens in every county and community.  We were asking the organisation to review the supervision in scouting.  Second, because of the current referrals, reviews and the incidence of child-to-child inappropriate sexualised behaviour in the confines of sexual abuse, we were also asking Scouting Ireland to consider the viability of continuing with overnight trips given the concerns outlined.  If one reads into that, the communication probably voices professional language within the context of how one needs to communicate with organisations.  If Scouting Ireland reads into that, it again needs to look into its overnight camping trips and what safeguarding measures are in place.  We would possibly have a view on that given the concerns flagged by Scouting Ireland and formal referrals to our child protection services across the country.  We were saying it was for a Scouting Ireland to examine the viability.<\/p> <p>  It is also a matter of parental responsibility.

We had a very fruitful meeting last Thursday where there was clear collaboration and partnership with Scouting Ireland.  I chaired that meeting.  We had a very specific agenda, which created a space where we could have an open discussion about the issues and concerns we raised.  This led us to an agreed action plan that the interim CEO read into the record here.  This is where Tusla and Scouting Ireland want to be because notwithstanding where we got to in the political and public arena, it was never the intention of Tusla to go there.  As Mr. Smyth outlined, the correspondence about our concerns was directly to the CEO.  We did not see these concerns as insurmountable because if they were insurmountable, it would have been a different type of correspondence.  We knew progress was being made and that Scouting Ireland had been very transparent and had integrity regarding historical abuse but we were looking at the overall landscape in the context of the concerns.  We feel it is a work in progress.  I am very satisfied with the engagement I had with Scouting Ireland last week, that there is partnership and collaboration going forward and that Scouting Ireland has agreed the action plan, which addresses the issues.  It sets Scouting Ireland in a good place in terms of us working with it to ensure it is not just compliant with the statement of intent, which is the safeguarding statement, but that it works with us in assuring us that practice in the organisation mirrors its policies and procedures and that we look at the issues of the helpline.

In respect of the Children First information officers beginning to do their work, we must remember the context, as Mr. Smyth has already noted.  This came out of the retrospective work.  Scouting Ireland is working very closely with us and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in terms of retrospective cases.  Given the fact that an independent review of Scouting Ireland commissioned by the Minister was published in June 2018 and the serious concerns within that review about processes and how complaints were managed, the Children First information officers were urgently allocated to work with Scouting Ireland to bring the policies and procedures up to date.  In our view, they were not up to date in terms of Children First in 2015 or in terms of guidance and practice.<\/p><p>This guidance and practice is there for all organisations that are producing their safeguarding statements and their policies and procedures.  Within that, there is guidance over ratios when travelling away with children, supervision, etc.  That is all there.<\/p><p> We felt an urgency to get their attention, given the report that we had last year and given the concerns that we had in the six referrals.  There were 21 referrals altogether involving 13 separate instances.  Six of those, including one in the recent helpline, are very concerning, and the impact on those young people can be quite significant at an emotional level.  That is why it was urgent to meet.<\/p><p> When we met on 8 January, a plan was agreed.

Underneath it may be the policies and procedures required to dictate good practice.<\/p> <p>  I am delighted that the tone has changed in working alongside Scouting Ireland.  It is the tone that is set by Tusla at this juncture in dealing with any organisation in which there are concerns.  We do not get business done by having a dogfight; rather, we do so by finding common ground and being collaborative and supportive.  We have demonstrated and specifically stated to Scouting Ireland and the media that we value Scouting Ireland and want to assist and support it to be compliant.  We are in a good space with it.  It is clear that the agenda for the meeting on 7 March was set to create an opportunity to have an open discussion behind closed doors between Scouting Ireland and Tusla on the issues and concerns which had been raised.  There are differences of opinion, but we have agreed an action plan to satisfy Tusla, Scouting Ireland, the volunteers, the Government and everyone else with an interest in this matter that we are on the right road.  Scouting Ireland has demonstrated a collaborative and partnership approach in its achievements since the historical abuse that was uncovered retrospectively.  There are some current issues.  As chief operations officer, I am satisfied that we are in a good place, talking to one another, have good engagement and will resolve issues.<\/p> <p>  The letter was communicated in the context of other information we had on Scouting Ireland that heightened our awareness and capacity to communicate.  However, any organisation with similar deficits or concerns would receive such correspondence.  To some extent, it comes back to Tusla and the reasons for its establishment - we are damned if we do and damned if we do not.  The letter was sent to the CEO of Scouting Ireland.  The intention was that we would meet Scouting Ireland to get the business done.  As a State agency, we are not involved in trying to undermine Scouting Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2019031300002#H01800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Gibson"},{"type":"speech","time":1552471200,"counter":174,"content":"<p>I thank the representatives for appearing before the committee.

This is a big question for all of us in society.  If a parent or guardian is letting a child, or a niece or a nephew off to an activity then the adult needs to be clear that despite having all the policies and best practice in place, those who are intent on harming children can get themselves into positions to do that.  It must be at the forefront of everybody's mind  to ask those clear questions.  We say this to all organisations.  This is not just about Scouting Ireland.

It is unfortunate that we are where we are and that two organisations that work quite well together have found themselves in a highly public conflict on a very serious matter.  I agree with Deputy Mitchell that there have been conflicting reports around how things happened, what transpired and who said what and when.  When something is put on paper and when Tusla wrote that letter it must have known it would go into the public domain.  That is how the world works even if the intention was that it would stay private.  When one sends a letter to a large organisation, knowing it is probably not going to be received too well and might cause some upset, it is not surprising that it would enter the public domain in some way.  It is also not surprising that the Minister requested the letter the moment she discovered the letter existed.  Given the pressures of this particular job, the immediate thing to do was to publish and put it out there.  The minute that pen was put to paper and there were words on a page, it was going to become public at some point.  That is just the reality.  Even if it had not been published, the letter would have been the subject of a freedom of information request at some point.<\/p> <p>  That letter had quite a significant impact on many thousands of volunteers across the country.  There was concern among parents who wondered if they had sent their children to an organisation that is not safe.  They wondered if they had asked the right questions or if they had been too trusting.  There was a direct and significant impact on a very large organisation and on many families across the country.  Perhaps it might have been handled in a different way.  I acknowledge that hindsight is great.  It is easy for us to sit here and say that we might have done things differently, with the benefit of hindsight.  I appreciate that Tusla was in a particular position where it had to take action and that there were genuine concerns on its side.<\/p> <p>  Tusla is a very good organisation.  At times it becomes mired in controversy because it deals with historic legacy issues, which is a difficulty for the organisation.  I have said before in this committee that Tusla needs to do a little bit more around putting out the good work it does, highlighting the positive impact of Tusla and all of the really good stuff that comes out of it.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the safeguarding statement issued in February around Scouting Ireland being compliant, there was a perception - even for those of us who are active on this committee and who deal with Tusla regularly - that the organisation was fully compliant right across the board, and that the procedures and practice on the ground were compliant.  Perhaps communications need to be looked at for future situations so that what is actually meant is explained better.  I refer to Mr. Lee's example that having a health and safety statement in a building or an organisation does not mean that health and safety practice is up to scratch, and that perhaps we need to explain ourselves a little bit better.<\/p> <p>  I take on board that Scouting Ireland was taken aback and very upset by the letter sent to it on 18 February.  Can the Tusla representatives talk the committee through what led it to compile that letter?  Where did Tusla get the information?  It appears that there were no conversations with Scouting Ireland before the letter was sent.  Where did Tusla get the information?  Were there any phone calls, interactions or advance warnings with Scouting Ireland to indicate that Tusla was looking into the organisation and at its processes and that Tusla was probably going to have to draft a serious letter and seek further engagement?  Did any of that happen or was it just drafted within Tusla without any outside interaction at all?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2019031300002#K00900","speaker":"1336"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1552471200,"counter":207,"content":"<p>I will ask my colleague Ms Lisa Creamer to address the detail of that.

This was in response to another part of our organisation working on the retrospective cases.  In addition, we had concerns about the independent review.  We were supporting the organisation in that regard.  All of the Children First information officers support agencies to develop their policies and practices.<\/p><p>That happened last year.  We had a meeting on 8 January this year to discuss how we were going to move forward.  Scouting Ireland had an implementation plan but there were holes in the plan and we asked it to fill them.  In fairness, the organisation was waiting on the safeguarding person to come into post.  However, many things can be done without having that person in place.  A subgroup made up of members from around the country was to be established to discuss Children First and what the policies and procedures are, for example, ratios of adults to children and who will supervise where children are sleeping overnight in fields of tents at a jamboree.  We need the detail behind that and that was the kind of detailed information we wanted at the meeting of 8 January.  At that meeting, there were certain things the Children First information officers and Scouting Ireland were to do.  These included talking to the board about the roles and responsibilities.  Under Children First, there are designated liaison persons who are nominated and should be in all the dens, as I am sure they are.  We need to be sure, however, that a designated liaison person is in each den and everybody in the den knows who that person is and what his or her role is under Children First.  Should something happen, people could then go and talk to that person.<\/p><p> At the meeting of 8 January last, we also asked Scouting Ireland to look at its code of practice, which does not meet the needs of Children First.  We wanted it to get together this subgroup together, with young people, and have young people contribute towards developing that code of practice.  There would then be ownership by young people.  We want Scouting Ireland to talk to young people about how to behave and not to behave and to tell them that if something bad happens in a tent, they should not be afraid and should talk to the designated person.  There are suggestions that some children are intimidated by other children.  We wanted these documents to include a great deal of practical material, including den-related matters, as well as the broader picture and bigger issues.<\/p><p> The meeting was held on 8 January and we communicated with Scouting Ireland several times in January to elicit a response on some of these pieces of work.  We had still not received a response by 14 February when Scouting Ireland came back and said it was working on the various issues.  We wanted to meet it again given the concerns clearly outlined in the 2018 review around confidentiality, trust in the different layers of the organisation, and the way in which information filters down from senior management to ground level.  There were serious concerns in this regard and we put Scouting Ireland under pressure to move faster because it could not wait for the safeguarding person to come in and noting that there was other expertise in the organisation that could help do it.  We needed to get to a place very quickly were the dens and volunteers all knew what was expected.  It has comprehensive induction but even with that, we needed improvement.

I respect entirely what Ms Creamer said about the surprise on all sides but my surprise, as Chairman of this committee, is that Scouting Ireland, according to Tusla, is not compliant with child safety guidelines.

There are two elements to this.  The one the Chairman is referring to, namely, the child safeguarding statement, involves, as the director of quality assurance outlined, a very specific process.  It is a statement of intent and there is a legal requirement for all organisations involved with children to have that statement in place.  Mr. Lee's unit has been working with Scouting Ireland and all other organisations in the country to bring their child safeguarding statements up to a level of compliance.  What is at issue with Scouting Ireland is the practice.  We looked at the underlying policies, procedures and, most importantly, practices that support the way that children are protected in the organisation.  That part of it was dealt with through the Children First information officers and because of the fact that we have historically been involved with Scouting Ireland on retrospective cases, the close reviewing of practice, policies and procedures was probably more intense than would be the case for a lot of other organisations.  It is that part that we have been trying to address.  That was the part that was the subject of the letter of 18 February.  I understand the challenge here.  The child safeguarding statement is, as Mr. Lee describes it, a little bit like the health and safety statement required for building.

I want to give them an opportunity to address the concerns of the public relating to how, when Tusla makes an observation such as this, a cohort of people simply does not believe it.

As I said earlier, the fundamental value of how we operate is to try to ensure that every child in Ireland who needs the services of Tusla and those safeguarding protections to be in place has them.  When any of us look back at whether we did right or wrong, it will be viewed in the context of whether we did enough for those who needed us.  The underlying challenge behind that is that this is a difficult area of business.  The establishment of Tusla was a very strong statement by the State that it took this area seriously.  Today, we are challenged by the failures of years of neglect of child protection and welfare systems in the State.  We are all citizens of the State, so we all have to take some responsibility for that.  I think we are in an era where we as citizens and the wider public demand very high standards of child protection.  We in Ireland have had incredibly difficult episodes relating to the failures of that in the past.<\/p> <p>  Tusla tries to carry out the State's desire to ensure that those services are sufficient and good enough as we move forward.  It will take us a number of years to get to a place where that is sufficient.  Last time we were here, we talked about the difficulties with regard to resources and the key professionals, which is to say social workers, and their availability.  That is an ongoing challenge which we are faced with trying to improve and make changes around.  All this means that the responsibility for protection is down to every one of us as citizens and parents.  I do not think we can easily overcome the fact that there are doubters but the value of this organisation is to try to do our best for the children of today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2019031300002#P01400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat Smyth"},{"type":"speech","time":1552471200,"counter":316,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Creamer, Mr. Gibson, Mr. Smyth and Mr. Lee for their presentation and answering members' questions.

With me today is Dr. John Lawlor, chief executive officer of Scouting Ireland and Mr Ian Elliott, independent safeguarding consultant who has been working with Scouting Ireland since 2017, acting as the interim safeguarding manager for the past year.<\/p><p> Let me begin by confirming that Scouting Ireland is a safe organisation.  The letter received by Scouting Ireland on 22 February last, dated 18 February, from the child and family agency, Tusla, shocked Scouting Ireland to the core.  I read this letter, not only as a scouter but also, like so many other volunteers, as a parent of three daughters, aged from ten to 17, all of whom enjoy the adventure that is scouting.  As such I was shocked by the letter, the content of which concerned me greatly.  Scouting Ireland has a track record of working with Tusla and I reaffirm that Scouting Ireland is not in conflict with Tusla.  We value co-operation with Tusla and will work closely with it so that confidence in Scouting Ireland as the largest non-formal education provider on the island is restored.<\/p><p> I would like to demonstrate the progress that Scouting Ireland has made since last we met on a number of the key issues that have been discussed here before.  In respect of governance, we are finalising our plans regarding the oversight and executive function of the organisation.  The current board, most of whom are here in the Visitors Gallery today, is now fully disentangled from the executive function, which had not been the case with preceding boards.  It is now well-established and regarded as a board of oversight.  We have sought expert advice that will see us fully compliant with the governance code for type C organisations.  We are announcing our new structure in the coming weeks and have briefed the transition implementation monitoring group in that regard.<\/p><p> In regard to our membership, the majority of groups have now transferred to membership of the company rather than the outgoing association, with the remaining groups being captured in a mopping-up exercise.  This is a significant development and is a practical demonstration of the progress to date in the change over to the company-only format for Scouting Ireland.<\/p><p> The committee will be aware that the independent barrister report completed by Ms Lynch BL was received by Scouting Ireland some weeks back.  This report, commissioned by the national management committee, NMC, of the association, has been received by the NMC and reviewed by a sub-committee which has accepted the report in full and determined that the four respondents in this matter be subject to disciplinary procedures.  The board will consider the outcome of the disciplinary procedure and, once complete, come to a view with regard to future membership.<\/p><p> On accountability, Scouting Ireland has worked hard at developing the good working relationship with the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  We recognise and are grateful for the Minister's commitment to scouting.  Following the recommendations of Ms Jillian van Turnhout in her review of Scouting Ireland at the request of the Minister, Scouting Ireland is pleased to be able to inform this committee that we will be submitting quite a positive final progress report to the Minister later this month.  We have completed all of the recommendations set out.  Those elements that were of concern due to lack of funding can now be addressed due to the Minister's indication of improved financial support.  A key element, the recruitment of a permanent safeguarding manager, has been completed.  The new safeguarding manager is due to begin his employment with Scouting Ireland on 5 April and Scouting Ireland will shortly make an announcement on this appointment.<\/p><p> The element of scouting under most scrutiny is our safeguarding capability and practice.  As chairperson of Scouting Ireland, I confirm that Scouting Ireland is a safe organisation for our young people and adult volunteers.  Our safeguarding team, who have worked over and above the call of duty in recent months, have provided their regular service to the organisation while at the same time operating our successful helpline for survivors of historic abuse.  The committee might wonder why I would refer to a helpline, set up under such circumstances, as being successful.  The answer is quite simple.  Tusla had received 49 calls and closed down its helpline before Christmas.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na received five calls.  Scouting Ireland has received 180 individual calls to date.  Those who wished to tell their story had options for whom to speak to.  Most spoke to us and we do not accept the criticism of Tusla regarding our helpline.  We have a team of professional staff who have listened, respected and assisted 180 individual callers to tell their story and feel that they had been heard.  They have provided heartfelt individualised apologies on behalf of Scouting Ireland for the wrongs in our legacy organisations, and all have been offered an opportunity to engage in counselling.<\/p><p> Notwithstanding the great courage shown by survivors in coming forward to tell their story and the recognition by Scouting Ireland and our professional staff of how difficult this can be, it may at times help those so badly hurt and betrayed by former members to tell their story to someone who can understand how the former organisations operated.  At the time of this committee meeting, the most recent case that has come to Scouting Ireland's attention has been in 1998.  The majority of cases still refer to the decades between the 1960s and 1990s, with a smaller number either side of that.  It is very humbling to note that the majority of our survivors still hold a high regard for scouting, recognise that Scouting Ireland is not the legacy organisation in which they were badly treated, and wish no harm to our organisation that continues to do so much good for young people in our communities across the island of Ireland.<\/p><p> I now want to address the letter received from Tusla.  Our relationship with Tusla is a professional one and we are constantly engaged with it on all aspects of safeguarding.  We received a letter from Tusla on 22 February which, as stated, caused us serious shock and concern.  Many of the issues raised in the letter had not been brought to our attention previously.  The following working day, 25 February, Scouting Ireland hosted an inter-agency meeting with Tusla and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na where Scouting Ireland's representatives asked the parties present if they were content with Scouting Ireland's engagement with them and the provision of information to them.  It was confirmed that they were.  Following receipt of the letter, Scouting Ireland requested an urgent meeting with Tusla, which took place on Thursday, 7 March last.  This was a productive meeting and concentrated on Scouting Ireland's efforts to understand Tusla's concerns.  During this meeting, we outlined the dedication of our safeguarding team and our adult volunteers and reiterated our absolute commitment as a child-centred organisation to safeguarding.  We further reaffirmed our commitment to continuing to work with Tusla in a positive and collaborative way, as we have always done since its inception, and with all relevant statutory authorities.<\/p><p> We have over recent days agreed on a joint action plan which includes a number of actions.  These include the following: Tusla representatives will make a presentation to our board of directors on Children First and safeguarding; Scouting Ireland's new safeguarding manager will be our liaison person with Tusla; and we will share our updated implementation strategy with Tusla, which includes mechanisms to review the implementation of Scouting Ireland's child safeguarding statement, updated policies and procedures, and supporting implementation of same throughout the organisation.  This strategy will also include mechanisms for monitoring and quality assurance of safeguarding policies and procedures and the implementation of these.  Further, we have committed to engaging with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Tusla to discuss the management of allegations regarding the case samples outlined within the letter.  Specific to this, Scouting Ireland would like to reassure our members and the public that we do not, and have never, investigated claims.  Scouting Ireland is a child-centred organisation.  We have always listened and will continue to listen to our young people.  This extends to our safeguarding team when a youth member presents with a concern, and this is done where the welfare of the child is paramount.  Scouting Ireland is, as ever, committed to reviewing our safeguarding risk assessment and relevant procedures with a specific focus on our code of behaviour regarding overnight trips and jamborees.<\/p><p> Finally, Scouting Ireland is constantly aiming to improve and develop its safeguarding practice.  To that end, the board of directors will consider how best to draw learning from the successful provision of a dedicated helpline over recent months, by way of the independent evaluation, thus ensuring professional development within Scouting Ireland.  However, we assure our members and the public that at no time have any of Scouting Ireland's safeguarding team been compromised in the delivery of the helpline.  Scouting Ireland chose to face the difficult problems within our former organisations.  We chose to do this in as open and transparent a manner as possible.  This is further evidenced by our continual reporting of our updated figures and the development of a victim support programme.<\/p><p> I would like to conclude by telling the committee about the dedication of our youth members, their parents, our adult volunteers and professional staff team.  The 14,000 adult volunteers who have kept scouting going in this country in their communities through difficult times are the unsung heroes.  They have helped our numbers to grow and provided quality programmes in a safe environment.  Young people are always to the fore.  Our groups are supported to do what they do best by a small but very dedicated and highly effective staff team.  Our staff members keep the children at the centre of everything they do in carrying out their roles.  As the committee will be aware, scouts are brave.  We will climb any mountain, cross any sea and weather any storm to ensure our way of life and reason for being and the mission we share with 50 million fellow scouts throughout the world will not falter or be taken from us.  We will scout another day and do it together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2019031300002#R00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Adrian Tennant","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1552471200,"counter":322,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Tennant.

I note the invaluable work of Mr. Elliott, Dr. Lawlor, Mr. Tennant and his predecessor and the many others who have put so much time and effort into bringing Scouting Ireland out of the crisis in which it has found itself.  t is fair to call it a crisis.  It should be acknowledged that Scouting Ireland is an extraordinarily invaluable organisation across all strands of life in this country, not only for people who are able-bodied but also for individuals who are not so able-bodied.  I acknowledge that very few organisations in the State offer the level of engagement it offers to people with particular needs, special or otherwise.  In the light of the transformational change it is going through, it is appropriate for me to say that yesterday when I was chatting to a former scout leader from Cork, the way in which volunteers had dealt with issues that can be alarming for ordinary members, particularly those which have ended up on the front pages of newspapers, was acknowledged.  I am sure my colleagues, like me, come across ordinary members when knocking on doors and chatting to people.  They always have questions.  It is important for me to say I have absolutely no doubt in my mind that volunteers from the local den to the board offer their services in an effort to improve Scouting Ireland as an organisation and the lives of children throughout the country.  <\/p> <p>  I ask Deputy Neville to commence the questioning of Scouting Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2019031300002#T00400","speaker":"1300"},{"type":"speech","time":1552471200,"counter":325,"content":"<p>I thank the delegates for coming.

Dr. Lawlor may also come in on some of these issues.  <\/p> <p>  The letter from Tusla to Scouting Ireland, dated 18 February, was received on Friday, 22 February.  We had given the Minister, Deputy Zappone, and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs a commitment that we would be very open and transparent with them to ensure any information that came our way would be relayed to them.  It is a two-way street.  It is very important that nothing blind-side either side.  We have made that commitment and stick to it.  On the Monday morning, the first available working day, communications were made to the Department.  It is important to note that we did not provide and have still not provided a copy of the letter for the Department.  We let it know that such a letter had been received and that we were managing the matter.  At the last session there was no discussion of the fact that a meeting with representatives of Tusla and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na had taken place on the Monday.  I referred to that meeting in my opening statement.  Mr. Elliott may come in on this issue.  As we were all shocked by the letter, the pertinent question we asked at that meeting was whether the representatives of both agencies - An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Tusla - were happy with the interactions between Scouting Ireland and their respective agencies.  We also asked whether they were happy with our level of commitment and the progress we were making and whether they had particular concerns.  They confirmed that they had no burning issues and no particular concerns.  The issue with the helpline was also mentioned, albeit to a lesser extent.  Mr. Elliott will confirm the details in that respect.  We subsequently came to the opinion that we were dealing with the letter.  The letter had arrived on the Friday and this was on the Monday morning.  By Monday afternoon we had met Tusla and mentioned the letter.  We asked it to confirm whether there was anything outstanding or anything with which it was not happy.  It confirmed that everything was fine.  The Tuesday was a quieter day in the office in that respect.  <\/p> <p>  On the Wednesday the Department made contact with us about the letter.  I made it clear that we would be greatly concerned if some of its content was to get into the public domain.  I was thinking, in particular, of the content related to cases A, B and C because the children involved were still members of our organisation and had a duty to protect them.  Those concerns were made known and, in fairness to the Department, they were accepted.  By no means, was there a standoff between Scouting Ireland and the Department in that regard.  I received a further communication later that day informing me out of courtesy that the Minister would be raising the issue in the D&aacute;il and would read the letter.  That communication also confirmed that the letter would be published later that evening.  There was no argument, discussion or anything more about it.  In fairness to the departmental officials, they were letting us know out of courtesy that this was coming and we accepted it as such.  <\/p> <p>  On the Wednesday we immediately sought a meeting with Tusla.  I sent a letter on behalf of Scouting Ireland to the chairman of Tusla - my reciprocate in that organisation - to try to organise a meeting as a matter of urgency.  It was as a result of those communications that the meeting of 7 March was constituted.  It is not the case that there were no discussions between that time and 7 March.  There was constant communication during that time and there has been constant communication since the meeting.  Tusla and Scouting Ireland have a track record of working together on a number of fronts, including on the historical cases with which we are dealing, our ongoing review of compliance with Children First and the current cases being examined.  <\/p> <p>  Does that answer the Deputy's question?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2019031300002#T00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Adrian Tennant"},{"type":"speech","time":1552471200,"counter":327,"content":"<p>I have a question which follows on from it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2019031300002#T00700","speaker":"1328"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1552471200,"counter":328,"content":"<p>No problem.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2019031300002#T00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Adrian Tennant"},{"type":"speech","time":1552471200,"counter":329,"content":"<p>To the best of Mr. Tennant's knowledge, from his point of view or in his opinion, was Tusla aware of the communication commitments Scouting Ireland had given to the Department, in which it stated any such communication would be forwarded to it?<\/p><p>Was Tusla aware of the commitment that Scouting Ireland gave to communicate with the Department, where any such correspondence would be forwarded to the Department?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2019031300002#T00900","speaker":"1328","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1552471200,"counter":331,"content":"<p>That was covered by Tusla in the previous session.

One must understand that the issue was completely unknown to us.<\/p> <p>  The helpline has been in operation since the day following our last appearance before the committee, which was 21 November.  We set up the helpline and made it clear what we were doing, how we were doing it and what we sought to achieve.  It was not intended to exist on its own but rather in the context of two other helplines that were run by two statutory agencies, namely, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Tusla.  The Garda helpline is staffed by Garda personnel, the Tusla helpline is staffed by Tusla personnel, while ours is staffed by Scouting Ireland personnel.  I undertook to supervise the creation and operation of the helpline.  I have relevant experience in the area from my career, given that I was the responsible director for the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children and oversaw the provision of its 24-hour child helpline, which was a national service with more than 200 members of staff and which responded to several thousand calls.  We also provided specific helplines for specific situations that arose.  I had relevant experience, therefore, and I applied it to the task that lay before us at Scouting Ireland.  It is important to understand that it was a helpline and it was designed for that purpose, namely, to be available to those who wished to speak to us, with a view to accessing help that Scouting Ireland could provide.<\/p> <p>  We made it clear that, overall, the organisation felt a great deal of sadness and disappointment because the legacy organisations which had preceded the establishment of Scouting Ireland had not performed well and that a number of children and young people had been abused through contact with them.  Scouting Ireland felt a responsibility to those individuals and wanted very much to provide help to them.  That the issue is in the public domain is as a result of work undertaken by Scouting Ireland and not as a result of anything done by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or Tusla.  We have done this.  We have shared with the committee that information as well as our commitment to addressing those issues and doing what we can today to try to ensure that those who have been hurt are helped.  The helpline was part of that provision.<\/p> <p>  There was an issue with the limitation of resources but we and I provided not only training for the individuals involved but also live supervision for a number of calls that were received.  I listened to the service in practice, therefore, and to how calls were being received and engaged.  I ensured that the practice met the requirements and expectations I held as a supervisor.  I also supervised individual members of staff and took a number of calls myself.  I answered the phone and responded to individuals because there were days on which we were under a great deal of pressure.  It was very hard because such calls are challenging to manage.  It is emotionally draining, as an individual, to receive and engage with somebody who is perhaps speaking about something that happened to him or her many years ago but he or she may be speaking about it for the first time, which is challenging.  There are only a certain number of those calls that one can take in any working day.  I had a responsibility to manage that and ensure that every call was answered, appropriately recorded and dealt with in a way that was not only satisfactory to me but which also met the expectations of Scouting Ireland.<\/p> <p>  As the committee will know, we had a large number of calls - approximately 180 - and a great deal more than the other agencies.  Every call was recorded and every situation was shared with the statutory authorities.  To ensure that happened, we set up an inter-agency meeting involving Tusla, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and us.  We regularly checked with them as to whether they were satisfied with the responses we made to the situations, particularly victim disclosures, which presented themselves to us, and it was always confirmed to us that they were.  We corresponded with them and shared with them the information we had gathered.  It was a surprise, therefore, to find ourselves in the situation where suddenly there appeared to be issues because we had never been aware of those issues.  There were concerns about the service which had been in place since November but there had never been any mention to us of any such concerns.<\/p> <p>  We are anxious to learn from the situation and we want to hear the detail of where the information has come from.  Tusla has shared with us that it received a complaint but, despite our request, it is not in a position to give us any detail about the complaint on the grounds that it is concerned about the breach of confidentiality, although I do not fully understand that.  It is difficult for us to address issues when we do not know what those issues are, which is our apparent problem.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2019031300002#U00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ian Elliott"},{"type":"speech","time":1552471200,"counter":335,"content":"<p>The eight-point recommendation has been broken down into six action tasks.

I would just like to round off the questions on communication and I think that will answer that question for the Deputy.  I know my colleague, Dr. Lawlor, wants to come in on that.<\/p> <p>  On our relationship with Tusla, I will start with our response when this letter went public.  People are not used to or do not consider it normal for Scouting Ireland representatives to be on something like television or radio shows and come out as robustly as we did.  However, it is very important for everybody to understand that we are not in conflict with Tusla.  That is a very important message here.  In the radio and television interviews that Mr. Elliot and I did on the day, we were coming from a position where we just did not understand where this was coming from.  We had to respond publicly because it was put in the public domain.  I am sure everybody in the room and at home would understand that parents in a community in Kerry, Donegal or Athlone whose children were going to an activity that weekend, to scouts that night or to beavers the following morning, were wondering whether Scouting Ireland was on top of this.  We were very shocked and concerned by the detail in the letter.  We would have preferred not to have hit the airwaves.  In the interviews Mr. Elliot and I did, we made it clear that we are not in conflict with Tusla.  We just wanted to understand what was informing the content of its letter.  That is very important.<\/p> <p>  Scouting Ireland is not afraid of criticism.  We have a system in scouting called \"plan, do, review\".  With everything from our beaver lodges all the way up to us as adults, we plan, do and review everything.  We are quite honest with each other and we have consulted other people.  An organisation like Scouting Ireland cannot be described of shy or afraid of criticism given that we brought in someone like Ian Elliott to do specific work for us and to take on projects and specific jobs.  Mr. Elliot would not leave any stone unturned as he has proved time and again.  He does not have to prove or justify that in the scouting context.  It was well established before that.<\/p> <p>  There have been things in the years since Mr. Elliot came in that have not been easy listening and not stuff that the organisation as a whole wanted to hear.  However, we did hear it and we acted on it.  We adopted Mr. Elliot's recommendations and teachings on that.  Because we have come through such a process in recent years and been under the spotlight, in the past year in particular, when this letter came out we had to respond.  We had to reassure the parents of children involved in scouting.  We had to reassure our volunteers who will be taking charge of other people's children in the dens, halls, events and all the rest of it.  Our volunteers deserve that.  The young people and their parents deserve that.<\/p> <p>  When we did that, it was not in conflict but one where we were trying to understand.  I will be like a broken record today.  I appreciate I have said it again and again.  We are not in conflict with Tusla, but we will be robust in ensuring that what we do is right for Scouting Ireland and that we are fully compliant with what is required of us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2019031300002#V00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Adrian Tennant"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1552471200,"counter":343,"content":"<p>On the issue of practice and the progress we look forward to making with Tusla tomorrow and in the weeks ahead, it is important to understand we are not coming from a standing start with, for instance, safeguarding training.  The leaders in Scouting Ireland - we call them scouters - make an enormous commitment to training.  Before any adult commences working with young people, he or she is obliged to attend a residential course of training involving 24 hours, which has a full four-hour module of safeguarding training.  The requirement in the sector is for an online course, but Scouting Ireland for great length has been beyond that.  We are building on something that is already there.<\/p> <p>  If I take the issue of vetting, for instance, Scouting Ireland has implemented a policy of re-vetting every three years.  It is not a requirement in the sector.  It is now a requirement in Scouting Ireland.  We are building on what has been there and we are also with Tusla to see how.  I want to give the sense that we are not coming from a standing start here.<\/p> <p>  On reporting, Scouting Ireland has a rock solid record of recording, going back to the foundation of Scouting Ireland.  That is to the statutory agencies, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Tusla, the Police Service of Northern Ireland and Gateway, as required.  All those records are there and can be accessed by the statutory agencies.  That has been done and has been maintained.  We want to continue to improve that.  Since Mr. Elliot has arrived, we have improved how our files are, we have improved our recording, and we have benefited from his professional supervision and oversight.  He often complains, when he gives out to me about stuff, that I talked him into a job in the Europa Hotel in the summer of 2017 that was supposed to be a handy six weeks' piece of work, but went far beyond that.  When he joined us, he got steadily more involved in guiding us in how our teams worked, how we should amend our policies and how we should implement best practice.<\/p> <p>  The requirements of Children First, as our colleagues in Tusla have laid out, are an enormous challenge for the sector.  That was obvious from the Tusla presentation.  In this sector, certainly Scouting Ireland has provided best practice up to now.  I know it might be hard to credit that given the recent controversies.  For instance, our code of conduct document for leaders has been used as a template by many organisations.  We now know that needs to be updated for Children First and it will be.  I believe it will go on to be a template for other organisations in the future.<\/p> <p>  I am trying to give the sense that we are building on a solid tradition of working with statutory agencies to ensure best practice safeguarding.

An individual who had been removed from one of the - forgive me for calling it this - legacy organisations in 1972 had been found in late 2011 to be active in scouting.  When that was discovered he was immediately removed and the learnings from that had to be taken on board.  At the time we had inherited almost 300 files from the two legacy organisations, the Catholic Boy Scouts of Ireland or Scouting Ireland CSI, and Scouting Ireland SAI.  Both files had essentially remained untouched and in filing cabinets in Larch Hill.  Our immediate concern was that no person who had been removed from the legacy organisations had gained access to Scouting Ireland, either through the movement from the legacy organisations to the new organisation or in the move from essentially a paper-based record system to a database of membership.<\/p><p> We felt we had to check that and we put a team together to do it.  We brought back staff who had some understanding of the files.  Over a six week period, the files were analysed.  Anywhere we had a doubt, it was reported.  We found that no other person surfaced who had gained access to Scouting Ireland.  We thought that was important to give us that sense of confidence.  We had seven files the reporting status of which we were unsure and they were reported to both Tusla and the Garda at the time.  All that recording was done.  We fully reported on those cases.<\/p><p> What I will say in relation to that is that this was essentially a desktop piece of work.  It did not involve investigation.  It fulfilled what we believed was our obligation in reporting what we knew.  That was quite a different situation from that that arose when the recent project to deal with safeguarding legacy in the scouting organisations.  Of course, the attendant publicity assisted in bringing in so many of the calls, about which we talked earlier, to our helpline and it opened up a whole avenue of information that never previously existed or was not in the files.  In all these situations, all reporting was made to the statutory agencies.  I have said that Scouting Ireland has a good record of reporting.  That is absolutely true.  Of course, statutory reporting did not come in until 2017, as members will be aware, but Scouting Ireland was reporting solidly from the foundation of the organisation in 2003 and, indeed, in at least one of the legacy organisations, pretty well before that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2019031300002#V00800","nonspeaker":"Dr. John Lawlor","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1552471200,"counter":349,"content":"<p>Dr. Lawlor referred to it a few times and I am glad Senator Warfield raised the question because one of the misnomers is that there was some sort of review or process in 2012 and then nothing until 2018, or until more recent times.

I do not fully accept that and I am surprised by it.  First, the helpline for Scouting Ireland did not exist in isolation.  People who chose to telephone it did so because they knew that they would be talking to someone from Scouting Ireland.  They could have spoken to the Garda or to Tusla.

My role and the role of our board of directors is to speak on behalf of the volunteers and ensure Scouting Ireland is being run appropriately and is fit for purpose.<\/p><p>One of the key things the last year has shown and the reason we were taken aback by the commentary about the helpline is that Scouting Ireland has what I would call an appropriate reliance on our professional staff.  What the hell does that mean?  What I mean by that is that there is no doubt in our minds, as volunteers, that Scouting Ireland could not run without the 14,000 of us.  We have more volunteers than An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and &Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann combined.  That army of volunteers serves this country well in providing a really good, safe, solid programme throughout the island, North and South.  We cannot do that on our own, however.  In this regard, I must refer to our small cohort of professional staff, despite everything that has gone on in the past few years.  I do not wish to single out any group but the safeguarding team, in particular, has come under an awful lot of scrutiny.  I want the members to hear from me, as a volunteer in the 13th Wexford scout group in Wexford town rather than as a chairman, that the organisation is being served well and is totally indebted to and reliant on the goodwill and professionalism of our staff team.  This is not said enough.  It is not said enough in any place of employment, probably.  If it were, I probably would not have a job.  With regard to Scouting Ireland, it is not said enough.  The vast majority of our volunteers, to a man and woman, really appreciate what our professional staff do.

The staff of the helpline are effectively being vetted by way of a review of their qualifications, etc.  I assume Mr. Elliott will be involved in that.

It is a simple issue but nonetheless important.  If the concern is about Scouting Ireland staff being compromised in answering, that is a structural issue in terms of the organisation of the helpline.  It was present on day one.  The helpline was in operation from 22 November.  If there were concerns about it, one would have expected them to have been voiced in November or December.  It was not February.  That is a simple point.  A number of meetings have taken place in the time and nothing has ever been said.  It is important to point that out.  It is also important that we be precise in what we are agreeing and committing to.  It is, of course, a matter of practice for us to evaluate regularly everything we do.  That is how we operate.  If we are involved in a practice, we evaluate what happens in terms of safeguarding and the provision of effective supervision.  All members of the safeguarding team are subject to this.  We used this as a basis for improving our practice.  That is exactly what we are talking about in relation to the helpline.  The helpline is not something we normally provide in Scouting Ireland; it is exceptional.  It has proved from our side to be extremely effective and successful.  It is important, therefore, that we learn and understand as much as we possibly can from the experience so we can apply it to any of our future developments.<\/p> <p>  There are ethical issues that are very much present in any evaluation of the process.  From my perspective, I feel it has to be focused on the experience and performance of the staff and the written record.  Every single call we receive is recorded.  A record is available and used as a basis for ongoing transmission to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Tusla or whichever statutory agency is concerned.  That is the basis on which we work.  There are ethical issues with regard to any attempt to engage the service user in what has happened.  I do not know the detail of the complaint that Tusla received and I have not been able to match up that complaint with anything we have on record from the helpline.

I believe, however, that what our helpline and staff did has resulted in the truth being evidenced.  The truth is now available.  It is a very painful and difficult truth but it is the truth that had to be told some day.  A great service has been given by those who served on the helplines to the victims who carried hurt for many years.  That needed to be done and was done very effectively, openly and compassionately.  That had to happen.  Those who abused children in their care over all the decades in scouting betrayed the vast majority of volunteers, who served young people so well over the time.  That is a deep hurt in scouting.  It is hard for us to credit that it could happen but it did.  A tiny minority was involved but they had a devastating impact on the young people concerned.

I do not want the witnesses to answer.  I simply make the observation that it may be the case there is a fundamental misunderstanding of terminology between the two organisations.  While Mr. Tennant has said repeatedly the organisations are not in conflict, which I accept, I would have thought a basic understanding of terminology between two organisations would be important.

We are not defined by policies only; we are defined by our practices.  We cannot rest on our hunkers knowing a particular safeguarding statement is signed off and ratified and we have it in our halls and bring it to our camps.  I was camping this weekend and on the shelter of our tent was pinned the safeguarding statement.  Even when we are out in the field the safeguarding statement is there and that is normal practice.<\/p> <p>  What defines us, and it is something of which we are very proud, is that we are always changing because we must appreciate safeguarding is not a standstill topic.  The same evening I was on \"Prime Time\", the programme had other stories about social media concerns for young people.  It is always evolving.  The threats to children and the dangers to which children are exposed nowadays change all the time.  We have to stay on top of this and we do so very simply when we train our adult scouters.  As an aside, we do not call ourselves leaders any more because we are very much led by our youth members who decide the programme.  This is something we know but people outside do not know.  Our adult volunteers are our scouters and they facilitate the programme for the young people that they themselves develop.<\/p> <p>  It is not a right for anybody to become a volunteer in Scouting Ireland, it is a privilege.  To access that privilege people must go through a number of steps before even getting to the residential course about which Dr. Lawlor spoke.  During all of this time we spot whether there are issues.  It starts with the group leader bringing in a person.  On the residential course there is a four hour block dedicated to safeguarding but safeguarding is there throughout the entire weekend.  Every three years, because it is not a topic that stands still, we retrain our adult volunteers and they are fully co-operative with it.  There is no push back.  They have a yearning to know what are the latest things they need to watch out for when looking after young people.  This is an onerous task for the organisation from a practical training point of view but it is something we have been doing and we continue to do.  It is not just about the thing that is on the wall or pinned to the tent, it is about our people.  Our people are constantly trained and updated as new things come in.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2019031300002#Y00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Adrian Tennant"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1552471200,"counter":376,"content":"<p>Organisations on the scale of ours must always be mindful of the challenges that arise.  We did some calculations to give some sense of the level of activity as against what will arise.  We estimate that we did in excess of 220,000 young people overnights last year, if that makes sense.  If we multiply the number of young people by the sections by the weekends it certainly is in excess of 220,000.  That simply could not work if we did not have a robust educational method that worked.  We could not take that many young people away and not have untold disasters unless we knew what we were doing, and our volunteers know what they are doing.  They operate through an educational method that is well established and has served scouting and Ireland for more than 100 years.  It is well acknowledged internationally as the finest non-formal educational method on the planet.  It is within the context of this method that we work with young people.  We build an environment of trust, kindness and responsibility.  This is inherent in the scout programme.  It is the basis on which they work with us and with the adults who work with them.<\/p> <p>  Of course, incidents will arise and we have to deal with them properly.  We have to be open to learning.  Children First is a huge opportunity for us to establish a new benchmark in safeguarding for Scouting Ireland and for the sector.

We will need to take learnings from them and ensure in what we do going forward, if we can, that the same problem cannot arise again.  Young people are developed in scouting to care for each other and work with adults in a team-based environment.  This is the essence of the model.  In essence, this is at the heart of keeping young people safe.

Policies are in place and if people have identified gaps in those policies I ask them to please share them with us.  We are always keen to learn and to address them.  It is ensuring that the practice, which is what matters to the young people, is up to standard.

The backdrop of this is the Topical Issue matter that Deputy Sherlock and I tabled.  We tabled that in good faith to get an update on where we were after last November.  I had a concern last November following the question I asked about how many files had gone to the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, from Scouting Ireland.  With the height of respect, we knew the scope of work which Mr. Elliott was doing, which really related to retrospective cases, of which I have significant understanding.  I also wanted to know about the current cases.  I understand that the information that I requested on that day has still not been laid before the committee.  Not only was it on that day, but there was a follow-up letter to Scouting Ireland and the board.  There was a subsequent letter about it on 11 January.  That is an outstanding matter that I am not comfortable or happy about.<\/p> <p>  Who sent or leaked which letter?  We will probably never find out how that got into the public domain but it was there due to a genuine concern about something highlighted by Tusla.

I am grateful for her question because this matter does need to be cleared up.  In terms of the terminology, and Mr. Elliott referred to the importance of terminology, child protection was the common term, probably up until we started to see the emergence of discussions around Children First.  We had somebody employed directly as a professional in that area up to the summer of 2017.  We then engaged Mr. Elliott immediately for the purpose of overseeing what we did and to provide the interim cover as the interim safeguarding manager, as he has been referred to.  He has provided professional guidance and support to our team since then.<\/p> <p>  In regard to our team, they are trained.  They are vastly experienced.  They have dealt with very many cases in their time and they have done so with the benefit of Mr. Elliott's guidance and supervision since the summer of 2017.  There was no gap in trained people to deal with this.  It was quite obvious to us that the model of having a single child protection officer in an organisation of our scale was inappropriate given the scale and the complexity of the work that was involved.  We realised we needed to move to a new model and Mr. Elliott has been hugely helpful in framing what that would look like.<\/p> <p>  Of course, we have the challenge of funding, which has been alluded to a number of times in the meeting, but notwithstanding that we have retained a professional team managed by the finest safeguarding expert, if he does not mind me saying so, in these islands who has had oversight of all cases since and has overseen the practice of our professional team.

It is important that is said repeatedly but we have to tease out the reason there is a spotlight on Scouting Ireland, which does amazing work as do its leaders throughout the country, and try to prevent future spotlights on this area.  In terms of the reason I ask these questions, it is my understanding, and Dr. Lawlor can correct me if I am wrong, that there was a gap.  Whether it is called a child protection officer or a safeguarding manager my understanding is that there was a gap in child protection at the highest level at some level along the line.  Dr. Lawlor might clarify that for me.  Was there a gap in child protection?  Mr. Tennant said he was out last weekend and he was looking at the tent, and that the policies and procedures are in place, but when an audit is conducted it is not sent out to every one of the 200 tents that were put up in the past number of years.  They are auditing headquarters.  Were there gaps in terms of the child protection officer, manager or whatever one wants to call it in the past two or three years in Scouting Ireland?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2019031300002#AA00700","speaker":"1231"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1552471200,"counter":407,"content":"<p>Before I refer the Deputy to Dr. Lawlor to deal with the employment of the child protection officer, following which Mr. Elliott can come in, in terms of the audit going out to the dens, the tents and so on, an audit has to do that.  Some of the issues we have had regarding the Tusla letter were about the lack of evidence that was presented to us or that we could understand might have led to some of the statements in it.  In terms of some of the things that were stated about the overnights or the levels of supervision for our young people, we did not know where that came from.  I was asked in various interviews the reason they would say that and I did not know why they said it.  I do not want to but I disagree with the Deputy somewhat in that the spotlight is not just on the headquarters.  It is very much a spotlight on the entire organisation.  Our entire organisation can stand up and show that it is not just about the policy on the wall; it is about the practice that is carried out in scout halls and in camps North and South of this island.  We will quite happily stand up and demonstrate that.  When we talk about audits in regard to our practice, the practice happens on the ground and we can stand over that.  The practice does not just happen in headquarters.  Mr. Elliott is correct.  When we talk about the review for the helpline we have to be very careful about the terms of reference because we want to get learning out of this and ensure that if there are issues we need to deal with, we deal with them, and they cannot all be captured by desktop exercises.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2019031300002#AA00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Adrian Tennant"},{"type":"speech","time":1552471200,"counter":408,"content":"<p>With the height of respect to Mr. Tennant, I have just listened to his commentary and, to be honest, it seems to me that he has thrown every scouter throughout the country under the bus.

We knew we needed a restructuring, and Children First uses the language of safeguarding, and that we needed to move to something different.  When we had a change of personnel in the summer of 2017, contiguous to that we employed Mr. Elliott.

Other national scouting organisations around the world have experienced similar circumstances, some to a greater extent and some lesser, and there have been different methods of trying to deal with that in different jurisdictions around the world.  In the formulation of how we will deal with it through our victim support programme and so on, we have learned lessons from other places.  I will pass to Dr. Lawlor to comment further in a moment.  We received a great deal of support from other national scouting organisations and we have the support of the World Organization of the Scout Movement, WOSM, which is the overall body for scouting around the world.  In fairness to us, WOSM recognises that we are not the first to face such tragic circumstances.

We are part of a worldwide movement of 170 national scouting organisations.  The issue and problem has arisen elsewhere and it has tended to be dealt with in the northern part of the globe - Canada, the United States and the UK - as well as in Australia.  We have learned some lessons from their experience.  Scouting organisations are not unique among youth organisations and, in fact, anywhere where there are children it is likely that this has happened.  As one goes south towards the Mediterranean, one tends to hear that the organisations do not have that problem.  We know, however, that is probably a case of a see-no-evil monkey.<\/p> <p>  Nevertheless, we have had the benefit of other scouting organisations and I pay particular tribute to the Scout Association in the UK, which is approximately ten times our size and which has been generous to us in facilitating expert training courses for our staff, continuing professional development and engagement with the UK police because it tends to see trends before we do, particularly in the case of youth-on-youth incidents or the difficulties with social media, impersonation and so on.  The Scout Association has been helpful to us and we are lucky to have on our board a member of the Scout Association, whom committee members may have met at the previous meeting, who taught us a lot and is part of our safeguarding oversight at board level.  We have learned a lot from our colleagues overseas, where they have had to address similar difficulties.  We received a message of support from the secretary general of the WOSM, Ahmad Alhendawi, at the weekend for the work that Scouting Ireland does in this area.  I expect Scouting Ireland to be of global significance as an exemplar of how to deal with these issues.  We have learned from others.  The Canadians made a public apology in respect of the matter, while the Boy Scouts of America have particular issues they, too, must address.  There are lessons to be learned.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2019031300002#BB00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. John Lawlor"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1552471200,"counter":423,"content":"<p>Deputy Anne Rabbitte took the Chair.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1552471200,"counter":424,"content":"<p>There is much to try to internalise and understand from the contributions.  My earlier intervention was based on the idea that there needs to be progress while we are all moving forward, which means the State agencies, the statutory bodies, Scouting Ireland, as a voluntary organisation, and we, as Members of the Oireachtas, are all on a journey to ensure that an organisation that is cherished within Irish society emerges stronger as a result of what has happened.  While we are on that journey, there remain questions to be teased out.  If we have concerns, no matter how seemingly ill founded they might be, they are nonetheless concerns.  It is important that we reserve the right to ask questions, and so doing should not be taken as having a particular view on an organisation or individuals within it.<\/p><p>As Deputy Rabbitte noted, she and I raised the Topical Issue matter but if we had not, we would arguably not be having this discussion.  The motive for raising the matter was predicated on the concerns we had that information was entering the public domain via <i>The Irish Times<\/i>and we read the information but there was no mechanism where the Minister would report to us in the committee or to the Oireachtas in respect of the process.  We merely wanted to establish the facts of the process for the historical cases.

The Child and Family Agency, Tusla, has stated on the record that the letter of 18 February was not copied or issued to any person outside of Scouting Ireland or Tusla.  On Wednesday, 27 February 2019, Tusla received a request from the Department to provide a copy of the letter dated 18 February 2019.  The Department had received direct communication from Scouting Ireland's interim safeguarding manager, Mr. Ian Elliott, on Tuesday, 26 February 2019 in connection with Tusla's letter.  That letter was provided to the Department, and the Minister read its recommendations into the D&aacute;il record and later published the letter on the Department's website.  Will Mr. Elliott confirm his version of events <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>Tusla's interpretation of events?  The letter exists - that is a statement of fact - and it was sent to Tusla.

Tusla appeared before us earlier and gave a version of events, and we now have Scouting Ireland's interpretation of events.  It throws up a set of new questions.<\/p> <p>  I wish to discuss the letter of 18 February again.  Arising from the evidence we have just heard, there are questions to be asked of the departmental officials and the Minister in respect of this matter.  Regarding the helpline, I will ask Mr. Elliott to put himself in the politician's position for a second.  The Minister appeared before the House and put the key points of the Tusla letter on the record.  When an Oireachtas Member hears the words, \"Scouting Ireland should consider the viability of continuing with overnight trips\", the natural and immediate reaction is to wonder whether something explosive that we did not know about had happened and to take the Minister in good faith.  Having parsed this situation out a little further and consulted people on the ground regarding their obligations in respect of safeguarding, and given that overnight camps took place at the weekend, there is public confidence in matters at ground level.<\/p> <p>  Notwithstanding all of that, legitimate issues were raised in the letter of 18 February regarding the three cases at hand.  They should not be glossed over, and I am not saying anyone has.  It is not that the incidents did not take place.  There was arguably a response at the time by the designated liaison officers.

For me, the issue is the manner in which Scouting Ireland responds to matters.  I make no apology in that regard.

We all appreciate and understand risk is inherent in any voluntary organisation, but in this instance the manner in which the eight professional staff responded was inappropriate.  That is the issue for Tusla.  It was mentioned that it had been raised at the inter-agency meeting on 25 February.

In the context of why we are here, it is even more important that we get to grips with some of the detail.  To echo some of the comments of Deputy Mitchell, from a personal perspective, not just scouters and legislators but parents were rightly horrified by some of the examples and these elicited an emotional response.  As a parent, an emotional response when it comes to the protection of one's children manifests itself in various ways.  For some parents, the decision they might make with regard to future or continued involvement with Scouting Ireland, or whatever the decision might be as a parent, is clearly justified in the context of that emotional response.<\/p> <p>  It is very clear to the members and those who have been observing these proceedings for the past five hours that there are questions relating to what has been put into the public domain by the Minister and there are responses that will have to be provided by Scouting Ireland in conjunction with Tusla.  However, personally speaking, I am very pleased to hear it reiterated over and over that Scouting Ireland is not in conflict with Tusla and is working with it.  That provides the opportunity to restore the trust that, in fairness, and I am not alone in saying this, Scouting Ireland has been working steadfastly to rebuild following the announcement in January or February of 2018 that there were historical case files that were throwing up difficulties for the movement in this country.<\/p> <p>  From my own perspective, I thank the witnesses for coming before us and, if not presenting their side, presenting a robust response to the position they find themselves in.  I thank the members for their engagement, the Scouting Ireland representatives for making themselves available at short notice previously and this afternoon and the Tusla representatives who came before us and provided us with a great deal of information.  As Deputy Sherlock illustrated, there are a series of questions, some of which perhaps came to light a little earlier in the process but were not put into the public domain in regard to the information we all came to find.  We need to look at that.  I asked Tusla what I feel is a legitimate question, namely, whether the children of Ireland were served by this document finding its way into the public domain.  If the members of this committee had been presented with such an incendiary document, would we have made a decision to put it into the public domain or would we have carefully considered how best to respond to it, to engage with Scouting Ireland either publicly or privately, and to engage with Tusla either publicly or privately?  I am not 100% convinced, as Tusla alluded to, that the best thing in this case is what has occurred.  I do not need to dwell on it for longer than that as I have made my point clear from the start of these proceedings five hours ago.<\/p> <p>  On behalf of the committee, I thank the witnesses for their attendance, participation and responses and, indeed, for their volunteer spirit in everything they do.

He has picked up the baton half way through the race, and it is a fraught race indeed.

What is Mr. Barry's position on this?  I appreciate that he is still chair designate and this will take time, but he is someone with significant experience in large capital programmes.  As the incoming chair, what is his view as to the cost of &euro;1.7 billion?  Does he believe that it is an unavoidable and high cost for a complex project or that the cost has spiralled and it no longer represents a reasonable cost for that building?<\/p><p>If so, does Mr. Barry believe there are opportunities at this stage to bring the costs back down through an extensive value engineering exercise?

Regarding the costs, I am not sure regarding the sum of &euro;1.7 billion.  I am more familiar with what is involved in the approximately &euro;1.4 billion for the build than I am for the other &euro;300 million being incurred by the hospital operating entity.  I am not familiar with its cost structures.  Regarding the &euro;1.4 billion, as far as I can judge - and much of this is in the public domain - what happened was an underestimation of the scope of the project at a very early stage.  That was compounded by initial tender documents for the construction, which did not properly pick up the full scope.  That led to prices coming in which did not represent what the cost would be.<\/p> <p>  In any circumstance, it would have been better to have had more of the total cost determined through competitive tendering rather than partially through competitive tendering and partially through subsequent negotiation.  We could argue the toss as to whether the price is exactly what it would have been if it had gone through competitive tender.  I do not think, however, that it would be significantly different from where it has ended.  When I was reviewing this with my future colleagues, I found that an independent expert signed off on many of the additional costs and adjudicated on them as fair and reasonable for the work involved.  What we are looking at here is a late recognition of the scope of the work and what it is going to cost, rather than a case of spending far too much on achieving the result that is to be obtained.  <\/p> <p>  On the question of reducing costs, a major value engineering exercise was carried out at the time of the original tender.  An ambitious target to save &euro;70 million was set at the time and a saving of about &euro;20 million was achieved.  I know value engineering has also been carried out over the past few months examining further measures and some efforts are also being made at the moment.  We are now, however, in the area of diminishing returns.  There are no savings to be had that will significantly affect the headline figure.  The challenge in the next few years is to contain any growth in that figure.  The committee will be aware from previous evidence that there is a GMP with the contractor for the main construction elements.  There are, however, exclusions to that.  There is inflation, which is outside of our control completely.  That will be what it will be.  There may also be issues to be dealt with if there are scope changes as medical technology evolves over the next few years.  Regulatory changes may also affect aspects of the project.  <\/p> <p>  Our challenges, in reality, in the coming years centre on getting the hospital built.  It is a five-year programme to build and commission this project.  Thousands of people will be working on a constrained site and the challenge for me, the board and the executive will be getting the hospital built safely.  We do not want accidents on the site and that will be a key aspect.  We also have to ensure we get the design and build quality we are entitled to get for the money being spent.  In addition, there is also the challenge of mitigating the impact of large-scale construction on hospital operations and on the surrounding neighbourhood.  We are building in a busy neighbourhood.  We also have to procure a great deal of equipment and deliver it to the hospital, deal with the integration between ourselves and Children's Hospital Ireland, as well as with all of the unexpected events that will occur over a five-year construction programme.  Those are the areas where my focus, and that of the board, will be in the years to come.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019031300002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fred Barry"},{"type":"speech","time":1552467600,"counter":515,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Barry.  Regarding eliminating or minimising further error, does he foresee any changes in personnel within the management structure?  One of the things that struck me in the past two months is that in spite of the cost overruns, not a single person was fired and not a single person has had any HR sanction taken against him or her.  We were also told that not a single contract was changed and not a single company asked to step down, in spite of these massive and unprecedented cost overruns.  I am not asking for specifics, but as Mr. Barry comes into his role, does he foresee the need for any personnel changes?

One of the other issues that jumped out at me from the increased costs was that one of the line items concerned the design team fees.  We have heard that there were significant cost underestimations.  I have a different view as to what happened but that is the Government's position.  We heard from people at this committee that quantities were greatly underestimated and so forth.  My understanding is that some of the people who work in that area are within this design team.  Seven companies are involved in that design team, including quantity surveyors, architects, mechanical and electrical engineers, etc.  In spite of this gross underestimation, and what appear to be major errors, not only were no members of the design team fired but it was agreed that the fees paid would jump from &euro;44 million to &euro;71 million.  That is in one year.  Not only was no one fired or penalised, therefore, their fees were almost doubled.

One of the issues there is that much work has to be done beforehand.  An office block of 22 storeys has to be built and all of the administration staff decanted into it.  All of the existing buildings then have to be demolished and the building of the new children's hospital commenced.  One of the issues that arose during the conversation was the inflation in building costs in Toronto.  Building inflation there has gone up by 15% in 15 months.  It is increasing by approximately 1% per month.  <\/p> <p>  It is in that context that I wish to ask about the mechanism in respect of inflation contained in the contract for the national children's hospital.  The project is not going to be finished until 2022 or 2023.  We have a price that we are discussing now.  There are also, however, built-in issues regarding inflation.  I acknowledge Mr. Barry has only had a preliminary look at the situation, but what is the likelihood of inflation adding to the cost?  Can that be controlled?   I ask Mr. Barry to give the committee his view on what building inflation will be like in Ireland in the next three to four years.

Inflation in excess of 4%, therefore, will lead to additional payments and costs.  As to the likelihood of that happening, a continuous rate of inflation in excess of 4% going on for another four or five years would be unusual.  If that happens, it will be because the economy continues to boom.  The inflation rates are high at the moment.  That is particularly the case regarding the skilled trades that will be needed for the construction of the hospital.<\/p><p>Many of them are the same as those needed for some of the major industrial developments.  There are some very big life sciences developments taking place in the country.  Many members will have seen that Intel has started a huge programme of work, while another is to follow hot on its heels if planning permission is received.  Therefore, there are many cost pressures.  Certainly, the construction inflation rate is running in excess of 4%.  Depending on whose measure one takes, the rate is probably about 6% plus, but I would be surprised to see the rate of 6% continue for another four or five years, only because it would imply a very superheated economy during that period.

Does he believe, having examined the board, that it has the required expertise?  I am not asking for any commentary on individuals; I am talking in general terms because I do not believe commentary on individuals would be appropriate.  Within the structure, Mr. Barry's board reports to another board that reports to another which reports to the Government.  Will he be making recommendations to the Government on changing that structure?  To date, it seems there have been layers upon layers that may not necessarily be required or work.<\/p> <p>  I have two more questions, one of which was partially answered in response to Deputy Donnelly.  Does Mr. Barry believe he can keep the project within the cost of &euro;1.4 billion, plus a fit-out cost of &euro;300 million?  Everything hinges on the PwC report, much of which I presume will be similar to the Mazars report, but additional questions have been asked.

The State would pick up the extra inflationary cost for the couple of years involved.  It would carry the costs of the development board and the CHI board before the start-up for an extra couple of years.  The current contractors would have to be paid for de-mobilising and there would be a further payment to re-mobilise the new contract.  There are many long lead-in equipment items and materials on order, not only through the main building contractor but also through the mechanical and electrical contractors.

One of the major questions that is starting to emerge relates to the two-stage process that was decided by the development board.  The board received a derogation from the Government construction contracts committee, GCCC.  This type of derogation in a two-stage process has only been taken up twice - once by the development board and once in respect of the Dunkettle interchange - and at a preliminary stage.  The development board would have been a pioneer in this type of procurement process.  From his previous work in project management, has Mr. Barry experience of this type of two-stage process?

That is not a reflection on the current board members.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the two-stage process, which is relatively new in the Irish context, the more general process of awarding contracts against approximate quantities at an early stage and subsequently converting those to either fixed prices, guaranteed maximums, target prices or whatever is commonplace throughout the world.  It can work well and has the benefit of getting the work started much earlier than might otherwise be the case.  Often, it helps in getting contractor input into design, development and some of the procurement issues.  There are many positives to it.<\/p> <p>  It was certainly complicated this time around because the original tender documents did not capture the scope of the project as well as might have been the case.  Consequently, there was far more left to be negotiated subsequently than might have been hoped.  As a process, though, there is nothing wrong with two stages or variations on those.  In the UK, for example, a great deal of work is done on a target price basis.  There are many benefits to that sort of contract process.  It is more difficult in the public sector than it is in the private sector, though.  The public sector is understandably quite risk averse whereas, in the private sector, speed to market is often a much greater driver than getting the minimal construction cost.  Saving time is regarded as much more valuable than shaving a certain amount off the construction cost.<\/p> <p>  Processes of that sort can work very well.

He is still Chairman designate but I am sure his appointment will prove to be very appropriate.  I raised the issue of the multiplicity of boards associated with the hospital at the committee's meeting with representatives from the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board when it became obvious that there were some cost overruns.  Interaction between those boards is an absolute necessity.  They should not be acting independently of one another because experience tells us that there is a danger that one of the interests involved will lead the project in a particular direction, which can lead to situations such as that we are now facing.  There must be regular, weekly interaction.  Personnel from one board must have <i>ex officio<\/i>representation on all of the other boards.  Otherwise, one board will take off on a gallop over which the others have no control.  I would not presume to advise Mr. Barry but I would suggest, based on past experience, that this is important.<\/p><p>Unfortunately, this project has got bad a press because it seems to be a question of guesstimating what will be the overall overrun.  Deputy Donnelly has analysed the project from the very beginning and suggested that there could be no end to the overruns.  I have listened to Deputy Donnelly carefully.  I like him; he is a very nice fellow but I do not want to see over-exaggeration of the costs, even in the context of making a political point.  I contend that the original guesstimate was way short of what it should have been.  I look forward to the PwC report because it will identify the basis on which the figures were arrived at in the first instance.  There was no basis at all for arriving at the figures mentioned at the outset.  If one wants to quantify an overrun, the lower one starts, the bigger it will be.  It is in the interests of those who want to criticise the project to have the original guesstimate of costs as low as possible.  Between June and August of 2018, considerable effort was made by the boards to reduce the costs and a relatively small reduction was achieved.  However, if this project were to stall, it would be a national disaster.  The cost consequences would be massive.  That has been the experience on many other projects here and throughout Europe.<\/p><p>I do not understand the need for the 6,000 rooms provided for in the project.  I know that some of the rooms will house equipment and some will be for consultations but we have not been informed how the rest will be used.  Obviously, the more rooms that are provided, the more expensive the project.  It may be of benefit to reduce the number of rooms in the hospital.  We do not know what will be in those rooms.  Could the number be reduced without undermining the overall thrust of what the hospital is about?  There is no reason it could not be revised further, subject to planning permission, the process relating to which can, admittedly, be fickle.  Nonetheless, we should look at the fact that it is a 12-acre site on an overall site that is three or four times that size.  I was approached recently about the possibility of rearranging the traffic to and from the site in a way that would reduce costs.  I do not know if that is a realistic possibility because I am not familiar with the traffic movements in the area, but perhaps it could be considered.<\/p><p>This hospital has been campaigned for and sought for nearly 40 years but has not yet materialised.  It has not materialised because agreement could not be reached on where it should be located.  There will never be such agreement even if we are to wait for another 40 years.  There will never be agreement on the optimum location and that is a fact.  This is because of national and medical politics and the different objectives of various actors, many of which are held in good faith.  However, if we are going to make progress we cannot postpone this forever.  It is not in the interests of children's health to do so.  It has not been beneficial to children's health that the hospital has not yet been built; it should have been built at least 20 years ago.<\/p><p>I also have a question on the fitting out of the hospital.  The fitting out is an add-on in all hospitals and is expensive.  I recall when Beaumont Hospital was being fitted out.  The building was left idle for a year or 18 months while the fitting out took place.  There are extra or add-on costs involved.  It is no good saying that we knew what the costs would be because we did not know.  We do not know what the total will be until the fitting-out costs are clearly identified.<\/p><p>I cannot understand why detailed specification and quantity surveyor reports are not always required before proceeding with a project, in order to protect everybody.  We should not indulge in rough or even precise estimates in a project of this size.  This hospital is needed but it must be built in accordance with the requirements for which advocates have petitioned for many years.  It would be an enormous disappointment to the families of sick children and the children themselves were it to be delayed indefinitely while a political wrangle takes place over where it should be located and how it should be costed.  This is not the first location chosen for this hospital.  It was to be built on the Mater site and a number of other sites were also proposed.  The proposal for the current location incorporates two other hospitals at Blanchardstown and Tallaght.<\/p><p>It is a comprehensive proposal that should not be dismissed in the way some people are dismissing it.  Somebody spent money somewhere in the past ten or 15 years and we have very little to show for it yet.  We should proceed cautiously and ensure that the hospital is at least on par with those throughout the world, which is what we hope.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019031300002#H00500","speaker":"1322","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1552467600,"counter":583,"content":"<p>Does Mr. Barry have a response?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019031300002#J00200","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1552467600,"counter":584,"content":"<p>I would simply note what Deputy Durkan said and thank him for his advice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019031300002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fred Barry"},{"type":"speech","time":1552467600,"counter":585,"content":"<p>That supplementary is a safe bet.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019031300002#J00400","speaker":"1322"},{"type":"speech","time":1552467600,"counter":586,"content":"<p>It is planned to spend more than &euro;10 billion on hospital infrastructure under Project Ireland 2040.

Driving by the St. James's Hospital site, one can see that it is coming out of the ground, yet there is still commentary on the site in the media and in political circles; we had a debate again in the D&aacute;il last night.  Mr. Barry might briefly outline to the committee the status of the project.  There is an suggestion that there is a hole in the ground and nothing else.  Initially, Mr. Barry might outline the reality of what is on the ground.  As Deputy Durkan said, there has been medical politics, regular politics and all sorts of groups involved in this project but we now have to consider how to finish this hospital.<\/p> <p>  I understand there is some commentary on the estimates issue and that perhaps it involved poor calculation of quantities and inflation within the market at the time of design.  There has been mention of de-scoping.  We all know that if we want a fancy kitchen sometimes we have to forgo the curved cupboards or the brass taps or put whatever covering on the floors.  In terms of de-scoping and pulling back on costs, can Mr. Barry say yet if there is any room to do that?  There is a portion of aluminium cladding on the outside and some stone work.  I have not studied the entire building but Mr. Barry might set in stone today - excuse the pun - if we can put an end to this de-scoping conversation or is there room for a cost saving in the future?<\/p> <p>  There has been a conversation about the 6,000 rooms.  It is almost as if there is no need for 6,000 rooms but that is an issue for anyone who has been in an intensive care unit or high dependency children's ward.  Mr. Barry might elaborate on the number of rooms off a main room that would be needed.  I am aware that Crumlin Hospital is currently jammed.  There are no treatment rooms.  With regard to isolation for chemotherapy, children are immunocompromised, so we are not talking about 6,000 regular little rooms.  Mr. Barry might elaborate on that for the committee.<\/p> <p>  There has been a lot of conversation about fire safety.  I want to make sure the message gets out, if it is correct, that there are safe burn times and that there is no issue with the provision of car parking in the basement.  On cladding and finishes, in light of what happened in Grenfell Tower, is Mr. Barry satisfied that our children will be safe if a fire breaks out and that there will be the proper response times to get them out of the building?<\/p> <p>  Equipment comes under his remit.  Does equipment mean computers as in fixed hardware, telephones, kettles and such items or does it mean MRI and X-ray machines, or is it all of those?  I do not know if there has been a discussion on how we will go forward in that regard.  Approximately two years ago, we, as a committee, discussed how we should go about maintenance of equipment.  I raised here the fact that there are always issues with the maintenance people in a hospital when it comes to taking on new roles and training in terms of depreciation of equipment.  Equipment is often leased in the retail sector now and that there is a maintenance contract.  If the retail and commercial sectors are doing that, it tends to be the best option.  Are Mr. Barry and his team looking into that model, which will involve owning the telephones, the computers and such items?  However, when it comes to large, expensive machines which may be rendered quickly out of date, how will that bill be divvied up?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019031300002#J02200","speaker":"1297"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1552467600,"counter":604,"content":"<p>Deputy O'Connell asked about a number of topics.  On the site, certainly there is a great big hole in the ground, with an enormous amount piled around it.  There is a four storey building on one side and there is another coming out of the ground.  Therefore, a lot of work has been done on the site and the idea of moving to a new location should be removed from everyone's mind.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la turned down the application for planning permission for the development on the Mater hospital site.  It gave planning permission for where it is to be built at St. James's Hospital.  There is no certainty that it would not turn down an application for planning permission to build it on another site.  If that were to happen, it could be five or six years before the tendering process could even start again.

I am the clinical lead of Cancer Trials Ireland and I am joined by our CEO, Eibhlin Mulroe.  We are delighted to be here to discuss the implementation of the research-related key performance indicators of the national cancer strategy.  We also want to raise awareness of the value of clinical trials in cancer treatment.<\/p> <p>  I am a consultant medical oncologist, a professor of medicine at the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland and an adjunct professor in the division of cancer medicine at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center.<\/p> <p>  Cancer Trials Ireland is a charity that was set up by doctors, nurses and scientists in cancer care to work on trials across cancer disease areas.  There are over 500 members and we come together regularly to develop ideas and set up cancer trials.  We have 130 cancer trials under way in Ireland, which involve thousands of patients.  The trials are how we develop new and effective cancer treatments.<\/p> <p>  Ireland has the know-how to do more trials.  By increasing investment in cancer trials infrastructure, we will be offering Irish cancer patients more options and potentially better outcomes.  Cancer trials can extend lives and improve quality of life.  When I am in the clinic with a cancer patient, there are times when I want to be able to offer more than the standard of care and that is where a trial can help.  Due to the resource constraints in our cancer units and at our head office, there are trials we simply cannot do at the moment.<\/p> <p>  Cancer is a genetic disease caused by changes in DNA that can be inherited but most of which arise randomly during a person&rsquo;s lifetime.  The landscape of cancer trials globally is changing as we move away from treatments based on the previous understanding of cancer site of origin such as lung, breast or pancreatic cancers, and more towards targeted studies where we look for the same DNA change or mutation in a variety of cancer types.  These trials are very specific, with smaller patient numbers, and are replacing the larger one-size-fits-all trials that we had done in the past.  Ireland can and does participate in these new types of trials, which are important for patients.  In such trials we are testing whether certain targets in cancers respond to specific new treatments in the context of trials where the patients are monitored at the highest level.<\/p> <p>  As for our recommendations, we need to take steps to implement the national cancer strategy published in 2017.  The previous strategy in 2006 was a game changer for cancer care.  We in Cancer Trials Ireland believe this strategy could also be a game changer for cancer research.  Many members will be aware that we need to be ready to take on the challenge of a twofold increase in the incidence of cancer on the island of Ireland over the next 20 years.  In that context, fostering a research culture in our hospitals is important and will create more treatment options for patients through our activity.  The target - KPI 20 in the national cancer strategy - to double the number of people with cancer who can access cancer trials, from an estimated 3% to 6% by 2020 would have saved the HSE millions of euro in drug costs and would have provided more patients with access to promising new treatments that would otherwise not be available.   Because of cuts to our funding, however, we are actually going in the wrong direction.  In 2018 the numbers we have collected so far suggest only 348 patients were newly recruited to cancer trials in 2018 and according to the last report by the National Cancer Registry Ireland, NCRI, there were 22,321 new cases of cancer in the same year.  In 2014, the equivalent figure was 664 patients on trials and approximately 21,000 new cases of cancer, which led to calculation of the 3% baseline figure.<\/p> <p>  In order to support the national cancer control programme, NCCP, achieving this key performance indicator, KPI, and other research related KPIs, Cancer Trials Ireland is calling for support from this committee to reverse the 20% funding cut to its Health Research Board grant that supports its cancer trials research units and general central office.  We need an additional &euro;1.2 million per year to Cancer Trials Ireland research units and central office over the next three years to increase activity and to bring patient numbers up to and above the 3% baseline for persons recruited to clinical trials.  We need protected time for clinicians and medical teams so they can do more research and foster a culture of research in our hospitals.<\/p> <p>  We recommend that the NCCP makes available a ring-fenced fund to which cancer trials research units can apply for multi-year funding for staff and capital to ensure continuity and to build up human capital in each unit.  While the Health Research Board grant covers costs it is not sufficient funding to provide a stable platform for individual research units to do more.<\/p> <p>  I will hand over to my colleague, Ms Eibhlin Mulroe.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019031300002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Bryan Hennessy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1552467600,"counter":626,"content":"<p>I thank Professor Hennessy and the Chairman.  It is great to be here today.<\/p> <p>  The implementation of the national cancer strategy could take us significantly closer to achieving more options for cancer patients.  To date we have been enabled through funding received from the Irish Cancer Society, which contributes &euro;485,000 annually and the Health Research Board, which contributes &euro;3 million per year.  Some &euro;2 million of this funding is distributed among our 11 cancer units in our hospital sites.  This funding employs people to work on clinical trials.  In 2006, the figure for hospital sites was &euro;3.8 million or almost half.  We also receive kind support from the St. Luke&rsquo;s cancer research fund, which is &euro;165,000 per year.  The other half our income is generated through sponsoring our own investigator initiated studies.  They are our trials, we run them and we come up with the ideas but they are funded by pharmaceutical companies and working with international groups like ours to bring international trials to Ireland.<\/p> <p>  Patient involvement is key for us.  Cancer Trials Ireland makes a direct impact on Irish patient lives and it is important for the committee to reflect on that.  In our submission on 6 March, we included true-life stories of people and their experience.  There are many stories of people who have lived longer and with improved quality of life because of their participation on a clinical trial.  They have been there for family, major life events and, most importantly, for their children and grandchildren.<\/p> <p>  There are many misconceptions concerning participation on clinical trials and we try to stimulate public conversations about trials through our Just Ask Your Doctor campaign.  We are humbled that so many patients are willing to advocate for cancer trials on our behalf.  We have established a patient consultant&rsquo;s committee, some members of which are with us here today.  We are very appreciative of that.  Patient involvement in the decisions we make and the research we do is of strategic importance to our organisation.<\/p><p> Our challenge, as outlined by Professor Hennessy, is that we can report little movement on the implementation of the research KPIs.  Due to our reduced funding, we have had to decline opening clinically important academic trials and people with a range of cancers, including lymphoma, testicular and endometrial cancer, have lost out.  We are unable to be proactive in exploring opportunities to open new trials in areas such as pancreatic, lung, testicular and cervical cancer.  This is as a direct result of reduced funding.<\/p><p> The work at our office and at hospital sites is highly specialised and subject to a detailed quality management system with over 50 standard operating procedures, SOPs, designed by us, and is frequently inspected by the HPRA.  Patients in Ireland on clinical trials can take comfort in the knowledge that their welfare is monitored at the highest level in healthcare.  However, it costs to do more and to maintain quality standards.  Therefore, we need increased funding from the Department of Health through the Health Research Board and a budget commitment for the NCCP for research at our hospital cancer units and head office.<\/p><p> The medium-term objective of Cancer Trials Ireland, CTI, is to test and prove treatments that kill cancer and stop it in its tracks.  One important difference between cancer trials and all other cancer research is that clinical trials have a profound impact on the lives of people with cancer today.  Trials deliver in the medium and immediate term.  Today our trials are providing patients with access to proven but not yet available treatments that can save their lives.  There are people on trials today who would not be alive if they did not have access to one of our trials.<\/p><p> It is really important for decision makers to understand that when the funding for trials is reduced, life-saving treatments for patients today can be removed.  Their options are reduced.  Is this a wise approach?  We believe not.<\/p><p> We would like to take this opportunity to thank the 15,000 Irish patients who have volunteered on our trials over the past 20 years.  They have made a difference for future generations of cancer patients.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019031300002#L00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Eibhlin Mulroe","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1552467600,"counter":628,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Mulroe.

My colleague, Mr. Donal Buggy, the society's head of services, and I appreciate the opportunity to outline the patient perspective on the national cancer strategy.<\/p> <p>  Thirty years ago, when we first celebrated Daffodil Day, only three out of ten Irish patients survived a cancer diagnosis.  Today, six out of ten do.  That is thanks in no small part to investment in cancer research - by ourselves, Cancer Trials Ireland, the Health Research Board, HRB, and others - as well as the significant improvement in cancer services in Ireland under the two previous national cancer strategies.  For example, the centralisation of cancer surgery, under the national cancer strategy of 2006, has ensured that more patients are being treated by healthcare professionals with more experience and expertise in their particular type of cancer and thousands of lives have been saved as a result.<\/p> <p>  However, Ireland's cancer outcomes still lag behind other European countries.  It was this lag that the 2017 national cancer strategy set out to tackle through a focus on prevention, early diagnosis, providing an integrated model of care where patients get the package of supports from multi-disciplinary teams and improving treatment, particularly in rare cancers and those where our outcomes are still poor.  Crucially, the 2017 strategy also recognised the importance of patient involvement in their care and of improving quality of life for cancer survivors.  It stressed the importance of investment in cancer research, as a key driver of innovation and a way, as Ms Mulroe of CTI has pointed out, of ensuring access for patients to life-saving medicines that they simply would not get otherwise.  It also highlighted that sufficient support for the national cancer control programme and effective workforce planning were essential to delivering change.<\/p> <p>  The Irish Cancer Society was proud to sit on the steering committee for the development of the 2017 cancer strategy under the leadership of Professor John Kennedy, who is a former chairman of the society.  It is a visionary document that puts the needs of patients at its heart and which, if implemented, would reduce the number of Irish people getting cancer in the coming years and would increase survival rates and quality of life for those who do.<\/p> <p>  That is why it is so disappointing that there seems to be very little momentum behind its delivery.  According to the implementation report published in February, six out of seven interim targets due to be met by the end of 2018 were missed.  Even worse, the HSE's 2019 services plan explicitly states that the NCCP allocation for this year will not enable the service to match referral demands in areas such as radiotherapy, rapid access clinics and diagnostics.  Not only have resources not been provided to the NCCP to deliver the new initiatives promised in the strategy, inadequate funding has been given to deliver existing services to an increasing number of cancer patients.  This is truly shocking and will have a major impact on cancer patients and their families.<\/p> <p>  One of the six missed targets was to ensure patients are diagnosed earlier, thereby increasing their chances of survival.  We recently heard from a woman whose GP had recommended she attend a breast clinic to investigate some worrying symptoms.  She told us that her doctor had told her that her case was urgent and as such she should be seen at the clinic within two weeks.  Still waiting for an appointment, she rang our Nurseline very upset.  She was incredibly worried, anxious and distressed, thinking about a possible cancer growing inside her while she was still waiting to be seen.<\/p> <p>  At the end of 2018, 95% of people classified as having breast cancer symptoms needing urgent investigation were supposed to be seen within two weeks but only 75% were.  Nine out of ten patients with certain cancers were to have surgeries within the timelines set out in the strategy and only seven out of ten did.  Nine out of ten patients starting radiotherapy treatment were meant to start within 15 days of being ready to do so and only eight out of ten did.  Every missed target affects real people - the mother with a lump in her breast, the father with blood in his urine, the healthcare professionals trying to do their best for their patients in a chaotic health service.  Publication of the National Cancer Strategy 2017-2026 was a step forward but underfunding and underperformance are two steps back.<\/p> <p>  One in two of us will be diagnosed with cancer in our lifetime.  When we are, we deserve the best chance.  We deserve the standard of care promised in the 2017 national cancer strategy.  Unless action is taken now, this will not happen.  Instead, with more cancer patients and insufficient resources, standards will slip.<\/p> <p>  That is why we are calling on the committee today to help us ensure that the strategy is implemented by pushing for: a more detailed implementation plan with clear funding, including for the big infrastructural and capital projects called out in the strategy; increased investment in cancer research, including clinical trials and investment in CTI to provide the essential basic infrastructure for those trials to take place; a clear plan and timeline for the delivery of at least one comprehensive cancer centre; completion of the centralisation programme; and action to fill gaps in data and baseline figures in order that implementation of the strategy can be properly monitored.  The committee members' constituents, friends, families and communities deserve nothing less.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019031300002#M00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Averil Power"},{"type":"speech","time":1552467600,"counter":630,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Power.

The Health Research Board, HRB, supports great ideas, the infrastructure and people to come together to make research potential a reality.  The HRB, under the auspices of the Department of Health, is the leading Irish agency funding health research today.  Our annual budget is &euro;45 million and we manage an active investment portfolio of approximately &euro;170 million.<\/p> <p>  We fund research across a broad range of health areas to prevent illness, improve health, enhance healthcare and inform policy.  These funding areas include applied biomedical research, for example, studies into antibiotic drug resistance to support MRSA treatment; clinical trials; population health, for example, monitoring the impact of HPV vaccination in Ireland; and health services research, for example, developing a standard assessment tool to reduce the number of adverse events happening in Irish hospitals.  Our &euro;45 million annual funding pot also underpins the HRB's role in providing evidence to Government to inform health and social care decision-making.  Examples of work that the HRB evidence centre has done and contributed to in the past number of years include the Public Health (Alcohol) Act 2018, regulation and financing of home care costs and policy on water fluoridation.<\/p><p>We also manage four health information systems across a range of areas, including drug and alcohol use, drug deaths, disability and mental health.  International evidence tells us that research-active healthcare systems have better outcomes for patients.  The Health Research Board, HRB, has been at the forefront in some key developments enabling better health and better healthcare in Ireland.  The HRB has invested in an extensive network of three clinical research facilities; five clinical trial networks, including Cancer Trials Ireland; a clinical research co-ordination Ireland hub, which co-ordinates Ireland&rsquo;s involvement in clinical trials; and a trial methodology research network to strengthen the approach taken to trials.  Whether improving lives, prolonging lives or saving lives, health research must be patient-focused.  The HRB has also been taking a lead on putting the patient first by encouraging and helping researchers to involve the public in their research from the start and helping the public participate in reviews of research proposals.<\/p><p> I will now address cancer and cancer research.  The HRB recently analysed the most recent available data on the spend on health research from a range of public funding agencies in Ireland between 2011 and 2015.  During that period, the main agencies and Departments provided cumulative funding of &euro;750 million.  When we looked at the spend on different disease areas, we found that cancer accounted for about 20% of national funding.<\/p><p> This level of investment is reflected in the HRB's portfolio.  Although we provide funding in all disease areas and in cross-cutting areas, approximately 20% of the HRB's revenue budget is allocated to cancer research.  This pattern of expenditure on cancer is not at all out of kilter with other countries.  In the UK, for example, about 20% of national funding for disease-specific health research is allocated to cancer.  In Norway, approximately 25% of all research funding is devoted to cancer.  It must be acknowledged, however, that compared with other countries, Ireland's spend on research is a relatively small proportion of total health spend.  In absolute terms, the HRB allocated &euro;50 million to cancer research in the period from 2011 to 2015.  Across all agencies, the total number was &euro;93 million.  The next largest funder was Science Foundation Ireland, with a spend of more than &euro;30 million. <\/p><p> I will now refer to the national cancer strategy.  We at the HRB welcome this review of the national cancer strategy and the fact that more attention is being given to research as part of that review.  We have three recommendations specific to the research area that we believe will drive the research agenda for cancer in the future.  First, we recommend the urgent establishment of the national cancer research group as outlined in the strategy's recommendation 46.  As noted in the national cancer strategy, there is a need for better co-ordination between different initiatives, research entities and Government agencies.  This can be accomplished through the establishment of a national cancer research group.  We view this as a very important action for 2019.  It would require the involvement of a range of stakeholders including the Department of Health, the NCCP, the HSE and all research funders, including funders from the charity sector such as the Irish Cancer Society.  There are several ways in which the group could operate.  We have some suggestions on how this might be done.<\/p><p> Second, we recommend the proactive fostering of a culture in the cancer care system that truly values research.  This requires supporting the people and the leadership within an integrated healthcare system.  As noted in the national cancer strategy, there is a lack of recognition within the healthcare system that research is a relevant, vital and critical activity.  We strongly support the strategy's recommendation of ensuring that newly-appointed cancer consultants and advanced nurse practitioners have protected time to pursue research.  The appropriate mechanisms must be put in place to make this a reality and not just limited to employment contracts.  It is one thing to have it written in a contract but actually delivering on it on a day-to-day basis is what is needed.  Furthermore, we recommend that the NCCP and HSE find a way to fund, or at least co-fund, more of the core positions in the research infrastructures, such as clinical research nursing and data management.  This would free the HRB in its remit as a cancer research funder to move away from more basic infrastructural needs and invest in more trial activity, which would be good for patients and good for the system.<\/p><p> Our third and final recommendation is for serious efforts to be made to build patient and public trust by improving the use of the cancer data that already exist in an open and transparent manner.  This is linked to recommendation 52 in the national cancer strategy.  The National Cancer Registry Ireland is a world-class piece of data infrastructure that informs us at a high level about the incidence and mortality of all cancers in Ireland.  However many other data sources also exist such as, for example, disease-specific registries and population cohort data such as the data sets of the Irish longitudinal study on ageing, TILDA, and the hospital inpatient enquiry, HIPE.  If these data sets were linked to the National Cancer Registry Ireland data in a safe, controlled and trustworthy manner, this could provide valuable insights into cancer in the Irish population.  For example, linking information on cancer incidence and mortality to information on demographics, socioeconomic indicators and lifestyle would help us to target cancer treatment and diagnostics deliver more effective prevention strategies.<\/p><p> We recommend that a national health data project should be initiated using the principles established in the Health Research Board&rsquo;s proposals for an enabling data environment for health and related research in Ireland, which we euphemistically call the data, access, storage, sharing, linkage, DASSL, model.  This was published in 2016 with an initial focus on cancer.  The HRB believes that given Ireland's size, relatively centralised health system, well-connected ecosystem and growing sense of citizen engagement, a focused and concerted effort could make Ireland a leader in health data management and use.   A critical first step in that project would be the development of trust on the part of patients.  This could be achieved through Citizens' Assembly-style meetings to build understanding of the concept, gain buy-in and establish safe data sharing and linkage principles.  We believe this would lay the foundations for people to benefit fully from the advances in genomics and precision medicine that are increasingly important in cancer treatment. <\/p><p> I thank the committee for the opportunity to present.

I will address the second question first.  As I said in my opening statement, our baseline figure for the number of people diagnosed with cancer who go on trials is 3%.  That was calculated from 2014 figures.  The strategy recommends that we double that.  That is because, as other speakers have noted, international evidence clearly points to the fact that research-active healthcare systems have better patient outcomes.  However, the problem is that since the calculation of that baseline figure we actually have gone backwards.  The figure for 2018 is more like 1.5%.  That is mainly down to cuts to funding for cancer research nationally.  That is by far and away the biggest factor that has caused that problem.  Ms Mulroe can speak further on that.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy's first question was about how we choose who goes on cancer trials.<\/p><p>The research programme in Cancer Trials Ireland seeks to develop cancer trials for patients with all the different types of cancer, such as breast, colorectal, bowel and lung cancer as well as the less common cancers such as ovarian and pancreatic cancers.  We subdivide different cancers into different areas - different parts of the cancer journey that are treated in different ways.  We develop trials in each of those areas but we cannot cover all the different priority areas in all the different types of cancer, not even nearly, with the funding cuts we have experienced, and we want to do that because people with cancer are entitled to cancer trials.  When I see a person with cancer in the clinic for whom currently available treatments are no longer working, I can do nothing else to help the person.  If there is a trial open that suits the person, it could offer a lifeline.  A lifeline is hope and many trials have offered, and continue to offer, hope for people in Ireland with cancer, but not enough of them.  If there is no trial there is no lifeline and no hope.  That is not the best that we should be offering people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019031300002#N00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Bryan Hennessy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1552467600,"counter":636,"content":"<p>It is all down to funding again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019031300002#O00200","speaker":"1262"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1552467600,"counter":637,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019031300002#O00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Bryan Hennessy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1552467600,"counter":638,"content":"<p>It is.

It is an Australian trial and our little not-for-profit Irish group is sponsoring that trial not only in Ireland but also in Europe.  At the time, the drug involved in the trial was not available in Ireland.  It was not approved or licensed.  It was an experimental drug so people here would not have had that opportunity.  What is important is that the public understands.  Trials are for everyone with cancer, irrespective of when or where one is diagnosed.  That is why the incidence denominator irritates me slightly.  It is more to do with the prevalence.  We should be looking at 6% of the prevalence figure, which is almost 173,000 people living with cancer in Ireland.  What is important is our hospital sites.  Looking at the number of trials we are running across the country, we are doing more in Dublin and Cork than we are doing in the west and north of Ireland.  It is important to consider that in the strategy, there is access to trials for the whole country.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked how one gets on a trial.  We have started to ask patients to ask their clinicians about trials.  We have trials open; they are on our website.  One can ask one's clinician and often one can be referred to a trial.  What is heartbreaking is when a person comes to a clinic such as Professor Hennessy's and one knows a trial is taking place across the water for the exact condition the person has.  We could do it.  We have a list of trials in a queue that we cannot open because we do not have the money to do it.  It is not just the money in our office; it is also the nurses and so forth.  In the hospitals the Oireachtas Members work with and represent the nurses, doctors and data managers who work on those trials within the care journey are maxed out.  That is the reason for integrating research trial staff within the hospital budget line items.  Dr. Morrissey referred to that.  It is important to point out that the trials for cancer happen in the cancer units in the hospital.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019031300002#O00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Eibhlin Mulroe"},{"type":"speech","time":1552467600,"counter":641,"content":"<p>I acknowledge the presence of Eddie and Teresa MacEoin from my home town of Bandon and welcome them to Dublin.

Some people who are going to hospital to receive chemotherapy are being sent home because there is no bed.  Has this come to the attention of the witnesses?

There are two main reasons for that.  One is demographics.  Cancer is predominantly a disease of older people so as the population lives longer more people are likely to get cancer.  The other key reason is lifestyle factors.  Factors such as obesity, alcohol and tobacco increase the likelihood of getting cancer.  We are all born with a certain risk of getting cancer and, as Professor Hennessy mentioned, while many cancers occur randomly, others are genetic.  However, by drinking alcohol excessively, not exercising enough and being overweight, we increase our likelihood of getting cancer.  The NCRI prediction of cancer numbers doubling is just a prediction and it is within our power as individuals, as an Oireachtas and as a society, to change that prediction and make sure it does not happen.  Investment in cancer prevention is one of the main pillars of the national cancer strategy and it is very important.  By addressing cancer prevention, we can save lives by ensuring fewer people get cancer in the first place.<\/p> <p>  Regarding patients being sent home when they have presented for appointments, it happens for all types of appointments and not just those for chemotherapy.  The same happens for surgeries due to capacity issues in the hospitals.  It is a constant source of distress for patients who call our Nurseline or present at daffodil centres in hospitals and even when patients are referred to rapid access clinics because they have urgent symptoms.  The additional distress that comes from not being treated within the required timeframe is incredible.  On diagnostic tests when people have been told that they have symptoms that require urgent investigation and they had the test, it is a massive relief to find out that they do not have cancer, but they will have spent that entire period worrying about a possible cancer growing inside them.  That is unnecessary and incredibly upsetting for patients.  Tragically, others will find that by the time they have got a diagnosis their cancer may have progressed and be harder to treat than it would have been if they had been seen within the required timeframe, which is shocking.<\/p> <p>  There are a number of reasons for that.  One is capital infrastructure.  That is why it is important that the capital projects promised in the national cancer strategy are delivered on time and are not delayed by issues such as the overrun for the children's hospital, which the committee discussed earlier.  It is also essential that workforce issues in the health service are addressed.  Research investment is a key part of that.  One of the reasons many Irish-trained consultants, nurses and other healthcare professionals who have gone abroad to get experience do not come home is that they will be unable to do research here because they do not have protected time.  We train amazing healthcare professionals to a very high standard in this country.  They go abroad to get further experience in some of the best cancer centres in the world but then they must face the choice of coming home and not being able to do the type of research they can carry out in New York, Australia, New Zealand and other countries.  That is crazy.<\/p> <p>  As Professor Hennessy and Ms Mulroe said, patients do better in research active environments and one of the reasons is that research active hospitals and healthcare settings attract the best healthcare professionals.  The best people want to be able to carry out research and ensure their patients get access to new treatments and medicines.  They want to work in an environment where they have time, head space and access to treatment facilities that deliver the best care.  They do not want to work in a system that is chaotic.  Providing investment in research and protected time will also address the wider issues around attracting people home and filling the gaps in consultant, nursing and other posts in the health service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019031300002#O00800","nonspeaker":"Ms Averil Power"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1552467600,"counter":643,"content":"<p>I will address aspects of all Deputy Murphy O'Mahony's questions.

That submission is under review.  I hope that there will be a step in our 2019 allocation towards a phased reversal of the original cuts.  That said, and to address the Deputy's opening question, this is not just about cash.  Rather, it is about the complexity of funding and, as Ms Mulroe, Ms Power and Professor Hennessy have mentioned, the blend of support on the other side of the line in terms of infrastructure, people supports and people to deliver the trials, for example, better and more flexible staffing within hospitals to allow for more research time.

If the 2019 funding comes in, we will be at a revenue level of &euro;34 million within an overarching pot approaching &euro;46 million.  There is growth.  In addition, the Department is driving some important infrastructural changes within the health research system.  These will allow for more efficient and increased research activity in future years and are fixing decades-long systemic issues in the system.  For example, a Bill that has received Cabinet approval and whose heads are being developed as we speak deals with the issue national research ethics, an area that has seen a systemic impediment in the system.  With us, the Department may be able to deliver solutions in that regard.  Similarly, there was a risk that GDPR would get in the way of research.

However, the HRB funds research, which is what the 45 people in CTI do.  The least qualified person in our office has a masters in translational oncology.  It is not one bit intimidating.  These are the people who write protocols, monitor safety, quality and training, and engage in pharmacovigilance, covering all of the processes required in clinical trials for Irish patients to be safe.

Yesterday, I spoke to one of my colleagues in the Health Research Board-Clinical Research Co-ordination Ireland, HRB-CRIC.  Denmark is recruiting four times the number of people onto cancer trials than we are because it has integrated the budget line item for research staff in cancer units into hospitals.

The Irish Cancer Society provides almost &euro;500,000 a year for Cancer Trials Ireland, much of which is core funding which in other countries would be provided by the health service.  It should not be for us to fill the gap.  We want to be able to fund research programmes, not basic infrastructure.<\/p> <p>  Uniquely, we fund protected time for clinicians.  One of the big issues for researchers in Ireland is that they do not have dedicated time to carry out research as part of their contracts.  If medics working in our system want to carry out research and be part of a cancer trial, whether Irish or international, they have to do it on top of their existing contracts.  If people who already have insanely busy weeks and are under pressure to deliver basic clinical services want to conduct cancer research, they have to add another 20 or 30 hours from their own time to carry it out.  That is crazy and impossible.  It is also unreasonable and the reason healthcare professionals do not want to return here from other countries where research is a core aspect of their day job.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019031300002#Q00800","nonspeaker":"Ms Averil Power"},{"type":"speech","time":1552467600,"counter":673,"content":"<p>It is all interconnected.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019031300002#Q00900","speaker":"1349"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1552467600,"counter":674,"content":"<p>Absolutely.

Specifically, she stated the HSE's 2019 service plan explicitly stated the allocation for the National Cancer Control Programme, NCCP, would not enable the service to match referrals in services such as radiotherapy, rapid access clinics and diagnostics.

It is an interconnected system.  Therefore, a wide range of stakeholders are required.  Certainly, the Department of Health is four square behind it and central to it, as are the NCCP and the HSE.  In our submission we outlined the data.  We assessed the funding provided throughout the health service that trickled through to cancer research.  Whereas the Health Research Board is the biggest contributor, Science Foundation Ireland, the Irish Research Council and others also have a stake in the game.

We have to do it ourselves and find our own budget on top of what we get from the Health Research Board and Irish Cancer Society.

There is no doubt that it is incumbent on those networks to ensure that the net is cast very wide and that there are no impediments, whether infrastructural or otherwise.  As it happens, with Cancer Trials Ireland, we ran an international review last year which was a positive review with regard to scientific outputs but it asked questions about appropriate structures and how financial flow happens through the system, especially in the context of interconnectedness between trial activity and it having to happen in hospitals, where there is change going on related to Sl&aacute;intecare, regional integrated care organisations and such.  On the back of that recommendation to look at the structure, we are running a more finance and structure-oriented review, for which we are bringing the terms of reference to our board in the next few weeks.

I do not believe it is there.  If we are to integrate trial activity in hospitals, it needs to be in that document.  I am grateful that Dr. Morrissey has brought that up.  The Senator asked if there are any researchers and clinicians at hospital sites who are restricted from doing studies.  There is rarely anyone saying that someone cannot run a trial.  A contract for a trial could go to the CEO of one hospital and the same contract could go to another, and one hospital will not sign it while the other will.  That means that patients in the hospital where the contract is not signed are taken out of the mix for access to clinical trials.  There is not continuity for how we approach simple things such as contracts for trials.  That needs to go at a very high level within the national cancer control programme, NCCP, and the HSE, and would solve some issues.  I imagine some of the researchers the committee has heard from have mentioned that.<\/p> <p>  The Senator asked if people feel left out.  Some 70% of the money that we distribute to hospital sites does not come from the Irish Cancer Society, the Health Research Board or the HSE but from the money that we generate for our own trials.  That funds staff at hospital sites.  That comes from collaborative groups and from industry that are funding, investigating or initiating the study.  Dr. Morrissey is correct that industry should be involved in this conversation.  We are a funder and we are not part of the newly-established research group, yet we fund more trials on cancer.  I understand the rationale behind it because we are a charity.  We have looked at the figures and know exactly how much it costs to run a trial and how much we spend on every one of the 130 trials that we have on our books.

In recent times, it has not been possible to get this information through parliamentary questions, whereas it had been in the past.  Now we are referred to the annual report.  The problem is that it is annual.  There are no reports on a weekly, or bi-weekly basis, for instance.  I will engage with the Minister in an effort to change that.  I mean no disrespect to the people who compile them, but a report that is over a year old may lack accuracy.<\/p> <p>  Following on from Senator Burke's questions, have the organisations represented here made comparisons with the outcomes in countries similar to Ireland, which spend more on cancer research, diagnostics, etc., so that we might know what should be done to achieve similar outcomes?  They should be better but they may not be. <\/p> <p>  Various forms of cancer, including melanoma, keep coming up again and again.  Early diagnosis is important but, again, public representatives cannot always get information on these on a regional basis.  It can be informative to find out the incidence of different cancers.  We have been told in the past that it was due to better diagnostics, healthcare or an emphasis on healthcare.  Do the witnesses have any information that would be useful?<\/p> <p>  More could be done on the educational element of cancer prevention.  Will the witnesses comment on that in respect of the various forms of cancer?  Some types come to mind in particular. <\/p> <p>   I refer to genetics.  I am interested in the extent to which those here have identified the genetic tendency towards cancer.  There seems to be solid evidence for that.  I am aware of it but would like some more information about the extent to which there can be intervention at a crucial stage in the patient's favour.  <\/p> <p>  I am sorry for going on for so long but I might not get another opportunity.  It is fully appreciated that every aspect of the health services suffers from a lack of funding because of the downturn in the economy.  We cannot address that all in one go.  It is not easy.  It has been repeatedly brought to our attention through the HSE that to attract the right staff in the numbers required and to retain them, it must compete with Australia, America and Canada.  This is a difficult issue.  It is not easy for patients because they will feel they are entitled to the best possible treatment available as soon as it is available anywhere.  Patients have experience trauma because treatments available elsewhere are not available here for various reasons.  Perhaps it because we have been too slow to react or it is due to lack of funding, or there are other reasons.  How can the most salient factors be addressed in the shortest time possible?<\/p> <p>  I refer to the availability and access to research through public and private sectors.

We would like to be at the top end in life-saving.  We went from a survival rate of three out of ten to six out of ten.  Drugs are being developed to treat individual patients.  If that is the way drugs are going, will we be left behind as a result of the methodology used to reimburse drugs?  Is it necessary to separate oncology drugs from all other drugs because time is of the essence?  If someone is being treated and a doctor can get to them early, he or she can save the person's life, but if he or she does not, there is an inevitable consequence.  <\/p> <p>  I would also like the witnesses' opinion on drugs which are life-extending rather than life-saving.  I have a specific interest in lung treatment where we are behind the curve.  The drug, Tagrisso, is reimbursed in 20 countries but not in Ireland.

What is the funding split between primary and applied research?  I have spoken to some of our scientists whose view is that funding for primary research has been largely stripped out in, say, the past ten years.  Several have described how they might have been working on particular molecules and undertaking basic research that could have led to all sorts of wonderful things but that research was stripped away.  They felt that they were essentially being outsourced to the pharmaceutical industry to conduct testing on their drugs and their impacts.  How much of cancer research is not linked to any specific drug or trial but is just core, basic lab-based research?<\/p> <p>  The next question is for the HRB and Cancer Trials Ireland.  Regarding all the trials that are being funded, are any drugs publicly or co-owned or is all the intellectual property privately owned?  If all the intellectual property is privately owned - and this is essentially private companies trialling their own products - what percentage on average do companies fund to trial their products versus the State or third parties for that?<\/p> <p>  I thank the HRB for its presentation, which was useful.  Its first recommendation was to establish a national cancer research group to improve co-ordination.  That sounds like something everyone would support.  What is the current status of that?

The third recommendation is to build patient and public trust by improving the use of cancer data.  I read through this and it sounds like the sort of thing a PhD student or a team of boffins could knock together in about a week.  I am probably oversimplifying somewhat but we are talking about getting a bunch of existing datasets and doing clever things with the data.  Is that not something that could be knocked together very quickly?  There would be a need to hire very clever people.

Why is that and what do its representatives think is going on?  We will shortly be talking to some of the people whose job it is to ensure implementation.

It relates back to the idea of creating core infrastructure in the hospitals for cancer trials for clinical research.  It is not a lack of value for research by medics, doctors or nurses.  In the system, from the Department of Health down, there is no recognition that research should be integral.  A hospital manager will have a ward that needs ten nurses.  It is part of his or her job to get ten nurses for that ward.  There is no recognition of cancer research in that way.  There is no budget line item in hospital management or the Department of Health stating that the cancer trials unit in that hospital needs ten staff members to be hired.  While the hospital management will staff the wards, they will not staff a cancer trials unit at the moment because such units are not recognised as an integral part of the system.  We doctors and nurses in the research system have to staff our own cancer trials units with our own moneys from the Health Research Board, the Irish Cancer Society, Cancer Trials Ireland, charities, donations from patients and so on.  When we talk about valuing research in the healthcare system, we need the Department of Health, the NCCP, the HSE and hospital management to recognise the cancer trials unit as an integral part of the hospital as much as any ward in that hospital and for such units to be staffed accordingly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019031300002#T00500","nonspeaker":"Professor Bryan Hennessy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1552467600,"counter":707,"content":"<p>That describes the passion that exists in the system from the members of Cancer Trials Ireland, including the medical oncologists, radiation oncologists, haematologists and cancer research nurses who are working with patients every day.  Those patients are looking to them for other options and they do not turn their backs on them.  This organisation started 20 years ago to provide an opportunity for Irish patients with cancer to have another option.  Deputy Donnelly asked about the IP and the costs around that.  We commissioned DKM Economic Consultants to do an economic and health impact analysis in 2016.  We were able to prove that there were cost savings of &euro;6 million in 2016 in drug costs.  That was for drug costs that would otherwise have been available within the system.  The Deputy asked how much more expensive it is to put a patient on a trial than not to do so.  It is actually cheaper for the system to put a patient on a trial.  That is in very crude terms.  We can prove it.  The health impact takes it a step further because that patient gets quality adjusted life years, or QALYs as they are known in health economics.  We have been able to prove that thousands of patients have had years of QALYs.  One QALY is one perfect year of life.  Many have got five to ten of them.  That is one of the reasons trials are so successful now; they are running longer because patients are surviving for longer.  The economic impact is very real.  It is probably going to increase over time.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Brassil talked about access and innovative treatments.  We are not in the business of health economics.  That is not what we do.  We run trials and the drugs we are working with are mostly experimental.  Very often with experimental drugs, we are comparing standard of care treatments with an investigational product.  Professor Hennessy may wish to jump in here.  When that happens, if it is a pharmaceutical sponsored trial or if it is one of our investigator initiated trials, that drug is covered.  The cost of those drugs on both arms of the trial are covered.  In terms of the access piece, it is going to be an issue.  I think the Irish Cancer Society will want to speak to that.  However, in the absence of that, as I mentioned earlier, we have a patient here who benefited from being on a trial in respect of a drug that was not available in the system.  We up the game in clinical trials and offer more options to Irish patients, and they live longer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019031300002#T00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Eibhlin Mulroe"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1552467600,"counter":708,"content":"<p>Deputy Durkan's question in the context of education was very good.

Hundreds of those courses have been taken up.  These are the things we engage in which are important.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Donnelly used the term \"primary research\".  The term we would use is basic biomedical research and the question is where that fits within the HRB brief.  There is no doubt that during what I will euphemistically call the austerity years, the focus for the Department of Health and the HRB definitely shifted towards the more applied end of research.  That is a matter of fact.  We have moved increasingly away from funding basic research.  However, there is still a place in our portfolio for basic biomedical research.  Currently ,out of a revenue stream of approximately &euro;35 million, in the region of &euro;2 million is dedicated to basic biomedical.

Dr. Morrissey's answer is frank; it is the most frank answer I have had and I thank him for it.  The concern they are raising is that we have to have a pipeline the whole time.  There is this balance in a technology-readiness pipeline, and there are all these different ways of looking at it.

The quantum of that role remains to be seen.  Engagements between the Health Research Board, as a more applied health research funder, and other funders, will allow a basic funding pot to flourish.  We engage with organisations such as The Wellcome Trust.  We co-fund with it and pull leverage funding into the State for use for basic funding.  We do the same with the National Institute for Health in the United States, and others. <\/p><p> I wanted to address many points but I am aware that we are running out of time.  The data issue is more complex than has been outlined.  The recommendation is founded on the issues that abound whatever jurisdiction one is in, in the context of data governance, mining people's data, and data protection.  Linkage is not easy.  A lot of investment has come into this area, most notably from companies based in Northern Ireland, in order to set up safe havens for data linkage, using principles that the CSO would know a lot about.  We wrote a paper in 2016, known as the data access, storage, sharing and linkage, DASSL report.  I have copies of the report and am very happy to hand them out.  It makes proposals which the Department of Health is minded to run with.  It is more complex, but we believe there is a solution within it.  <\/p><p> On the subject of intellectual property, IP, ownership, all funders in Ireland sign up to the national IP management protocol.  The simple answer to the question Deputy Donnelly asked about the percentage that flows through each project is that it depends on the project and the skin in the game that the industry or private sector partner has.  The rules are laid out in the national IP framework, which is linked to state aid and European legislation.  That is a simple answer.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019031300002#T00900","nonspeaker":"Dr. Darrin Morrissey","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1552467600,"counter":712,"content":"<p>In broad terms what is the average?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019031300002#U00200","speaker":"1436"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1552467600,"counter":713,"content":"<p>I do not know.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019031300002#U00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Darrin Morrissey"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1552467600,"counter":714,"content":"<p>Cancer Trials Ireland is a charity; it has no IP.

Deputy Brassil asked about access to medicines.  There is no doubt that there is huge potential for personalised medicines to transform patient experiences and outcomes.  It is particularly stressful for patients, especially those with a terminal diagnosis, to know that there is a new medicine that could either save or extend their lives but which they cannot access, particularly in circumstances where the same medicine is available across the water through the NHS.  It is a big issue and it is a growing issue.  Patients feel that they are caught in the middle between the Government and the industry.<\/p> <p>  The National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics, NCPE, has quite a transparent process which looks at the data and interrogates the proposition put forward by pharmaceutical companies.  After the recommendation is made it goes to the Department and the into the political system, which is a black hole.  There is a sense among patients that decisions are very political and that there is no fairness to the process.  It seems to be a case of shouting the loudest, which is an approach that is particularly distressing for patients.  We need a fair system that is based on data, one in which a patient can be confident that if his or her doctor believes that his or her particular type of cancer will respond to a new medication that he or she will be able to get access to it.  These medicines are expensive, and they do not work for everybody.  We need to educate patients in that area, because sometimes they read about so-called miracle drugs through the media, and believe that because it has worked for one patient with a particular type of cancer it will work for them as well.  Unfortunately that is not the case.  Where the data is strong enough, however, and where the NCPE is satisfied that there is a clinical and pharmacoeconomical benefit to providing that medicine it should be provided.  That is a big issue.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019031300002#U00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Averil Power"},{"type":"speech","time":1552467600,"counter":716,"content":"<p>Does Ms Power have figures on how we compare to the EU averages for the time of reimbursement for new drugs?

In the medium to long term the answer is cancer prevention, given the fact that four out of every ten cancers are preventable though things such as the HPV vaccination and through lifestyle changes.  We each have it within our power as individuals and as a society to ensure that cancer numbers do not double over the next 25 years, as predicted.  That would make a massive difference.  In the short term early diagnosis would help.  A frightening number of Irish patients - some 3,000 a year - are diagnosed in emergency departments.  Approximately three quarters of those cancers are at a late stage, when the cancer is difficult, if not impossible, to treat.  There is no doubt that thousands of lives could be saved if people were diagnosed earlier, and if we tackled those issues around waiting lists.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019031300002#U00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Averil Power"},{"type":"speech","time":1552467600,"counter":718,"content":"<p>How do those numbers-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019031300002#U00800","speaker":"1322"},{"type":"speech","time":1552467600,"counter":719,"content":"<p>We have to move on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019031300002#U00900","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speech","time":1552467600,"counter":720,"content":"<p>I am aware of that, but I have been here since 9 o'clock this morning.

In comparison to other countries, Denmark, Norway and Austria have better outcomes for cancer than we do.  We can, through the implementation of this strategy over the next ten years, achieve the target of getting from mid-table to the top quartile of cancer outcomes in Europe.  That is the prize available if we choose to invest in this particular strategy.  We should make that choice to invest in the research, the services, the co-ordination and the networks required to deliver world-class cancer care.<\/p> <p>  The other point raised concerned genetics.  Genetics and genetic services are a challenge.  Funding is not available to support comprehensive genetic services.  I am aware of services in St. James' Hospital, but they were suspended last year because the symptomatic numbers coming through overwhelmed that system.  There is leadership in that area, but we have to put funding behind it.  Another issue is access to preventative surgery once one has been brought though those genetic services.  If one requires preventative surgery can he or she access it?  It is considered elective at times.  <\/p> <p>  A question on cancer prevention and education was asked.  Cancer prevention has been one of the areas of progress in terms of this strategy and the development of a cancer prevention network and a cancer prevention function within the NCCP.

I am joined by Dr. Teresa Maguire, head of research services unit at the Department of Health, and Judith Corcoran from the cancer policy unit.<\/p> <p>  The national cancer strategy is a comprehensive policy document that aims to meet the needs of cancer patients in Ireland for a ten-year period.  It is the third national strategy and builds on the history of strong policy in cancer over the past 20 years.  The main achievements of the 2006 strategy included: provision of equal access to high-quality treatment; the establishment of designated cancer centres; multidisciplinary management as the standard of care for cancer patients; the centralisation of some cancer surgery services; rapid-access clinics for breast, lung and prostate cancer; significant increases in access to medical oncology and cancer drug treatment; a national programme for radiation oncology; and cancer screening on a nationwide basis through BreastCheck, CervicalCheck and BowelScreen.<\/p> <p>  The establishment of the NCCP to implement the strategy recommendations, followed in 2007.  The National Cancer Strategy 2017-2026 is aligned with Sl&aacute;intecare and its implementation is an important part of the Sl&aacute;intecare action plan.  The vision of the strategy is, \"Together we will strive to prevent cancer and work to improve the treatment, health and wellbeing, experiences and outcomes of those living with and beyond cancer.\"  We developed the strategy in collaboration with clinicians, nurses, health and social care personnel, patients, carers and organisations such as the Health Research Board and the Irish Cancer Society.  The strategy sets out four goals, namely, reducing the cancer burden, providing optimal care, maximising patient involvement and quality of life, and enabling and assuring change, that are crucial to the achievement of the vision.<\/p> <p>  On reducing the burden, cancer prevention is a cornerstone of the strategy.  The proportion of cancer incidence attributable to modifiable lifestyle and environmental factors is estimated to be between 30% and 40%.  Of these risk factors, smoking has by far the largest impact and, in implementing the strategy, we are working towards the goal of making Ireland tobacco free by 2025, including through the enactment of legislation on standardised retail packaging for tobacco.  We also need to maintain our efforts to reduce the number of avoidable cancers through the promotion of healthy lifestyles, in areas such as improved diet, increased exercise and reduced alcohol intake.  We are focused on diagnosing cancer at the earliest possible stage as a critical step in reducing mortality and improving survival and quality of life.  Public and health professional awareness of warning signs for cancer is vital.  Early presentation is important, as is ensuring that people take up the offer of cancer screening.<\/p> <p>  In regard to optimal care, the primary aim for all cancer services is to provide evidence-based care that is effective, safe, of high quality and patient-centred.  The concept of a continuum of care will underpin the approach to patient services, from prevention, early diagnosis and evidence-based, high-quality, patient-centred treatment to appropriate follow-up and support.<\/p><p>Multidisciplinary team working has led to better decision-making, more co-ordinated patient care and improvements in the overall quality of care.  It is proposed that all patients diagnosed with cancer will have their cases formally discussed at multidisciplinary team meetings.  This strategy is building on the progress made to date through supporting the key role of designated cancer centres in cancer treatment.  The centralisation of surgical services for more cancers is being progressed and radiation oncology and medical oncology will continue to be improved and expanded.<\/p><p> A report in January from the National Cancer Registry confirmed that the programme of centralisation of cancer services is contributing to ongoing improvements in cancer survival.  In addition, the CONCORD programme established global surveillance of cancer survival as a metric of the effectiveness of health systems.  The most recent programme data from 2014 indicates that, in Ireland, survival has increased for all tumour types studied.  Our aim now is that survival rates in Ireland will reach the top quartile of European countries by the end of the strategy period.<\/p><p> Patient involvement is a key aspect of the strategy.  We now have an increasing number of cancer survivors with their perspectives to offer on the development of services for cancer patients.  Building on the significant impact of the cancer patient forum in developing this strategy, a cancer patient advisory committee is now in place and patient involvement in policy-making and the delivery of services is being promoted in the implementation of the strategy.  With many people living significantly beyond cancer diagnosis and treatment, there is a need to develop and implement survivorship programmes.  This has consistently been a key concern of patient representatives whose focus is on quality of life.  These programmes will emphasise physical, psychological and social factors that affect health and well-being, while being adaptable to people with more specific survivorship needs following their treatment.<\/p><p> The NCCP provides leadership across the continuum of cancer care.  It promotes the provision of high-quality, evidence-based care to optimise outcomes and patient experience.  The NCCP has been instrumental in reforming and improving how services have been delivered.  Under this strategy, the NCCP is working closely with hospital groups and community healthcare organisations to lead service reorganisation and to ensure that integrated care pathways are provided for those affected by cancer.  The focus is on ensuring that the objectives of the strategy will continue to underpin decisions on cancer care across the health service.<\/p><p> The strategy emphasises the positive impact of research activity on patient care.  The development of a culture in the cancer care system that values research to the benefit of patients is an aim of the strategy.  The data collected and managed by the national cancer registry are a foundation for research activity to drive improvements in cancer care for patients.  Cancer research also supports the recruitment, retention and motivation of excellent clinical staff who drive the development of high-quality, efficient services.<\/p><p> The first National Cancer Strategy 2017-2026 implementation report for 2018 was published the Minister on 4 February.  This report focuses on the implementation of the 52 recommendations.  Highlights include legislation on standardised retail packaging for tobacco, the passage of the Public Health Alcohol Act 2018, progress towards a national skin cancer prevention plan, new posts in medical and surgical oncology, capital developments relating to radiation oncology, publication of a model of care for oral anti-cancer medications, the commencement of the roll-out of a national cancer information system, the progress being made by working groups on survivorship and psycho-oncology and the establishment of a cancer patient advisory committee.<\/p><p> The Department and the NCCP are working together to ensure that progress is maintained on the implementation of the strategy.  We hold monthly performance oversight meetings as well as quarterly review meetings specifically focused on reviewing progress on the implementation of the strategy recommendations.  The strategy was formulated with the input of all stakeholders and it enjoys broad support.  The Department and the NCCP are committed to working with these stakeholders to progress its implementation so that many people will avoid cancer in the coming years and those with cancer will receive comprehensive quality treatment and will maximise their quality of life following their treatment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019031300002#V00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Conroy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1552467600,"counter":728,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Conroy and now ask Dr. Jerome Coffey from the NCCP to make an opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019031300002#W00200","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1552467600,"counter":729,"content":"<p>I am accompanied by my colleague Dr. Ana Terr&eacute;s, head of research and evidence of the HSE.

It is part of the overall prevention message of the Department and many of the messages about protecting people from cancer are the same as those about protecting people from other illnesses.<\/p> <p>  There is an ever-increasing number of people living with and beyond cancer because of the successes in treatment we have had over the past ten years.  Many people have been diagnosed, had cancer and are now out of it, have survived and are living well beyond cancer.  There are 170,000 people in that category.  I could talk about developments in treatment but let us focus on the aftermath for a moment.  In our discussions around the development of strategy, I particularly remember a patient who talked about looking forward to coming out of treatment and being told she was clear of cancer.  When she got to that day, instead of a feeling of euphoria, she described a feeling of fear about losing a comfort blanket and wondering what to do.  Structures are needed in that regard.  That is something we are working closely with patients on.  We are also working hand in hand across the voluntary sector and so on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019031300002#W00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Conroy"},{"type":"speech","time":1552467600,"counter":732,"content":"<p>It is said to me reasonably regularly that Ireland is poor at public health investment.

The second is to ensure that clinical cancer research and the staff who deliver it become fully integrated as a component of cancer care, which relates to the point made by Deputy Donnelly.  The third recommendation is to examine mechanisms to ensure that newly appointed consultants have time allotted to research.  The fact that this is in the strategy illustrates that we accept the basic point the Deputy is making, namely that there is more to be done in this area.  The current strategy is very much building on the previous one and we accept that research is an area that has not been developed as much as it could have been.  There is a commitment in the strategy to this area, particularly through the cancer research group which will be set up in the first six months of this year.<\/p> <p>  There have been a lot of steps forward in cancer research.  Cancer is one of the areas where research is a lot more developed than in other areas of the health sector.  There is an opportunity to use cancer as a lead in terms of making improvements.

Can we be confident that pathways for information flow, the necessity for patient permission, and the process by which those who are diagnosed with cancer but come into the system from different pathways, have all been looked at dealt with to ensure we will not need to go there again?  As a result of the revelation about what went on there, the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland is carrying out a review which was meant to be done long ago but will not even be completed this year and we still do not know.<\/p><p>To return to the statistics, my third question is whether all that has been dealt with.

I wish to take up on one or two points from the previous session.  Clinical trials are not as readily available outside Dublin and Cork.  What is the reason for that?  What about Limerick, Waterford, Galway and Letterkenny?  Surely trials should be spread across the country in an even-handed way.<\/p> <p>  Do the witnesses believe the national cancer strategy is working?  This is important because the rudiments are in place to make it successful, ensure good outcomes and improve the life expectancy of cancer patients considerably.  Everybody asks questions seeking confirmation.  I spent many years as a member of the Committee of Public Accounts so I know how that works.  I am not putting words in the witnesses' mouths but am seeking a simple, straightforward, honest answer to the question of whether the registry is working.  If so, is it working to the greatest extent possible?  Can it be improved?<\/p> <p>  My next question is important.  Every organisation requires more funding.  The health service, in particular, is in need of funding for a variety of reasons, including a lack of action on time, a lack of intervention on time, and a failure to provide adequate capital funding on time.  As a result, there is a backlog.  That is the story of the health services.  I am not suggesting a bottomless pit in terms of funding but we have to improve.  Generally, health services here cost more than in many other European countries.  That needs to be dealt with that from a public consumption perspective.<\/p> <p>  Somebody said to me some time ago that we had a better system ten years ago, and we did.  We had more money but we borrowed it.  The country was broke and nobody realised it at the time.  That is a fact.  At this stage, we need to spend money carefully and wisely, and we need to make it available.  That is our duty but we must keep in mind that we do not want to go back to where we were.  The health system, no more than any other aspect of infrastructure, would not be capable of withstanding another crash.  We have many challenges, not least of which is the need to make adequate provision throughout the health services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019031300002#Z01000","speaker":"1322"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1552467600,"counter":786,"content":"<p>The national cancer strategy is working.  We have touched on some of the prevention measures.  In the past, people accepted the dangers of smoking.  They were not as conscious of some of the other dangers associated with cancer, and did not link certain lifestyle issues to cancer.  That is changing.  We are bringing out a skin cancer prevention plan on 1 May.<\/p> <p>  With regard to screening, our numbers are up.  The breast screening rate last year was 76%, against a target of 70%.  On early diagnosis, people are more aware of cancer.  Increasingly, they are being encouraged to follow up on lumps or other symptoms.  Much work is being done on the provision of diagnostic equipment in our hospitals to handle the numbers coming through.  We can do more. <\/p> <p>  On cancer surgery, improvements in outcomes are very marked owing to the centralisation of services.  On radiotherapy, Dr. Coffey mentioned the new centre in Cork that will have five radiotherapy machines, up from four.  It will open next year.  The building will be finished this year and it will be commissioned in the first quarter of next year.  Medical oncology facilities are being improved all the time and expanded, bearing in mind that the number of people coming through is increasing.  With regard to the involvement of patients, there is much interaction with them, as there was in the drawing up of the strategy.  Patients are our biggest critics in ensuring that the system is working.  Their views are spurring us on to ensure it continues to work.<\/p> <p>  I mentioned the robust review mechanisms to be in place with the NCCP, with which we work closely.  It is basically a hand-in-glove approach across the Department and NCCP.  The NCCP is pushing implementation all the time across the HSE.  We see figures coming through all the time.  We try to use any money we get in a judicious way to address any problems.<\/p> <p>  With regard to funding generally, we will never have enough money.  All areas of the health sector and all areas of government always like to have more but what we do have we use very well.  We are using funds in a targeted and outcome-oriented way that is followed up and recorded, and from which we see the outcomes.  We change allocations in the details to ensure that continues to happen.  If something is not working as well, we address that.  <\/p> <p>  There is a third strategy.  We are building on a good strategy in the second one.

Trying to persuade people who do not want to undergo a test in a freely accessible service that it might save their lives is a challenge.  It is important to distinguish between colorectal screening.  The target is low and it is hard to reach but that is in line with the international experience.  For some reason, people are happier to go for mammograms, Papanicolaou smears or HPV testing than have a faecal immunochemical test, faecal occult blood test or scope.  Despite best efforts and impressive media campaigns in this country, it is a struggle to reach the targets, but I am not sure what are the international reasons for that.<\/p> <p>  I am not directly involved in the introduction of HPV testing and, therefore, I do not know the date for the introduction of the service or how the backlog is being addressed.

In the mid-west and the south east, we buy from the private sector and those services, which have been in place for a period, are excellent.  The machines in Limerick and Waterford are at the end of a ten-year life cycle and, therefore, the question is how best to replace them while also potentially increasing capacity in order that people will not have to wait.

Given the accuracy rating and the apparent lack of information prevalent in the system, it was a bad system in terms of the capacity of patients to have confidence in it.  The theory was that information was withheld from patients because it would have undermined public confidence in the system.  Which comes first, however?  Is it the need to assure the patient of absolute certainty that the laboratory to which her test is referred is doing its job, is accurate and that results are followed up?

The family law system has evolved over the past 40 years with very little regard for the rights, needs, interests or experiences of men.  We find that the family courts are adversarial, exacerbate hostility, create ill will, and are bad for parents and children.  The system is overloaded, delays are frequent and we understand that judges dislike family law cases.  Instead of addressing the social issues, family law has evolved into a high-growth civil law industry that thrives on exploiting conflict.  It benefits only lawyers, solicitors and other professionals.  It plunders scarce family resources that are even more stretched following a separation.  The system takes far too long to reach a settlement.  Legal fees are very expensive and place lay litigants at a disadvantage.  Men are less likely to qualify for legal aid and very many are unable to afford legal representation.  A point made repeatedly at the hearing in this committee on 6 March was that the threshold for legal aid was too low and disadvantages men.<\/p> <p>  Children suffer from costly and long drawn out conflicts.  They may also be used as pawns in custody battles.  Joint custody in a real 50-50 sense occurs in only about 1% of cases.  We believe that breaches of access orders should be dealt with firmly with sanctions imposed.  This does not happen at present.<\/p> <p>  Outcomes in the family courts are bad for men and this is well attested.  Too often it is a winner-takes-all situation in which the man is removed from the home.  He may still have to pay maintenance and a mortgage as well as provide for himself.  Furthermore, he will often discover that access to his children is gravely diminished, in many cases because he can no longer provide suitable accommodation for himself and his children due to his removal from the family home under section 10 of the Family Law Act 1995.  There is a need to reform the law and remove that section in order to prevent these disastrous outcomes.  This is also essential to ensure that mediation is entered into meaningfully by both parties.<\/p> <p>  Alternative dispute resolution, ADR, produces far better and more conciliatory results in a shorter period and at a lower cost.  There is evidence for this from Irish mediation services, as well as from Finland, New Zealand and elsewhere.  It has much better outcomes for children and should, therefore, be regarded as the normal procedure.  Application to the courts should only be made in the event of failure of mediation and should be regarded as the exception, not the rule.<\/p> <p>  Members will see from the supporting documentation supplied to the committee many of our proposals such as the introduction of families in transition programmes, the replacement of the family law civil Bill with proposals for the reorganisation of the family unit, and mandatory mediation are designed to reduce the hostility and expectations of victory that are inherent features of the current family law system.<\/p><p> We hope these proposals will be of interest to and given due consideration by the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019031300002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Frank McGlynn","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1552467600,"counter":831,"content":"<p>We strongly support the case made by Treoir for automatic guardianship rights for unmarried fathers and the need for a central register for these documents.  In the tussle between competing parental rights the rights of the child are being lost.  Instead we emphasise the principle of equal rights for both parents.  Current practice puts the adult centre stage, whereas the child's welfare and fundamental right to know and spend time with both parents should be paramount.<br\/><br\/>At the hearing on 6 March reference was made to a case in which a father was alleged to be violent and denied access as a result.  Apart from the fact that such an allegation does not need to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt in a civil court, a father still retains his right be a father to his child, as one judge affirmed recently in Dolphin House.  However, this is not common practice.  Once again, it underlines the need for clear parenting guidelines and compliance with them.  <br\/><br\/>We also strongly support the case made for mediation where domestic violence is alleged, not only for the reason outlined.  The term &quot;domestic violence&quot; covers a wide range of behaviour, from physical violence to abusive behaviour, including emotional and psychological abuse.  We know from a wealth of sources that approximately 50% of domestic violence is reciprocal.  It is engaged in by both parties.  In such instances there is not an identifiable mutually exclusive pair of victim and perpetrator.  That crucial point is not recognised.  There are many surprising findings about domestic violence which are relevant and not known but which are listed in the sources cited in our written submission, on which we would be happy to expand, if required.<br\/><br\/>Parental alienation is recognised as a serious problem by a number of commentators.  In a D&aacute;il debate on 25 February 2015 two Deputies referred in graphic terms to parental alienation.  One stated:<\/p><blockquote>There is an enormous problem, where people are estranged, of the primary custodial parent, who most often is the mother, deliberately obstructing fathers from accessing children.  They are using children as pawns, going to war with fathers, causing some fathers to have nervous breakdowns, and destroying relationships deliberately between children and fathers.<\/blockquote> <p>Hearing the voice of the child sounds attractive, but it needs to be approached with great caution.  As one expert has said, it is a question of differentiating between the expressed wishes of the child and his or her ascertainable wishes and feelings.  This requires expert professional advice.  The issue is covered in much greater detail in the written submission made by Nemo Forum.<br\/><br\/>I refer to fatherlessness or father absence.  It is a huge problem, the importance of which has not been sufficiently recognised.  There is ample evidence that children, especially boys, suffer from a range of behavioural problems.  The US academic Professor Sara McLanahan found negative effects of father absence on outcomes in educational attainment, mental health, relationship formation and stability, as well as later success in the labour force.  Boys who grow up without a father are twice as likely to end up in jail as those from two-parent families.  Professor McLanahan found strong evidence that father absence negatively affected children's social-emotional development and the effects were more pronounced in boys than girls.  The US academic Dr. Warren Farrell gave the following warning in 2015: &quot;Prisons are centres for dad-deprived boys.&quot;  This shocking statement underlines the importance of fatherhood.  We neglect it at our peril.  The issue of father absence needs to be moved far higher up the agenda than where it lies.<br\/><br\/>We thank the joint committee for its attention and stand ready to take questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019031300002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Walsh"},{"type":"speech","time":1552467600,"counter":832,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McGlynn and Mr. Walsh.

In my opening statement I will focus on three of the issues suggested for discussion: the structure of the court system; alternative dispute resolution mechanisms; and ascertaining the views of the child during family law proceedings.<\/p> <p>  Ireland does not yet have a specialised family or children's court system.  Such systems are commonplace across Europe and in common law jurisdictions.  The establishment of a specialised family and children's court system is a recommendation made in Council of Europe guidelines.  The intention to establish such a system has been announced, but the necessary detail, resources and implementation are needed in order to make the plans a reality.<\/p> <p>  In the 1980s the Probation Service sat in in every family law case, but that changed late in that decade as the service concentrated on criminal law cases.  That left a significant gap which has never been filled.<\/p> <p>  It should be acknowledged that the President of the District Court, Judge Rosemary Horgan, has introduced innovations in the Dublin Metropolitan District Court.  Admirably, in his first public address the Chief Justice focused on the issue of access to justice.  That said, much broader structural reform is needed to ensure the family law system will meet the needs of citizens who access the system at a vulnerable time in their lives.<\/p> <p>  The proposal set out in 1996 by the Law Reform Commission family courts working group recommended the establishment of a two-tier court system: the District Court and a regional family court.  Under this proposal, the lower tier would have some of the jurisdiction the District Court currently has, but the court would not make final orders.  The second tier proposed was the establishment of regional family courts, with information centres attached.  They were to be on the same tier of jurisdiction as the Circuit Court and use specifically trained members of the Judiciary.  The second tier, to be known as the Regional Family Court, would have jurisdiction in dealing with all issues.<\/p> <p>  An analysis of the family law court system in England and Wales and Australia suggests it is a model which is not overly interwoven with the rest of the court system.  Managing the type of case which goes before each tier also emerges as a key issue of importance.  In England and Wales a strictly run gate-keeping system is operated to ensure cases are allocated to the most appropriate tier of the system.  This mechanism to manage cases is best suited to the Irish context.<\/p> <p>  Cuts to legal aid budgets have led to proceedings which are more drawn out and more difficult to resolve and a situation where adequate support is lacking.  The time constraints faced by professionals actually cost more money in the long run.  That is something we sometimes forget; it is a case of penny wise and pound foolish.  It is something of which we should not lose sight.<\/p> <p>  It has often been emphasised that the common law adversarial system is highly unsuited for family law cases, as parents are focused on winning and their disputes can be damaging psychologically both for them and their children.  It is unclear whether inquisitorial systems are better for family law cases, in particular those which involve proceedings concerning children.  Alternative dispute resolution, ADR, has been recommended for greater attention, having regard to international practice and what would be possible in Ireland.  Mediation and other alternative dispute resolution approaches appear to result in more amicable and enduring arrangements, with the attention of parents more likely to be on children's needs.  There are issues related to power dynamics in relationships and children are often excluded from alternative dispute resolution approaches.  Therefore, it should be seen as a useful alternative mechanism to resolve family disputes, not as a cost-saving measure.<\/p> <p>  A family law system must be equipped not only to have children present but also to facilitate them in having meaningful involvement in proceedings.  Courts in Ireland have a duty to hear children and give due weight to their wishes.  Article 42A of the Constitution provides for a more heavily entrenched right for children to be listened to in private family law cases.  There is a distinct lack of provision in Ireland for children to be heard.<\/p><p>Guardians <i>ad litem<\/i>are often the most effective mechanism whereby children can present their views to the courts, yet they may or may not be appointed in a given case.<br\/><br\/>I have made a number of recommendations in the submission to the committee and I will focus on three or four of those by way of conclusion.  Any new family court structure must recognise and promote an interdisciplinary system to ensure effective communication among all disciplines involved in family law.  In private family law matters, key services should be available to permit family law judges to refer couples or parties to skilled personnel to draw up parenting plans; carry out parenting capacity assessments; deal with anger management programmes in domestic violence cases; monitor custody and access orders when they break down and facilitate their restoration; engage in family therapy; and implement supervised access orders.  The key ancillary services are an essential part of any new family law court system.  The message I wish to communicate this morning is the importance of those key ancillary services.  Without them any new system will be as flawed as the current one.<br\/><br\/>Other practical measures that are necessary to ensure child and family law matters proceed smoothly include having translators within easy reach to avoid lengthy delays or adjournments when there are language problems.  Judges must set firm timetables for cases.  Timetabling and case management decisions must be child-focused and made with explicit reference to the child's needs and timescales.  This recommendation should be underpinned by primary legislation, as delay and drift have a profound impact on the welfare of children and families.  The message from other jurisdictions is unequivocal that children and family services in the court are best managed by a dedicated and integrated family court structure that is properly resourced to meet the particular needs of people at a vulnerable time in their lives.  Ireland must invest resources to ensure that its court system is fit for purpose.  It should be not only meeting the requirements of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, the Council of Europe guidelines and other international standards but leading the global inclination in favour of specialised family law systems and of involving children in proceedings affecting them.<br\/><br\/>I thank the committee for taking the time to listen to me and I am happy to answer the members' questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019031300002#E00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Geoffrey Shannon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1552467600,"counter":835,"content":"<p>Ms Eilis Barry will make the opening statement on behalf of FLAC.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019031300002#F00200","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1552467600,"counter":836,"content":"<p>We welcome the opportunity to make a submission to the committee and we welcome the committee's focus on this important issue.  Family law is the largest area of queries on our information telephone line and in our legal advice clinics.  The clinics, where volunteer lawyers provide legal advice, operate in 67 locations around the country.  As part of our public interest law project, McCann FitzGerald Solicitors has partnered with Women's Aid and provides advocacy for women who are representing themselves in family law matters.<\/p> <p>  For 50 years we have been promoting access to justice, which obviously includes access to legal aid.  Importantly, it also includes access to the courts and effective remedies.  What happens in the court is vital to access to justice.  Access to justice is about democracy, as provisions in legislation the Oireachtas has enacted, such as the important provisions in the new Domestic Violence Act that we welcomed, will only be effective if they can be enforced.  Access to justice is also fundamental to the rule of law as it enables State bodies that are involved in family law, such as Tusla and the HSE, to be held to account.  Fundamentally, however, it is about social inclusion.  People who present at FLAC clinics or in our casework often have a number of legal issues ongoing at the same time so it is important not to view family law and the family courts in isolation.  Family law problems are often accompanied by debt, unemployment and housing problems, and homelessness makes these issues far worse.  Solving an issue such as housing or homelessness may have a positive impact on family law matters, such as enabling access or custody to take place.  Addressing these issues together will increase social inclusion.<\/p> <p>  The Legal Aid Board and the Courts Service are public, statutory bodies.  The positive duty which is set out in section 42 of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act 2014 imposes an obligation on both the Legal Aid Board and the Courts Service to promote equality and human rights.  What we mean in this context is the human right of access to legal aid and complying with the provisions in the Equal Status Acts which require the Courts Service to be accessible and to ensure there is no discrimination on any of the grounds in that legislation.  It also requires the reasonable accommodation of people with disabilities.  The State's system of legal aid and advice is administered by the Legal Aid Board.  We believe the Legal Aid Board and the Courts Service must be regarded and treated as fundamental to the administration of justice and the rule of law and must be resourced appropriately.  The budget of the Courts Service was hit very badly during the recession and that must be addressed.<\/p> <p>  We welcome the committee's focus on this issue but we invite it to cast its forensic eye in particular on the issue of legal aid.  Problems with the provision of legal aid include problems with delays, the means test, the contributions, the waiver, the issuing of certificates and the areas of law excluded.  We also submit that there is a lack of transparency about the reasons for refusal of legal aid and the amount of financial contributions collected.  I pay tribute to the work of the staff of the Legal Aid Board, who face huge demands for their services.  Nothing we say here should be seen as a critique of their work.  It is somewhat like the health services in that the service from the staff is excellent but the problems arise from the structures and resources.<\/p> <p>  With regard to delays in law centres, there is a waiting time of ten months and more for a first consultation in the Blanchardstown and Finglas law centre, 33 weeks in the Cork law centre and 32 weeks in Tralee.  The means test has not been amended since 2008.  We understand that the Department is open to reviewing the means test and that the Legal Aid Board has submitted recommendations for a review in this regard.  To qualify for legal aid a person must have a disposable income of less than &euro;18,000 per year, as well as disposable capital of less than &euro;100,000.  The family home is not considered as means when assessing capital.  There are also allowances which have not been reviewed since 2008.  One of the allowances includes &euro;8,000 per year for accommodation costs.  Given the current accommodation costs per month, that is far below what one would pay for private rented accommodation or a mortgage property.  There is also an allowance for childcare expenses of up to &euro;6,000 per annum whereas the average childcare costs amount to &euro;1,000 per month.  The means test must be poverty proofed and reviewed on an ongoing basis.<\/p> <p>  We also argue that the Legal Aid Board should have discretion to provide legal aid in certain circumstances where people have failed the means test.  We have seen a case where a hospital was intending to make an application to the High Court in respect of the medical care of a terminally ill child.  The parents failed to meet the means test.  They had no money because they had been out of work for a number of months to take care of the child, but they failed to get legal aid in that instance.  In cases of exceptional importance where people fail the means test the Legal Aid Board should have a residual discretion.<\/p> <p>  As regards financial contributions, one would think that somebody on an income of &euro;18,000 or less would not have to make a financial contribution towards legal aid but, unlike the medical card, legal aid is not free.  The minimum contribution for legal aid is &euro;130.  That might not appear to be much but it is very significant if one is in receipt of a social welfare payment.  It exceeds the reduced rate of social welfare payments that are paid to a person under 26 years of age.  We have heard of contributions of thousands of euro being made by people who are in receipt of legal aid if the aid relates to the sale of the family home.  It is possible to get a waiver if the contribution might cause hardship but that waiver provision is not well known and is not advertised.<\/p><p>We campaigned to have the financial contribution removed for victims of domestic violence and we were successful in that campaign but a person still has to make a financial contribution when they go back to the courts in relation to access, custody or maintenance.<\/p><p> There appears to be an unofficial rule in operation that a person will only get the maximum of two legal certificates per year.  This does not make sense on any level.  Apart from the impact on the parties and the families having to make repeated trips to the court over extended periods, it would appear to be a far better use of court time and legal aid staff to have all applications dealt with from the outset.<\/p><p> There is a lack of clarity as to whether legal aid is available in housing cases, which is closely related to issues which arise in family law cases.  FLAC submitted an amendment to the Department of Justice and Equality which, if enacted, would ensure that legal aid was available to anyone facing eviction from the family home.  This would include people in long-term mortgage arrears or people facing evictions from local authority housing.<\/p><p> We need more transparency from the Legal Aid Board on the use of the waiver, the level of contributions that are collected, the number of refusals of applications for legal aid and the reasons that accompany those refusals.<\/p><p> Ms Lord will deal briefly with the issue of access to the courts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019031300002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Eilis Barry","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1552467600,"counter":838,"content":"<p>I will be very brief in my comments.  I reiterate our thanks to the committee for inviting FLAC before it to present on this important issue.  As Ms Barry has already pointed out, access to justice is fundamental in that it allows people access their other rights but also enables people to hold other State agencies, such as Tusla and the HSE, to account.  I want to focus on some of the more practical aspects of accessing the Irish courts which should be addressed if there is to be meaningful reform of the family law system.<\/p> <p>  Given the limited nature of legal aid and the restrictions on what someone can be granted civil legal aid for, many people end up representing themselves in the courts.  This raises all sorts of difficulties for individuals because of the complexity of the processes.   We have made a lengthy submission to the committee on which we have made a range of recommendations regarding accessible forms that could be made available to people that would assist in making it easier for people to represent themselves in the court process.  We have also made a number of recommendations around examining the provision of unbundled legal services and further statistics that could be compiled so that we might eventually gain a better picture of the true needs of family court users.<\/p> <p>  We have also made a range of recommendations to address the difficulties that are faced by people with disabilities in the courts, such as inaccessible courts, inaccessible offices of legal practitioners, legal documentation being unavailable in accessible formats, and the procedural systems being too complex to navigate.  Accessible formats and accessibility testing are necessary because people with disabilities are involved in family law proceedings in our courts.  We have also made a number of recommendations regarding the availability of information for people who speak Irish Sign Language.  We recognise that the Courts Service has made some improvements in accessibility, particularly for people who use hearing aids, but much more could be done.<\/p> <p>  There are clear problems with the physical infrastructure of the family courts in Ireland.  Hearings on domestic violence, guardianship, children, maintenance and matters pertaining to passport applications and blood tests are heard in Dolphin House in Dublin.  Dolphin House deals the family court issues for the Dublin metropolitan district with the exception of Swords.  Despite the large area that Dolphin House caters to, the court building is not equipped for the high volume of people who are using it.<\/p> <p>  The availability of speakers of foreign languages is an issue across all family courts.  The lack of regulation in legal interpretation services is a major issue and FLAC has concerns about the quality and availability of interpretation that is being provided.  Given that there can often be significant and important constitutional rights in the balance in these cases, this is an issue of major importance.  People who do not have sufficient English language skills are just as entitled to access justice as anybody else in the court process.  We absolutely recognise the work of Courts Service staff and legal practitioners within the court, but it is at full capacity at the moment.<\/p> <p>  I will talk further about Dolphin House in particular.  My work is research-based and I do not generally visit the courts but I did visit Dolphin House recently.  I found the entire experience rather shocking.  It was filled with people, many of whom were in a vulnerable position and from marginalised communities.  It is common practice for people to have to engage in consultations with their solicitors in the hallways and on the stairs because there are so few consultation rooms available and those that are available are already occupied.  Women often have children with them because of childcare issues.  It is unclear, when one enters the court building, where to go.  There is a set of stairs and people carry buggies and prams upstairs before returning back down the stairs.  Consultations with solicitors, which often contain intimate details of someone's mental or physical health, are taking place in full earshot of complete strangers.  There are visibly distressed people and upset children in the courts who are crammed into a dirty and poorly laid out building.<\/p> <p>  The lack of space in the family law courts means applicants and respondents generally have to wait in the same area, and this can be especially distressing for victims of domestic violence.  It makes it especially difficult for women who have to consult their solicitors when the respondent is in the same area.<\/p> <p>  A further issue is that when a person's legal aid certificate has run out, they are dependent on the Courts Service staff to explain the basic information to them about the different orders and processes involved and the requirements needed to apply for them.  The Courts Service staff do their best but it is not a replacement for proper legal representation and access to civil legal aid.  While I am speaking particularly about Dolphin House, the lack of consultation space is something that comes up in courts across the State. <\/p> <p>  Were the courts and legal aid to be resourced appropriately, it is our view that it would massively reduce legal costs in the long term because cases would proceed appropriately.  Civil legal aid is consistently viewed as the poor relation of the welfare state and we would very much like to see this examined and changed.  FLAC would be happy to attend this committee again and meet any of the committee members who wish to discuss this issue further.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019031300002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Stephanie Lord"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1552467600,"counter":839,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the invitation to address it today.  I plan to focus on the impact of the <i>in camera <\/i>rule on hearing from children and families, the need for consistency between courts, and articulating a clear model for childcare proceedings.  My knowledge of these issues is based on being a principal investigator of two research projects, one on childcare proceedings in the District Court and the other on voluntary care arrangements, as co-editor of a book examining child welfare removals in eight countries, and as an educator and a former front-line practitioner in child protection and welfare.<br\/><br\/>I endorse previous comments made to the committee by Dr. Conor O'Mahony from UCC and Dr. Carol Coulter and Dr. Maria Corbett from the Child Care Law Reporting Project.  I am therefore intentionally not addressing themes I feel are important but were previously addressed by them.<br\/><br\/>I will now address updating the <i>in camera<\/i>rule, and the voices of parents, children and young people.  Through our research and discussions with experienced judges and legal practitioners, it has become clear that the <i>in camera<\/i>rule is poorly defined in Irish law, despite recent clarifying amendments in 2007 and 2013.  The precise parameters of what is prohibited are not set out and whether any particular conversation about a set of <i>in camera<\/i>proceedings would breach the rule largely comes down to the subjective opinion of individual judges.  These amendments focus largely on permissions for attendance in, and the reporting of, these proceedings and do not appear to cover research with participants outside of the proceedings.<\/p><p>In essence, any person involved in <i>in camera <\/i>proceedings in the field of child protection, private family law or elsewhere risks being held in contempt of court every time he or she discusses the proceedings with anyone other than his or her legal representative or the other parties to the proceedings.  The law neither clearly allows nor prohibits interviews with children, young people and their parents.  In the absence of clarity, researchers, children, young people and parents are at risk of being held in contempt of court. <br\/><br\/>This is not just an issue of academic concern.  We should be proud of recent Irish legal, constitutional and practice reforms which have sought to promote the participation of children, young people and parents, ascertain their views and facilitate their greater involvement in decision-making.  We now have a considerable amount of quality Irish research on the operation of childcare proceedings.  However, the specific issue I have documented with the <i>in camera <\/i>rule has had a chilling effect on research, thereby silencing the voices of children, young people and parents who are impacted on most by these proceedings.  Further to observations made previously at this committee, this is further evidence that there is a significant gap in implementation which is frustrating the realisation of the child&rsquo;s right to be heard.<br\/><br\/>I refer to the lack of consistency between courts.  A key finding of our study of childcare proceedings in the District Court, in the feedback from front-line practitioners during children&rsquo;s rights and child protection training in a five-country EU project that we ran and the current data collection in our study of voluntary care in Ireland is that there is professional frustration and concern about a lack of consistency between courts on how childcare proceedings should be conducted.  This lack of consistency and the significant differences between court culture and practice are problematic for several reasons.  First, all participants should expect a degree of predictability in court proceedings.  Second, citizens participating in court proceedings which involve State intervention in family life should not experience significantly different models of practice, depending on their address.  Third, there is some concern that in courts where an adversarial approach is dominant a focus on the welfare of the child can be lost.  There is also concern that this model is not conducive to facilitating children&rsquo;s participation and can lead to significant delays in decision-making and significant extra court time for professionals.  Clearly, this issue is inextricably linked with other reform items, including a lack of specialist family courts and judges; limited judicial and interdisciplinary professional training; the absence of a judicial council; the need for investment to address judges' high caseloads; and suitable child-friendly and family-friendly court facilities.<br\/><br\/>I wish to speak about a clear model for childcare proceedings.  There is a pressing need for the Oireachtas to articulate a clear vision of what the orientation of these proceedings ought to be through the Child Care Act 1991 review process and the establishment of specialist family courts.  The revised Act should be detailed in describing the model to reduce discretion in implementation and promote consistency.  Lessons from other jurisdictions illustrate that there is no single ideal model that could be adopted ready-made from the shelf.  Caution will need to be exercised to avoid unintended consequences such as those discovered when time limits for child protection proceedings were introduced in England and Wales.  However, there is clear evidence in other countries of significant reform of their court and court-like decision-making models for child welfare removal.  When Ireland&rsquo;s childcare proceedings are compared with reforms in other countries, the Irish system appears dated and has changed little, despite wider changes to the child protection system and legal and Constitutional developments.  Difficult decisions will have to be made and significant investment is required.  Change may be hard, but the research and practice level evidence now available makes it clear that reform is required.  <br\/><br\/>Whatever model is proposed should attend to several questions.  Is the new model child-friendly and parent-friendly, maximising participation and amplifying the proceedings' focus on the welfare of the child?  Are decision-makers sufficiently trained and resourced to make timely and evidence-informed decisions in the best interests of children?  What principles should underpin the revised model and what practical changes are required to implement them?  What type of implementation strategy is required to ensure there will be no significant deviations in the model across the country?<br\/><br\/>Reform discussions will need to examine whether decision-makers with specialist knowledge who are not solely judges should be included; the merits of pre-proceeding processes; what child-friendly and parent-friendly non-court-like buildings and rooms would look like; whether time limits on proceedings are necessary to ensure timely decisions; consistency in the implementation of thresholds for care orders; protocols for referrals to meditation or similar alternative dispute resolution processes to address an impasse; articulate in detail the principles underpinning the model and codify them in law; adopting child-friendly justice principles and practices; exploring how the testing of evidence could be undertaken in lieu of adversarial cross-examination; consideration of a wide range of methods to facilitate the direct and indirect participation of children; and the establishment of specialist courts. <br\/><br\/>Based on our research, there is consensus that reform is required in Ireland, but there is less consensus on the of reforms that should be implemented.  An independent, focused consultation process such as this hearing and others, with stakeholders from civil society groups, experts by experience and representatives of social work, legal practice, professional associations, the Courts Service and relevant State agencies, could go some way to informing decisions on these reforms.  It is clear that children and parents cannot wait for another decade before meaningful reforms are decided on and implemented.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019031300002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Kenneth Burns","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1552467600,"counter":841,"content":"<p>Before I turn to members for questions and other contributions, I flag that at the conclusion of our session today we would like to invite our guests to join us for a group picture for inclusion in our report.

The Irish people voted for a system in which children would be heard.  The expectation is that the Oireachtas would move to legislate in a coherent fashion for hearing the voice of the child.  I have had quite a lot of experience internationally on this issue and I have been asked regularly by the Anglophone and Germanophone judicial network to speak at conferences on how systems operate internationally.  We now have a constitutional principle that children should be heard but we do not have the infrastructure.  I argue that we have world-class legislation but third-world infrastructure when it comes to implementing a lot of the reform.  Where that is lacking is in the detail.  We need a system in which proceedings are tailored to the needs of the child.  That is something we sometimes lose sight of.  We need to be clear that there are various methods by which to hear the voice of the child.  We need to look at where the child is at.  Guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>provision is inconsistently implemented.  When it comes to the Judiciary hearing children, we need a structure around that.  We have a decision of Mr. Justice Abbott, which I cited in my opening statement, which provides some guidelines.  However, we need a clear framework for hearing the voice of the child so that there is consistency and so that, no matter where a child lives, he or she has the opportunity to have his or her views heard fully.  That can be achieved by enacting legislation which maps out the various methods by which the voice of the child is heard, whether it is the guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>system, hearing directly from children, a judge hearing a child or that the child is heard through an expert.  That should revolve around the needs of the child rather than those of the system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019031300002#J00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Geoffrey Shannon"},{"type":"speech","time":1552467600,"counter":847,"content":"<p>Would FLAC like to add to that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019031300002#J00300","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1552467600,"counter":848,"content":"<p>I agree with Dr. Shannon.

However, it is clear the legislation as it currently is, with the four-year minimum period, has a huge impact on children.  Not only is the four years a minimum separation period, it tends to include extensive litigation between both parties.  It can be very vitriolic.  Parents then look at who their children are siding with and the outcome for children is very bad.  We must look at some of the other models.  I used to work formerly with the European Commission and I have close friends who are involved, but I am not an expert on the legal side.  However, I have seen what they do in some of the Nordic countries.  They have no fault divorce systems and mediation is enforced.  Parents can separate after six months and divorce after six months if both consent.  That has a huge benefit for children.  Can one imagine the outcome where differing divorcing parents actually co-operate with each other?  I am not saying they are going to be the best of friends afterwards, but they actually co-operate together in the upbringing of their children.  They work out the finances and maintenance through a mediation process.  If that is motivated, a number of people here would not have to go through the four to five years minimum of litigation, which is vitriolic.  I have to say straight out that the only winners are the barristers and solicitors.  None of the children benefits from this.  The models they use in the Nordic country should be looked at.  If there is going to be reform, moneys have to be ring-fenced.  Lots of these families lose huge amounts of money.  They are torn apart and their assets are stripped.  The whole issue is the custody and asset stripping battle.  What is worse, as has already been mentioned, is that there is inconsistency in a lot of the judgments.  I cannot understand this.  If there are legal requirements to deliver for the welfare of the children, why do people and barristers play to judges?  They know they might get a better result with one judge than another.  They all know these games internally.  I have witnessed it myself.  I recommend strongly the models used in some of the Scandinavian countries where mediation can lead to non-vitriolic and non-advarsarial results and protect children.  Children's rights are never looked at in these cases.

Mediation is considered best when it is voluntary.  Mediation is not suitable for every particular case that might present.

Doing something such as removing civil legal aid as a penalty for not engaging in mediation would be a disproportionate response in that case.  It might be better to examine making mediation more accessible.  There is some research on the provision of mediation services in Canada where it is available on site in the courts.  In that situation, while people might be waiting to enter a court hearing, they are encouraged to engage in mediation processes because they have nothing to lose.

It was intended that there would have been a referendum in either 2014 or 2015.<\/p> <p>  The initial proposal was that it would be presided over exclusively by a dedicated Judiciary that was specialised and expert in family law.  Much depends on the type of system we are going to consider.  Is it going to be a system separate to other areas of the law?  We have a specialised Commercial Court, for example.

It is not desirable for the parties involved, for the children or for the early resolution of matters.  It causes huge delays as judges try to grapple with the unrepresented litigant appearing before them.  There is a real need for the family law court system to be resourced and for the courts system itself to be resourced.  The courts system is predicated on the basis that someone will be represented.

It may then help the children because a separation could be agreed and a divorce could be granted much more quickly.  The timeline under the divorce legislation will have to be reduced.  Cutting out the minimum of four years will be hugely beneficial to children because the acrimony in the family is dreadful.  In other areas, where matters must go to litigation, it should be fair.  If one considers someone who can afford very expensive barristers as opposed to someone who cannot afford any, there must be the same legal process.  Lay litigants do not have much of a chance.  They enter into an area where they have no experience at all, they have no information, they do not know the procedures and they just get annihilated.  In some cases, judges do not even give them time for a hearing.  I agree with what has been stated to date and there must be better information, but it is complicated.  There are so many weaknesses.

Our research is to clarify that we do not have one childcare proceeding model.  We have a continuum of proceedings some of which are highly adversarial, some are a bit of a hybrid model and some tend more towards the inquisitorial model.  We just need to make a decision.<\/p> <p>  There is a great opportunity in the ongoing review of the Child Care Act 1991 in the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.

I can understand why certain proceedings need to be highly adversarial when facts are contested.  However, for the majority of cases we need to have some form of process that has alternative dispute resolutions where communication is clear.<\/p> <p>  The solicitors and social workers we interviewed were concerned about the damaged relationships between Tusla, social workers and parents when the process becomes highly adversarial.  Social workers are working to support families over a long period, building those relationships.  If a child needs to be removed or there is a question over a child needing to be removed and if that ends in a very adversarial process, those relationships are damaged very quickly because an adversarial process is about testing the evidence.  The evidence from the people we have interviewed so far is that that may not be the best way to go.  The children get lost in that and it becomes a matter of who wins, which cannot be good.  We need to pause.  At a minimum we cannot have many different systems; we must have one system.  In whatever we decide, it must be child and parent friendly.

Dr. Shannon referred to experts in the area of child attachment, development, abuse and so on and indicated that advice could be provided to the judges appointed to deal with these cases.  Will he expand on how that might work?  Would it involve experts sitting down with families in order to put together reports or talking with judges?  How would that be developed more practically?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019031300002#N00400","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1552467600,"counter":902,"content":"<p>That is a fundamental question and I am very supportive of the Deputy's vision.  I support the comments on the Scandinavian system because it builds its infrastructure around children.  In this jurisdiction, we build our structures around adults and available services.  That is a fundamental shift.  I urge this committee to focus on that structural reform.  We have been very progressive in introducing new legislation but that new legislation will be of very little benefit unless we have the proper structures.  We are missing those structures.  In 1996, this issue was reviewed and led by former Chief Justice, Ms Susan Denham.  It goes back further than that, to 1975.  How many generations of children have grown up since we first started debating this issue?  Deputy O'Callaghan asked if we need constitutional change.  For a modest change, we do not.  For ambitious change, however, prudence makes me suggest that we need constitutional change.<\/p> <p>  On the question about hearing the voice of the child, it is a cultural issue too, and a question of how we can ensure that everybody agrees that it is important that those most affected by our decisions are consulted on those decisions.  That is my starting point.  The next question is how we do it.  I recall, in 2007, being asked about that by an international judge at the Anglophone-Germanophone conference which was held in Dublin at the time.  I stated that it would be difficult.  My vision would be to have stand-alone legislation on what one should do when a child appears in front of a court.  I have had some direct experience in hearing directly from children and it is very challenging.  A number of disciplines need to be involved to support judges to hear the voice of the child.  Neither judges nor lawyers have specific training in this regard.  When I referred to interdisciplinary work, I meant that no one discipline should have an exclusive preserve on this area, and if we are really committed to hearing the voice of the child, we need a set of protocols for how we achieve this.  It will depend on the situation.  It will be different in a private family law context but is nonetheless very important because divorce comes as a significant shock for children and usually causes an emotional crisis akin to a bereavement.  How do we ensure that children are heard?  It will be different in the child abuse context, where there is a power imbalance.  It is a complicated project and requires a lot of skill in drafting legislation.<\/p> <p>  We should have overarching legislation where a number of disciplines sit down and look at how we ensure that the voice, welfare and best interests of the child are front and centre in our decision-making, introduce that legislation and have training for the Judiciary.  In fairness, the District Court is now undertaking regular training.  I have been asked to speak on some of these issues at its full-day conference on Saturday week.  I will look at how the new domestic violence legislation will be implemented.  Historically, our approach has been that we introduce legislation and it is left there.  I suggest that a range of disciplines should come together.  We should have this new, overarching legislation.  Guidelines should be drafted for hearing the voice of the child.  There will be multiple methods.  We need to equip decision makers to be able to select the best method appropriate to the child.  I hope that has been helpful.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019031300002#N00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Geoffrey Shannon"},{"type":"speech","time":1552467600,"counter":903,"content":"<p>It is.  For our report, we would look to suggest something radical because the problem here has been that, exactly as Dr. Shannon says, this has been debated for decades.  Many good recommendations have been made but there has been no implementation of them.  People either did not bother with them, could not care less or it is part of a deeper cultural problem, which is the direction in which I am heading now.  If we stood everything on its head and looked at things from a child's perspective, it would simplify many other matters.  It feeds into the discussions we have had about custody arrangements and how a 50-50 divide is available only in 1% of cases.  How much of that is linked to cultural issues?<\/p> <p>  I think Mr. Drakeford said that women expect to get the house and the kids.  I do not think it is that at all but that we need to address the structural barriers that exist before couples break up, not just after they break up.  The reality is that many women have lower wages and are the primary caregiver, or perhaps judges perceive them as being the primary caregivers.  It is much more normal for women to work fewer hours and so on.  Unless we address all of those issues, we cannot really talk about shared parenting.  At our meeting last week, Mr. Damien Peelo referred to shared parenting and stated that it is not equal parenting.  He indicated that we need to move away from guardianship and custody to parental responsibility, day-to-day contact, etc.<\/p><p>Much of the culture or the practical issues must, presumably, feed into judges' decision-making.

At the time, the reason proffered for not progressing along those lines was that it might require more ambitious constitutional change.  When it comes to our family court structures, we have been talking about this since 1975.  The time is right now for fundamental structural change in order to ensure that we have a system which meets the needs of every citizen in this jurisdiction.  Rather than trying to create a system that will not require constitutional change, I would much prefer to see being put to the people a constitutional proposal that would allow us to be very ambitious in any new family court structure we might establish rather than having a system that we are required to create, having regard to constitutional constraints.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019031300002#O00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Geoffrey Shannon"},{"type":"speech","time":1552467600,"counter":906,"content":"<p>I will bring Mr. Drakeford in but I suspect that Deputy Clare Daly was moving along the line of witnesses and has some questions for him in any event.

That money is ring-fenced and everything else is split.  If outrageous claims are not available through the courts, then people might not have the incentive to go to the courts in the first instance and may be prepared to try mediation.  It may encourage and motivate people to move in that direction rather than down the litigation route.  I personally know people from both of those countries who have reached satisfactory outcomes within six to nine months.  It is a model that needs to be the subject of serious consideration.  If we are going to reform the system, we must encourage mediation.  It will not work for every case but if there is nothing to be gained by going through the courts then people will not necessarily engage expensive barristers and solicitors in order to try to seize assets or demand custody, when they do not necessarily deserve them, from the other partner.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019031300002#O00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Drakeford"},{"type":"speech","time":1552467600,"counter":908,"content":"<p>I have a couple of concluding points.

What we need is a robust case management system so that every case that comes into the system is dealt with within a reasonable period.  I very much support Mr. Burns' view that a process as important as adoption cannot be dealt with in such a tight timescale.

What happened in England and Wales is that the authorities wanted to reduce the average wait from 52 weeks to a maximum of 26 but it was also part of the introduction of a pre-proceedings process.  The aim of that process was to take some of the discussions out of the court setting.  What they found was that they managed to reduce the wait in about 60% of cases and to reach decisions in a timely fashion, which is what Dr. Shannon was talking about.  However, the unintended consequence was that some of the orders that were given were different from what was expected.  The point is that when we consider changes, we can learn from other jurisdictions in terms of what they have done.  Other jurisdictions have made fairly fundamental changes from which we can learn.  Furthermore, evidence is starting to emerge that unintended and unexpected consequences can arise from those changes.  In England and Wales, they did something that had unexpected and unintended results.  There was a reduction in the number of care orders and some of the cases ended up in special guardianship orders, for example, but that was not what was intended.  One of the key messages in terms of timelines, which should be up for discussion, is the number of judges available.  As FLAC pointed out, the number of available judges needs to be higher.  There is no point setting deadlines without dealing with the availability of judges.<\/p> <p>  The broader question about guidelines is that if they provide that a decision must be made within X amount of time, they cannot be so rigid that exceptional cases, particularly adoption cases and other contested cases, are squeezed into an artificial deadline.  It is nice to have benchmark and it is good to aim for that benchmark but it should not be an absolute.

This issue was front and centre of the debate when the legislation was being discussed.  A commitment was given at the time on having a register of guardians.  It would be a hugely important document because guardianship is the gateway to so many other rights.  This was to be reviewed.  There needs to be an examination of how we can ensure parents who have direct involvement in children's lives get the legal rights commensurate with their involvement.  Rights should equal responsibilities.  It needs to be scoped out and I am reluctant to make a definitive statement today.  It is worthy of exploration.  It should be viewed in two stages.<\/p> <p>  I support Treoir's recommendation on having a register of guardians.  What happens if people agree to be guardians but lose the hugely important form?  If we had a register of guardians they could access it.  It is a very substantial right that is the gateway to custody and access.  I suggest if the committee were disposed to making a recommendation on guardianship perhaps the starting point might be on the register of guardians, which was hotly debated at the time of the Children and Family Relationships Act, and then scope out the options available for enhanced guardianship rights.  There is some legitimacy in the arguments being advanced that we need to look at this issue and the different roles we all play in raising children.  If we had a system built around children we would not be getting exercised about guardianship issues, we would be getting exercised about ensuring that the parents looking after the child have the legal rights to ensure it happens.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019031300002#Q00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Geoffrey Shannon"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1552467600,"counter":934,"content":"<p>We do not have a definitive view on this.

My contribution on this will be of a personal nature as somebody who had to apply for a form to get guardianship of my own child.  It was a source of curiosity that the lawyer had never dealt with the form before and did not know what to do with it.  There was no register, which meant I was worried about losing the document.  I see the merits of a register and why it would be very important.  I grew up in a generation when it was socially possible and not culturally reprehensible to have children outside of marriage and we now have a plurality of family forms.  We have been very successful as a nation in trying to recognise them.<\/p> <p>  The fathers I know who are not married do not know the minutiae of what they are entitled to and, in particular, they do not know about guardianship.  Most of them did not know they were not automatically guardians of their children and were somewhat worried about the process of how to go about it.  The 2015 Act made some progress but I understand there is a lot of confusion among men about how to go about receiving full guardianship if they are actively involved in the day to day care of their child, whether they live with the child or not.  Progress on this is required.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019031300002#Q00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Kenneth Burns"},{"type":"speech","time":1552467600,"counter":936,"content":"<p>My next question is for Dr. Shannon.  It relates to properly implementing Article 42A of the Constitution and giving effect to the provision on the voice of the child.  In the discussion we had with Dr. Conor O'Mahony a number of weeks ago he identified three difficulties and I hope I do them justice.  The first is where an expert is not appointed and the lack of clarity as to what should happen in these circumstances.  The second is there is not a lot of clarity around determining whether a child has the capacity to have his or her voice heard.  The third is where an expert is to be appointed but the parties cannot pay for it.  Does this concur with Dr. Shannon's analysis?  That being the case, is the first of the three the primary difficulty?  Is it the most substantial problem?  Are all three of equal weight?  Are there other issues?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019031300002#Q00700","speaker":"1287"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1552467600,"counter":937,"content":"<p>I would say all three are of equal weight.  It is important that some person has the standing to ensure the child's voice and welfare are front and centre when a court comes to make a decision.  This touches on the second issue, which is capacity.  It is my view that if a child is capable of articulating his or her views the best person to articulate those views is the child.  Sometimes we have a tendency to overly professionalise the system.  My experience of hearing children directly has been that children want to be heard by the decision maker.  They feel empowered by being heard.  What we then need to do is provide them with the supports to ensure this occurs.  I read Dr. O'Mahony's evidence and I support the view there is a problem with the funding.  My solution to this is to have a national system for funding all representatives of children, be they in public or private law proceedings.<\/p><p>If one considers the Children and Family Relationships Act and if one considers sections 31 and 32 of that Act, the funding can fall on the shoulders of the applicants.  If the constitutional aspiration is to ensure the voice of the child is heard, there is nothing in the constitutional aspiration that refers to having regard to the resources of the parent.  It is an access to justice issue because if we are committed to hearing the voice of a child, we should have a national system for ensuring that children are heard in all proceedings affecting them.  The overarching requirement is set out in Article 12 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, which states that the child should to be heard, having regard to the age and maturity of the child in all judicial and administrative proceedings.  That is why I believe we should have a national body such as the guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>service in the North.<br\/><br\/>I welcome the developments by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, and this is being scoped out currently in terms of the childcare (amendment) Bill, but I suggest it is equally important in divorce cases.  Sometimes we see children as bystanders in the divorce process.  Children are hugely affected by divorce and they need to be supported through that process.  Whether it is public or private law proceedings, my view is that it is a question not just of having the expert but ensuring that the vulnerable parents are not burdened with the cost of that expert at a very traumatic time in their lives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019031300002#Q00800","nonspeaker":"Dr. Geoffrey Shannon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1552467600,"counter":939,"content":"<p>I have a question on a related issue which I might address to the panel as a whole if anyone wants to speak about it.

I wholeheartedly agree with that and I suggest that one of our recommendations should be that civil legal aid, particularly as it pertains to this area, be much better funded.<\/p> <p>  I am not very familiar with the point about the unbundling of legal services.  If I understand it correctly, and I may not, it means that an applicant can do what might be regarded as the more simple administrative work and where a complex argument has been made in the proceedings, a lawyer might make that case.  It is something like that.  Perhaps that point might be elaborated upon.<\/p> <p>  There is a good deal of information in the proposals, some of which is very straightforward and sensible and well worth taking on board.  I want to get FLAC's perspective on that.  Is this a case of FLAC being pragmatic in saying that in advance of a much-improved civil legal aid budget, we could do these quick fixes as well or are they complementary?  Is this an interim measure that is absolutely needed or would FLAC rather see proper legal representation that is well funded to ensure that some of this might not be necessary?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019031300002#R01000","speaker":"1287"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1552467600,"counter":948,"content":"<p>There was an initiative in Canada on the unbundling of legal services and a good deal of research done by Professor Julie Macfarlane.

In the interim, on the way to achieving that larger goal, we recognise that there is a major budgetary issue in that regard and that much analysis needs to be done in terms of deciding the scope of what is actually needed to provide the level of funding required.  We would like to see those additional mechanisms put in place.  We do not see them necessarily as a replacement for providing people with both advice and representation but it is something that could be examined on the way to getting to that point.

In the absence of journalists covering the cases, court reporting and research make up the other part of the solution.  While Dr. Coulter's research is funded, very little other research is.  Some research receives small to moderate funding.  It is largely independent.  Money could be provided through the Irish Research Council, which could put out a call for applications.  There may be other ways in which one could go about it.  Dr. Coulter has been very effective in her use of the media to tell the story of the proceedings.  On that level, it might be duplication to pursue this area.  It may be the case that we need to find ways to help the story be told in different ways.
