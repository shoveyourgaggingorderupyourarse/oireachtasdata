There has been much talk over the past number of months about the need to support small business in particular and the talk has been encouraging from all sides.  We now have a Government in place.  Indeed, it was remiss of me not to wish the Government well and wish the Minister of State, Deputy English, who is with us this morning, and all his colleagues well and Godspeed in their very difficult job in the months ahead.<\/p><p>I have concerns about the finance initiatives.  Indeed, the Minister of State will have seen the various business organisations, in particular ISME, Chambers Ireland, IBEC and others, state that it encourages borrowing that is arguably extremely dangerous at this time.  There is no question but that many businesses have been effectively wiped out and have their doors closed throughout this period.  That has had an enormous impact on our society and economy and on employment and so on.  However, when we say to people who are already on the rack that we are going to enable them to borrow, that is not a good precedent to set.  The other aspect of this is that the way we underwrite these loans and the way the SBCI money in particular is distributed is through our existing bank base.  As we learned to our expense and to much frustration across political parties and indeed society, the banks' focus is on the bottom line.  They must be profitable.<\/p><p>We have moneys being made available to us at, I think, a minus percentage rate but by the time that gets to an SME farmer, shopkeeper, fisherman or carpenter, quite a number of percentage points have been added on, effectively to give profits to banks which are already profitable.  It is sort of a three-card trick to say &quot;live horse and you will get grass&quot;.  We know businesses have been wiped out this year.  In particular in the tourism and hospitality world, even if everything was opened up, consumer sentiment is not such that those businesses would be in a position to recoup the losses they have had or to make their business model work with lowered capacity and turnover levels and the reduction in profitability that is going result from that.<\/p><p>I would have much preferred Ireland, as a State, replicate the proven models that were introduced in the past, such as the Agricultural Credit Corporation, ACC, for funding agriculture and farming activity and the Industrial Credit Corporation, ICC, for funding industrial and commercial activity.  Instead we have allowed the pillar banks to do this.  As I said, the pillar banks, even when we had public interest directors on their boards, were in a position to serve only their shareholders whose only <i>modus operandi<\/i>, MO, is profitability.  That is good for them but, as a State, it is wrong that we are facilitating that.  What would have been much better is 20 to 25 good underwriters with a State institution lending to them.  Instead we have this bureaucratic group of levels, through Microfinance Ireland, SBCI, the Department, the pillar banks and the underwriters.  Eventually the punter gets to borrow money at 4% or 5%, which carries a very substantial premium over the amount we, as a country, are getting the money for.  What we are doing is getting peace of mind politically by thinking we are facilitating and supporting small enterprise when the truth is that all this is really doing is enabling the better-heeled to get on while ensuring those who genuinely need support hit the wall.  This is a big concern for me because we are encouraging people to strangle themselves with debt in what is already a desperate situation for most.<\/p><p>I represent the constituency of Sligo-North Leitrim.  We are responsible for parts of south County Donegal and north County Roscommon.  It is a part of the country where only two sectors really contribute in a major way to our society.  That is not to take away from all the others, but obviously tourism and hospitality and agriculture are our two major pursuits.  While wishing the Minister of State and all of our colleagues well and Godspeed in the months ahead, I hope their focus can be on that.  It is a little bit disheartening that tourism, for example, is buried in a Department with other things.  Many tourism operators have reached out and made contact with, I am sure, all Members in constituencies where it is a vital component of economic activity to protest that no measures have come forward, other than to strangle themselves with debt while we make the banks more profitable.  Other than that they are on their own.  Through media briefings it is becoming evident from officials, politicians, Ministers or whoever that some businesses may not survive, so in many ways we are throwing in the towel already.<\/p><p>If one looks at the measures introduced to support business in France, on commercial rents it has what I think is called the 40:40:20 scheme where the state picked up around 40% of the commercial rent.<\/p> <p>The landlord would take a 20% reduction and the tenant would pay 40%.  We did not nothing like that.  Many people are already strangled by having to pay commercial rents to landlords with mortgage commitments and they have found themselves in a position where they just cannot afford to reopen.  The business models of caf&eacute;s, restaurants, bars and hotels operated based on 60% to 80% occupancy and they are now operating at 25% with social distancing rules and so on.  We use terminology such as \"helicopter money\" or \"direct financing\" and the &euro;1 trillion in loans and direct grants announced at a higher level in Brussels was welcome, but we are not seeing that in the direct grants here.  People can borrow and we are adding a number of percentage points for handling fees or whatever we are calling them in order to be profitable, but the reality is we are not getting the hard cash to the people who need it to help them survive this.  That is what is needed.<\/p> <p> Covid is probably going to be around for many years and a loan is not going to cut it.  We are going to have to directly finance and support businesses.  While I will obviously not be voting against the legislation, if this is the whole picture we are going nowhere.  It is designed to facilitate the better heeled to borrow and expand but the average Joe SME does not have a prayer of getting this kind of money.  In order to get the Brexit loan, which is more or less what the Covid one was based on, the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, was asked to define a business plan that was visionary and reinvented the wheel, for want of a better expression.  That is just not acceptable because before Covid all or many of these businesses were profitable and were in a position to make money.  More importantly, they were in a position to create employment.  We had high employment numbers and while many of us would like to see those people being paid more, they were nevertheless employed.  I appreciate that this is part of a picture.  However, I would much prefer if the State moved back to the ACC Bank and ICC Bank model where we had direct control, were not looking at profitability and were supporting the sectors and industries that required it.  This is a start but it is not remotely the sort of start I would have hoped for.  I hope we start stripping out all the bureaucracy, the handling fees and the need to make our pillar banks more profitable than they already are and get with the programme.  We need to simplify this and ask how to get money to the people who need it fast, in order to that they can generate economic activity and create jobs.  Please God, there might be a little bit of profitability for those people in due course, although that is not a word many businesses will be able to countenance in the year or two ahead.<\/p> <p> While this is not directly related to microfinance, it relates to having the financial resources to support businesses in other ways.  The D&aacute;il sitting here in the Convention Centre is an abject waste of taxpayers' money.  In Leinster House, each of us has our self-incubation unit with a monitor in front of us to watch proceedings and with some will and just a pinch of imagination, we could have a fully functional Oireachtas on the campus where it was intended to be rather than needlessly wasting &euro;25,000 a day down here.  We have all the facilities required and if we just employed that pinch of imagination, we could all be back up on Kildare Street doing our work as people expect.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070800003#A00700","speaker":"1606","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1594201200,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I will raise a number of points.  Everybody is supporting this legislation and it is vital to ensure microenterprises can continue to work, or to put in place the resources for them to continue to work in the current climate.  However, we need to consider why we have arrived at this position.  Due to the length of time it has taken to form a Government, legislation could not be passed during that period.  While it may be unusual that the coronavirus and the general election clashed together to make this happen, as a body politic we have to look at how our Constitution impacts on this matter as well.  The Constitution was written at a time when we had two and a half parties in the State.  In 1937, it was envisaged that Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael would interchange, with one out of power and one in power and that party would go straight into government.  The reality is that does not happen any more and that is the case right across Europe.  It is not unique to Ireland or anywhere else.  Time will be taken after all elections for negotiations to take place and parties to come together to form a Government.  We have to recognise that.  I call on the Government to look at this issue and the constitutional requirements involved.  We will probably have to have a referendum, so that will need to be looked at.  We do not want to have the same problem after the next general election where urgent legislation may be required but we have to wait until the formation of a Government.  A way can be found to ensure talks on the formation of a Government can take place and that government can function in the interim period.  That needs to be considered and I ask the Government to look at that because it is vitally important.<\/p>  <p>  The Microenterprise Loan Fund (Amendment) Bill 2020 is obviously very welcome.  I have listened to the contributions over the last few days about the interest rates charged on the loans that have been granted and it sticks in one's craw to see interest rates of 5.5% or 6.5% being charged when normal interest rates are around 0.5% or 1%.  That is a barrier.  I would like to see information about how big a barrier it is because I imagine if I was in business and was going down the tubes, if I could get money at 5.5% I might take it to keep myself going.  One might not decide to do that but it is definitely something one would have to consider.  There may be many other issues around why there is such a poor uptake of this loan.  Based on the Microfinance Ireland website, at first glance it appears to be successful.  So far, 3,169 loans have been approved which are protecting 8,020 jobs.  That is very welcome.  However, there are 249,000 microenterprises in this State, which have all been affected by the Covid crisis and one would imagine that the demand, intensity and need for finance to keep going would increase.  While I know there has been a lacuna period during which loans could not be granted, the number of loans received from Microfinance Ireland represents 0.012% of microenterprises in the country.  That is extremely low and I wonder if this Bill had been passed and the money had been in place in time, whether that figure would be significantly higher.  We should be expecting 15% to 25% of businesses to be applying for and getting loans.<\/p>  <p>  The loans also need to be looked at further because of the amount of information required, the work that has to be done and the cost involved in getting the loan and providing all the paperwork that is needed.  That must be looked at and addressed.  I would like to see a report on what the barriers are for businesses in attracting loans.<\/p> <p>I believe that small or microenterprises are the key to all of our constituencies throughout the country.  There is a huge amount of employment among them.  A huge number of people working in microenterprises struggle at the best of times and probably need this support.<\/p> <p> I will support the legislation but it needs to be looked at and evaluated over time with regard to what the actual barriers are.  The interest rate is probably one of the barriers and perhaps the publicity it has received has prevented people from looking to access the funding but there are an awful lot more barriers in place.  Many small businesses do not have the level of paperwork required to consider the loan.  There is also an item with regard to de minimis aid and whether an enterprise has received previous supports.  I do not know what impact this has on the ability of Microfinance Ireland to lend to a small business but perhaps it is a barrier that prevents businesses from going further with an application.  All of this needs to be looked at.  The number of businesses applying to the fund needs to be increased significantly for it to have a genuine impact.<\/p> <p> As an aside, I was looking at the criteria for qualifying for the loan and it is interesting to see that illegal economic activities are barred.  I wonder why this even had to be included among the criteria.  It is good that they are barred but I wonder why it has to be there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070800004#B00200","speaker":"1547","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1594201800,"counter":16,"content":"<p>I would not want to have vertigo up here; there is a pretty steep fall.  I wish the Minister of State, Deputy English, the best of luck in his new role.  I know he relishes a challenge and I sincerely wish him the very best of luck and I look forward to working with him.  I had expected the T&aacute;naiste to be here.  The first time I met the T&aacute;naiste was in Kinsale prior to the election and I photobombed him for the purposes of getting a bit of publicity.  It seems to have worked.  We were standing in Kinsale, which is part of my constituency, and it was clear to see what a vibrant town it is.  The success of Kinsale and other such towns is built on small, medium and micro enterprises, such as cafes, restaurants, beautiful bookshops and boutiques.  Directly across the road from where we stood my first cousin has a flower shop.  All of these small businesses are the heartbeat and backbone of what makes a town such as Kinsale work.<\/p>  <p>  I am not sure whether the Minister of State, Deputy English, has visited that neck of the woods but these are exactly the type of businesses, towns and streets that we are looking to protect.  When Covid is done and dusted and when we are finished, we need to be able to go back to towns such as Kinsale and ensure the doors of these businesses are still open. The microenterprise fund will play a vital role in this if we structure and administer it properly.  The same could be said for towns such as Bantry, Bandon, Skibbereen, Dunmanway, Schull, Castletownbere and my hometown of Clonakilty.<\/p>  <p>  Recently, I opened my constituency office on Ashe Street in Clonakilty, which is a gem of a street.  It is not only picturesque but the businesses there are very innovative and creative.  There are all different types of businesses.  When I set up my office the first knocks on my door were not from constituents looking for issues to be addressed but the other neighbouring businesses and local businesses welcoming me to the street with open arms.  This demonstrates the tight knit network of businesses in our towns and regional areas, including clothes shops, boutiques and other retail, and how they all look out for and support each other.<\/p>  <p>  One of the specific remits of the Minister of State will be retail.  These are the types of businesses we need to look after.  We are all shouting about hospitality, restaurants and cafes, and we need to do so, but retail also plays an important role.  They are all looking out for each other.  Unfortunately, within a few weeks of setting up my office we had one of the first casualties of Covid as one of the businesses on the street shut its stores for the last time.  The entire community on Ashe Street was heartbroken.  The people were devastated because they had become very close and they had seen one of their friends close down.  We can sense the worry and concern among the businesses on Ashe Street.  They will bounce back and I am absolutely sure that somebody else will move into that premises but we need to do everything within our power to allay their concerns and make sure that these clothes shops, fashion shops, boutiques, cafes and restaurants can keep their doors open and are still there when we get a vaccine and can return to some type of normality.  I am trying to demonstrate the importance of these microenterprises that employ fewer than ten people and I know the Minister of State is familiar with it.  There are the backbone of our communities, towns and streets.<\/p>  <p>  It is important that I take this time and opportunity to mention hospitality.  Town such as Kinsale and Clonakilty would not have retail industries if it was not for footfall.  This is where we need to come in strongly with the July stimulus.  The VAT rate has to be reduced.  There have been repeated calls for this and I want to reiterate them.<\/p>  <p>  The wage subsidy scheme has been an absolute lifesaver for these industries.  I am speaking in particular about hotels.  Perhaps they do not fit into the microenterprise category but it is important that we speak about how important the wage subsidy scheme has been for them to keep going.  I was speaking to a hotelier this morning and they simply would not have their doors open if it was not for the wage subsidy scheme.  We need to extend it and we need to prepare, unfortunately, for the potential of a second wave so that we do not leave businesses high and dry.  We must be prepared and be in a position to extend the wage subsidy scheme if there is a second wave.<\/p>  <p>  Bigger industries will have to apply for the working capital loan.  As is the case with the microenterprise fund, there is great difficulty and businesses are finding it hard to stomach and swallow the fact they are dealing with 4% or 5% interest rates when they know that in Europe and internationally we are looking at zero or negative interest loans.  We need to pass on the zero interest rate of which we are able to avail to the small and medium enterprises.  I would like to ask the Minister of State whether there is any way the interest rates can be examined in terms of how the microenterprise loan is administered.<\/p>  <p>  There is not just tourism in west Cork and we also have vital farming and fishing industries.  They need to be facilitated through the microenterprise loan fund because there is an opportunity for them to obtain some relief.  They are facing similar difficulties.<\/p>  <p>  I also want to mention briefly the event sector because I hope to get an opportunity to contribute to tomorrow's debate on this.  We all love going to gigs and I am sure that in the room where we are standing there have been some incredible and exhilarating gigs and events and we have all been to gigs just up the road in the 3Arena.  It is not exclusive to Dublin.  Where I am from in west Cork is the second rock and roll capital of Ireland.  We have amazing venues such as De Barra's music venue and Levis's in the small village of Ballydehob, which has hosted some of the biggest names in the world.  These venues are all incredibly nervous and on edge.  They are not sure what the future holds.<\/p> <p>They have contacted many of us with a list of their wishes.  I will take the opportunity to read these out in order that we can take note of them because they fit into the microenterprise bracket of employers of fewer than ten people.<\/p> <p> They are looking for the Covid payment and wage subsidy scheme to continue for events and arts workers - that is very important - at least until mass gatherings can reconvene, which may be some way off, if we are to be honest.  They are looking for business grant support of 20% of the 2018 turnover for SMEs and events and arts sector workers.  They are looking for bank loan and lease payment holidays to continue.  They are looking for their insurance policies to be re-evaluated.  That is very important because, obviously, with events not going ahead the risks are much lower, so that needs to be re-evaluated.  Rent assistance and funding of an industry assistance programme to cater for mental health and well-being are incredibly important.  Since this pandemic the arts community has really come together to look after one another's mental health, but there needs to be a properly funded programme for that.  Reduction of the VAT rate needs to be seriously considered for arts and events workers.  They refer to a break on commercial rates, and the recipients of the Covid payment to be eligible for other welfare supports, such as rent allowance.<\/p> <p> This is the first time in history, to my knowledge, that the arts and events industry has been through this, so we need to be there for those in the industry until mass gatherings can recommence.  I will elaborate on this again tomorrow.<\/p> <p> Every avenue over-66s look down, every corner they turn around, they face brick walls.  They have been excluded from the PUP and cannot apply for the restart grant if they are not ratepayers.  Bed and breakfast owners are a good example of this.  They are excluded from the enterprise grant because the &euro;1,000 grant is available only to those coming off the PUP, but they could never avail of the PUP.  Furthermore, they may not necessarily apply for loans such as this, so we need to make them eligible for the restart grant.<\/p> <p> I was talking to a local LEO company recently.  Microfinance Ireland has been in touch to say the money has gone.  That re-enforces the importance of passing this legislation.  Microfinance Ireland is telling the LEOs to stop sending businesses to it until more funding comes.  The interest rate, as I have already said, needs to be looked at.  Finally, there is approximately a 60% or 70% approval rating, from what I can gather.  Is there a way we can increase that approval rating?<\/p> <p> I thank the Minister of State for listening.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070800005#C00200","speaker":"1545","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1594202400,"counter":18,"content":"<p>This is a straightforward Bill.  We are talking about cash flow and working capital for businesses.  We all welcome this legislation and see its necessity.  We all come from places that are absolutely reliant on SMEs and microenterprises.  These are the people we know in the community who provide employment to other people in the community.  I do not need to go into the domestic and global hit that businesses and we as a society have taken.  We need to ensure we can come out of this, and the only way we can do so is by supporting those businesses that were viable before the pandemic.  Some people and businesses were dealing with difficulties beforehand.  As some other Deputies have stated, a solution will never be found in a banking sector that is utterly reliant on profit.  That is fair enough from a business point of view, but the sector is not able or willing to do what we need it to do at this point.<\/p>  <p>  We have had difficulties with the restart grant.  A number of people could not qualify on the basis that they have not paid rates.  A significant number of people found the grant was not sufficient to get them back up and running because it was based on the rates they had paid.  While we have had some solutions for people who are self-employed, there are still difficulties.  It is straightforward: the money is just not enough for the businesses to wash their faces.<\/p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in has tabled an amendment to this legislation to deal with microfinance loans but, really, the power lies with the Minister of State, Deputy English, the T&aacute;naiste and the Government.  It comes down to the fact that it is about interest rates.  Many have already mentioned this.  We are talking about people sometimes having to pay interest rates of 4.5% or 5.5% or sometimes higher.  People at times have to go to loan sharks and are charged extortionate rates.  The fact is that if people need to get money to keep their businesses going, they will be willing to do that, but it is not the support they need.  We definitely need to look at grant aid for specific businesses.  If we can draw down loans from Europe at a negative interest rate, and if we are now looking at the possibility of a Europe-wide recovery and fiscal stimulus, we need to ensure we can get adequate and fair access to such moneys and provide them to businesses as they need.  Some of that will be grant aid.  Many businesses will not be able to reopen.  They are caught in certain situations.  I think other Deputies mentioned the fact that we have people in the arts sector looking at no possibility they will be able to operate major gigs or anything like that in the near future, so we will have to have bespoke solutions.<\/p>  <p>  The big thing is that we need to ensure we are able to give people interest rates as close as possible to 0%.  We need to ensure that the risk assessment is streamlined, particularly when we are talking about businesses that were viable beforehand, so we can foresee that these businesses will be viable into the future.  We have to protect them now.  It will be a lot more costly if we let these businesses go to the wall, if we do not introduce a stimulus and if we do not catch them before they fall.  It will cost a hell of a lot more to create new jobs and put new businesses in place.  If we do not pay to keep these businesses open, we will pay through social protection payments and other costs.  That is before we even talk about the societal damage that letting them fail may cause.<\/p>  <p>  I spoke last night to a woman who spoke about making an application.  In fairness, I think people will only commend the local enterprise offices and the work they have done.  She said, however, that while the repurposed Brexit loans were welcome, when she tried to apply she found that the payback mechanisms and interest rates were a lot worse than when she just went and found her own credit through banks, which is far from perfect.  A huge amount of her cost is from a small hairdressing business.  In fairness to her, she carried out works on it from the point of view of being able to operate best practice as regards physical distancing.  This was combined with the added cost she has of ensuring that everybody is healthy and maintains cleanliness, which is absolutely necessary for infection control.  Such people really need to be helped out.<\/p>  <p>  Throughout this island, this State, we have towns such as Dundalk and Drogheda that need this kind of support.  If we do not have it, a huge number of people will hit the wall, and the impact that that will have on all of us will be spectacular, so we need to stop it before it starts.  We need to streamline the risk assessment and ensure for loans such as this that we can give people interest rates of as close to 0% as is possible.  I am leaving this with the Minister of State, Deputy English, and the T&aacute;naiste.  They have the power to bring this to Cabinet.  We need to ensure it happens.  This is the reason more people have not applied for these loans.  There are other difficulties.  The fact is that this just needs streamlining.  It is as simple as that.  Combined with that, we need to ensure that the July stimulus programme contains an adequate response.<\/p>  <p>  We need to accept that different resources will be needed for different business sectors of society.  Some people will not be looking at full reopenings and will be looking only at partial work or no work into August, September, October and beyond.  We need to ensure they do not go to the wall.  These businesses are the people within our community who employ other people within our community.  We need to back them.  If we do not, we will be headed for something far worse even than what we dealt with back in 2007 and 2008 and right through what people term the age of austerity, which we certainly do not need to go back to.  What we need to do now is ensure we give people the working capital to operate the businesses that were viable beforehand and will be viable again.  We need to ensure that employment is maintained and that we can put our society back into action.<\/p> <p>If that requires that we get the proper resources and supports domestically and from Europe, that needs to be done.  We also need to tackle the other issues that have already been mentioned in relation to the insurance fiasco that businesses are dealing with and the fact that we need banks to play ball.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070800006#D00200","speaker":"1498","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1594203000,"counter":20,"content":"<p>I join my party colleagues in welcoming this Bill to the floor of the House and I express my support for the amendments tabled by Deputy O'Reilly.<\/p>  <p>  I will take this opportunity to raise the issue of SMEs in my home county of Clare.  Tourism is a large seasonal employer in County Clare, particularly in west Clare.  Many of these businesses are small, family-run operations and operate mainly in the summer months when the industry is at its busiest.  These businesses, along with many self-employed tradespersons, transportation companies and other microbusinesses, are struggling to cope as the country reopens post Covid-19.  As the Minister is aware, the tourism sector across the island has taken a major blow this year due to Covid-19 and the travel restrictions.  This has place between 6,000 and 8,000 seasonal jobs at risk in County Clare alone.  This and Monday's announcement that Shannon Airport is looking for redundancies and pay cuts among its staff, as well as the imminent closure of Moneypoint power station, have placed a dark grey cloud over the county.  Large-scale unemployment in the county is a real possibility.<\/p>  <p>  A recent survey carried out by Ennis Chamber of Commerce in the middle of the pandemic found some startling numbers for the SME sector in County Clare.  One of the major issues for businesses was the lack of support they were receiving from their insurance providers.  This will not be a surprise to this House as the matter has been raised on several occasions.  A total of 48% of respondents in the survey answered \"No\" when asked whether their insurance had been co-operative during the crisis.  That figure is just not good enough.  When asked to predict their losses going forward, 33% of respondents indicated their business losses would be between 25% and 50%, with a further 31% indicating the losses would be between 50% and 70%.<\/p>  <p>  I have been told stories of grant applications being refused because they came in an hour after the deadline on a Friday evening.  These SMEs have, in many cases, reduced their staffing costs to save money.  This often means that administrative staff are still on furlough and the business owner is working full days before having to head home to complete the paperwork later in the evening.  This is why these applications need to be simple and easy to access and complete.  They need to be free from red tape and they cannot have long processing times.  While it is welcome that Microfinance Ireland has been processing applications during this crisis, we need to ensure that this continues.  Loans provided via Microfinance Ireland are calculated on interest rates of between 5.5% and 6.5%.  How will this be of assistance to any SME facing major issues with cash flow?  It is astonishing.  Bank of Ireland, for example, is advertising loans to SMEs for a much better rate of 5.48% in some cases.  While these loans are seen to be an easier route to finance compared with the banks, these interest rates are not competitive.  For this reason, we must ensure the rates are kept as low as possible so these companies can afford to repay loans without taking on any more crippling finance they may not be able to afford down the line.  At a time when the Government can borrow at 0% interest and sometimes even at negative interest rates, it is time we used this access to low interest rates to pass this on to our SMEs at the most affordable rate possible.<\/p>  <p>  It is safe to say that this is a major difference of repayment amounts for a company that is already struggling to stay afloat.  In a small business, this could be the difference between rehiring a part-time student and not doing so.  As much as anyone else, students are dependent on these posts over the summer months to help support them over the college year.  This is yet another group that is forgotten about.  Canada, for example, announced at the end of April an emergency student benefit for students who have seen summer work dry up and do not qualify for their version of our pandemic unemployment payment, PUP.  While it was welcome that students with part-time jobs could qualify for the PUP, this does not cover all students.  While I acknowledge the T&aacute;naiste's comments on youth unemployment, we must ensure our young people do not get left behind as we re-image post Covid-19.<\/p>  <p>  Some self-employed persons, such as plumbers, carpenters and bus and taxi operators, found themselves out of work, many of them for the first time in their lives, and started to draw the PUP.  Now, as the country reopens, they are being offered small jobs here and there.  The problem for these people is that they must sign off the PUP if they take even one day's work.  Therefore, it is not practical for them to take such work.  Being self-employed means they are not entitled to claim casual jobseeker's payments which would allow them to sign off for the days they got work.<\/p>  <p>  With so many people out of work or on reduced wages or hours upon returning to work, there is significant hesitation about completing home improvement works.  For tradespeople, this reduced workload could continue for some time. These people are also being forgotten.  There are families contemplating whether it is a good or bad idea to sign off and take the risk.  They are worried what will happen at the end of all this when the PUP stops.  They have other halves who cannot go back to work because they do not have the childcare facilities available to them to do so should both need to work on the same day.  Many of these family-run companies have been around for years and many of them weathered the financial crisis of the 1980s and the crash of the Celtic tiger in 2008.  They have never experienced anything like the current uncertainty and the inability to know what will or will not happen.<\/p>  <p>  I also call on this Government to put in place a strong stimulus package to allow SMEs to bounce back post Covid-19.  This package needs to be bold and radical and needs to be something that will work.  These SMEs are the backbone of our economy.  Recent OECD reports suggest some 92% of businesses in this State have fewer than ten employees.  That clearly shows that microbusinesses are the heart of our economy.  Over 70% of our workforce is employed by SMEs.  If that does not show the need for a real stimulus package, I do not know what would.<\/p>  <p>  As discussed by my colleague, Deputy O'Reilly, when she spoke on the Bill yesterday, Sinn F&eacute;in proposes that repayments on these loans be paused for at least 12 months.  Businesses that were struggling with cash flow problems even before the onset of Covid-19 need these breaks if they are to be viable.  We need to follow countries like the UK, which is providing similar stimulus packages at more affordable rates of repayment.  We need to support these businesses, not cripple them with further debt as they try to reopen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070800007#E00200","speaker":"1520"},{"type":"speech","time":1594203000,"counter":21,"content":"<p>I congratulate the Minister and wish him well in his new role.  It is a great honour and responsibility.  Trying to get the balance right between saving lives and opening up the economy is going to be difficult and challenging, and we have to strike that balance.<\/p>  <p>  Microenterprises and SMEs have experienced shocks that are putting their very existence in doubt.  I heard John Moran on \"Morning Ireland\" last week or the week before say that &euro;6.5 billion of funding for SMEs was announced, but only &euro;100 million was drawn down.  As my colleague, Deputy O'Reilly, said yesterday, many of these supports are inaccessible.  Businesses have contacted me about the restart grant, which has been mentioned a number of times this morning and was mentioned in yesterday's debate.  In many cases, they were approved for these grants weeks ago but have still not heard anything.  This will soon become known as the Government of announcements because it makes announcement after announcement with very little delivery on these announcements.  This will undermine the July stimulus plan and the announcement made on that.<\/p>  <p>  I will give an example of an announcement on which there has been no delivery.  In early May, the then Minister announced a rates waiver for certain businesses, which would allow them to claim back the rates they had claimed over the same period last year.  Unfortunately, SMEs have heard nothing more to date.  I have been contacted by a number of small business owners who are all in the same boat.  They all have a serious shortage of cash flow and anyone who has been involved in business will know that cash is crucial to any small business. <\/p> <p>They need this rates waiver.  They need the breathing space.  However, the council has not processed the waiver.  It does not know the criteria and is waiting on the Department to provide instruction.  The problem for small businesses is that they are still waiting.  For two months, SMEs have been waiting.  For two months, the council has been waiting to hear from the Government.  Without this support and other supports, the businesses in question may have to close.  The margin is that fine.  They are balancing on a knife edge and they need everything that they can get.<br\/><br\/>Last week, I asked the T&aacute;naiste the following questions:<\/p><blockquote>\tCan he say why, two months on, the Government has not informed Dublin City Council of the three-month rates waiver for SMEs?  Why has the largest council [Dublin City Council] ... not been updated on a scheme announced two months ago?  Will he confirm that there will be no rowing back on the waiver scheme and that SMEs will receive it? <\/blockquote> <p>Last week, in response to those questions, the T&aacute;naiste stated:<\/p><blockquote>\tWe informed the world that rates were being waived for companies that had to close for that three-month period.  We ... have to consider extending that waiver.  I do not know why Dublin City Council has not been formally informed but I will check that out. <\/blockquote> <p>They are still waiting.  They still have not heard anything.  The SMEs have not heard anything.  The local authorities have not heard anything.  That was a week ago.  I have been in touch with the chief executive of Dublin City Council and he has informed me that the introduction of the rates waiver is awaiting decision by the Department on the details of the scheme.  Despite intensive pressure from the local authority sector, no circular has been issued with details of that scheme.  It seems that those in this Government and that which preceded it have been making announcements and then sitting on their hands.  What is happening in the Department that the T&aacute;naiste does not know that the rates waiver has not been delivered two months after it was announced?<br\/><br\/>As already stated, the T&aacute;naiste indicated last week that he announced to the world the rates waiver scheme.  However, the Department has done nothing to make sure that it is delivered.  This delay in deciding on the scheme is unhelpful to both SMEs and local authorities.  The local authorities need to know the criteria for the waiver.  They need to know who is eligible and who is not.  They need to know because they themselves need to budget.  I ask that the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister of State ensure that the local authorities are notified of the criteria for the rates waiver scheme and that it is issued as a matter of urgency.  Otherwise, the Government will become known as the Government for announcements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070800007#E00300","speaker":"1555","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1594203600,"counter":23,"content":"<p>Go raibh maith agat, a Theachta.

I have no doubt that he will do exceptionally well there.  I wish him the best of luck in the Department.<\/p>  <p>  The big focus for many of us is local business.  These are the companies that are not exporting.  They are not big American multinationals but they are the lifeblood of the economy in places right across the regions.  These companies employ 58% of the total workforce, or the total number of people who are paying tax.  Many of them have been badly hit as a result of Covid-19 and it is a considerable challenge for them now to try to redesign their way of operating.<\/p>  <p>  As the Minister of State will be aware, in my previous life as Minister I actively promoted a Government scheme called the trading online voucher in order to try to get businesses to start trading online.  I commend the Government on increasing the grant rate in this regard, from 50% up to 90%, and there has been a phenomenal take-up of that voucher.  The take-up has been a phenomenal for a number of reasons.  First, businesses and businesspeople were not working.  They had time to carry out a little more research than would have been the case when there were working day to day in trying to keep money coming through the door and many of them researched this trading online voucher.  The fact that there was a 90% grant absolutely made it attractive.  However, what has been most frustrating is that this grant has dried up.  The reason it has dried up is because the funding is not being made available, through the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, to the local enterprise offices.  The offices have already drawn down their full allocation for this year.  A supplementary allocation was given to the local enterprise offices for the trading online voucher but all of that was drawn down immediately.  Even counties such as Roscommon and Galway, for example, which would not be the biggest counties in terms of SMEs, have waiting lists of people who have gone through the training process, have been approved for a grant and are now waiting for that grant to be paid.<\/p>  <p>  We cannot allow this to continue because these businesses need to redesign what they are doing.  They need to reinvent themselves and their doing so should not be dependent on a very small amount of grant aid that is being made available.  That single investment of up to &euro;2,500 could be the difference between a company staying afloat or not and redesigning how it delivers for its customers.  For very little money, we can have a dramatic impact on the viability of many businesses across this country.<\/p>  <p>  I accept that we are talking about providing credit.  There has been much debate about the interest rate for that credit, but here is something that is a phenomenal success.  The data has shown that anyone who has availed of the voucher in the past has seen their number of employees increase.  This is an absolute no-brainer and yet Government is holding this scheme by the neck and not allowing it to grow because it will not put a small amount of money into it.  It is farcical to talk about an economic stimulus in three weeks' time if we are holding every business that wants to redesign itself by the neck and saying that it cannot grow and develop because we are not prepared to give it the &euro;2,500 grant.  The same applies to microfinance.  It is all well and good but, as the Minister of State knows well, many businesses out there do not want to borrow.  Here we have an opportunity to incentivise the redesign of how they deliver their business with a small grant and yet we are not prepared to give them that grant.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, we cannot even make the online course available to them in order that they can do the training.  The decision has been taken that we will strangle this particular scheme now and will not let people do the online course so that they would be eligible for the grant.  The studies have shown that 50% of people who do the online course find that they already have the existing infrastructure in place, they do not need to develop a new online trading platform and they can utilise the tools they have at present.  We are strangling those particular businesses as well because we are not giving them access to that course.  These are the basic fundamentals that can have a significant impact tomorrow morning on redesigning our economy post Covid and allowing companies to survive.<\/p>  <p>  The reason I am so animated about this scheme is that the figures relating to the analysis that has already been carried out show that this is probably one of the most successful grant schemes ever introduced in the State.<\/p> <p>The figures I will give are pre-Covid-19, brought up to date using research carried out roughly to give the current figures based on the growth in online trading.  On average, pre-Covid-19, Irish people were spending &euro;21,000 every minute online.  The difficulty is that &euro;14,000 a minute of that money was being spent on goods and services outside of Ireland.  Straightaway, a huge market is available there to Irish businesses if they can start trading online.  Roughly one third of Irish businesses are trading online, so there is a great opportunity to grow that area, and about one fifth of businesses are selling online overseas.  There is a massive opportunity to meet domestic demand and to start to trade internationally, without having to go through an Enterprise Ireland office in France, Germany or somewhere else.  This is small money to start getting businesses trading online and thinking about new opportunities for growth.<br\/><br\/>Pre-Covid-19, about two thirds of people in this country were purchasing goods and services online.  Naturally enough, that has increased dramatically during the Covid-19 crisis.  Figures show that 90% of people will research a product online before buying it.  They may not buy that product online, but they will research it online.  From analysis of Irish people, what is interesting is that they will pay more to buy a product locally rather than internationally.  The reason is that the quality of a product is guaranteed.  If there is a problem with the product, it is easy physically to bring it back to a local business rather than having to put it in the post and send it halfway across the world.<br\/><br\/>People are prepared to buy locally online.  The difficulty is that we are not giving those businesses the opportunity to have their shops open online and that is because the Government has decided that the quota has been hit for this year, regardless of Covid-19, and those businesses will have to wait until next year to start trading online.  Yet, we will spend the next couple of weeks bringing in new legislation, schemes and initiatives that will be full of bureaucracy and red tape and will take months to implement and of which businesses may not then avail.  The online trading voucher scheme, however, has been a phenomenal success, but we are not prepared to put in a small amount of money to transform businesses right across the country.  I appeal to the Minister of State, therefore, to get the finger out and ensure funding is put in place for this scheme.  It has been a great success - a proven success - and it has the ability to transform absolutely the delivery of services in this country.<br\/><br\/>While I am discussing the trading online voucher scheme, until now businesses such as restaurants were not allowed to avail of it.  I know of one local business in Roscommon town, The Good Place cafe, which has developed its own app.  It has been a phenomenal success during the Covid-19 crisis and has allowed people to order and pay for their products online and collect them at the door.  If that business has been able to stay above water by making an app available, surely we should be facilitating other businesses and services to do the same thing.  The focus has to be on trying to keep people in employment and the biggest challenge in doing that will be the services sector.  Again, for a small grant of &euro;2,500 we can keep four, five or six people employed in these businesses and yet we are not prepared to release the money to do that.  I hope that before the end of this month we will see the money being provided in a substantial way, not piecemeal or drip fed, to allow the trading online voucher courses to continue and allow people to draw down those grants as quickly as possible.<br\/><br\/>The second issue I want to raise concerns the 138 different State agencies that taxpayers are funding to support small businesses.  We have 35 Government agencies, 31 local authorities, 49 local development companies and 31 enterprise offices.  All of them are providing some type of support to SMEs.  Is it any wonder that businesses are confused about the supports that exist and are available to them?  Every opportunity I get I actively encourage businesses to go on the <i>www.supportingsmes.gov.ie<\/i>website, access the small business tool, put in the details of their business and quickly find out what supports and grants are available.  Not enough businesses, however, are filling out that online tool.  We need to start working with the businesses that are not doing that.  The Government will advertise, but advertisement has not worked to date.  The Government will use seminars, but seminars have not worked to date either, because the people whom we need to use that online tool are the very ones who will not attend those seminars.<br\/><br\/>In fairness to the Government, there is a huge range of supports, including grants, advice and access to capital in various forms.  I will make a suggestion to the Minister of State, however.  As he knows, the LEADER companies across the country are winding down and the funding available to the rural development Vote in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is also winding down.  We have a huge cohort of staff there who have great skills in working with small, indigenous businesses.  I suggest we redeploy those staff, and any other staff within Government agencies who may be surplus to requirements at the moment as a result of Covid-19, and that they go individually, door-to-door to these businesses, sit down with them, fill out the online SME tool and support those businesses in applying for the various grants and supports available.<br\/><br\/>I suggest that because I think this is the single biggest weakness we have now.  We can bring forward all the legislation we like in the next weeks and months to support businesses, but the ones that are going to come for help are the ones where it is now too late because they are already about to close their doors or are not prepared to reopen them.  Staff in the LEADER companies across the country should be going to those businesses and knocking on their doors.  They should sit down with those employers or self-employed people, go through the SME online tool, fill it out with them, identify what supports are available and assist those businesses in applying for and drawing down those supports.<br\/><br\/>The accessibility of these supports is a fundamental problem.  We have a listening ear among businesses, but they do not know where to start.  Many of the people involved may not be tech literate, yet these are the businesses we need to ensure are able to survive post-Covid-19.  Loans are fine and I welcome this legislation.  There has been debate regarding the interest rate being charged, but my and the Minister of State's engagement with businesses across the region has shown they do not want to get into further debt.  Many of those businesses cannot afford to get into further debt and many are looking at an uncertain future.<br\/><br\/>They are weighing up whether they should open their doors.  They are also wondering whether they should re-employ the same number of staff and how to lay off staff.  A phenomenal number of businesses are getting human resource advice on how to lay off staff.<\/p> <p>Yet we are not prepared to spend a very small amount of money on informing people that there are supports, that advice and resources put in place by the Government are available to them as businesses, and that we are prepared to work through those with them and give them the advice they need.  Do not wait for those businesses to close their doors.  Do not wait for them to knock on the door.  Let us get out there and meet them face to face.  Let us sit down with them and fill out those online tools.  Let us assist them in applying for the various supports that are available, and there are many.  The Minister of State will be amazed at the number of businesses that will go to the wall in six months because they did not avail of the restart grant or the rates waiver because they were unaware of them.  We cannot afford to do that.  We cannot afford to have people become unemployed because they did not access all of the available supports.<\/p> <p> New legislation is welcome and we in the Regional Group will assist Government in bringing it forward.  However, let us utilise what we have at the moment.  Let us support our existing businesses and dedicated and loyal employers to avail of the financial supports already in place.  Let us maximise the utilisation of those in the short term, and then explain to them how they can grow and develop their business with these new incentives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070800008#F00500","speaker":"1603","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1594204800,"counter":29,"content":"<p>Deputy Danny Healy Rae is sharing time with Deputies Michael Healy Rae, Nolan and O'Donoghue.

I hope we will continue to work positively on behalf of the people we represent.<\/p>  <p>  First, I have to declare that I am a small publican in a small rural village.  Publicans around the county of Kerry, and indeed countrywide, are very concerned about comments made by the new Taoiseach, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin.  They are wondering if pubs will be allowed to open on 20 July.  In that vein, what is the difference between somebody having a meal and a pint in a restaurant and someone who comes after having his or her meal, who can only afford the price of two or three pints, and who cannot get in anywhere for a pint?  That does not make sense to me.  Pubs should be open now the same as restaurants-cum-pubs.  They are regulated and always have been, and over the years they have provided a massive service to communities, especially rural communities.  Now, sadly, they are closed, and it is in doubt whether they will open.  What difference is it to have the meal in the pub or to have it before coming to the pub?  It should not be any different.  It only makes sense where there are lots of restaurants in urban areas or where there are crowds, and we saw there were crowds in Dublin, and people are queuing up to get in.  We know that when only half of the places are open, more people will go to places that are open when they cannot got to places that are closed.  People make sense of what is done, but what is being done does not help stop the coronavirus one iota.<\/p>  <p>  I want to talk about the VAT rate for the hotel and tourism industries, which have been calling for a reduction for many weeks and months now.  The former Minister of State, Deputy Griffin, said there should be no problem in reducing it but he did not do it.  I must remind him that he was the Minister of State involved in raising it from 9% to 13.5%.  I call for it to be reduced to at least 5% to help these people who are on their knees.<\/p>  <p>  Bus operators and drivers and taxi drivers and owners are on their knees, and we need give them help.  Some of them are afraid to come off the &euro;350 pandemic unemployment payment because if they try and fail, and it is very doubtful whether they will succeed, they cannot then get back on the payment.  Something needs to be done for the people who will try.  I ask that the temporary wage subsidy scheme be extended to include seasonal workers who were not working in January or February.<\/p>  <p>  I must mention our new Minister, Deputy Cowen.  His case should be closed now because he paid the price, he paid the penalty and he has said he is sorry.  What I am more interested in now is what he will do as Minister with responsibility for agriculture and how he will deal with all the issues.<\/p>  <p>  One issue we must deal with is the fair deal scheme for farmers, because it is not fair now, and even the Bill that is proposed is not adequate.  Will the Minister ensure that the value of the farm is disregarded and that the scheme will apply only to the residential house on the land, as is the case for everyone else throughout the country?  The value of the farm should be disregarded.  Where a young fellow values his farm at just &euro;400,000, the sum he will have to pay under the three-year cap on the value of the farm could amount to &euro;80,000 on top of that &euro;400,000.<\/p>  <p>  I am sorry.

I cannot understand why regulatory fees should have gone up by such an enormous amount.<\/p>  <p>  Our post offices must be supported because these are institutions of the State that will be important in revitalising our small businesses.<\/p> <p>We are charged with working here for the next number of weeks to ensure that the July provision will be rolled out and will be a positive measure, and to ensure that all the money Ireland can access abroad is brought here and put into various schemes in order that the economy can get going again.  That is very important.<\/p> <p> I want to emphasise that at this time small businesses want grants rather than loans.  Many of the small businesses we are trying to support already have loans that they can longer sustain or carry.  They need grants and assistance.  I compliment and thank the previous Government for putting in place the wage subsidy scheme and the working capital loan scheme.  I wish to thank in advance the new Government for keeping them in place.  We are desperately relying on the Minister of State and others, including the new Taoiseach, to support our small businesses.<\/p> <p> As has been stated, I am worried about the Taoiseach's comments.  I want to put on the record of the D&aacute;il that the Taoiseach should not paint all of Ireland with a Dublin brush when he is considering what to do over the coming days and weeks.  He, more than anybody in the world, should know that there is a world beyond the Red Cow roundabout.  I want him to think of that when he is making any decisions.  With the permission of the Whip, I will propose an amendment to section 120 of the Bill.  I will discuss this matter with the Whip.  It is an important amendment and shows that when decisions are being made the areas affected should be looked at in isolation rather than in terms of the totality of the country as happened before.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070800010#H00500","speaker":"1487","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1594205400,"counter":34,"content":"<p>Deputy Carol Nolan lives beyond the Red Cow roundabout.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070800011#J00200","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1594205400,"counter":35,"content":"<p>I want to begin by wishing the Minister of State every success in his new role, particularly as, now more than ever, it is very important to get businesses back up and running.  I ask him to ensure that as many of our SMEs as possible survive.  I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important Bill.<\/p>  <p>  As we know, microenterprises are the beating heart of the local economy.  To get that heart pumping again, we must ensure that the Government and local authorities get back to basics.  They must remember that well over 90% of all of the trade in the State involves SMEs and microenterprises with fewer than ten employees.  In April, I asked the Minister of State's predecessor, the current Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Humphreys, if she would consider implementing a nationwide shop local campaign to encourage people and communities to support local businesses because there is, as we know, a need now more than ever to make sure that our businesses are adequately supported, helped through every step and made aware of the schemes that exist in order to ensure their survival.<\/p>  <p>  Each year we run the fantastic Tidy Towns competition.  It would be great if there was something similar at national level for towns which have contributed the most to bring about a genuine shop local spirit.  As chair of the retail consultation forum, the Minister of State will be acutely aware that Covid-19 has brought particular challenges for small and large retailers across the State.  That is why I was somewhat taken aback last week when he announced that the projected gross expenditure for the Department in the original Estimate was &euro;970.9 million.  That is a lot of money, but, as he noted, it represented an increase of only &euro;21 million on the 2019 Revised Estimates allocation.  Is he certain that his Department will have sufficient resources to deal with the scale of the problem that exists for microenterprises?<\/p>  <p>  Section 6 seeks to make provision that Microfinance Ireland may borrow money from a promotional financial institution, but that the aggregate of any borrowings at any one time shall not exceed &euro;100 million.  That is a significant sum of money, but do we believe it will be adequate to fulfil the task that lies before us?  As the Government has acknowledged, the unprecedented circumstances of the pandemic have resulted in a swiftly evolving landscape for enterprises.  This will mean that it must keep the supports provided under review and utilise the appropriate mechanisms to adjust and amend the supports and their timeframes accordingly.  This is vital.<\/p>  <p>  We have to create a space in which the voices of local retailers are heard, and not just heard but acted upon.  As I said, everything needs to be done to ensure that they are supported and helped in their struggle for survival.  Small businesses are being lumped with levels of debt that are unsustainable in the short term.  This matter needs to be examined.  Many owners of small businesses have told me that they do not want to incur debts and would instead prefer supports.<\/p>  <p>  We know from the most recent report from Microfinance Ireland that to the end of December 2019, 346 businesses have failed and 2,085 loans were drawn down.  If those were the circumstances which pertained in 2019 prior to Covid, we can only anticipate how much worse things will be from here on.  It was also recently reported that investors in Irish banks in which the Government holds large stakes are nervous about the sector and about facing high levels of bad loans if they continue to lend to small businesses without the types of credit guarantee schemes that have emerged elsewhere in Europe.  Small businesses need guarantees that applying to access funds will not be the straw that breaks their backs.  They will need more than warm words, rhetoric and easy money put before them.  They will need assurances that if they try their best to retain employment in local economies that they will not be punished but rather supported.  I will end on that note.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070800011#J00300","speaker":"1592"},{"type":"speech","time":1594205400,"counter":36,"content":"<p>The importance of the Bill cannot be underestimated.  Some 1.5 million people in Ireland are employed by the SME sector, which needs monetary help in order to remain viable.  I understand the priority that needs to be given to increasing this fund.  Compensation needs to be provided for the rebate of fixed costs and the losses endured by SMEs during the Covid-19 shutdown.  The system needs to be simple to operate.  An SME accountant can verify the loss of revenue and expenditure during the pandemic.  The process can be administered through Revenue.<\/p>  <p>  We need to discuss the issue of clarity regarding the rates charged for borrowing.  It should be noted that the current stimulus package is not working.  Only &euro;100 million has been drawn down from a package of &euro;6.5 billion.  Why is this the case?  The answer is that it is too cumbersome.  It is not just me saying this; it has been echoed by the Central Bank, chambers of commerce throughout Ireland and KPMG.  The rates charged should be related to the cost of fund with a minimum administration charge.  The cost of loans needs to be as close to 0% as possible and there should be no repayments for a year.<\/p>  <p>  The current process is far too complicated.  The SME sector was a casualty of the Government's request to close.  The policing of loans and rent should be monitored by way of staged payments.  If debtors are to be paid off, they should need to provide proof that they have been paid.  In simple terms, if an SME owes money to a local firm or business and it cannot pay, that will lead to a configuration effect and two companies will close down.  Money must be redirected now.<\/p> <p>Forty per cent of businesses in Limerick will collapse if compensation is not provided.  Businesses are so busy trying to reopen they do not realise how serious the cash flow problem is.  They are sitting on the cash.  If they do not pay their creditors, creditors too will collapse.  The Government needs to support businesses now or it will end up paying out more on the dole.  Limerick has a city but it also has a rural county which is very dependent on small and medium enterprises.  Confidence will follow.<\/p> <p> We need this amending legislation enacted otherwise all of our businesses will close.  Is this what we want to see happening?  There are businesses working to reopen but the credit controls previously in place no longer exist and suppliers are seeking funds upfront before the businesses can reopen.  This is not how we open our businesses.  In other countries, businesses are being visited and consulted on what government can do to help.  This week, I learned that three publicans in my area will not reopen because they cannot see a future in the business.  Yesterday, I visited a pub in Kilmallock where I had lunch, but without a pint.  This pub has put in place all of the required social distancing measures while retaining all of its staff.<\/p> <p> We need to get funding to businesses now to protect cash flow going forward.  There is a simple process by which this could be done.  The funding could be provided through Revenue and processed by the accountants therein.  We need to stop complicating the issue.  We need to engage with businesses on how we can help them to reopen and get our employees back to work and then they will support us going forward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070800011#J00400","speaker":"1499","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1594206000,"counter":38,"content":"<p>Debate adjourned.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Ceisteanna \u00f3 Cheannair\u00ed - Leaders' Questions","time":1594206000,"counter":39,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070800012#K00200"},{"type":"speech","time":1594206000,"counter":40,"content":"<p>Today, I want to raise the issue of the Debenhams workers.  I was alarmed and disappointed with the Taoiseach's response yesterday when these matters were raised.  His response was lacklustre and it was not the type of response that I believe is required from Government.<\/p>  <p>  As the Taoiseach will know, the Debenhams workers have been in dispute with their employer for some months now.  At the height of the Covid emergency, they were on the picket line and they are on the picket line still, 24-7, standing up for their right to be treated with respect but also fighting a battle that has a much wider significance than just Debenhams.  Debenhams has used a tactical liquidation of its Irish stores to walk away from all of its responsibilities to its workers.  It is now the intention of Debenhams to take possession of all assets and stock in its Irish stores to funnel the profits through its British operations, at the same time leaving its workers here high and dry.  <\/p>  <p>  The Debenhams workers are not the first to be treated in this appalling manner by their employer and because of Government inaction, they will not be the last.  The use of tactical liquidation is not new to this State.  The Taoiseach will recall that in 2015 staff who had given a lifetime of service to Clerys were unceremoniously dumped by their employers and left high and dry.  They did not receive their statutory redundancy lump sum, they never got moneys owned in lieu of notice of redundancy or holiday pay and the State was left to foot the bill.  This is the blueprint for what is happening in Debenhams.  There needs to be immediate intervention by the State and Government.  The Taoiseach will recall that in the case of Clerys we all said at that time that this could never happen again, but it has.  Now is the time for immediate and effective action.<\/p>  <p>  What the workers are looking for is not unreasonable, it is necessary.  They want the Government to intervene and engage with KPMG, the liquidators appointed by the UK parent company.  They want the Government to directly intervene with the parent company and they want Debenhams to honour previous agreements to pay two weeks' redundancy per year of service in addition to the statutory redundancy.  They want to be treated with respect.  They do not want a situation where Debenhams can simply walk away.  It is now urgent that the Government act.  It is also urgent that we legislate.  I want the Taoiseach to move beyond the words he uttered yesterday, which were equivocal and non-commital.  I want to hear a firm commitment from him today that the Government will act immediately to directly support these workers and will also act immediately to legislate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070800012#K00300","speaker":"1466"},{"type":"speech","time":1594206000,"counter":41,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising the issue and the question in regard to the Debenhams workers.

The State will do everything it can to support the workers who have been made redundant by the company in the manner described by the Deputy.<\/p>  <p>  The programme for Government outlines the necessity to review legislation, particularly in terms of its utilisation by companies to lay off workers by way of the trading side of the company being insolvent and the separating out of the assets, which are then not available to facilitate the payment of redundancy to workers.  There is a commitment in the programme for Government to review the Companies Act with a view to closing off the vehicles or mechanisms by which companies can treat workers so shabbily and badly.  <\/p>  <p>  Governments arbitrarily cannot intervene in liquidations as easily as suggested by the Deputy.  That said, Debenhams should do the right thing by its workers.  It should pay the levels of redundancy agreed in previous engagements.  There are obligations on the company in terms of its workers.  The Government will do everything it can within the law to support the workers.  We will provide every resource possible to enable them to secure their rights and entitlement, but also future employment and other supports they may require to enable them to deal with what has been a very difficult and traumatic situation for them as workers.

In regard to the Clerys situation he said, \"The most effective intervention is legislative\".  At that time, he challenged for a review of the law to ensure that this type of behaviour cannot continue.  Five years on, the Taoiseach is still talking about reviewing legislation.  That is not good enough.  Deputy Martin may be new to the office of Taoiseach but he is not new to Government.

The authorities refused point-blank to allow mental health patients back in or even to have a space there, or one room for those presenting at the adjacent St. Joseph's Hospital with a mental health crisis.  Now the facility in St. Michael's is kitted out for Covid patients.  I hope it will not have to be used for this purpose.  We acknowledge the good work done in this regard but the facility must be kept open.  It has been proven that where there is a will, there is a way.  Money was found to open the facility for Covid.

There are two dimensions to mental health services.  One is obviously physical facilities.  I refer to acute capacity &mdash; in other words, acute beds &mdash; in particular facilities.  The south east in general, including Tipperary, has been short of acute capacity in mental health services for quite some time.<\/p>  <p>  The other aspect is securing the necessary personnel or staff to provide the services once a facility is available.  It seems to me, having worked in the area and having engaged with previous Ministers and the HSE, that there has been a significant challenge in recruiting and securing qualified personnel.

I have no doubt she will respond diligently to the points he and his colleagues in Tipperary have made.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to St. Michael's, the Deputy has said physical improvements have been made.  We will have to ensure we can get the right personnel in place and recruit the professionals.

These can help in providing services to people who have been on waiting lists for far too long trying to gain access to very basic mental health services.<\/p>  <p>  I am particularly conscious that Covid-19 will create additional burdens in terms of mental health need.

The public and Deputies were targeted so they would support the campaign to ensure patients in Ireland would be reimbursed for the clinically proven and licensed drug.  Many Deputies, including the Taoiseach and the now Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, supported the families in question.  The Deputies raised the issue in the D&aacute;il and supported the families in person at the protests and audiovisual room briefings.  At the time, Ireland was the only one of the Beneluxa initiative partners that had not approved the funding of Spinraza.  It was eventually approved on 11 June 2019, and the families involved in the campaign and those affected by the illness were greatly relieved that their children could access the drug.<\/p>  <p>  I received a telephone call from one of the families just last Thursday and learned that 12 children are still waiting to commence treatment.  One of those waiting is a 17 year old woman.  Her father, Pat, sent me an email.<\/p>  <p>It states:<\/p><blockquote>\tI am looking for your help as the situation with my daughter is totally unacceptable.  My daughter is deteriorating at an alarming rate while it is 391 days since Spinraza was approved and it sits on a shelf while my daughter lives in constant pain and discomfort. <\/blockquote> <p>His daughter sent a note, in which she states:<\/p><blockquote>\tMy case at the moment is that Spinraza, a life-changing drug for people with SMA, one of them being me, was approved on 11 June 2019.  I have still received no access to it.  Each day my muscles and body get weaker.  When I was 12 I lost my ability to walk and by now, at 17, I have lost the ability to lift my arms up over my shoulders, brush my hair, turn myself over at night and even go to the toilet and have a shower alone.  I need assistance to do every little thing.<br \/><br \/>I have lost so much quality in my life that I know Spinraza could bring back.  Since my muscles have become weaker, I suffer from extremely bad anxiety.  It has gotten to the stage that I cannot leave my house without my mam being by my side and I am so anxious that I am not able to sleep alone in my own room downstairs without panicking. <\/blockquote> <p>This woman's neurologist was in contact with the HSE before the pandemic and she was told no beds were available and the required care cannot be followed up.

Nonetheless, some garda&iacute; were subject to disgusting and very nasty attacks such as people spitting at them, and that called for proper protocols to be in place in terms of testing and supporting garda&iacute; in such situations.  I came across a case in that regard and I would be fully aware of the anxiety it causes a Garda family.  We have to be clear and unequivocal not just in our condemnation of those attacks but also in supporting the garda&iacute; who are carrying out their duty on behalf of all of us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070800016#O01200","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1594208400,"counter":98,"content":"<p>I want to bring the Taoiseach's attention to page 56 of the programme of Government, which references a commitment to resource harm reduction and education campaigns in regard to drug misuse.

I am glad to support this Bill and I commend it to the House.  I want to take a moment to recognise the new surroundings and the amphitheatre in which we find ourselves.  I pay tribute to the Ceann Comhairle and the Oireachtas staff who are behind this great new venture on which we find ourselves embarking.  If I ever imagined myself addressing such an auditorium, I thought I might have a somewhat larger audience in attendance, but such are the slings and arrows.  Here we are and at least we can get on with our business, as we are doing today.<\/p>  <p>  This Bill is one of the many vital items of legislation being addressed and introduced by the new Government.  It highlights why we needed that Government.  While it was of essence that we put a Government in place after the long hiatus of talks and the pandemic, the political fates that were aligning made it all the more imperative that we get a Government in order that this type of Bill could get into the Chamber and be passed.<\/p>  <p>  I wish the new Government well.  It is important to note that the Government, despite some claims to the contrary at the outset, enjoys a solid majority.  I know that there were upwards of 30 Deputies in excess of a majority on the day that the Taoiseach, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, was appointed.  I think that by any metric, whether votes, seats or percentages, the Government enjoys an overwhelming mathematical majority of the House, electorate, public support, etc.  It is important that that is the case and that we all get on with the job of supporting that Government and its important work and measures to tackle matters such as this.  This is one of many priority items that it was so important to introduce.<\/p>  <p>  I pay tribute to the resilience of so many small businesses in our towns, villages and constituencies that have somehow survived.  It is still an open question as to whether some will survive.  I pay tribute to those that have got to this point in the pandemic.  In many cases, they reinvented themselves successfully and ingeniously in various ways.  I marvelled at the rapid response in my constituency, which was mirrored across the country.  We had a unique situation at the height of the lockdown whereby individuals were cooped up in their own homes and private houses for weeks and months on end.  At the same time, we had suppliers of goods and services, which were of great interest to those individuals, behind closed doors in depots, corner stores and everywhere else.  It did not take a huge leap of faith or imagination to connect the two.<\/p>  <p>  I was delighted that my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Troy, spearheaded writing to the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation to try to get the needed certainty that businesses could begin to trade online and to trade over the phone in remote fashion.  That got going quite quickly in the end.  An Post, delivery services and courier firms played a part in that online fulfilment too.  It was remarkable to see the speed with which local retailers embraced it once it was clear that it was kosher to do so.<\/p>  <p>  In my constituency, Ted Johnsons hardware in Naas, a popular family-run traditional business mobilised and it led to a situation where clerks, tellers and store staff were taking orders over the phone until lunchtime every morning, manning the phones in every sense, and then on the road in a van that afternoon to deliver their wares, which were highly in demand in the area.  They fulfilled that need, keeping the company in business and the staff in jobs and meeting the needs relating to the supply chain.  Businesses like that embraced this new remote world for the first time, tackling matters such as supply chains, logistics, filling orders and methods of payment, the nuts and bolts of remote delivery and large-scale supply chain management.  In the time it took a Harvard business paper to come off the printer, the company had invented and reinvented it in its own storeroom.  I pay tribute to businesses such as that to which I refer.<\/p>  <p>  I talked about survival and this is a matter of survival for many businesses.  I think Darwin said that it is not always the strongest or biggest that will survive, but those who are most adaptable to change.  Our small retailers demonstrated and lived that value during the pandemic in the way in which they proved adaptable and changed, remodelling their own offerings.  I pay tribute to them for doing that.<\/p>  <p>  On a note of more caution and concern, while we embrace that, an online trading voucher has been talked about.  Deputy Denis Naughten mentioned it earlier.  This matter also came to my attention during the pandemic.  The online trading voucher support scheme appears to have run dry.  That is a matter of great concern to those concerns which have reinvented themselves and which are putting their shoulders to the wheel in order to serve their customers and keep their businesses afloat and their staff in jobs.  The trading voucher scheme enables businesses to get online and provides access to support, mentoring and finance.  I appeal to the Ministers and to anybody else with power in this area to examine the position.  We cannot say to businesses at the height of this pandemic, when everybody is embracing remote distribution channels, that last year's allocation is used up and that they will have to wait until next year.  I do not think that is good enough.  I hope, expect and am confident that this matter will be tackled.<\/p> <p> On the bricks and mortar and the people who cannot do business online, we are all very familiar with online Zoom calls, Skype chats and everything else.  A lot of business and socialising is being done that way.  In the normal way we would now be embarking on the summer school season.  That along with conferences and other get-togethers are now transitioning to online, which is great in the sense that it continues and prevails, and those discussions take place.  However, it is not such great news for the coffee shops, pubs, restaurants and hotels that supported those events.  People cannot buy a cup of coffee on a Zoom call and they cannot go and have their meals with other delegates coming out of an online conference.  That is a concern right across the country.<\/p> <p> We have seen considerable focus on staycations and people going down the country.  I applaud that and people should do that.  Let us not forget Dublin and the commuter belt and our day-to-day businesses.  A local example is the Petit Caf&eacute; across the road from Leinster House.  I spoke to the manager yesterday who is having terrible trouble because the footfall that normally generates in the city centre from the museums, galleries and public buildings, not to mention the commercial activity, is just not there.  We need to find a way to put feet back on the street in a safe way and in a way that can support businesses allowing them to survive.<\/p> <p> I pay tribute to the retailers.  The supermarkets and convenience stores kept going through the pandemic.  Those retailers and their staff put themselves literally on the front line.  It is important to recognise those front-line workers as front-line heroes.<\/p> <p> Kildare Chamber of Commerce, as with many business associations around the country, is concerned.  The Bill offers a welcome channel of finance for small businesses.  For anyone who wishes to avail of it, it will be lifeblood.  It is not a panacea or a silver bullet, but it is a very useful and important measure.  The Kildare Chamber of Commerce survey identified 10,000 active enterprises and 50,000 workers across the commercial, trade and professional services industries with an 88% employment rate prior to the emergency.  Businesses are very concerned.  Activity levels are extremely low.  Less than half - that figure may be optimistic - of their usual activity was presenting.  Earnings have dropped by more than 60%.  Some 25% of businesses expect to have earnings of 70% less than normal, meaning a quarter of businesses will not even make 30% of their usual revenue.  That decline has been felt most strongly in the regions, including in the east.<\/p> <p> The smaller operators, which do not have the reserves, the ecosystem or the cashflow are seeing a significantly disproportionate impact.  Those microenterprises, small businesses many of which are family run, need support.  The Microenterprise Loan Fund (Amendment) Bill is part of the solution.  I wish it well and I encourage everybody to apply for it and draw it down as a support for their businesses.  I commend the Government on introducing it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070800020#X00300","speaker":"1583","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1594211100,"counter":134,"content":"<p>I welcome the increase to the Microenterprise Loan Fund and the extension of borrowing powers of Microfinance Ireland.  Some questions have been raised with me in my constituency of Carlow-Kilkenny and I wish to raise them with the Minister of State.  During this pandemic, the State has given great support to the people of Ireland.  To quote Charles Dickens, \"No one is useless in this world who lightens the burdens of another.\"  It is not without gratitude that the business community took these supports.  However, I am concerned that some businesses have been unable to access many of the supports available.  This funding needs to reach those who need it.<\/p>  <p>  My office was repeatedly contacted by small business owners who were prevented from accessing these loans through the enterprise board.  Now that the amounts available are being increased, can the scope of who can qualify also be increased to allow many more businesses to access low-interest funding such as this?<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the ability of the social organisations and community-based projects to access some of this funding.  Will clear guidance be given on who can access funding?  How long will it take to draw it down?  Will it be in stages?  Will the application process be transparent?  Usually these loans require robust borrowing ability.  Since we have already seen mortgages refused to the people who have been put on wage-subsidy schemes, will businesses suffer the same fate?<\/p>  <p>  Some businesses, abiding by public health guidelines, have closed during the pandemic and will now reopen with less potential for profit than before.  Can the Minister of State assure them that they will still qualify?  Certain businesses have changed their business model, for example soap companies now fully manufacturing sanitisers, clothing companies now manufacturing personal protective equipment, PPE, chemical manufacturers now making cleaning products for commercial use and sit-in restaurants now doing only takeaways.  Will they still qualify for these loans or will they be classified as new businesses despite having traded successfully for years up to the Covid-19 pandemic?<\/p>  <p>  Given that so many businesses need cashflow right now, can these loans be accessed immediately?  What is the timeline on decisions?  Can businesses receive guidance on how long they can expect to wait for approval?  It is important that these loans are not only accessed by those who have the means, but also by those who do not.  Is there a system in place for help and guidance for businesses to apply for these loans?  If that is the remit of the enterprise board, we really need to talk about resources.  Will adequate resources be put in place to ensure that the lack of people to process applications does not hinder someone being able to stay in business?<\/p>  <p>  Will people be unfairly penalised in the future for accessing the loans if their fortunes should turn?  We might want to talk about creating jobs, but to create jobs we have to create the ability for business to prosper and we have to ensure that all precautions that businesses are taking to make their place of business safe for consumers, which is very expensive, are factored in when someone comes looking for a loan.<\/p>  <p>  I am also very concerned about the interest rates and we need to do all we can to keep them low.  The Irish Small and Medium Employers, ISME, appealed for grants as opposed to loans.  We cannot do something in this legislation that is likely to lead to someone going out of business by imposing interest rates that are untenable in the future.<\/p>  <p>  Can part of this funding be dedicated to local authorities through their enterprise boards to create shop-local funding initiatives, which encourage businesses and consumers to shop local?  It is more important than ever for us to look at our communities and how each of us can play our part in sustaining the areas in which we live and work.  I know I have asked many questions, but I would like the Minister of State to come back with some answers and then I can come back with more questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070800021#Y00200","speaker":"1511"},{"type":"speech","time":1594211100,"counter":135,"content":"<p>The Deputy cannot come back.

This scheme is to be welcomed and it is very important for SMEs.  Paper trails, timescale, how businesses access it and lack of information coming from Departments will be crucial.  People can be put off if they constantly have to complete paperwork.  Businesses that apply should not be left waiting for months with requests for further information.  This has to be immediate cashflow to businesses.<\/p>  <p>  In our lifetime we have never before seen businesses closed for months.  Many jobs could be at stake.

If someone was on a different wage agreement before the Covid-19 crisis, can they still be included in the wage-subsidy scheme?<\/p> <p>The main issue I raise today relates to dry cleaners and launderettes.  There are no specific guidelines, supports or personal protective equipment, PPE, provided to the industry.  On the contrary, the Government advised many members of the public not to use the services of dry cleaners and launderettes.  The Government did not consult or engage with the industry on the guidelines, nor has it responded to the numerous queries and concerns raised by the industry.  That is bizarre, particularly when one considers that the dry cleaning industry is a service regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency.  Dry cleaners and launderettes are specialists at cleaning the general public's laundry and the task is deemed high risk, especially during a pandemic.<\/p> <p> Dry cleaners and launderettes provide essential services to various sectors, including hospitality, hair, beauty and fashion, as well as schools and sports clubs, and other businesses that were closed during the lockdown.  They are an essential part of the supply chain for these businesses.  The pandemic has caused an estimated 50% to 80% loss of turnover to many dry cleaners and launderettes, some of which have had to close.  In the past week alone, two such businesses have closed in County Mayo.  Dry cleaners and launderettes need to be aligned to the hospitality sector and should be included in any VAT breaks or rescue packages offered to that sector because dry cleaners and laundry staff are highly skilled and many of them have taken years to upskill and train.  The impact of losing a staff member or key worker could be the difference between a business staying open or closing.<\/p> <p> The wage subsidy scheme needs to be in place for a minimum of one year and schemes and grants must be in place to take on new staff should others become sick because they are in a high-risk category.  Those grants and supports should be provided for upskilling and PPE, especially considering the job in question.  The industry now requests that all authorities and governing bodies consult and engage with it immediately on guidelines and supports.  I ask the Minister of State to look at this issue and see how these businesses can be looked after because I do not want towns like mine to be left without dry cleaners and launderettes.  They are essential services.<\/p> <p> Grant aid is extremely urgent.  I know the Minister of State is aware of that but the money must take the quickest possible route to these small businesses.  We are talking about businesses that need the money in a matter of days or weeks.  Some businesses have already closed down and will not be reopening.  <\/p> <p> We also need to get that money to smaller businesses.  I am finding that smaller businesses and new start-up businesses have been unable to avail of the rates scheme that was put in place with a minimum grant &euro;2,000.  Many self-employed people, smaller businesses and new start-ups have been excluded from that grant.  I ask the Minister of State to bring those people into the circle.  They are talking about small sums of money, not large ones, to help with their cash flow and provide new equipment that they need to purchase at this time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070800021#Y00600","speaker":"1501","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1594211700,"counter":140,"content":"<p>Like many other Teachta&iacute; D&aacute;la, I have spoken to many business owners during the months of lockdown.  Many people were ringing us, trying to figure out what was going on and what supports were available for businesses to be able to reopen and stay in business.  Many of those business owners have shown that they have a strong social conscience.  I will give a couple of examples.  I was a part of the community effort in Dublin 15 through my local GAA club, St. Peregrine's.  We started up a Sunday dinner for senior citizens in our community because the similar Fingal County Council initiative only ran from Monday to Friday.  It was a way of helping out on Sundays.  We were delivering more than 110 dinners every Sunday on a completely voluntary basis.  We could not have done that without local businesses.  Those businesses were struggling but gave us the support to enable us to carry out that wonderful project during the lockdown.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that, when we talk about microenterprise businesses, we are talking about carpenters, plumbers, mechanics, caf&eacute; and corner shop owners.  Those are very small businesses.  Their owners do not have the time, and some may not have the expertise, to fill out forms and apply for grants, unlike bigger businesses that may have somebody specifically designated to fill out those forms.  It is important, therefore, that we make the process as simple, clear and transparent as possible to enable these businesses to restart or stay in business.<\/p>  <p>  One of the biggest concerns that people have, particularly those in shops, is about rates and how they will be supported.  I know that such business owners have been supported in recent months but they are concerned about the future, particularly caf&eacute; owners who are worried about their capacity to allow the same number of people into their businesses that they once did.  That is now completely gone.  Caf&eacute; owners are talking about maybe 40% of the capacity that they had previously, which is not sustainable with the current level of costs.  It is important that we keep this process as simple as we possibly can.  We must ensure the funding gets to those who need it as quickly as possible. <\/p>  <p>  Many business owners have been saying they have loans already.  Some have borrowed to open their businesses, others to enable them to upskill their businesses.  They are worried about taking out more loans, the level of interest they will have to pay, how they will repay those loans on top of the business loans they already have and how they will manage that.  They are concerned about taking on additional debt.  Some business owners are saying they would rather not take on additional debt but would instead close their businesses and see what is going to happen because of the fear that they may be left with large bills.<\/p>  <p>  The small business community is the most ingenious group of people and I commend them.  During the lockdown and the emergence into the period we are now in, I know a couple of businesses that were innovative.  One bus owner took out all of the seats in his bus and started to work for the courier company DPD.  The individual in question is now looking to establish another business for the Christmas market and is wondering how he will support it.  I commend Fingal County Council on supporting that business.  I also know of a gym owner whose business was closed during the lockdown.  He started renting out equipment and is now looking to establish a sideline business renting out gym equipment.  Small business owners are ingenious and want to ensure they stay in business.  They try to diversify when they can but their existing businesses are struggling.  It is important that we give them support now and make this process easy, clear and transparent.  The House should support the Sinn F&eacute;in amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070800022#Z00200","speaker":"1476"},{"type":"speech","time":1594211700,"counter":141,"content":"<p>Like the previous Sinn F&eacute;in speakers, I support Deputy O'Reilly's amendment.  There are times when Deputies can all work together and this is an issue where we should all support microenterprises and small businesses.  Deputy O'Reilly is arguing that if we give people 12 months during which they do not need to repay money and no interest is charged, we will give them an opportunity to keep their businesses going.<\/p>  <p>  Small businesses are the lifeblood of communities in my constituency of Cork North-Central and nationally.  They hire local people and provide local employment.  We must consider that when we think about every local business we can save.<\/p> <p>As we look at the finances of the State, it is a lot more financially beneficial to businesses, communities, employees and the country if we can keep small businesses operating.  UCC did a study which found that on average, small businesses employ 3.1 people and are open for almost 25 years.  In 2017 and 2018, 85% of them were profitable.<\/p> <p> This goes back to what Deputy Paul Donnelly said about initiative and how small businesses are able to diversify, change and adapt.  In my own community, some businesses have not reopened, including some hairdressers and gyms, because they do not feel it will be possible for them to be viable under the current restrictions.  We need to provide support for them to get over the next 12 months because this period will be vital for businesses.  That is why I urge the Government to look at Deputy O'Reilly's proposal.  At the end of the day, we all need to work together.  We are better off supporting small businesses to stay open and be viable than we are paying social welfare to the number of people who will be laid off.  We need to look at the positives from a financial and business point of view but also from a personal point of view because of the consequences of people losing their jobs.  When we came into this new D&aacute;il, we said that where we could be constructive or could work with the Government, we would do so.  We are asking the Government to work with us to give small business and microenterprises a chance and keep them viable.<\/p> <p> Yesterday I was in my local launderette and the lady who has owned this business for decades was telling me that she had three staff but she cannot take them back because a lot of her business was with hotels and restaurants.  As we know, that business is not there now.  She is back working her launderette herself.  We need to keep her going until the hotels and restaurants are back up and running full time.  We have the same situation in caf&eacute;s, hairdressers, restaurants and bars.<\/p> <p> Sinn F&eacute;in wants to be positive and constructive.  We are bringing forward solutions.  We will try to work with the Government.  The business community does not do a 39-hour week.  These are people who work 50, 60 or 70 hours a week to keep their companies going.  We want to support them and the staff they employ.  We will do everything on our side to be constructive.  I hope the Minister of State will take on board Deputy O'Reilly's amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070800022#Z00300","speaker":"1453","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1594212300,"counter":143,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Microenterprise Loan Fund (Amendment) Bill 2020 and welcome the expansion in supports this Bill brings about through Microfinance Ireland Covid-19 loan funds and for the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, future growth loan scheme.  These provide vital measures and it is very important that the Bill progresses through the D&aacute;il as quickly as possible to support microbusinesses.  Public health is rightfully our most important concern at this time.  However, the pandemic has had a very significant and serious impact on small businesses and in particular on microenterprises.  They are the engine of our local economies.  They provide local jobs and it is most often local families who run them and set them up.  They are very often intergenerational.  I have spoken to many of these businesses in County Wexford and many are struggling to survive.  Many are questioning whether they will even reopen.  We are talking about laundries, caf&eacute;s, tradespeople, small hardware stores, young and small enterprises, gym businesses, and other ordinary small businesses with a few employees which have suffered very hard in the last months.  They are the entrepreneurs, ordinary people, the ones who took huge risks to establish their small businesses.  They are also very difficult businesses to set up, and when they are lost, they are very difficult to replace.<\/p>  <p>  In any funds that are provided for these small businesses, speed of access is going to be critical.  It is necessary that they can get the funding quickly and that the method to get it is simple and clear.  These businesses are very worried.  They are seeing their cash flow collapse and bills mount up.  While there was some forbearance from some creditors, many of those bills are now flying in through the letter boxes.  They are concerned at how they will be supported going forward in terms of rates, VAT, loans and grants - in short, costs and liquidity.  Any small business has a cost of doing business.  Access to funds is critical for them to survive.  I am very hopeful that this Bill will help to allay some of their fears but we will need to see more supports for them in the next couple of weeks.<\/p>  <p>  These businesses provide essential and valuable services throughout our local economy.  For regions and counties, like my own of Wexford and the south east, that have undergone a very slow recovery, if any, since the last recession, they are the communities that are now very vulnerable.  Wexford relies on tourism and small businesses and if they are lost, it will suffer extremely badly.<\/p> <p>These are the small businesses which are very adaptive.  They are the innovative businesses and they deserve our support.  We hear much discussion about IDA Ireland and big businesses, and while the latter are very important, the backbone of the country and economy are small businesses.  When an IDA Ireland business closes up and moves elsewhere, small businesses stay here.  We need to support them. <\/p> <p> County Wexford is highly reliant on tourism but the industry has already lost most of the season.  The season usually starts to turn on 15 August when visitors start to trail off and by September things are quiet again.  Many tourism businesses have only opened on a trial and error basis to see if they can survive.  If they enter the winter period without the supports they need to survive, they will not reopen in spring.  Those that are open have only been able to allow in about one third of the traditional customer base but they need twice as many staff and costs are increasing.  They need support.<\/p> <p> The food and accommodation sector has probably been the hardest hit.  Many businesses in the sector are family owned or small and they will not survive without the support they need.  We must acknowledge the value of these businesses to our economy and country.  We must protect them and, in doing so, protect local economies, families and communities and retain social cohesion.  The money spent in small local businesses is kept locally.  When someone goes into a hardware store and buys a few bits and pieces, the money is spent by its owners and staff in the local economy.  It is not lodged in a bank account before being transferred to an account in another country.  It is critical we support these businesses.  Looking back at the last recession, the small businesses that survived helped our economy and country to grow again.  Many of the small businesses that crashed in the last recession did not need to crash.  If they had been given a small amount of support, it would have got them over six or nine months and allowed them to get going again.  Good businesses collapsed because their debtors went out of business and cash flow dried up quickly.  <\/p> <p> We are facing into a recession but it will be different from the previous recession because this time there are high levels of savings in bank accounts.  The figures being bandied around indicate that &euro;2 billion was saved in May 2019, whereas in May 2020 between &euro;10 billion and &euro;12 billion was saved.  We need to get that cash flowing, which means giving people confidence and clarity about what they can and cannot do, what they can and cannot book and what they can benefit from.<\/p> <p> A large number of Irish people holiday at home every year, but Irish people spend around seven times more on foreign holidays.  Very few people will go on foreign holidays this year.  We must find a way to encourage these people to holiday at home and spend their hard-earned money in local economies, including in pubs, restaurants, hotels and other small businesses to keep them going.  I appreciate that it is not easy to give an answer to everything but we need these businesses to survive.  If they go out of business, the owners and their employees will lose their jobs and end up on social welfare payments, which is another cost.  These are good businesses which can survive and thrive with a little support. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070800023#AA00200","speaker":"1618","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1594212900,"counter":145,"content":"<p>The Convention Centre Dublin is a strange setting but this is an important discussion.  I thank all the Deputies who made the journey across to this new Chamber to discuss this Bill today and those who spoke on it in Leinster House last night when the T&aacute;naiste introduced it.  There has been a good discussion, which has focused on many aspects of the supports needed for SMEs.  I thank the Ceann Comhairle and Acting Chairmen for their efforts and all the Deputies who have participated in the debate.<\/p>  <p>  I am glad to hear general support across the House for the SME sector generally and microenterprises in particular.  I was pleased to hear the majority of Deputies acknowledge the need to ensure that microenterprises have access to suitable opportunities to facilitate reopening their businesses and re-emerging from the Covid-19 health crisis.  I agree with most Deputies that SMEs and microenterprises are the lifeblood of many of our communities, towns, villages and high streets.  They often give people their first job and many give those who are retiring a part-time job.  They also support many others.  They have had a presence in our towns and villages for many years, creating jobs and providing goods and services and business opportunities.  Many have done their best to provide a service during the past four or five months.  Those which were allowed to do so went to great efforts and I thank them and their staff.  I thank in particular the retail sector for providing a service and ensuring that goods were available when needed.  Apart from a few items such as flour, everything that was needed was available.  The retail sector upped its game and built on much of the work it had been doing on supply chains and so on as it prepares for Brexit.  It showed what it can do.  Retail staff went to great lengths to turn up for work and took a risk in doing so, as did all the front-line medical staff whose efforts we regularly acknowledge.  We must also recognise the work done by retail workers.<\/p>  <p>  We are seeking to recognise that many of the business that stayed open and those that had to close need extra help and support to reopen, re-employ staff and grow their businesses again.  We are very conscious of this and the whole Government is committed to providing such support, as is the whole D&aacute;il.  All parties are at one on this issue.  As Deputy Gould noted, we are all agreed on the need to support SMEs and microenterprises and encourage job growth and retention.<\/p>  <p>  The Department, under the previous Minister, Deputy Humphreys, has been central to this debate for some months.  It has been involved in creating jobs and sustaining growth for many years.  It showed what it can do with the Action Plan for Jobs in 2012.  I was lucky enough to have been a junior Minister in the Department at the time.  I am now working with the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Varadkar, and the other Minister of State at the Department, Deputy Troy.  We will work with our officials to deliver a cross-Government approach through the stimulus plan in July and to drive the economic recovery plan in October.  The Department has an excellent team which is ready to work with all our State agencies and enterprise agencies.<\/p>  <p>  An earlier speaker indicated that more than 135 agencies are working with and on behalf of the Department on job creation.  They include local enterprise offices or LEOs, enterprise units in county councils, local authorities and more than 30 agencies, such as Enterprise Ireland, Science Foundation Ireland, IDA Ireland and Microfinance Ireland, which work on job creation every day.  They are involved in helping business grow and expand.<\/p>  <p>  Last night, one speaker pointed out that our first aim is to help businesses to survive and get through this period.  Thereafter, it is to help them build on that, thrive, grow and expand, and avail of the many opportunities to which Deputies referred.  We have come through very difficult times and businesses in Carlow, which Deputy Murnane O'Connor mentioned, and elsewhere are under a great deal of pressure.  There are great opportunities.  The retail sector is part of my brief and many speakers noted that a large amount of business is now done online, although 70% of that is based outside Ireland.  Irish retail companies can dive into that market and win more market share by providing a better service with online choice.  They must also provide a friendly, local service because Irish people want to buy Irish where they can.  The issue is to compete on cost, which is something on which we can work with businesses.  There are many opportunities to win more market share.  Plenty of Irish companies are selling their goods and services all over the world and we want to encourage more companies to do so.<\/p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland does a lot of work with larger companies which have potential to grow but many other companies which are not Enterprise Ireland clients could trade internationally through other schemes we are offering.<\/p> <p>There is loads of potential and opportunity but we are going through a very difficult time.  Those businesses need the help of our various Departments to get through this.  We will get through it.  Part of our work is to restore confidence.  Many Members asked if many businesses have the energy and confidence to continue to put more money into their business and whether or not to borrow or re-employ their staff.  This is a big decision on a weekly basis and we have to work with them to give them the confidence to do that.<\/p> <p> We have been through this before as a country.  We were back there in 2011 and 2012 when we tried to drive that recovery.  Massive unemployment hit here in 2008, 2009 2010, 2011 and 2012.  In 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015 we came out of that through businesses getting stuck in.  The self-employed sector put their shoulder to the wheel and took that risk and the opportunity to invest again in their business.  It takes guts to do that and we need to support them in doing that but I am quite confident that with the right supports we can get this right as well.<\/p> <p> Referring back to this Bill, it is not the only thing that we need to do.  There are other measures already in place to support SMEs.  The key here is getting access to funding which is a big issue for many companies, certainly microenterprises, be they start-ups, existing businesses or businesses trying to reopen.  It is about access to that finance at the right time, in a speedy manner and at the right price.  The previous Government had already put in place new and expanded schemes to address Covid-19.  The new Government is hitting the ground running to do the same, starting with this Bill and the credit guarantee scheme which the T&aacute;naiste and I and the Minister of State, Deputy Troy, hope to bring before the Houses before the summer recess.<\/p> <p> I was also happy to hear a range of ideas from across the House on other schemes which we can examine with a view to including them either in the July stimulus plan or the economic package planned in October.  The T&aacute;naiste in his opening speech asked contributors, while commenting on this Bill, to put forward their own ideas to feed into this July stimulus.  I hope to engage with all of the spokespersons of the different parties to get their ideas over the next week or two to put that plan together.  All of the three Ministers in our Department have been reaching out to the various sectors to get their own ideas and views.  I am conscious that the July stimulus plan will not be just be from our own Department but will be from all other Departments whereby we can make interventions to try to encourage recovery, to save and recreate jobs and to give everyone a little bit of a boost and build on that later on in the year as well.  We are open to looking at everything that we can possibly do.<\/p> <p> Not all of these ideas may be workable.  Many ideas were put forward here today, some are workable, some are not and some may take more funding than we have available.  Some may also take longer to put in motion but we will take all ideas and we are naturally willing to work with all of those over the years ahead.  My officials and others have taken note of all of the contributions over the last few days and we are looking at these and will contact individuals if I do not get a chance to refer back to them today.<\/p> <p> Microfinance Ireland is a not-for-profit lender which was established in 2012 under the Microenterprise Loan Fund Act.  It has been providing business loans of up to &euro;25,000 for up to five years to enterprises employing up to nine full-time equivalents.  Many Members during the debate asked us to go beyond nine and that is something that I would have called for myself in the past.  It is not possible to do this under European legislation but there are many other supports for companies with over ten staff.  This is targeted particularly for those with up to nine staff.<\/p> <p> Deputies also asked about the different types of businesses that might avail of this.  It is accessible to nearly all types of businesses.  The application process is quite straightforward and can be completed in most cases in less than six days.  The sector does try to respond as quickly as it possibly can with a good service.  I want to stress the point about the lender being not-for-profit - Deputy Mattie McGrath contributed last night and asked about different parts of this and that it is quite popular in Tipperary and other counties.  The question was asked about cost and in particular interest costs.  To be clear, Microfinance Ireland does not make profit on charging interest costs.  It tries to cover all of its costs, but it is loaning into a high-risk category which is traditionally what it does, to start-ups and companies which are unable to get finance elsewhere generally or where the banks, for whatever reason, do not want to loan to them.  This category is generally high cost and high interest.  In the past, Microfinance Ireland has managed to loan money at between 7% and 8%.  Already through changes made by the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, earlier this year in response to Covid-19 that interest rate has been reduced to 4.5% in most cases if through a LEO, or 5.5% if the loan is made directly through MFI.  We have already responded to the interest rate call and would like to do more.  I am willing to discuss this with Deputy O&rsquo;Reilly to see how we can agree on this.  I am aware that an amendment has been put down.  We cannot put targeted interest cost into primary legislation or a time line for a deferral of payments for 12 months.  This is something that we can look at in the regulations and in the scheme as we produce it.  I will discuss it and work with the Deputy on this.  This cannot be done by way of amendment to primary legislation, which is not where it belongs.  We can see if we can reduce the cost of the interest rates and the terms as well.  We have made the first six months interest free which effectively means that the interest rate is 3% over a three-year loan as opposed to 4.5%.  Very often loans like this could have a charge between 10% and 15% on the open market.  This is already quite a subvented percentage rate.  We will look at and work with the Deputy on this.  To be clear, nobody is making profit in charging 4% or 5%.  People are saying that the money is coming from Europe at a much lower interest rate and what is the difference.  It is not profit, it is the risk involved.  The taxpayer subsidises that risk and that is what we do when we put our funding of over &euro;100 million into this.<\/p> <p> On the amount of money loaned, it can be up to &euro;50,000.  The average loan in the past was approximately &euro;25,000.<\/p> <p>Many Deputies referred to the application process being long and difficult.  It should not be.  Deputy Murnane O&rsquo;Connor mentioned that and I am very happy to discuss that with her as the loan is very open to all sectors.  It is quite straightforward.  There is lot of hand-holding and coaching with the application process by MFI and our LEOs, because that is what we want to do in trying to help people who might not be familiar with drawing down big loans which might be new to them.  Certainly, for a microenterprise or a start-up there is much engagement and a number of efforts are made to get the forms right.  Sectors should not feel it is difficult or they are left out and I will be happy to discuss this also with the Deputy.  We try to accommodate as well as we possibly can.<\/p> <p> A number of contributors have referred to the approval rates of 40% to 50%.  It is much higher than that if one looks at the applications over the last number of months as it is at about 80%.  That is something that we try to encourage.  We have asked MFI to be aware that businesses need supports now, to allow for that and to take greater risks.  One of the first questions I would have asked is around the success of MFI.  On the failure rate in terms of loans being repaid, often 50% to 60% of these loans may not be in a position to be repaid as there is quite an amount of losses associated with this kind of risk-based lending.  It is important that we allow for that.  That means that we are taking a chance on businesses and giving start-ups an opportunity.<\/p> <p> When I first got involved in politics I was involved in enterprise boards close to 20 years ago and I would have been unhappy if there was not a reasonably high failure rate.  If the failure rate is too low and it is all success, this means that we are taking no chances.  If we are to encourage entrepreneurship, business growth and opportunity, we have to take a risk and to encourage all of our agencies to allow for that little bit of risk which will mean some losses and that some loans cannot be paid back.  That may be because of market failure.  Every effort is made to ensure a business is run right and can pay back debts.  Sometimes with these loans one has to take a chance, let it go and see what happens, which is something we encourage.  I will want to hear back from colleagues if there are hearing differently to this.<\/p> <p> Many of our contributors last night, including Deputies Harkin, O&rsquo;Reilly and MacSharry, raised the issue of the interest rates which I hope I have addressed.  Deputy O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s colleagues in Sinn F&eacute;in and many others support her amendment, which is worthy, and we would all like to do this and are calling for that lower interest rate.  This is something that we will work on and look again at, bearing in mind that this is not-for-profit loan facility.<\/p> <p> The operation of the loan schemes is through MFI and through the LEOs.  Many contributors asked about various loans through the regular retail banks.  This loan is not through these banks.  The credit guarantee scheme is a different scenario which we will be debating next week and it is operated through the existing financial arms to help us to reach out to all parts of the community and give access for everybody.<\/p> <p> Part of the conversation was also about getting the message out that MFI loans are available.  We will certainly look at the communications to see if we can increase that because we do want to see these loans drawdown.  When this scheme first started in 2012 and 2013, we did expect higher rates of drawdown but as the country recovered there was not such a demand for loans through Microfinance Ireland.  That has been increasing over the last number of years and certainly over the last four or five months there has been and will be a much greater demand.  We are responding to that.  That is what this legislation is about, namely, is putting in place a mechanism which will enable businesses to borrow and drawdown more money to meet that demand.  I ask Members not to judge MFI on its previous applications because these were made in different times.  One will see many more applications coming through this year, which is what we are getting ready for.  We will have to respond in many other ways also and that is what the July stimulus plan is about.<\/p> <p> Many people raised issues outside of the microfinance loan such as rates.  Deputy Andrews asked a question about Dublin City Council not being able to get clarity.  There was absolute clarity on this.  The Restart grant is based on last year&rsquo;s rates which were paid in 2019 up to &euro;10,000, with a minimum figure of &euro;2,500.  Most businesses which needed this have applied for it and are drawing it down.  In some cases there may be a small delay in drawing it down but business knows it is going to get it.<\/p> <p> Deputy Andrews raised the issue of the three-month waiver in respect of this year's grants.  For clarity, the three-month waiver is available to everybody.  Some of the local authorities are still working through applications for it because there are issues that remain to be sorted out related to the finance and the back payment to local authorities to cover that cost but it will be available.  Some people might get a still get a bill but the three-month holiday is available to them.  There have been many calls to extend the waiver and we will look into that as well in the context of the July stimulus.<\/p> <p> With the permission of the Acting Chairman, Deputy Lahart, as we are ahead of time I would like to respond to some of the other issues that were raised.  Many Deputies, including Deputy O'Reilly, raised the issue of the processing time for loans.  The processing time is generally less than six days.  I am sure there will be cases where processing has not been completed within that timeframe but we will keep the focus on this area.  If Deputies are aware of any such cases, I am happy to hear from them in that regard.  Generally, the processing time is less than six days.  In fairness, feedback on some recent applications might be taking longer because technically the money had run out until such time as this legislation is passed.  In some cases, the local authorities will not have had the funding to process applications.  Following enactment of this Bill, assuming we have the support of the House today, we will move to get that funding in place as quickly as possible.<\/p> <p> Deputy Catherine Murphy and others raised the issue of the approval rates for loans.  The risk appetite has significantly increased and the approval of applications is approximately 80%, and rightly so in my view.  I want to assure Deputy Dillon that officials are working with Microfinance Ireland, MFI, on approvals.  As I said, the approval rate is approximately 80%.  The Deputy also mentioned the need to communicate to people that this loan offering exists.  We will work on that.  Deputy Naughten spoke about using the partnerships and LEADER staff as vehicles to get the word out and to work with applicants.  I am happy to do that.  The local enterprise offices, LEOs, are already doing this work, although I know they are stretched in some cases in terms of staff numbers.  We will use all channels available to us to get the message out and to work with companies who want to apply for this loan as well.<\/p> <p> Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in expressed concerns about the three-year term of the MFI loans.  I will take this into account when we are developing a new scheme under the Act, along with the interest rate and so on.  There are other schemes in place, including the credit guarantee scheme and the future growth loan scheme, which have longer terms of six years and eight to ten years, respectively.  In the past, the MFI loan worked quite well as a three-year term but we will re-examine it.<\/p> <p> The issue of demand was also raised.  Many Deputies mentioned they had received feedback from their constituents in regard to the demand for this scheme.  Demand has increased tenfold over the past couple of months, which shows the pressures on businesses as reflected in the contributions of all of the speakers to this debate over the past two days.  There is a demand for this loan.  We will respond with this scheme and other schemes to meet that demand and to support businesses through this difficult time.<\/p> <p> Many Deputies mentioned that the demand is for grants, not loans.  We all would like to be able to provide grants to the various sectors but it does not work that way.  There are grants available for particular sectors and more grants will be made available to support business as much as we can, but the taxpayer does not have an endless purse to fund everything.  We are trying to stretch the purse as best we can and to combine our offerings and supports through grants, investment with equity, loans and so on.  The microfinance loan and credit guarantee are other tools in the box to help business as well.  We cannot always provide grants.  The restart grant is not repayable and the rates waiver is not repayable.  I have heard the message from Deputies that businesses want more grants and fewer loans.  We get that and we will respond.  Every business would respond in the same way.  Most business sectors and their representative bodies understand that the State will not be able to address every issue by way of grants and that some assistance will be by way of repayable loans.  How to make those loans more manageable is the issue.  The amendment tabled by Deputy O'Reilly is about giving businesses more time to repay loans, lower interest rates and so on.  We get that too, and as a Department we will work on that as well.<\/p> <p> Deputy Pringle asked about the barriers to people drawing down this loan or other loans and if the interest is a deterrent in that regard.  None of the research worked through by the Department, of which there is plenty, shows that the interest rate is the main deterrent or barrier to the drawdown of this or other loans.  Rather, the application process, making a business case, access to coaching and mentoring to restart or expand a business are the main issues.  While none of us want to repay loans at a high interest rate, the interest is not the biggest deterrent or barrier.  As I said, accessing the funding is the issue and this is where we are focusing our efforts.<\/p> <p> Deputies Michael Collins, Pa Daly, Michael and Danny Healy-Rae, Christopher O'Sullivan and others raised the issue of supports for the tourism sector.  There is a big demand in this regard as well, to which we have yet to respond.  There have been some interventions but no doubt more will come through in the July stimulus package.  As a country we are reliant on the tourism sector, along with our SMEs.  Deputy O'Sullivan spoke about supports for business in the fisheries and agriculture sectors.  Many of the business supports being provided are provided in conjunction with other Departments.  We will respond to those sectors.  It is hoped we will be able to reach all of the sectors.  The July stimulus plan and the October economic recovery plan for the next three years will have to respond sector by sector.  We will have to examine each area individually to see what we can do to sustain businesses and to enable them to thrive and grow.<\/p> <p> Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute; spoke about businesses that were viable before Covid but might appear on paper to be unviable now.  All of the supports provided down through the years have been directed to viable businesses that can survive, thrive and grow again.  As a rule, we do not like putting money into businesses that have no chance of survival.  That is a matter of judgment.  We have to focus on businesses that in normal times would survive and will be able to survive now with a grant or a loan.  This is where we will focus our efforts.  If a business was viable up until February then we will work it to assist it to get up and running again.  The country and our economy need businesses open.  We need businesses employing people, creating jobs, paying taxes and enabling the movement of money through the system.  It is those jobs and the finance derived from the various taxes that help to run this country.  As has been repeatedly said for many years, a functioning economy is needed to fund all of the services we need to improve, be those in health, education or other sectors.  We will work with every sector to try to make sure they are enabled to survive, reopen and re-employ their staff.<\/p> <p> The online trading voucher scheme was mentioned by a number of Deputies.  There is huge demand for it, and rightly so.  We have to respond to that demand.  The former Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Bruton, increased the funding available to all of the sectors in respect of this scheme.  We probably need to do more because there is greater demand for it now.  We will respond to that demand.  It is a worthwhile voucher.  I recall that in my earlier years in the Department with responsibility for business I spent a great deal of time trying to convince businesses to take up this voucher.  We worked hard to push and sell it but there was no great demand for it.  People have come to realise over recent months that this is what we need to do.  We need to get as many businesses as possible trading online successfully.  We will work hard to ensure that happens.<\/p> <p> In addition to the online trading voucher scheme, we have provided an additional &euro;6.5 million for the online retail scheme, which was originally to be a &euro;2 million offering, but as there were a number of high-end successful applications, totalling 183, we responded by increasing the funding available to &euro;6.5 million.  We are trying to meet needs as they come forward.<\/p> <p> There were references to credit unions and the banks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070800024#BB00200","speaker":"1505","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1594214100,"counter":148,"content":"<p>I must ask the Minister of State to conclude.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070800026#DD00200","speaker":"1572"},{"type":"speech","time":1594214100,"counter":149,"content":"<p>I am trying to respond to all of the questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070800026#DD00300","speaker":"1505"},{"type":"speech","time":1594214100,"counter":150,"content":"<p>I appreciate that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070800026#DD00400","speaker":"1572"},{"type":"speech","time":1594214100,"counter":151,"content":"<p>I think I have answered most of the questions.

There is no disagreement on that; everybody is saying the same thing.  SMEs need supports, grants and zero-interest loans, and they need the Government to be as imaginative as the Executive in the North.  Indeed, to set the bar low, they need it to be as imaginative as the Tory Government, if that is not too outrageous to suggest.<\/p><p>Let us not forget that the businesses in question were closed because of a public health emergency, not because they could not trade or were not trading successfully.  They are not start-ups.  While the Minister of State referred to start-ups, and obviously some of them at some point were start-ups, most of them are established, viable businesses that were forced to close, not because there were no customers or business but because of a public health emergency.  These are unprecedented times and the response needs to be unprecedented.<\/p><p>The amendment, therefore, seeks to ensure that money can be lent to microenterprises, interest free and with zero repayments for the first 12 months of the loan, and the interest rates on the loans will be capped at 2%.  That figure will not be a target or a percentage that will have to be hit, but rather a cap so businesses can use that money to get themselves back up and running.  We have included a timeframe and are mindful that this is unprecedented.  In Britain, a similar scheme provides for no repayments for the first 12 months.  That is what we are asking the Government to consider and the amendment seeks to ensure that businesses will have that breathing space.  If we look across the water, we can see that more than 1 million bounce-back loans, worth a total of &pound;30.9 billion, have been released to microenterprises.  That is the kind of ambitious plan that will be needed to ensure that SMEs can not only access credit but also get it easily without too many barriers in the way and know that they will not just be piling up debt.<\/p><p>The Minister of State indicated that nobody will be making a profit out of this, but the loans are administered by commercial banks using the rules relating to commercial banking.  These are unprecedented circumstances, however, and some imagination needs to be applied to the matter.  What businesses do not need is more debt or postponed debt, deferred debt or debt piling up while they are trying to get out from underneath this and while they try to restart.<\/p><p>I reiterate what I said to An T&aacute;naiste last night.  This cannot just be about jobs, any jobs, whatever types of jobs.  It has to be about decent work and paying workers properly.  There has to be a <i>quid pro quo<\/i>, not just for the Government but also for SMEs.  I ask that the Minister of State consider the amendment and that he consider taking the actions that Sinn F&eacute;in has outlined.  I welcome his commitment to meeting us.  I note what he said about primary legislation and there may be some disagreement with us about that, although I do not want to be the one who interferes with all the agreements that have broken out here this afternoon.  Clearly, we are all of the one mind and we want to ensure we get the finances to SMEs.<\/p><p>Sinn F&eacute;in seeks to ensure that in allowing businesses to access those credit lines, we do not subsequently put them under so much pressure that the credit is ineffective.  I echo the calls made by my colleagues and other Deputies in respect of grants.  Grants will be very necessary and have to be considered, although perhaps that is a discussion for another day.  Nevertheless, I reiterate that these were viable businesses that were closed because of a public health emergency, not because they were not viable.  They are the businesses we are seeking to ensure can get back on their feet and start to re-employ people, with a focus on decent jobs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070800027#EE00200","speaker":"1467"},{"type":"speech","time":1594214700,"counter":157,"content":"<p>On my reference to start-ups, in general microfinance loans are available to start-ups.  They were mentioned by other Deputies and I do not suggest that all the demand in recent months has been from start-ups.  Of course it has not been; it has been from businesses that want to reopen, survive and thrive.  The loan is also available to the many microenterprises.  There will be people who, for whatever reason during these months because of Covid-19, might have to change job category or sector.  The job they had for life might not exist because we do not know whether every sector will fully recover.  It is important, therefore, that money is available to those people who might want to switch their efforts, move over and start a new company or microenterprise.  That is what this money is for and it is important that in every debate on the matter, we get the message out that money is available to start-ups.  Some high-risk start-ups might have no certainty of where their customer base will be and that will be another use for this money.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy has proposed an amendment that would provide for a longer interest-free period and lower interest rates.  This is something that any sane person would naturally want to consider or achieve.  That does not mean it will be possible but, certainly, when developing a new scheme under the Bill, we will consider it.  I will honour that commitment to meeting the Deputy to discuss that because we are conscious of the support from all sides of the House for achieving lower interest rates and longer repayment breaks.  We have responded to that by putting in place a lower interest rate.  It was traditionally 7% or 8% but has now been cut to 4.5%  There is a six-month break that did not always exist, meaning there is now an effective rate of 3%, which is quite manageable for most businesses.<\/p>  <p>  Nevertheless, businesses need access to as much as they can get through these times.  While we will work with the sector on that, we have been advised by the Office of the Attorney General that it would not be legally sound to legislate for the details of the scheme in primary legislation, which is the point I was trying to make earlier.  It is a matter for secondary legislation and regulation as we bring the scheme forward in the weeks ahead.  The Government will have to oppose the amendment because the Bill is not the place to make that provision, although I understand the intention, which is probably supported from all sides of the House.  Given the strong cause of support for the amendment from many Deputies, I will certainly keep the Deputy's proposal in mind and engage with her on that when developing the new scheme under the Bill if it is passed by the Houses.<\/p>  <p>  In case there is a little misunderstanding about this loan offering or tool, I reiterate that the loan in question is not administered through the banking sector.  It is through Microfinance Ireland, as a non-profit bank.  The Deputy referred again to the traditional banking sector but that does not apply in this case.  The loans are not granted through banks that might make profits for other reasons.  That is not what this is about.  It is a not-for-profit bank.  For this kind of money, I accept that many different applications are coming through from businesses that are quite sound and just need a little help, which is what we are trying to do, but traditionally the microfinance loan is about funding new start-ups that do not have a history to base their credit rating on or businesses that are finding it difficult to access money.  It is generally a high-risk category associated with quite high losses, which the taxpayer funds.  That is our job and we are happy to foster the opportunity to create jobs.<\/p>  <p>  This kind of money is usually very expensive.  In many sectors, this could be money with an interest rate of 14% or 15%, and we are making it available already at 4.5%.  It was traditionally a 7% or 8% rate, reduced to 4.5% and effectively 3%, but we will re-examine that.  To be fair to Microfinance Ireland, the loans are not for profit, even though there has been a perception from some contributors in the House in recent days that they are.  I accept that other loan offerings and measures we offer are administered through the banks but this is not.

Then there are the secondary aspects of this, namely, the jobs that will be lost directly and the knock-on effects for suppliers, including the loss of more jobs.<\/p> <p>Also to be considered are the ancillary costs of unemployment, not least the impact on the person training people, and the costs of medical cards and housing assistance payments.  If even a portion of the jobs were to be saved by having an interest rate of 0% for a short duration, to give people a fighting chance to get back up and running, it would make very good economic sense.  Those kinds of things have to be factored in when considering the interest rate.  When the Minister of State talks about high risk, he should note the highest risk is that of not getting people back to work.  The expensive money may well be even more expensive because we have to borrow it as a State, if we are running deficits, to increase the amount available to a cohort who would be unemployed, for example.<\/p> <p> I hope the Minister of State will consider this fund in the round and not exclusively as a microfinance fund.  I ask him to consider how many jobs the fund might save.  Deputy O'Reilly made the point that those affected did not close their businesses and did not plan and could not have planned for what happened.  Therefore, it is not a matter of examining how such a fund was handled in the past but of accounting for what is a unique situation.  Counterparts across Europe have lower interest rates.  We have the double whammy associated with the risk of a no-deal Brexit.  Even if there is a deal, it will have an impact on the economy so there is a genuine argument for the fund to be seen as an investment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070800027#EE00400","speaker":"1489","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1594215300,"counter":160,"content":"<p>I had hoped to contribute to the debate on Second Stage but, unfortunately, the arrangements were such that I was not able to get across from Leinster House to here.<\/p>  <p>  We have to begin to understand why we are at this juncture and why this funding is necessary.  It is necessary because, for nine years, the Fine Gael Government failed to understand the need for direct funding for businesses to support them after the financial crash.  It ignored the fact that the main pillar banks completely blocked any attempt by microbusinesses to engage with them, obtain funding and restructure their loans in an effective and sustainable way.  Essentially, the Fine Gael Government failed the indigenous business sector and, as a result, we must find some mechanism, this legislation being one, to put money into the sector to allow the businesses to obtain funds at a reasonable rate.  I suggest a reasonable rate of 0%.<\/p>  <p>  At the hearings of the Special Committee on Covid-19 Response, business representatives told us they had not been consulted in any meaningful way on the method to put the money required into the sector.  For this reason, there is a misunderstanding in the Government regarding the extent of the problem we are dealing with.  The extent of the problem can be summed up as follows.  The banks literally screwed the SME sector and made it impossible for SMEs to conduct their business properly and efficiently over the past nine years.  There was little or no Government intervention during that period.  The SMEs were trying to restructure themselves financially after the crash and are still trying to do so.  They were only coming to the point of managing their debt when they were struck by the Covid-19 pandemic and the closure of their businesses.<\/p>  <p>  Therefore, we should not see funding at a rate of 4% as doing the businesses a favour.  We should see this as the State's responsibility to rescue the sector, which is made up of small family businesses throughout the country.  The businesses are keeping their communities alive.  They have not got the surplus money to carry a burden of debt, even at a rate of 4%.  I should not say all of them are in this category as some of them do have a surplus, but the majority are on their knees seeking direct support from the Government in the form of a grant or a rate of 0%.  The criteria have to allow the small businesses to restructure their existing debt.  There should be further funding, provided in a sustainable way, to guarantee the jobs the businesses fought so hard to create over the lifetime of a family or over generations.  We cannot ignore the fact that many of these businesses will simply not be able to access the fund.  Therefore, we must remove the red tape and bureaucracy and make it simple for them to get the funding to prove they can sustain the debt.  The interest rate is a killer for small businesses and needs to be explored.<\/p>  <p>  I draw the attention of the Minister of State to the fact that during the hearings of the Covid-19 committee, many of the sectors, represented by their national bodies, told us they were not asked for their views and had no input.  They particularly wanted to have an input into the July stimulus.  They have not got that opportunity.  The representatives told the committee that specific interventions are needed on a sectoral basis.  Without going into the detail of what each sector might want, I contend that the main issue for each sector was that it could not access funds.  Even today, the banks are causing the same difficulties that they caused during and after the financial crash.  Funds like the one in question, which are being made available by the Government, are essential to the sector.  The rate is critical in terms of structuring and the criteria used for applications.<\/p>  <p>  I will support everything to do with the SME sector but I have to take issue with the fact that we are not engaged fully enough with it to learn from the Government mistakes and for businesses to learn from their mistakes so we will not make the same mistakes over and over again.  In the nine-year period, we should have learned a huge amount.  I ask the Minister of State to review the criteria to enable the SME sector, especially the very small businesses, to gain access to the money.  He should review the interest rates the Government is proposing to charge and reflect on the fact that while the banks may say, through their advertising, that they are open for business and supporting the SME sector, they are not.  The evidence is the closure of many of the shops in the villages and towns throughout our constituencies.  If the new Government is to represent change, the change would be to listen, learn and put the appropriate supports in place that will support each and every sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070800028#FF00200","speaker":"1496"},{"type":"speech","time":1594215300,"counter":161,"content":"<p>I am conscious that Deputy Catherine Murphy, who probably has to leave now, and Deputy McGuinness were not here for the whole debate.  To reiterate, it is not that we are disagreeing with the need for businesses to have access to low-cost finance - that is what we are trying to achieve - but the microfinance loan is only one mechanism and does not comprise all the mechanisms.<\/p> <p>Eight or nine years ago I supported the idea of a State-led recovery bank for small and medium enterprises and I championed the cause in committees.  I was surprised a version of that in the microfinance loan, which was a small intervention of direct lending not through normal banks, did not see a higher demand.  The application process indicated there was not much demand then, although there is a demand for the product now.  That is why we are increasing the amounts that can be loaned and decreasing the rate charged.  The demand was not there, so the Deputy is not technically correct in saying the previous Government got everything wrong.  Access to finance did not continue to be the massive issue I thought it would be in the earlier years of that recession.  Many still did not get the finance they needed and in some cases the banks did not facilitate success for everybody but there was a massive recovery in jobs, growth and the economy.<\/p> <p> It is not true to say the previous two Governments failed in this respect.  That is not to say they got everything perfect and there are still many areas of the country that had not recovered even before the onset of Covid-19.  We will continue to work on that.  It was not necessarily all down to access to finance.  I would have agreed with the Deputy nine years ago that the State had to be involved with direct lending.  We did so but the demand for it was lower than what I thought it would have been.  That is probably because the credit guarantee scheme was very successful.  We are expanding that as well and the legislation will be here next week or the week after.  It is an important part of the process.  This type of direct lending, the microfinance loan, is for a targeted market that is generally a high risk.  I stressed during my contribution how the applications to this process have changed and there is evidence of very viable businesses applying that are just going through a difficult time.  We are trying to respond to that as quickly as possible.<\/p> <p> I have committed to looking at the interest rate and I do not see it as the barrier that the Deputy says it is.  Access to funding is a major obstacle and that is why we want to get money to these businesses as quickly as possible.  This is a not-for-profit organisation and we are not profiteering on the interest rate.  It has come down from 8% to 4%, with a six-month moratorium.  It is effectively a zero cost for six months and costs will naturally go up after this.<\/p> <p> I have listened to the argument and we will focus on this as we put the scheme together in the weeks ahead.  The State must, through its Departments, reach out to as many sectors as possible to sustain, grow and restart as many businesses and jobs as possible.  This does not mean we can give grants to everybody but we must intervene where we can with grants, equity, access to loans and so on.  We must use all the different tools in the box.  We do not have a bottomless purse, as much as we wish we had, but we must use what we have in taxpayers' money.  We will also borrow extensively to reach out to all the sectors we can to save those jobs.  This is not to say the Government does not recognise the demand or need for grants.  We know about it and we will try to respond as best we can.<\/p> <p> The changes in this legislation include the availability of money at low interest and an easier application process.  It is a streamlined process, although it is limited to &euro;50,000.  Businesses probably need more but there are other schemes for such cases.  This is only one access point and there are also restart grants.  Businesses have indicated to me that the most important tool in recent months has been the wage subsidy scheme and they want that to continue.<\/p> <p> I take issue with Deputy McGuinness saying that businesses feel they have not been listened to.  I accept that during the past three or four months of the emergency they may not have had enough time to be listened to properly, but I understand the previous Minister, Deputy Humphreys, engaged quite a lot with all the sectors during recent months to bring forward supports.  Other Ministers did likewise.  As the lead Minister in my Department, the T&aacute;naiste has engaged over the past week and even before that with such issues.  Both the Minister of State, Deputy Troy, and I are already sending messages to all sectors to come to us quickly with initial ideas for the July stimulus, which is not yet finished.  We will take ideas from everybody who contributed in the D&aacute;il yesterday and today.  I would love to sit down with Deputy McGuinness to hear his ideas too.  We will take all of them in and do what we can in this July stimulus.  We will return around the time of the budget with the long-term economic recovery plan.<\/p> <p> We will of course listen to all the sectors and representative bodies of businesses because they have many good ideas.  It is our job as a Department to engage with such stakeholders, use those ideas and apply our imagination.  We will not be limited in our imagination in trying to expand these schemes.  Naturally, we will look abroad and take on board ideas for good schemes.  We are very open to that.<\/p> <p> I take issue with the comment that nobody is being listened to.  We have a proven track record as a Department that we listen to everybody.  The former Minister, Deputy Bruton, and I involved every stakeholder we could find in the country in the Action Plan for Jobs.  They played a major role in what was a major jobs recovery.  It can be done and it will be done again.  This does not mean we got everything right but it certainly does not mean we got everything wrong.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070800028#FF00300","speaker":"1505","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1594215900,"counter":163,"content":"<p>I admit that I love to hear Members from Fianna F&aacute;il referring to \"the crash\" as if it was something that just happened and over which they had absolutely no control.  The two Deputies in the previous exchange are members of parties that were capable of agreeing the previous four budgets, so it is a bit rich for Deputy McGuinness to complain when both the parties were involved in the process.  This will not help small and medium enterprises and they do not want to hear about it.  They want to hear that the Minister understands the problem.<\/p>  <p>  I take the point about start-ups but it is not helpful for the Minister of State to say microfinancing is normally very risky.  This is not the same and we are not talking about a couple of young fellows with a dream.  These are viable businesses that may have had to close because of a global pandemic.  They want to reopen and get back on their feet.  They are looking for a hand up and not a dig out.  For this to happen there must be recognition that this is not microfinance in normal circumstances.  These are unprecedented times and they require an unprecedented and imaginative response.  There is not the same level of risk as there would be with a start-up.  These are proven businesses and, essentially, they are asleep.  They just need sustainable and affordable help from the State.<\/p>  <p>  This amendment seeks to cap interest rates at 2%.  As I stated, that is not a target but rather a cap.  I welcome the Minister of State's offer to engage and I am more than happy to do that.

As the Minister of State, Deputy English, has stated, it may be the case that we were in the middle of a global pandemic and perhaps there was not time for that to happen.  Time is there now and these businesses must be absolutely central, as must be the representatives of workers, when the Government puts together its July stimulus.  It must respond to the needs of businesses and workers.  This recovery will not be built on the back of precarious employment and low wages.  If there is to be a recovery at all, it must be built on decent jobs and work and fair terms and conditions of employment.<\/p>  <p>  As I stated, the amendment seeks to cap interest rates at 2% and that is in no way outrageous.  The Minister of State has said nobody is trying to seek to profit from this but we must absolutely factor in that this is not microfinance in the normal run of things.

It is not that we do not support the goal of an interest rate that everybody can manage in accessing funding.  This is what the loan process looks to achieve.<\/p>  <p>  It often happens in a debate that people take out one word from a contribution.  I referred to \"risk\" and, to be fair, the Deputy knows what I meant.  She is being a little bit smart in trying to change the course of the debate.  I refer to the overall cost of the scheme, and when I say it is not for profit, I mean it is not for profit.  There is no profit to be made here.  Generally, finance of this nature to clients taken on by Microfinance Ireland in the past would have been of high risk, although not in all cases.  There is quite a high level of loans that are not repaid, and the taxpayer subsidises them.  That is part of our job to give companies a chance to restart.  We are prepared to do the same again and put the money in.  That does not mean I am saying all the applicants are a high risk, and it is unfair to refer to my comments like that.  I am being realistic in referring to the cost of a fund like this.<\/p>  <p>  This type of loan will absolutely continue to be available to start-ups as there will be more of them in future.  In 2011, 2012 and 2013, we pumped much money into such start-ups because it was part of the process of creating more jobs.  Some people will not be able to get back to the jobs they had and we must get behind them.  We must give them a new opportunity, and that is what this fund is for.  In the next couple of months it will be for the companies that want to borrow money at low cost to restart or go again.  That is what it is for and it is the reason we are making changes.

The Minister will know that during the general election, which feels like an awfully long time ago, housing was one of the issues most often raised on doorsteps.  While the Covid-19 pandemic has taken many people's minds off the housing crisis in this State, in many ways it has just pulled a plaster over the reality of housing need in this country.  We wish to speak about those who rent and those who have been disproportionately impacted by the pandemic.<\/p><p>I know that the Minister will appreciate that we have had a dysfunctional housing market for many years.  In a European context, Ireland depends disproportionately on the private sector.  As we have said and will continue to say for as long as anyone is willing to hear us, the market has no conscience.  The private sector has a profit motive.  As such, we should not allow people in housing need to depend on the market or rely disproportionately on the private sector.  We in the Labour Party strongly believe that the State has to take its role seriously.  The State should provide housing and those who are renting should be able to depend on the State to have their backs.<\/p><p>The Labour Party has some very simple suggestions.  Last night I spoke about the need for a rent-to-buy scheme.  It is impossible for young couples or individuals to rent and save simultaneously.  We have had such schemes in the past and the State should support them in the future.  Unfortunately, there has been a sense in recent years that the State, the Government or the Department do not want to intervene in the market.  We have to intervene.  It has been shown time and time again that the market fails consistently when it comes to housing people.  We should not go through another of the cycles we have witnessed in the past 20 years or so. <\/p><p>The Labour Party wants the Minister to agree to a State support scheme for rental arrears; legal protection from eviction because of rent or mortgage arrears; an extension of the moratorium on rent increases and evictions; and a ban on bank penalties for mortgage arrears.  My colleagues will speak about other areas.  I wish to speak about the need for a State support scheme for rental arrears.  I want to outline to the Minister who renters are.  Before I touch on that, I again remind the Minister that we have a low-pay economy.  That is what we have constructed.  That is what this economic recovery is based upon.  As my colleague, Deputy Nash, frequently reminds this House, 23% of Irish workers were in low-paid work before Covid-19 according to the OECD.  About 40% of people under the age of 30 are in insecure work.  Someone on low pay can only get accommodation of a low standard.  If someone is in insecure work, his or her accommodation is also insecure.  The labour market, the rental market and the housing market are interlinked and we cannot divorce them.<\/p><p>I will speak about the State support scheme for rental arrears that we want and why we want it.  Let us think about younger workers, to whom I have already alluded.  Younger workers are disproportionately affected by Covid-19 lay-offs.  Approximately 60% of those aged 18 to 19 are out of work and 47% of those aged 20 to 24 are out of work.  Over the weekend Mr. James Doorley of the National Youth Council noted that youth unemployment in Ireland now stands at 45%.  Younger workers are also much more likely to live in rented accommodation.  Some 30% of those aged between 20 and 24 and 42% of those aged between 25 and 34 are renting.<\/p><p>Job losses have also occurred in sectors where a large number of workers rent.  Renters account for 38% of workers in the accommodation and food sectors, 28% of workers in the administration and support sector, 27% of retail workers, 23% of those who work in the arts, and 21% of those who work in construction.  Huge numbers of people whose lives and livelihoods have been hugely affected by the current crisis are in rented accommodation.  Around 200,000 renters are in the sectors most severely affected by job losses.  Essentials make up about 40% of a renter's total spending.  The comparable figure for owner-occupiers is just 36%.  Renters lead a more difficult life.  They are less able to weather storms, including this one.  Are we going to leave them to the market and the private sector or are we going to provide them with the protection of the State?  That is where the Minister comes in.<\/p><p>Departmental figures from May show that the number of people who are in debt, are renting and have low-paid jobs is still very high.  As I have outlined, low-skilled and low-wage jobs are disproportionately held by young people, migrant workers and female workers.  There is an equality dimension to this.  Supports such as interest-free loans or tax credits for renters are necessary to alleviate debt built up as a result of job losses.  This is going to last for years.  While we may come out of the immediate health crisis, its effects are going to last for quite a long time, as the Minister knows.<\/p><p>Threshold has created a profile of the renters impacted by Covid-19.  Younger single people make up about 60% of the callers seeking assistance from Threshold.  Some 69% of those calling have reported losing their homes as a result of Covid-19.  Many callers did not know about rent supplements.  If a tenant leaves a house share, the remaining tenants become liable for larger rents.  There has been a significant increase in queries regarding arrears.  Couples and families are disproportionately affected and one-parent families experience a secondary effect.<\/p> <p> In putting forward this motion, we are outlining very clearly to the Minister that the demographic in question, namely, people who rent, was already suffering under the economic model we have pursued.  We are living in an economy where a disproportionate amount of the income people accrue is spent on accommodation.  I think the Minister will acknowledge that.  As I understand it, nowhere else in Europe is as high a portion of people's income spent on accommodation by way of either mortgages or rent.  We are now in a situation where the collapse in employment is disproportionately affecting those who have been renting.  Those people need protections from the State against the excesses of the market, which has no conscious, and the excesses of the private sector, which has a profit motive.  That is where the Minister comes in.<\/p> <p> My colleague, Deputy Nash, will touch on other issues and we would appreciate the Minister's feedback on all of them.  The last thing we need in this D&aacute;il is for Labour Party Deputies or any other Members to come into the Chamber to give valid suggestions only for the Minister to do what Governments have traditionally done, which is to put down an amendment and we all walk away having achieved nothing.  Our objective is that people who are witnessing their lives falling apart can look at this Parliament and see a group of people who are working for them and not just playing the game.  We in the Labour Party have no interest in playing the game.  Our interest is in representing people, getting things over the line and setting up schemes that will affect people's lives in a positive way.  All of those things are in the gift of the Minister.  We want to know whether he is going to stand by the State or stand by the market.  Will he stand by the public sector and public provision of housing or will he stand by private provision, which, as we have seen, has failed time and time again?  We very much want the Minister to deal with our motion in the spirit in which it is presented.  We are solutions-driven and we are not here to play games.  We are here to find real housing solutions for the people of this country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070800031#KK00200","speaker":"1551","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1594217700,"counter":180,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister and wish him well on his appointment.  We hope he will accept the sentiments contained in this motion.  One of our key aims is that action be taken to protect mortgage holders who accrue interest and penalties as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic.  I have read the Government amendment and it does nothing to alleviate the situation being experienced by tens of thousands of families across the country.  Referring a struggling family who will have to pay an additional &euro;4,300 in interest on a 30-year mortgage of &euro;300,000 to the code of conduct on mortgage arrears is nothing short of a slap in the face.  These are people who have lost their jobs through no fault of their own and, in many cases, through no fault of the businesses that employed them.<\/p><p>As matters stand, the interest owed amounts to approximately &euro;150 million.  Instead of instructing the banks to cover that quantum of money, the Government is taking a hands-off approach.  The Taoiseach's response this morning to questions from my party leader, Deputy Kelly, was nothing short of weak and anaemic.  We are told that the Minister for Finance will meet the banks to have a discussion about this issue.  In everyone's experience, a meeting with the banks will do nothing to alleviate this aggravating situation for tens of thousands of families across the country.  The Minister is only one week in government but already he and his party are being schooled, once again, by the banks.  The European Banking Authority and the Central Bank have confirmed what we already knew, namely, that there is no obligation whatsoever to place high interest rates on the accrual of mortgage debt during this period.  AIB, Bank of Ireland and all the others are doing so simply because they can and the Government continues to allow them to do so.  There is nothing stopping the banks from taking a different course.  The reality is that the Government is taking a hands-off approach and that cannot continue.<\/p><p>I listened very intently earlier to what the representative of the Banking &amp;amp; Payments Federation Ireland had to say in an interview on RT&Eacute; Radio 1.  I was astounded that he sought to divide those who can pay their mortgages at the moment from those who cannot.  He said, in essence, that any interest break would have to be paid for by other clients of the bank.  In other words, he was placing an obligation on the 90% of people who can pay their mortgage to carry the can, as it were, for those who cannot.  We know where those kinds of arguments take us.  They are the types of arguments used to pit public sector workers against private sector workers and <i>vice versa<\/i>.  It is not a socially constructive thing to do.<\/p><p>We know that the banks have recorded very substantial profits in recent years.  AIB, for example, in which the State has a more than 70% stake, has made huge profits.  The banking sector was bailed out by a framework designed and co-created by Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party.  It is high time that the Minister and his colleagues in government reminded the banks of their social and economic obligation to this country.  They should be reminded that their obligation is not just to their shareholders but also to wider society and to those people who are struggling at the moment.<\/p><p>We need a clear answer from the Minister today as to what practical actions he will take.  We need to hear that he will not just be having a conversation with the banks but that he will, if required, change the law to provide protections for those who are in mortgage arrears.  It is an absolute scandal that interest rates are being applied to warehoused portions of mortgages at a time when people can ill afford to meet their repayments.  The Minister needs to address this issue clearly and to reassure the people of Ireland that he is on their side, not the side of the banks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070800032#LL00200","speaker":"1599"},{"type":"speech","time":1594217700,"counter":181,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 1:<\/p> <blockquote> \tTo delete all words after &quot;D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann&quot; and substitute the following:<br \/><br \/>&quot;recognises that the Programme for Government &ndash; Our Shared Future acknowledges that Covid-19 has presented the global community with a terrible set of challenges to add to the ongoing climate and biodiversity emergency;<br \/><br \/>acknowledges the extensive range of measures included in the Programme for Government &ndash; Our Shared Future, building on the initiatives already undertaken and in progress, which will be brought forward to support individuals and families in dealing with the financial implications of Covid-19 and to access affordable housing and, in particular, notes that:  \t- the Government has confirmed its overarching housing policy principle that everybody should have access to good-quality housing to purchase or rent at an affordable price, built to a high standard, and located close to essential services, offering a high quality of life; and<br \/><br \/>- the focus in recovery will be to get people back to work as quickly as possible.

Hundreds of thousands of people have had their incomes largely protected during the restrictions and thousands will continue to rely on the State for months to come.

It follows on from the very constructive approach they took last night in the debate on affordable housing.  I will take on board the suggestions that are put forward in contributions today.  I took extensive notes during the debate last night and will be responding to those Members who were constructive in their suggestions, such as those in respect of the rent-to-buy scheme.  The Government and I do not have all the solutions.  We are dealing with a housing crisis, a rent and mortgage arrears problem and a Covid pandemic.  We must deal with all of these issues in order to get our country through this phase and onward towards recovery.<\/p><p>Deputy Nash spoke about the interest being charged in respect of mortgage payments not paid during the moratorium.  The only mortgages I have control of are the Rebuilding Ireland home loans.  Those State-backed mortgages are still being given.  There is no blanket ban on lending and the message to the contrary that was put out is not true.  There is no interest being charged on those mortgages and nor will there be.  They are the loans over which I have direct control.  The Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, will speak about the revision being prepared by the Minister for Finance as part of a review of the code of conduct on mortgage arrears.  I can only speak on what I, as Minister, have immediate remit and control over, but I absolutely agree that the response to this issue has to be a cross-Government one.<\/p><p>Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in spoke about State intervention in the market and the State leading by example.  I support that, as does the Government.  It is why I outlined last night the initial process in regard to setting up a State-backed affordable purchase and rental scheme.  It is why we have included in the programme for Government that we want to get local authorities back building and delivering public homes on public land.  Our aims in providing housing for all are specifically set out in the relevant section of the programme for Government and they are things this Government is determined to do.<\/p><p>I will deal now with the specific issues raised in the Private Members' motion.<\/p> <p>I reiterate that I genuinely welcome the motion and the constructive way in which it is being put forward.<\/p> <p> Covid-19 has presented this country and the global community with enormous challenges over the past four months.  These add to the ongoing climate and biodiversity emergency.  The pandemic continues to present challenges.  The programme for Government, Our Shared Future, asserts the Government's ambition to meet those challenges, repair the damage that has been inflicted on our people by the pandemic and take the renewed spirit arising from these challenging times and translate it into action.  The Roadmap for Reopening Society and Business, published in May by the previous Government, recognised that within a few weeks of the first cases of Covid-19 being reported in Ireland at the end of February, it became necessary to take unprecedented steps to control the disease.  Restrictions on the movement of people were necessary to suppress the spread of Covid-19 and minimise its impact in Ireland.  This has been a very stressful and testing time for our people.<\/p> <p> Ireland's continued success in suppressing the spread of Covid-19 is a testament to our collective resolve to fight it head on.  Together, our actions have allowed an acceleration in the relaxation of the broad restrictions on the movement of people to occur with reasonable confidence, but requisite caution.  We are not yet out of the woods, but the relaxation can and should be cautiously welcomed.  Our public health officials have earned the respect of the people of our country and the Government.  We will continue to work with them to carefully monitor the threat and management of Covid-19.<\/p> <p> Our society and businesses are set to continue to gradually open up in the coming weeks.  The economic impact of the pandemic will continue to be felt in all parts of the country and, indeed, society.  As the Taoiseach has stated, there is no question but that our first priority as a Government is to continue the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic and to move decisively to recover from its devastating social, economic and cultural impact.  The key goal is to get as many people back working in a safe manner as soon as possible.<\/p> <p> As Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, I know that people need to get back to work and be able to pay their mortgage or rent and other bills as soon as possible.  Income supports continue to be available on the housing front and will be available long after the Covid-19 threat expires.  The Government is committed to helping people who need help to meet their housing needs.  It believes that everybody should have access to good quality housing to purchase or rent at an affordable price, built to a high standard and located close to essential services offering a high quality of life.  We understand that the provision of more affordable housing has a profound benefit socially and economically and we believe that the State has a fundamental role in enabling the delivery of new homes and ensuring that the best use is made of existing stock.<\/p> <p> The amendment I tabled on behalf of the Government seeks to recognise and highlight the State supports available and the commitments contained in the programme for Government, Our Shared Future, to continue to manage the fallout from Covid-19 for all households.  The programme for Government contains a commitment to extending the moratorium on the termination of tenancies in line with public health advice so long as the requirements of section 4 of the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020 are met.  Further, it also contains a commitment to improving the supply and affordability of rental accommodation and security of tenure for renters by delivering a new deal for renters.  There is also a commitment in terms of introducing the necessary reforms of the personal insolvency legislation and to ensuring that sufficient supports are in place for mortgage holders with repayment difficulties to access the code of conduct on mortgage arrears, including the available suite of alternative repayment arrangements, and to ensuring it has full legal effect.<\/p> <p> Emergency legal measures with effect from 27 March 2020 were introduced to protect tenants during the Covid-19 emergency period.  Tenants cannot be forced to leave their rental accommodation other than in exceptional circumstances and rent increases are prohibited for the duration of the emergency period.  These emergency laws initially applied for a period of three months from the enactment of the Act but, on the request of the former Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, the previous Government by order extended their application to 20 July.  The emergency laws set out the legal process for extending the Covid-19 emergency period.  The Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government must request that the Government make the order having consulted with the Minister for Health and with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  The Government must consider such extension appropriate and be satisfied that it is in the public interest, having regard to the threat to public health, the highly contagious nature of Covid-19 and the need to restrict the movement of persons to prevent its spread.<\/p> <p> Tenants are required to pay rent to their landlords during the Covid-19 emergency period.  Any tenants having difficulty so doing are encouraged to engage with their landlords at the earliest opportunity.  They should also engage with the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection as income support and the emergency simplified rent supplement are available.  I will turn to that matter when I address the number of people who have accessed that payment in the relevant period.  I encourage landlords and tenants to communicate with each other during the emergency period, as many have done, to see whether a resolution to any dispute can be found.  The Residential Tenancies Board is encouraging all customers who require assistance or advice to contact it via its web service as there may have been delays answering its phone lines during the period of the emergency.<\/p> <p> Any future request for the Government to make an order extending the emergency period will be made at the appropriate time and in accordance with the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020.  As we approach 20 July, I am conscious that I will be writing to the Minister for Health, Deputy Donnelly, to ask whether the public health situation merits a further extension of this moratorium.  If it is justified, I will bring a proposal to the Government accordingly.  I will consider the economic situation as well as giving consideration to renters and possible further measures that may be put in place should they be needed.<\/p> <p> The Government has made efforts to ensure that social housing supports are provided as efficiently and fairly as possible during the Covid-19 pandemic.  Housing assistance payment, HAP, tenants who are not financially impacted upon by the Covid-19 measures are expected to continue to pay their full HAP differential.  However, local authorities should reassess tenants whose circumstances have changed or do change and adjust their differential rent accordingly.  Local authorities have been requested to ensure that HAP tenants newly in receipt of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection supports be facilitated in remaining in their HAP tenancies.  If amendments cannot be made immediately to a tenant's differential rent amount, any arrears accumulating from the date of approval of the new Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection support should be rectified at a later date.  This will not affect the payment to the landlord.<\/p> <p> The rent supplement scheme continues to provide short-term income to eligible people living in private rented accommodation whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.  The scheme ensures that renters experiencing a temporary loss of employment during this emergency can continue to meet their rental commitments.  A point that Members may find of interest is that since the introduction of the previous Government's emergency response, slightly fewer than 7,000 customers have been provided with the rent supplement support.  There are an additional approximately 1,100 pending applications.  When those figures are compared with the fact that nearly 1 million people are in receipt of support under the wage subsidy scheme or the pandemic unemployment payment, it is clear that only a small percentage of the number receiving other emergency supports have sought or are seeking the emergency rent supplement payment.  I encourage people whose circumstances have changed to access the emergency rent supplement payment.<\/p> <p> The response from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection to the Covid-19 emergency has ensured flexibility in the rent supplement scheme via specific measures to prevent undue delays in processing applications despite the large number of new cases received over a very short timeframe.  The two to three day turnaround of applications ensures that customers do not build up rent arrears.  Officers attempt to ensure that applicants' rental obligations are met in full.  The scheme offers a safety net within the overall social welfare system by providing assistance to those whose means are insufficient to meet their needs and those of their dependants.<\/p>  <p>The main purpose of the scheme is to provide immediate and flexible assistance to those who need it who do not qualify for the payment under other State schemes.  There are several payments within the scheme, including a once-off exceptional needs payment which can cover rent arrears.  I have asked for further flexibility to be shown in that regard should there be a situation whereby we see a substantial debt burden after the pandemic.  Where a person has a change of circumstances such as loss of income, that person should notify the relevant authority in the case of a HAP claim or the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection for rent supplement to access any payment that can be made.<\/p> <p> My Department and the ESRI operate a programme of collaborative research, principally focused on housing economics.  Under this programme, researchers from the ESRI and the Department were asked to prepare a research paper exploring the short run implications of the Covid-19 pandemic for the private rental sector.  I anticipate that this research will be published shortly.  I have not yet received it.  That will help to inform me as the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, and the Government in our policy and approach to any potential rent arrears in the private rental sector.  Preliminary findings indicate that there has not been a significant build-up of arrears over the period from April to June.  Having said that, if the research leads to a contrary finding for those who are in arrears, we will bring forward measures to address and assist in that area.<\/p> <p> The Government already has a number of specific supports in place to mitigate the effects of the pandemic on our society.  The key factor is to monitor carefully their effect, to ensure that they remain fit for purpose and that we gradually and safely ease the Covid-19 restrictions.  I thank the Labour Party for tabling this motion.  I am acutely aware that we are not through the pandemic just yet.  We have vulnerable people in the private rental sector.  I want us to build our public rental stock substantially over the next few years but we need an immediate response by Government to deal with any residual rent arrears.  I encourage anyone who has lost his or her job, or whose income has been affected by the Covid-19 pandemic, to use the emergency rent supplement application and scheme, which is there for them.  There should not be a large build-up of rent arrears.  If there is, based on independent research done by the ESRI, the Government will then seek to address that at the appropriate time with the proper, independent research that we have already sought in our preliminary planning.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070800032#LL00300","speaker":"1561","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1594218900,"counter":184,"content":"<p>I thank the Labour Party for introducing this important motion.

To try to establish some sense of it ourselves, Sinn F&eacute;in launched an online survey for renters over a month ago.  About 1,000 renters across the State responded.  While it is not a scientifically representative sample and we do not claim that it is, it had a good geographical, age and income mix.  That survey told us 60% of renters who replied had lost jobs or income as a result of Covid-19.  Some 55% spoke to their landlord about some form of debt relief.  Some 40% found their landlords helpful and 40% found their landlords unhelpful.  Interestingly, 58% of respondents had never heard of the Covid-19 rent supplement payment and that is one reason why the take-up is so low.  The Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection has not been advertising this support, unlike the other supports.  Some 60% of respondents were worried about rent arrears post the Covid-19 restrictions.  About 70% thought they would have a minimum of &euro;3,000 of rent arrears.  A further 13% felt they would have rent arrears of up to &euro;5,000.<\/p>  <p>  Our view is very simple.  The Minister, as a matter of urgency, must extend the ban on rent increases, on notices to quit and evictions.  He and his colleagues must do more to advertise rent supplement.  He must put in place a rent arrears debt resolution process through the Residential Tenancies Board that will include, among other things, the possibility of partial or full rent write-downs.

While we support the Labour Party motion, I know that it does not deal with the issue of payment breaks.  It talks instead about penalties as opposed to interest and about mortgage arrears as opposed to payment breaks.  In payment breaks, one does not accrue mortgage arrears.  I think its spirit is in that line, given what Deputy Nash said.  I welcome that this is now getting more coverage.<\/p>  <p>  Before me I have a letter from Permanent TSB to a customer who availed of a three month payment break.  The cost of the person's mortgage will increase by more than &euro;7,700 as a result of that three month break.  If he goes for an extension to six months, it will skyrocket further.  This is not the first time that I have put this on the agenda of this House.  I raised it with the Minister for Finance in April.  I have produced legislation on this and gave it to the Minister for Finance three weeks ago.  Yesterday was not the first time that we learned about it.  Maybe it was the first time that others learned of it.  This is not the way that it has to be done in this State because we know from the Central Bank's correspondence to me that one does not have to charge interest rates, loans will not go into default and it will not trigger a credit mechanism, because we can see what happened in Spain at the end of March and what Belgium and Germany did.  They were able to protect their citizens from the attacks by banks charging interest rates.  This is the time for Government to stand up, particularly with banks that we own, and lay down a rule that banks will not be allowed to profit on the back of this pandemic, at a time when Government rightly had to close down our economy to keep our people safe.  It is not acceptable for banks to say that it is the time for them to feather their nests, fill their pockets and charge more for such people.  A bank is charging &euro;7,700 extra because a person's income was slashed during the pandemic and a State-owned bank sees it as an opportunity.

We absolutely support the call for a system to deal with rent arrears.  The Government inaction on this will just leave more children in homeless accommodation.  We in Sinn F&eacute;in have been calling for this issue to be tackled for some time.  We know from data published by the ESRI that young people and those renting are more likely to be in a more precarious situation with regard to their income due to Covid-19 restrictions.  We know that since the special Covid-19 rent supplement payment was introduced in March that the number of claims has increased by almost 40%.  We in Sinn F&eacute;in hosted a survey of renters which showed that 60% of those who took part had lost income because of Covid-19 and a similar number were really concerned about mounting rent arrears.

The Government must extend the ban on evictions until at least the end of 2020.  It must also extend the access to the Covid-19 rent supplement payment until the end of the year.  Not doing so will have disastrous consequences for people across this State and in my county, Galway.  The Simon Community has reported a drop in people entering emergency accommodation in Galway, which is as a direct result of the ban on evictions and rent increases.  There is no doubt that once this ban is lifted, there will be a wave of new homelessness, not to mention mortgage arrears.<\/p> <p>By stopping the banks from charging penalties or surcharges on mortgage arrears accrued during the pandemic and extending the ban on evictions, we can provide certainty for individuals and families as well as avoiding a potentially dangerous spiral of mortgage arrears and evictions that will cause untold distress for families throughout the State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070800034#NN00600","speaker":"1579","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1594219500,"counter":190,"content":"<p>I also welcome the Labour Party motion on housing and homelessness.  I wish that party had had the same interest in tackling those issues when it was in government and it adopted the very policies that created the crisis in housing that we now face.  The current Labour Party leader and then Minister with responsibility for housing was one of a sorry line of disastrous Ministers in that post.  The policies enacted by that Fine Gael-Labour Party Government were essentially about protecting the same vested interests Fianna F&aacute;il had allowed to destroy the economy in the first place.  It was about protecting the corporate landlords, speculators and bankers.  In their term in government they introduced a new toxic vested interest to our housing policy in the form of the vulture funds.<\/p>  <p>  We have a new Government in place and a new Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government.  I congratulate him on his appointment and wish him the best.  The sea change required by Government if we are to address our housing crisis is a willingness to stand up to those vested interests that have capitalised on the housing situation that so many families face.<\/p>  <p>  We recall that Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael told us there could not be a rent freeze.  There is one now and the only question that remains to be answered is how long it will last.  We were told there could never be a moratorium on evictions.  There is now and question that remains to be answered is how long it will last.<\/p>  <p>  This Government and its predecessors bought the lies the banks sold that they had to profit from the pandemic by charging interest.  I commend Deputy Doherty.  Primarily through his work we learned that that has been proven to be a lie despite the protestations of their spokespeople in recent times.  Because it has been proven categorically to be that case that banks do not have to charge their customers interest or to profit from this pandemic as they are intent on doing, the only question left is what the Government will do about it.<\/p>  <p>  What needs to be done?  In the first instance, the banks need to be told by Government that they are not to fleece their customers who have had to go looking for a payment break.  If they do not adhere to that instruction from Government, the Government needs to be determined to implement Deputy Doherty's legislation that will put an end to it.<\/p>  <p>  The rent freeze needs to remain in place not for three months or six months, but for years until we get a grasp on our dysfunctional rental market.  The moratorium on evictions needs to remain in place.  We have heard the experts and the people who are on the front line of this tell us that the moratorium has prevented homelessness.

I also welcome the comments from the Minister that he will listen constructively to any proposals from the Opposition and others throughout the House.<\/p>  <p>  There is little awareness of the emergency rent supplement.  There has been some uptake, but I and others have been dealing with many people who are not aware of it.  We are creating a problem of rent arrears because people who could be accessing that support do not know about it.  I appeal to the Minister to have a public information campaign on a similar scale to the other aspects of the public information campaign on Covid.  We have had advertisements on the emergency rent supplement in the newspapers and elsewhere but not on this scale.  That is needed as it will prevent a longer term problem building up.<\/p>  <p>  I want to make three key points.  I agree with the calls to extend the moratorium on evictions and rent increases.  We need to realise that evictions resulting in homelessness are not inevitable.  They are a consequence of policy and can be prevented.  That is one thing we need to focus on.  The Government can implement a range of policy options to address that.  We must learn from the mistakes made with rent and mortgages in the past ten years.  We also need to look at best practice in other countries.<\/p>  <p>  I draw the Minister's attention to a report on mortgage arrears, entitled A Lost Decade - Study in Mortgage Possession Court Lists in Ireland, published by NUI Galway.  I am sure the Minister and others will be familiar with it.  I want to focus on two recommendations in that report.  The first is a recommendation that human rights and equality training should be provided for directors of the Central Bank and for State-appointed directors of other banks.  I raised this in a parliamentary question to the Minister for Finance who has responsibility in this area.  I got detailed information back from the Minister on it.<\/p>  <p>  It is clear from the answer that while there is some training on diversity for employees and different aspects, the core human rights training that is needed for the directors to realise the impact of decisions that are made in large banks and in the Central Bank on people's human rights in terms of mortgages, arrears and evictions is not being done at present and needs to be done.  The importance of this is to create a balance so that in making these decisions while people are looking at the financial aspects, they also need to look at the human cost.  This should be a core part of their thinking.  I urge the Government to implement that recommendation from the report.<\/p>  <p>  The report also recommends that the Minister for Finance should request a quarterly report from the Central Bank along with the quarterly statistics on mortgage arrears.  That report should outline the impact of Central Bank decisions on housing rights issues and the disproportionate effects its decisions and supervisory actions have on women in particular.  We should not just be looking at the financial numbers in this; we should also be looking at the human impacts.  I urge the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, who is present, to say that to his colleague.  All of these things have a cumulative effect.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to speak about the sale of mortgages to vulture funds.  The Government should be seeking to prevent mortgage holders from having their mortgages sold on to vulture funds.  In Germany mortgages cannot be sold on to vulture funds without the consent of the mortgage holder.  If that is done in Germany, there is no reason that the same protections cannot also be afforded to people in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of the impact that evictions have on people, tackling high rates of evictions and repossessions makes good economic sense.  There is abundant proof that preventing evictions is cheaper in the long run than rehousing people after a period of housing exclusion or homelessness.  In Finland it has been shown that the cost of an eviction is between &euro;7,500 and &euro;8,000 a year, which is much more than the cost of preventing an eviction.  That should be at the core of our thinking on this.<\/p>  <p>  Research has also shown that victims of home loss frequently experience feelings of painful loss, continued longing, a general depressive mood, symptoms of psychological and social distress, and a sense of helplessness.  There are particular negative impacts for children in the loss of home and the experience of homelessness arising from evictions when the problems of rent arrears and mortgage arrears are not dealt with.<\/p>  <p>  Research shows that two years after eviction, mothers still experience significantly higher levels of material hardship and oppression than their peers.  One study of 2,000 Swedish households showed that those who had lost their legal right to a home where a landlord had applied for eviction were approximately four times more likely to die by suicide.  There is evidence of significant levels of eviction among individuals with complex support needs due to mental ill health and substance abuse.<\/p> <p>The European Federation of National Organisations Working with the Homeless has described eviction as:<\/p><blockquote>\t[...] one of the worst forms of violence that can afflict someone [...]  Eviction is not only a punishment, it is a collective abandonment of other people; prioritising one individual&rsquo;s right to own property over another individual&rsquo;s most basic needs [...]  Eviction is a humiliating and traumatising experience, which risks pushing the victim down a slippery slope towards destitution and poor self-esteem.  It constitutes a violent rupture of one&rsquo;s home life that directly feeds into the problem of homelessness. <\/blockquote> <p>There are positive international examples of good practice at which we can look.  For example, prevention of evictions has been a part of social policy in France for many decades.  Mortgage lenders in France are held liable for their irresponsible lending and, accordingly, there are much lower levels of mortgage repossessions.  A similar level of accountability should happen in Ireland and the Government has a role to play in that.<br\/><br\/>In Spain, tenants of small-scale landlords may seek a suspension of rent payments during the pandemic crisis and if they are unable to reach agreement with their landlord, they can avail of interest-free loans.  Those tenants continue to pay their rents with the loans to be repaid over a period of six years.  For tenants of large-scale landlords with more than ten properties, if the tenant and landlord cannot reach agreement on a postponement of the rent, the landlord is required to either cut the rent by 50% for the duration of the crisis or accept a suspension of rental payments for the crisis period with the rent then repaid over the following three years without interest.  We need to look at similar schemes in Ireland.<br\/><br\/>I want to mention three principles that we should agree on.  While we need an extension on the moratorium, we should first look at the rental sector and getting rid of most of the grounds for eviction.  We need to be strong on the point that the private rental sector provides people's home first and foremost, and those properties should not be financial or investment assets.  Those considerations are secondary.<br\/><br\/>We need absolutely to prioritise that there should be no evictions into homelessness.  Several EU countries already have a policy of never evicting families into homeless and we should have the same policy in Ireland.  In many countries, such as Scotland and Germany, the courts must notify the local authority and social services immediately of any impending eviction so that rehousing can be arranged.  We should have a similar formal arrangement in place in Ireland.<br\/><br\/>We also need mediation and payment plans where evictions are being looked at and evictions should only ever be used as a last resort.  We must support tenants and landlords to reduce the risk of evictions.<br\/><br\/>The Social Democrats fully support this motion and look forward to the work the Minister will do on this issue in the coming months.  We will work constructively on this with him and other parties in the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070800035#OO00300","speaker":"1550","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1594220100,"counter":193,"content":"<p>I will be share time with Deputy Mick Barry.  I will take five minutes and he will take four.<\/p>  <p>  The eviction of people into homelessness was utterly unacceptable before the pandemic.  Solidarity-People Before Profit put forward an anti-evictions Bill that was passed with a majority in the previous D&aacute;il.  If I am correct, Fianna F&aacute;il voted for that Bill and, ultimately, that is the solution.  We need to stop evictions into homelessness and remove any grounds for eviction that are not related to genuine fault on the part of the tenant.  All of the loopholes, including sale and refurbishment of the home, that are being used by property owners and landlords, essentially to maximise the profit on the property they own at the expense of real human beings who need, and have a right to, roofs over their heads must be removed.  That is a generality but it is the solution and we should get on with it.<\/p>  <p>  That aside, allowing the eviction of people into homelessness over rent arrears, mortgage arrears or anything else is utterly incompatible with public health requirements during a pandemic.  I do not think that the Minister needs to write to the Department of Health to get advice on this because it is self-evident.  The Minister should say that, until we decide the bigger issue, as an absolute minimum nobody is going to be evicted into homelessness during the pandemic.  As long as Covid-19 is around - and it looks, sadly, as if it will be around for at least a couple of years - nobody should be evicted.  Let us say that, do it, and make sure that is the policy.<\/p>  <p>  How on earth can putting people on the street be compatible with adhering to public health guidance in terms of preventing transmission of the virus?  It cannot be done.  Where are such people supposed to wash their hands?  How is hygiene to be maintained when one does not have a bathroom or toilet?  Similar worries apply if someone enters shared accommodation in a hostel or homeless hub where kitchen and bathroom facilities must be shared.  It is incompatible with adherence to public health guidance during a pandemic for anybody to be homeless or in co-living or shared accommodation.  We should recognise that and enact the policy that is necessary to comply with the obvious need to protect the health of the public.<\/p>  <p>  As I have already mentioned, we must get rid of the unacceptable, spurious and largely profit-driven reasons for evicting people.  The Minister probably heard me mention the case of St. Helen's Court in D&uacute;n Laoghaire during the previous D&aacute;il, a saga that is continuing and sums up a lot of what we are facing.  If the eviction ban is lifted, tenants who have for two years faced four different attempts by a vulture fund to evict them will be evicted.  They will be homeless and knocking on the door of D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council which has nowhere to house them.  We should not let them be evicted, nor should we allow vulture funds to behave in that way.  They have no reasonable grounds for trying to evict these people other than wanting to maximise the value of that property and the profit that they can make out of it.  That simply should not be allowed.<\/p>  <p>  I spoke to representatives of Threshold today and they are also saying that the Government needs to proactively step in and buy rental blocks from vulture funds to keep people from being made homeless and bring them into social and affordable housing.  I suggest we do that in the case of St. Helen's Court, as was done with the Leeside apartments in Cork and in other similar cases where those kinds of threats and behaviours by vulture funds persist.  I encourage the Minister to do that.  It will save money on HAP and all the rest of it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070800036#PP00200","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1594220100,"counter":194,"content":"<p>The evictions moratorium expired two and a half weeks ago in New York city.  The backlog in eviction cases for a three-month period in that city would normally be expected to be somewhere between 50,000 and 60,000 cases but, given the rent arrears that have built up from people who lost their jobs during the pandemic, it is expected that more than 100,000 evictions could be in the pipeline in New York city.  The director of litigation at legal services for the city said the situation is the most dire thing they had ever seen.  Meanwhile, 24-7 anti-eviction protests are being organised outside homes in Brooklyn and the protestors' slogan is, \"No landlords, no cops, all evictions have to stop.\"  Are we going to see something similar here?<\/p>  <p>  This afternoon, the Community Action Tenants Union organised a protest in Blackrock, County Dublin, in opposition to an illegal eviction.  For every landlord with an itchy trigger finger, how many will obey the law now but plan to evict once the moratorium here has ended?<\/p> <p>It might not be as many as in New York city but I suspect it is far from a small number either.  That is just the first wave of evictions.  What about the second wave?  Recently, the Irish Property Owners Association put the following on its website:<\/p><blockquote>\tRent increases are prohibited during the Covid&ndash;19 emergency period.<br \/><br \/>[...] However, Rent Review notices may be served during the emergency period, note that any increase in the rent under the tenancy of a dwelling that should take effect or be payable during the emergency period will not take effect until after the day after emergency period ends. <\/blockquote> <p>Are we going to see a wave of rent increases when the rent increase moratorium ends?<br\/><br\/>Three things now need to be done.  The moratorium needs to be extended at the very least into next year.  All arrears built up during the emergency period now need to be completely written off.  If small landlords are hard hit by such a measure, a once-off emergency tax could be introduced and levied on the bigger landlords including corporate landlords to create a fund to which the smaller landlords could apply for compensation.  Last but not least, housing activists need to act on the example of the housing activists in New York city and get prepared for a real battle to defend tenants from the double threat of rent increases and a tsunami of evictions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070800036#PP00300","speaker":"1522","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1594220700,"counter":196,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in and the Labour Party for tabling this motion on another aspect of the housing issue which we, as public representatives, deal with on a regular basis.  One of the things that I come across regularly is the issue of security for tenants in the private rented sector.  As a consequence of getting a notice to leave, we are in the situation in respect of homelessness.  I have that even in a rural constituency, particularly in the southern part of the constituency in Roscommon, Monksland in Athlone and Ballinasloe, where if someone gets notice that they have to leave, trying to get any alternative accommodation is next nigh to impossible.<\/p>  <p>  I have suggested in the past and put it to the Minister now that we should look to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, where there has been a very successful tenancy scheme in place which has transformed that sector over the past 15 years.  If it is good enough in the agricultural sector, it definitely should be explored in the housing sector.  Back in the 1990s, the vast majority of farm and land leases were for 11 months.  Today, approximately half of all leases of agricultural land are of five years' duration or longer, some of them up to 15 years.  In agriculture, the taxation system has been reformed to incentivise long-term leasing of land for the public good.  Surely the same case can be made in respect of the private rented sector.  I am not talking about big landlords that have already exploited the system in this country, I am talking about landlords with one or maybe two homes.  Many of the these individuals are accidental landlords.  There could be an incentive put in place for them whereby they would lease the home to a family for five, ten or 15 years and there would be a built-in incentive.  It would provide security of tenure for the family that is renting and a guaranteed income for the accidental landlord.  It could transform the sector, as has happened right across Europe where they have long-term leases for accommodation.  That to which I refer does not happen in this country but it has happened in the agricultural sector.  Surely we should be looking at it and exploring the opportunity for families.<\/p>  <p>  The other thing I hope the Minister will look at is the reform of the fair deal or nursing home support scheme.  The previous Government was committed to reforming this in the area of the capital assessment for agricultural land and for businesses.  There is a significant anomaly that is preventing up to 9,000 homes coming onto the housing market.  The current policy under the fair deal scheme effectively bans the renting out of 9,000 vacant homes belonging to older people who are in nursing homes, because they are hit with a treble penalty under the means test rules that apply.  As a practising politician, the Minister knows well that under the social welfare system, the means test for a person's asset is either the market value of the property or the net income that is generated from that asset.  However, under the fair deal scheme, 7.5% of the market value of the house is used but on top of that if the home is rented out by an older person, 80% of the income generated, exclusive of any costs such as maintenance or letting, is also included in the means analysis.  It gets worse.  If that rent goes through the older person's bank account, it is also considered capital on deposit and is calculated at a further 7.5%.  If a vacant property is leased out by a family that is looking to put a roof over the heads of some of those homeless families we have across the country, the older person in the nursing home is facing a means assessment with a treble penalty put on it.  Some of these properties have 1,000 Mbps high-speed broadband outside the door.<\/p>  <p>  Down the road, some of those 9,000 properties to which I refer will eventually be sold but we are usually talking years by the time a property has gone through probate and everything else.  The properties in question will require significant investment at that stage, yet they are houses that people were dwelling in up to a few weeks or months ago.  As already stated, there are 9,000 such homes.  At the moment, there are 14,000 people with property in private and public nursing homes under the fair deal scheme yet just 600 homes are being rented out.  Surely there is something fundamentally wrong if only 600 of those homes are being rented out and the reason is that the system penalises it.  I received a commitment from the Minister's predecessor that this anomaly would be addressed and I expect to see this reflected in the legislation when it comes forward.<\/p>  <p>  Another issue which reflects the motion of the Labour Party and has been highlighted also by Deputy Pearse Doherty is the fact that the banks are running amok during Covid-19.  They are exploiting their customers and the Central Bank is quite happy to sit on its hands and let this go on.  A couple of weeks ago, AIB had to reverse its ban on mortgage approval for couples where one of them was in receipt of the wage subsidy.  This is an issue that I took up directly with AIB because I was coming across constituents who had mortgage bans imposed on them.<\/p> <p> In recent days, the issue of interest charges has arisen.  A family with a &euro;300,000 mortgage who take a six-month payment break will end up with an interest bill of &euro;4,300.  These are families looking for a payment break because they cannot meet the current mortgage repayments and struggling as a result of Covid, and we are putting a millstone around their necks of &euro;4,300.  The banks are trying to say they have no choice but to charge interest but we now know the Central Bank has eventually woken up about this on foot of clarification from the European authorities.  The fundamental problem is that we need to split the Office of the Financial Regulator from the Central Bank.  That was the case historically and it must be done again.  We need a separate financial regulator.  The Central Bank's role in consumer protection and consumer rights needs to be moved and the consumers' advocate must have teeth and be prepared to use them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070800037#QQ00200","speaker":"1603","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1594221300,"counter":198,"content":"<p>The Rural Independent Group is next.

The banks are so arrogant that they are trying to get away with overcharging, refusing loans and withdrawing approval for families to build houses.  How, during this Covid crisis, will we ever get our people housed?<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Naughten spoke about the regulator and financial watchdog being separated from the Central Bank.  We need banking legislation, full stop.  From what I can see, there is very little banking legislation.  Legislation is in place for all of us in many areas, as are various amendments and statutory instruments, but the banks have free rein to do what they like and they do what they like.  A former Member of this House who is also a former MEP is now acting as their PR spin doctor.  It just goes on and on.

For their part, 99% of landlords are good operators who treat their tenants properly but there are also rogue landlords who do not subscribe to that approach.

I have been involved in the job of providing accommodation since I was 19 years old so I am sort of qualified to talk about the problem in Ireland today.  There is nothing wrong with people finding themselves in a position of needing to rent private accommodation.  However, renting is not the long-term solution to their housing needs.  The right thing would be to have our local authorities provide accommodation, which people would rent and eventually be able to purchase.  That is the ideal scenario for a family or a young couple who want it.  We are not like other countries where people want to rent throughout their lives.  Some people might want to do that, and it might suit them, but the majority want to have their own front door with their own key.  That is an ideal that we as politicians, and the current and future Governments, should strive to achieve.<\/p> <p>When it come to the issue of providers of what I call the private accommodation sector, our Government and politicians in this Chamber must be very careful about what they are saying when it comes to people who provide that rental accommodation.

They then have to pay the mortgages, the maintenance, the insurance bills and everything else.

Some &euro;100 million has been taken off the budget of Irish Water.  It's fixing of leaks is stopping now because the money is gone halfway through the year.  If the Government does not put in the sewers and water in the next year or two, it will not have houses. At the moment, it will get a lovely letter back from Irish Water saying it will give it to consultants, who will come back in a year, and in two or three years&rsquo; time Irish Water might do it.  That is not how a housing problem is fixed or the people who need houses now are sorted.<\/p>  <p>  On the fair deal nursing homes scheme, as has been pointed out earlier, there are several houses in towns, small or large, and in cities throughout the country that are left idle because people have gone into nursing homes.  We need to bring incentives in there.  A Bill was to be brought forward - I am aware that the Minister of State is here - and it seems to have vanished into thin air.<\/p>  <p>  On evictions, we have seen different Bills brought in over recent years to deal with this issue.  The reality at the moment is that Promontoria will take a person wherever it wants and do whatever it wants.  The large vulture funds do not have any mercy for the people in this country.  Until we bring in proper legislation to ensure protection where someone is making an effort, we are not going to solve this problem.<\/p>  <p>  On renting, there are couples throughout this country whom we need to do things for, such as incentives we can provide for them and ways we can make sure.  For example, why do we not use the English system where if a person travels to X, Y, or Z for a year, we will put him or her higher up on the list.  There is an opportunity, especially in rural Ireland, be it in small towns or in the rural areas, where there are a lot of houses where, if &euro;20,000 or &euro;30,000 was spent on them, that was given to the people who own them, and a proportion of it was taken off the rent as each year went by, say over five or six years, we would have a double win.  We would have someone living in a community and we would have a family housed that might not have a house.  We would also give them the opportunity, when suitable accommodation would come up wherever they would want to go back to, of putting them up on the list.<\/p>  <p>  We have to start thinking outside the box rather than the same ding dong, the same Department stuff, the same civil servants doing the same thing day in, day out, and we get the same answer.  If we keep pressing the same tune, we are going to hear the same song.  Unless we think outside the box in this new D&aacute;il, we are going to be here in the same place in five years&rsquo; time.  In the previous D&aacute;il we must have had about 20 different debates on this issue, but where did it get us?  It got us to the same old song that we are listening to over and over again.  We have to rock the boat and say to the people that are doing this work down through the years, be it Secretaries General, principal officers or whoever, that this is not working, that we have to look at things in a different way, that we are not going to be nodding to them for this five years, and that we are going to take it on and change it.  If we do not do that, we are wasting our time being here at all.  I want to let Deputy Harkin speak now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070800039#SS00700","speaker":"1508"},{"type":"speech","time":1594221900,"counter":210,"content":"<p>This Government has a real opportunity here to shape how it responds to the economic fallout from the Covid-19 crisis and how it responds to the significant challenges that will be faced by families and individuals as they struggle to pay their mortgages or their rent.  If we are to learn any lessons from the previous crisis, it has to be that ordinary people do not pay the price for the economic collapse.  The last time we bailed out our financial institutions and we socialised the bank debt.  Ordinary people paid the price and many people are still paying a price as both their homes and lands are under threat.<\/p>  <p>  In March of this year, the United Nations condemned Ireland for allowing multinational vulture funds to buy up vast numbers of properties and rent them out at sky-high rents.  It described this as an egregious practice in Ireland.  That is what happened the last time.  We know that we now have a chance to change our response and support our citizens.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to state that before we entered the Covid-19 crisis we had more than 27,000 people in long-term rent arrears.  For those people Covid-19 has simply exacerbated the problem.<\/p>  <p>  In the programme for government, the Government has promised a referendum on housing.  If that commitment is real, and I believe it is, then we need to make a start now, today.  We cannot say that we will start tomorrow or the next day.  We cannot say we will protect our renters and those in mortgage arrears because of Covid-19 but that we will do it next week or next year.  We have to start now.<\/p>  <p>  Everybody agrees that this is a time of unprecedented change and unprecedented challenge, and we need to respond to it in an unprecedented way.  That way will have to ensure that the Covid-19 crisis will not exacerbate the current inequalities in the housing sector.<\/p>  <p>  In that context, I thank the Labour Party for bringing forward this Private Members' motion, because it highlights the crucial issue that many people are really fearful and concerned about having a roof over their heads in three months or six months.  As Deputies we meet them, we read their emails, and take their telephone calls.  If they knew that there would be an extension to the moratorium on evictions, then they would have some hope that they too could get through this crisis.  I have spoken about help for small businesses, and the core of it is to give people hope to start again.  If we extend this moratorium on evictions, it will give people hope that they can continue.<\/p>  <p>  To give people belief that this Government will support them as citizens, we have to ensure that the banks and the financial institutions do not charge penalties or surcharges on mortgage arrears that have occurred during this period.<\/p> <p>Nobody can profit from this pandemic.  Nobody can get rich on the backs of others and nobody can deny hope to those who struggle to pay their mortgage or their rent.  This Government is in a position to ensure that nobody profits.

We are now in what I call a dark age in terms of public housing projects in this country.  From the 1930s to the 1950s there was massive State intervention in respect of public housing build in this country.  This was done because there was a will to do it.  At the heart of the motion before us is the supply of housing as the ultimate goal and, in the interim, protection for renters and the introduction of a State support scheme to ensure nobody is put out on the street such that we do not further exacerbate the homelessness crisis that we have seen in this country to date.<\/p>  <p>  We need an enlightenment period in regard to public housing construction.  The Labour Party will support any measures that are appropriate in that regard.  What we want to see from this Government on that journey is real interventions and not only rhetoric.  While we all have partaken in rhetoric, it is important now, more than at any other time in our history, that we put in place a programme of public housing construction such that we can alleviate the need for measures such as income supports for those who are renting.  To date, 1,300 people within this State are awaiting rent supplement.  Whether we like it or not that rent supplement will go into the hands of private landlords.  The model we have built up in this country is perverted and we need to deconstruct it.<\/p>  <p>  This motion says to Government that the Labour Party will work it but what we need to see in return is the putting in place of proper activation measures such that we never again see anybody being put out on the street.  We need a public housing programme.  As other speakers have said, it is a supply and demand issue.  We need a public housing programme to ensure that we meet that supply and demand.<\/p>  <p>  I am delighted to stand in this Convention Centre to support this motion.  Thus far, I have served as a Deputy for 13 years.  The number of people coming to see me who are on social housing lists is ever growing.  It is utterly depressing that in this modern republic we cannot build houses for people.  We will hold the Minister to his word.  We will give him a fair chance and a fair crack of the whip.  The Minister said earlier that he wants local authorities to get back to building houses.  If that is the case, let us give him a fair crack at that whip.  I contend that the model needs to be wider.  The local authorities need to be key stakeholders but delivery should not be left to only them.  There is a loss of corporates memory in regard to how local authorities built houses.  Local authorities have not been involved in house building for a long time.  We need to develop a model that regardless of our political persuasions we can buy into and support.  We need this to be a non-partisan issue and an issue about young people.  These are the very people who are losing hope daily that they will never own, occupy or have fixity of tenure in a house so that they can support themselves and their families.<\/p>  <p>  The time for a radical programme is now.  Even in the midst of this Covid crisis now is the time to put our shoulders to the wheel.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070800040#TT00200","speaker":"1514"},{"type":"speech","time":1594222500,"counter":213,"content":"<p>I regret that the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, is no longer in auditorium because I wanted to take this opportunity to congratulate him on his appointment.  He is a constituency colleague and I know him well.  He is, of course, a Fianna F&aacute;il Minister.  When many people heard that a Fianna F&aacute;il Minister was taking over the housing portfolio there was a sharp intake of breath and worry because Fianna F&aacute;il has always associated itself with housing.  Some of that tradition is proud, in particular the large public housing provision in the mid 20th century.  However, some of that tradition is not so proud, including more recently the deregulation of the housing market and the privatisation of public housing.  Houses were built too quickly and they were unsafe.  Pyrite and fire safety issues happened under Fianna F&aacute;il's watch.  It is with trepidation that we welcome a new Fianna F&aacute;il Minister into this role.  The Minister is aware of the aforementioned legacy.  It is on his shoulders to shape where Fianna F&aacute;il goes next.  If, as stated by the Minister, he does propose to return local authorities to the provision of public housing then he will have the support of many groups within this D&aacute;il.<\/p>  <p>  The Government amendment to the Labour Party motion is not a great start.  It is very weak.  As Opposition spokesperson on housing six months ago the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, would have laughed it out of the D&aacute;il Chamber.  The only saving grace was that the amendment did not match with what the Minister had to say in his opening statement.  I took a little more comfort from that than I did from the weak and watery amendment on what is the most serious crisis in this country.<\/p>  <p>  I am a little concerned about the Minister's reference to the need to seek advice from NPHET on the continuance of the protections for renters and mortgage holders.  We need to be careful about how NPHET is used as we move out of the pandemic.  NPHET has played a substantial role in keeping many people alive in this country but it is not the job of NPHET to advise Ministers in any portfolio, in particular housing, on whether protections for renters and mortgage holders should be continued.  We have a new Government and a new Cabinet.  They have to make decisions and they have to stand over them.  NPHET should be nearing the end of its job.  Its job is to keep people alive, not to keep people in homes or build homes.  That is the job of the new Government and the new Minister with responsibility for housing.<\/p>  <p>  I would like to pick up on a point made by Deputy Michael Healy-Rae.  The Deputy said that he is in the job of providing accommodation and has been since he was 19 years old and that we should not be hunting people like himself who are landlords out of their business.  The Deputy and landlords should not be in the business of providing housing solutions for the most vulnerable people in our society.  That is the responsibility of the State.  The State should be providing sufficient public housing such that we do not have to rely on HAP and rent supplement payments or on private landlords to fill the massive gap that was created when the State privatised the provision of public housing.  This was done under Fianna F&aacute;il.  It is part of its legacy.  It is a massive legacy to undo.<\/p>  <p>  We were told many things recently, including that it was not possible to freeze rents.  It turned out that was possible and it was done.  We were told that the banks, which are heavily owned by the State, could not be influenced in regard to relief on mortgages.  That was done.  Many things have been possible in the last couple of months that remain possible if there is a will in this country, publicly and cross this Chamber, to do it.  We can stop evictions and ensure that people do not find themselves with massive mortgage or rental debt such that they can look forward to the future with some degree of comfort that their Government has their back.<\/p> <p>I hope the Government will not push its amendment to a vote tomorrow.  I hope it will not move it and that it will instead support our motion.  It is a sound and good motion that has the support of the majority of Deputies.  It also had the support of the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, a few weeks ago when he was the Opposition housing spokesperson.  I commend the motion to the House and thank our housing spokesperson, Senator Moynihan, on her work on it and Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in for leading on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070800040#TT00300","speaker":"1564","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1594223100,"counter":215,"content":"<p>I thank Deputies for an engaging and thought-provoking discussion.

The Money Advice and Budgeting Service, MABS, continues to help anyone experiencing problems with budgeting and debt during the Covid-19 pandemic.  MABS, under the aegis of the Citizens Information Board, provides assistance to people, in particular those on low incomes or living on social welfare payments, who are over-indebted and need help and advice with debt problems.  As part of its service, MABS also provides help and advice to those who are in mortgage arrears.  Its services are provided by phone, email, post and video conferencing where face-to-face engagement is necessary.  A Covid-19 live feed has been created on the MABS website to host important financial developments and to highlight how they may affect the public.  A new call-back and instant messaging service is also available on <i>mabs.ie<\/i>, where the public can request a call back from a MABS adviser.<\/p><p>I encourage tenants to reach out for help if they find themselves in financial difficulty and to engage with their landlord at the earliest opportunity.  Their tenancy relationship should not be put in jeopardy.  I encourage them to talk to MABS or the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  Income supports and rent supplements are available to assist.  If a tenant is already availing of HAP or rent supplement and his or her income has declined on foot of Covid-19, I encourage the tenant to contact his or her local authority, in the case of HAP, or the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, in the case of rent supplement.  The current level of payment can be reassessed in light of any change in circumstances, such as loss of income.<\/p><p>I, along with the Department and the Residential Tenancies Board, urge landlords to consider the negative impact of Covid-19 on their tenants and to show forbearance where temporary rent arrears may arise.  As noted earlier, the Department is conducting research on the potential accumulation of rent arrears during the emergency period in conjunction with the ESRI.  The research will have regard to the range of rental and income supports made available to those affected by Covid-19 and will assess the combined impact that the supports and changed consumption patterns has had on the incidence of rent arrears.  Preliminary findings suggest there was not a significant build-up of arrears over the period from April to June, inclusive, which is welcome news.<\/p><p>The Department recently published a guidance document on Covid-19 supports for landlords and tenants that set out the emergency rental measures and income and other supports available to tenants and landlords during the emergency period.  The guidance document and a list of frequently asked questions are available on <i>rtb.ie<\/i>.  The RTB encourages all its customers who may require assistance or advice, including in respect of any threatened eviction, to contact it via its webchat service, although there may be delays with its phone lines during this emergency period.<\/p><p>With regard to debt generally, the Insolvency Service of Ireland, ISI, provides a debt resolution service.  The ISI was established in 2013 to deal with personal insolvency and is under the remit of the Department of Justice and Equality.  The ISI aims to return people to solvency and full participation in social and economic activity.  It offers a range of debt solutions, including a regulated network of qualified professionals who can help a person to reach a permanent debt solution with his or her creditor.  The ISI encourages anyone with serious debt issues, including those impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic, to visit its dedicated website, <i>backontrack.ie<\/i>.<\/p><p>My focus, and that of the Government, is to ensure that as many households as possible remain in their homes.  I encourage borrowers to engage with Abhaile, the national mortgage arrears resolution service, which is available free of charge to the borrower.  The unique element of Abhaile is that it brings together for the first time the full range of supports and services required by borrowers in home mortgage arrears.  A dedicated adviser will work with the borrower and the lender to find the best solution for their particular circumstances.<\/p><p>On mortgage arrears, the co-ordinated forbearance actions of the banking and non-banking sectors announced by the Minister for Finance on 18 March 2020, and agreed to by the members of the Banking and Payments Federation of Ireland and the Central Bank, have provided essential support to personal and business customers impacted by Covid-19.  The co-ordinated approach adopted by the banking and non-banking sectors is welcome.  These forbearance measures have primarily involved payment breaks for households and SME customers.  The importance of these supports is illustrated by the agreement to payment breaks for 80,000 mortgage customers and 35,800 SME customers.  With the initial three-month payment breaks issued in mid-March, lenders are undertaking a process of engagement with those who have availed of the break and those customers are being contacted about their options when the payment break ends.  These include a payment break extension of up to three months for those who continue to be directly impacted by the fallout of the Covid-19 pandemic.  The forbearance approach reflects the wider Government approach of ensuring that all supports, whether tax measures, public expenditure programmes or lender forbearance, are focused on those who have experienced significant income shocks.  These levels of support are maximised and scarce resources allocated to those most in need.<\/p><p>The Department has introduced three and six-month payment breaks for holders of the Rebuilding Ireland home loan or other local authority mortgages.  The breaks are available through local authorities and borrowers are not charged interest for the period of their payment break.  In addition, the Department has just written to all local authorities highlighting that Rebuilding Ireland home loan applications should continue to be processed during the Covid-19 pandemic.  Applicants of the temporary wage subsidy scheme can apply based on their pre-Covid income and will be given time post Covid to demonstrate that their earnings have returned to pre-Covid levels.  If the applicant's earnings do not return to pre-Covid levels, the application can be reassessed based on the actual level of post-Covid income achieved.<\/p><p>In the case of mortgage-to-rent mortgage holders, for whom no alternative is available, a scheme is already in place for borrowers of commercial lending institutions, which is overseen by the Department.  The scheme is targeted at borrowers in long-term mortgage arrears whose mortgage has been deemed unsustainable by their lender under the mortgage arrears resolution process, as provided for under the Central Bank's code of conduct on mortgage arrears.  Under the scheme, mortgage holders who are eligible for social housing can transfer the ownership of their home to an approved housing body or the private company, Home for Life, and remain in their home as social-housing tenants, paying affordable rent assessed in accordance with their means.  Following a review of the mortgage-to-rent scheme in February 2017, a range of revisions was made to the terms and conditions of the scheme to widen eligibility and ensure greater take-up.  In addition, new structures and arrangements have been put in place to encourage a greater number of entities to take part in the scheme and enable it to operate at scale.  One threat to the overall viability of the scheme is the lack of borrower engagement with lenders.  The Department is working closely with the Abhaile service, as well as the ISI and MABS, to ensure that borrowers who could benefit from the mortgage-to-rent scheme are aware of the benefits and how to access it.<\/p><p>The Government is committed to ensuring that the full range of options is available to distressed borrowers, including keeping as many people as possible in their own homes, and has included a commitment to strengthening the mortgage-to-rent scheme in the programme for Government.  The programme for Government is committed to delivering at least 50,000 social homes over the coming five years.  It is an urgent priority to address critical housing supply and demand issues, housing delivery and, in particular, the need for social and affordable housing.  I am keen to ensure we lose no time or momentum in doing this.  Last year, more than 10,000 social homes were delivered nationwide and we want to build on that in future.<\/p> <p>I am aware that the past few months have been exceptionally challenging for all stakeholders involved in housing, from those involved in delivery right through to those managing the risks associated with vulnerable groups.  Covid-19 has presented challenges to the country but it has also demonstrated the clear resolve of the Government and the need to back the people of Ireland.  Our key goal is to get as many people as we can back working in a safe manner as soon as we can to allow them to meet their housing needs independently.  We want to help people to help themselves but we recognise that not everybody is able to meet his or her own housing needs.<\/p> <p> I sincerely thank the Labour Party for tabling this motion and my fellow Deputies for their thoughtful input.  I look forward to working with them in the coming term on our shared objective of providing secure, quality housing for all who need it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070800041#UU00400","speaker":"1595","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1594223700,"counter":219,"content":"<p>I thank my colleague and newly appointed and excellent spokesperson Senator Rebecca Moynihan for putting this motion together and I also thank my colleague Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in for working on it with her.<\/p><p>I wish the Minister, Deputy Darragh O&rsquo;Brien, and the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, the best.  Trust me, I know how difficult their challenge is.  Given the previous comments on what Fianna F&aacute;il has done in regard to housing during its terms in office in recent decades, particularly the comments of Deputy Duncan Smith, I am glad the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, as a chartered accountant and forensic analyst, is in government with Fianna F&aacute;il because his experience will be useful.  I wish him the best of luck; he will need it.<\/p><p>We all know we are in difficult times and that we have to support one another.  The Labour Party is suggesting solutions and raising issues it knows the State has to deal with.  I stood in the D&aacute;il and outside it at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic and spoke about the issues related to rent and evictions.  I found it quite amazing that the previous Government could not introduce rent freezes because it was regarded as constitutionally impossible.  I always knew it was constitutionally possible because I introduced them.  Fianna F&aacute;il, the main party in opposition at the time, did not believe they were constitutionally possible.  They were possible because, all of a sudden, when the pandemic struck, they were brought in.  It has never been fully explained to me how Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael made a <i>volte face<\/i>and were, all of a sudden, able to introduce such a measure.  It very much shows the real issue, which is that housing and preventing profiting from rent among landlords are not really at the core of what the two parties believe.  This is what distinguishes Labour Party Members and many others in the House from members of Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael.<\/p><p>We supported the housing measures introduced by the Government when Covid hit.  We did so because they were necessary but we will remember it was incapable of introducing them before that.  The Government&rsquo;s attitude towards this motion is disappointing because, quite frankly, its counter-motion is offensive and amateurish.  I do not know who wrote it but I believe it is amateurish.  The Minister of State proposes to delete a line that recognises the loss of income to households through &ldquo;no fault of their own&rdquo;.  He proposes to delete the line that recognises cumulative debt from rent or mortgages will crystallise for many households.  He even proposes to delete the rather complimentary statement that the ban on rent increases and evictions during the pandemic has led to a decrease in homelessness.  I do not know why that perverse deletion would be made.  It is not a good start.  I wonder whether it is because the Minister of State wants to brush the issues of rent and homelessness under the carpet.  It is telling that his alternative text does not even mention homelessness.  Deputy Carthy is not present now but the day on which I will take lectures from Sinn F&eacute;in on housing will be the day on which the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission does not tell us that one quarter of all UK homelessness deaths were in Northern Ireland, the day on which it does not tell us that 205 homeless people died there in 2018, and the day on which Deputy Carthy or Deputy &Oacute; Broin will make a statement condemning this.  We must remember every day the hypocrisy of preaching in the way they do when we know from Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s practice in another jurisdiction what it has achieved.<\/p><p>Regarding to what is really before us, we have to consider what the public is facing.  We share the Government&rsquo;s ambition to create jobs and to come out of Covid but the fact is we do not know when the economy will be got back up and running, nor do we know the scale of the resources required.  It could be months or years before the economy is back up and running.  I accept that nobody knows but in the interim thousands of households will face crystallised debt they will not be able to pay.  One day, the walls will come tumbling down and somebody will have to pay the debt.  Those I have mentioned will not be able to pay it so the Government might as well face it now.  A plan needs to be in place to help those affected because they will not be able to pay.  It is just a fact.  The debt will crystallise day by day, week by week, month by month and, potentially, year by year.  The Minister of State is in for some wake-up call if he honours what he said in his alternative motion, that is, that hundreds of thousands of people have had their incomes largely protected.  Hundreds of thousands of people are in serious bother, and many renters are among them.  The basic fact underlying our motion is that, despite the exceptional pandemic unemployment payment and all the other supports, many workers are actually worse off.  Therefore, we need to support them.<\/p><p>The Government has taken no action in relation to the banks to give homeowners several months without mortgage repayments.  It has now been exposed that they have been left open to additional interest charges.  I raised this with the Taoiseach earlier based on confirmation from the Central Bank and the European Banking Authority.  This is affecting so many.  It is not believable that the Taoiseach, having sat through my comments, is now instructing his Minister to go off and speak to the banks.  A range of European jurisdictions, which I could mention, have spoken to the banks and ensured interest charges of the kind in question will not be imposed.  Many of those who face extra payments in the order of thousands of euro will note that what has occurred could have been prevented if the Minister or previous Minister, or both, had spoken to the banks.  It is unbelievable that this did not happen.<\/p><p>To hear a Banking Federation representative say the additional interest will be socialised across other mortgage holders who can pay is just rubbish.  It is not a case of talking to the banks on these issues but of telling them that what is happening is not acceptable, that the clock should be rewound and that the interest should be got rid of.  It is a question of our saying we know it should not be charged.  We should point to what other jurisdictions have done, use the analysis across Europe, say out straight what the citizens of this country have done for the banks, and say we are not allowing people to be absolutely screwed and ripped off during the Covid pandemic owing to their being charged more in unnecessary interest.<\/p><p>We need a plan for mortgage repayment periods that are longer than first envisaged.  The problem will feature for much longer and, potentially, there is a need for other vehicles to help those in various circumstances.  We need a plan to ensure people will not be ripped off because of interest rates and how banks are dealt with.  I have always been nervous about the Minister for Finance, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, dealing with the banks. I have been nervous because, while the representative of Banking &amp;amp; Payments Federation Ireland approached the Minister for Finance when the Covid pandemic kicked off, it should have been the other way around.<\/p> <p>They should have been summoned then instead of offering to meet the Minister.  The Minister needs to instruct them rather than it being the other way around.  I am deeply suspicious and we need a plan in this regard.<\/p> <p> We also need a plan for rent debt.  Many people sitting at home, some of whom are watching us now, are facing huge and crystallised debt of thousands of euro.  They are people in this city and in other cities.

At the onset of the Covid-19 crisis, the Government took immediate action and for that I give credit.  Very early on, the issue of seasonal workers came to the fore, particularly in those areas of the country and the sectors of the economy that are traditionally seasonal in nature.  We can look in particular at hospitality and tourism, where in many parts of the country the season runs from St. Patrick's Day or even Easter in cases through the summer to various points in the autumn, perhaps finishing in late September or Hallowe'en, with some going to Christmas.  There are large parts of the industry that do not function for the full length of the year.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the events industry and other sectors would be in a lull in January or February, as very few festivals take place then and there would not be as many events.  Much of the industry in these areas starts on St. Patrick's Day.  Under the rules of the temporary wage subsidy scheme, if a person was not employed in January, February and March, there is no entitlement to support through the scheme for workers who had never worked in those months but rather worked in later months of the year and earned their living that way.<\/p>  <p>  As well as a sectoral effect, this has caused a major geographic effect, where a disproportionate piece of the economy in places on the west coast of Ireland depend on this seasonal tourism.  These are places like Daingean or Killarney even up the west coast through County Clare, into County Galway through Clifden.  Connemara and the islands would be very familiar to the Acting Chairman.  We can then go up through County Mayo to Donegal.  The reality is that unless immediate action is taken, many of these industries and businesses in the hospitality sectors and all the spin-off enterprise supplying them might not survive.  That is not through any fault of their own but through a lack of support.<\/p>  <p>  This afternoon, we debated at length the issue of microfinance.  The latter is useful in its own right but which does not fill this gap.  For many of these businesses, borrowing money is not a solution.  We need to hear that the temporary wage subsidy scheme will first be extended for at least a year for those industries that will not recover for at least that time.  It should be available to those who can demonstrate a pattern of seasonal employment every year; in other words, businesses should be eligible for the scheme where they hire people in the spring but do not have them in January, February or March.  Within the hospitality sector, we need the cap on the restart grant to be eliminated as this is an equivalent to three and a half bedrooms in a hotel, and no such hotel exists in the country.<\/p>  <p>  My time is short and I hope the Minister of State will be able to tell me that the Government, even at this belated stage, will make an announcement and will not leave these vital industries high and dry.  I hope it will not leave us in such a position that when tourism returns, we will find that some of our best assets are no longer functioning.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070800043#WW00800","speaker":"1575"},{"type":"speech","time":1594224300,"counter":228,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter and the general issue of supports for business in the hospitality sector.  He also flagged the matter of seasonal workers, which is certainly on our agenda as well.<\/p>  <p>  As has been referred to by the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and other Ministers, the programme for Government promises to bring forward a July jobs initiative to support our economy and help restore employment.  Our focus is on supporting the viability of businesses and getting people back to work as quickly as possible in all sectors, including the vital hospitality sector.  I cannot confirm what will be in that stimulus but it will come in the next couple of weeks.  We will certainly enhance the offerings we have had so far as we are very much committed to supporting businesses in restarting and growing through job creation.  We had a good and lengthy discussion on that earlier today and last night.<\/p>  <p>  Helping small and medium enterprises is essential, given their pivotal role in the economy and employment.  The July stimulus will extend, enhance and add to existing measures, totalling &euro;12 billion in supports for businesses affected by Covid-19 that have already been announced.  These measures include direct grants and supports, including the temporary wage subsidy scheme referred to by the Deputy.  I am very conscious of the point he is making on seasonal workers and we will certainly focus on it in our work over the next couple of weeks as we bring forward the stimulus package.<\/p>  <p>  There is also a &euro;250 million restart grant fund and the Deputy is seeking changes to it.  There are also liquidity supports, such as 0% financing for six months from Microfinance Ireland.  This House passed the required legislation for that earlier and I hope it will go through the Seanad tomorrow in order that we can get on with the work relating to the fund.  There has been a rates waiver from local authorities and the warehousing of tax liabilities by the Revenue Commissioners with respect to small and medium enterprises.<\/p>  <p>  These supports are predominantly focused on our small and medium enterprises, which have been hit hardest by the Covid-19 pandemic.  As stated in the programme for Government, it is planned that the July jobs initiative will set out a path for the future of the temporary wage subsidy scheme.  That will deal with the length it will be extended, if it is extended, and also deal with who can access the scheme.<\/p>  <p>  The most important action from the Government was to try to ensure employees were not laid off and they did not lose an all-important link with an employer.  Experience demonstrates that maintenance of the link with an employer is critical to the prospects of a person recovering and resuming employment.  The temporary wage subsidy scheme achieves this objective but there are issues around this connected with seasonal or part-time workers and so on.  These are all being examined.<\/p> <p> In addition to the wage subsidy scheme, the Government introduced a new payment, the pandemic unemployment payment, to help individuals who were laid off.  These supports and others are now being reviewed in the context of the July jobs stimulus and the economic recovery plan, which will be brought forward around budget time in October.  These are key components of the programme for Government and I expect that further announcements will be made in due course.  I know Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v would like me to do that tonight but it is best that it comes forward in the overall stimulus package in the weeks ahead.  The issues mentioned by Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v relating to support for temporary seasonal workers are very much part of the considerations for the future of the wage subsidy scheme, and rightly so.  <\/p> <p> As the public health restrictions are eased, the challenge for the economy, SMEs and all businesses is evolving.  Work is ongoing on how best to continue to support employers in the more medium term, including consideration of support for temporary seasonal workers and new hires.  Also, I spoke earlier about new start-ups because people might change career during these times.<\/p> <p> Since it was introduced in March, more than 65,900 employers have registered with Revenue for the temporary wage subsidy scheme and more than 58,600 employers have availed of the scheme, which is almost one third of all employers from 2019.  More than 567,600 jobs have been directly supported over the period and many more indirectly.  That is considerable coverage and it is noted that the value of payments made to date is nearly &euro;2 billion.  <\/p> <p> Changes have also been made to the scheme to allow additional flexibility in the case of lower paid workers to increase the level of subsidy they receive, for workers returning from maternity, paternity and adoptive leave, and for apprentices who were engaged in a period of off-the-job or block release training in February of this year.  The update and the need for the wage subsidy scheme will continue to be monitored as the public health restrictions are eased and the economy continues to recover.<\/p> <p> My final point is on the restart grant, which was launched on 22 May 2020.  The scheme was devised in recognition of the fact that micro and small businesses were particularly vulnerable to the economic effects of Covid-19.  To date, there have been applications for &euro;130 million in grants and just over &euro;71 million has been paid out so far.  There is another &euro;17 million in the pipeline to be paid out this week.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070800043#WW00900","speaker":"1505","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1594224900,"counter":230,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his reply.  The restart grant is being paid very promptly, and that I welcome, but it was obviously devised with manufacturing type businesses in mind.  Whatever happened, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport did not make its case very well because rates are a major part of the overheads of any business in hospitality - hotels, restaurants and so on.  The one thing we are absolutely certain about is that for as long as there is social distancing, these businesses, even though they will be open, will not be able to operate and will not be as profitable as they were previously.  We have to reduce overheads.  The restart grant, which is a rebate of the previous year's rates, is a very obvious first start but we need to lift the cap because it is out of sync with reality in the hospitality industry.<\/p>  <p>  If we consider tour buses and so on, they will be limited in the number of passengers they carry.  We need to look at the sectors that will have long-term restrictions on their ability to trade.  Rather than forced unemployment, is it not much better to have people working and to make it economic to have extra staff, perhaps with a smaller turnover?  That is where, again, we are a little late.  There is no point crying over spilled milk but we need to have an immediate decision on the temporary wage subsidy scheme and it needs to continue for constrained businesses that cannot go back to business as usual.  It needs to continue for as long as two constraints exist.  One is the physical constraints because of health advice and the other is the business constraints because in terms of tourism, and this goes way beyond the tour providers, there are no foreign tourists here this year and we know people elsewhere are very reluctant to travel anywhere abroad.  We find the same as regards people leaving the island.  We need to deal with those issues.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the fact that people who booked holidays abroad had their deposits guaranteed.  I find it hard to understand, and the Minister of State might address this, why tour operators who were taking the deposits of people coming into the country did not get the same guarantee on their deposits.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070800044#XX00200","speaker":"1575"},{"type":"speech","time":1594224900,"counter":231,"content":"<p>To conclude and add to the comments I made earlier, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v rightly raised the tourism and hospitality sector.  With regard to any further targeted measures specifically aimed at that sector, in March 2020, a dedicated tourism recovery task force was established made up of leaders of various sectors of the industry who will work together to deal with the many challenges ahead.  It is specifically tasked with identifying measures required to enable Irish tourism to recover from the devastating effects of Covid-19.  Naturally, the work of the task force will feed into the stimulus plan in July as well as the long-term recovery plan in line with the budget in October.  We welcome any comments or suggestions in that regard.  When he addressed the House yesterday on the Microenterprise Loan Fund (Amendment) Bill, the T&aacute;naiste asked anybody who wished to do so to bring forward suggestions or ideas.  We will tease these out and they will feed into the plan.  Work on the July stimulus plan is ongoing in the Department and other Departments.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy rightly identified some of the issues with the existing schemes that might affect the hospitality sector.  All the existing schemes and all the efforts we have made in response to the Covid-19 outbreak are being reviewed and checked with a view to identifying changes we could make to enhance them.  I will certainly feed into that review the issues the Deputy raised tonight.  If he has any other suggestions, we will happy to feed those in also.  <\/p>  <p>  We are conscious that we have committed over &euro;12 billion of taxpayers' money to supports.  We also know, as does every Member of this House, that will not be enough.  We need to add to that and we are very much committed to doing that.  A package will be brought forward later this month.  We will build on that and we look forward to working with Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v and all those who represent the hospitality sector on bringing forward long-term plans because the recovery will not be immediate in some sectors.  We can make immediate interventions, which will help these sectors to survive, but we need to commit to this in the long term and we will do that.

Passenger numbers are likely to be 70% lower than last year.  Cork and Dublin airports will have a combined reduction in passenger numbers of 40%.  Shannon, therefore, has been exponentially impacted by Covid.  I seek a number of measures.  An aviation task force is about to produce its final report.  Will the Minister of State indicate when she expects to receive that report?  The report will be made public and I ask that she act on it.  Arising out of that report, I would like to see a specific task force report for the Shannon Group, specifically Shannon Airport.  We have unique difficulties to overcome in Shannon.  Coming from Galway, the Minister of State will understand that Shannon Airport is critical to the western seaboard.  The area has the largest number of multinational companies outside Dublin.  I want to see supports provided for the development of routes outside Dublin.  Shannon Heritage has submitted an application for supports and it should receive funding.

As an island nation, Ireland is particularly dependent, both socially and economically, on air connectivity.  Aviation plays a critical role in our economy.  More than 140,000 jobs are supported by the air transport sector in Ireland.  The air transport industry, including airlines and industry supply chains, is estimated to support a share of Ireland's GDP worth &euro;8.9 billion.  Approximately 6.8% of GDP was supported by air transport and foreign tourists arriving by air in 2018.  Spending by foreign tourists supports a further &euro;8.7 billion of the country's GDP.  Ireland is also a significant global player in the area of aircraft leasing, an industry which contributes a further &euro;541 million to the economy and supports almost 5,000 jobs.<\/p>  <p>  Successive Government policies and the national aviation policy have recognised and supported this contribution.  They have pointed in particular to Ireland's reliance on international connectivity to secure its competitive international position.  The current policy has been highly successful and aviation in Ireland has seen strong growth in recent years.  However, as we all know, the Covid-19 crisis is having a significant impact on the sector.  Irish airports and airlines are fully exposed to the dramatic downturn in activity.  Operations shrank to a small fraction of the normal level of activity, resulting in significant cash flow problems.  Airlines and airports have had to restructure their businesses significantly in response to the crisis, and many are availing of Government supports.  The Shannon Group has been severely impacted by Covid-19.  I acknowledge and thank the company's management and staff for their commitment to keeping the airport open and keeping passengers and staff safe during this very difficult time.<\/p>  <p>  We can all agree on the importance of Shannon Airport to Ireland and to the mid-west in particular.  This is acknowledged in the national aviation policy, which recognises the strategic importance of Shannon to the connectivity of the mid-west and its importance as a gateway to the Wild Atlantic Way.  Unfortunately, in the challenging circumstances faced by the Shannon Group, management have had to take difficult decisions to ensure the future viability of the company.  I understand the company has been engaging further with employees this week on further measures that must be taken to assist the company's recovery.<\/p>  <p>  I do not underestimate the impact on employees of these changes, which are deemed necessary to enable the Shannon Group to secure the future of the airport so that it will be well placed when the sector recovers from this crisis.  Deputies will be aware that in response to Covid-19, the Government has put a broad range of supports in place to help mitigate the effects of the crisis.  These include the temporary Covid-19 wage subsidy scheme, of which many companies in the aviation sector, including the Shannon Group, are availing.  The Shannon Group has asked for a range of supports from the Government to help mitigate the impact of Covid-19.  These are being considered.  My Department recently approved &euro;6.1 million of emergency funding to complete the airport's hold baggage screening project.  The Department continues to work closely with the Shannon Group to ensure that the company, including Shannon Airport, will be well positioned operationally to contribute to the post-pandemic economic and social recovery.<\/p>  <p>  The impact of Covid-19 on the aviation sector has been severe.  The sector will continue to be impacted as long as international air travel is restricted on public health grounds.  The Government is acutely aware of the matter and suitable policy and financial responses are being developed.  The final report of the aviation recovery task force will be important when finalising proposals, given the expertise and industry insights it will reflect.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070800045#YY00300","speaker":"1578"},{"type":"speech","time":1594225500,"counter":239,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

We must try to spread those passengers out to Shannon and other airports in the post-Covid era.  I look forward to the Minister of State's reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070800045#YY00600","speaker":"1517","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1594226100,"counter":243,"content":"<p>I have listened very carefully to what the Deputies said.

I propose to undertake a thorough examination of the airport's future viability and sustainability, including restructuring measures, financial supports and any other measures that may be necessary and appropriate as part of a wider review of Shannon Group.  I will be in a position to do this once there is further visibility of the extent of the damage caused by Covid-19 to the group's strategic and business outlook and its funding position.<\/p>  <p>  I plan to revert to the Government with recommendations on this issue in due course.  I will take into account the strategic importance of Shannon Airport in the context of the national and regional development of aviation policies.  I will be meeting with the task force for aviation recovery this week, whose membership includes the chief executive officer of Shannon Airport.  Deputies can be assured that I am taking this issue very seriously and will work with all the stakeholders to ensure we have a viable aviation sector.

I look forward to working with him.  This is the second opportunity I have had in this House to raise the issue of the bog slide on Shass Mountain in Drumkeeran in County Leitrim.  I raised it with the T&aacute;naiste last week, when he told me that in situations like this, where this is a disaster, the Government will normally step in to offer support.  This is surely a disaster and it has now become an emergency.  Many people who live in the area are asking where the support from Government is because they have not seen or heard anything in that regard.  I have visited the site twice, the second occasion being last Friday evening when I went there with my colleague, Deputy Fitzmaurice.  We visited the point on the mountain where islands of trees were emerging from the forestry and sliding down the side of the mountain.  It was incredible to see it.<\/p>  <p>  It is difficult to estimate the numbers but we are looking at the movement of some 300,000 or 400,000 cu. m of peat and bog.  The bog slide continues down the mountain for several miles and stops within 200 m of two family homes and not 50 m from the Diffagher river which then goes on to flow into Lough Allen.  Several homes are in danger and one house already has about 9 in. of bog at its back door.  Vast swathes of land are being completely destroyed.  The only thing holding back half the mountainside is the Dawn of Hope Bridge which was built in the late 1800s.  It is absolutely astonishing that this bridge is still standing and holding back thousands of tonnes of trees and bog.  We are facing an emergency and there are real fears that the bridge will not hold.  Urgent action must be taken to reinforce it and try to stabilise the bog slide.  That is the immediate need.  People in the area, especially those whose homes are in danger and those whose land is being destroyed, need to know, nine days after the situation emerged, that they have not been forgotten.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070800046#ZZ00300","speaker":"1605"},{"type":"speech","time":1594226100,"counter":246,"content":"<p>I wish the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, well in his new role.  I visited the site in Drumkeeran with Deputy Harkin and observed the damage she has described.  I want to make clear that no turf has been cut on this steep blanket bog.  The damage we are seeing has happened followed incessant rain and action must be taken to address it.  I spoke earlier today to the CEO of Leitrim County Council, Lar Power, who has RPS Consulting Engineers doing up a report on the situation on Shass Mountain.  If the bridge to which Deputy Harkin referred collapses, there will be serious problems.<\/p>  <p>  The Office of Public Works needs to get involved without delay and funds must be given to the county council to ensure it can cater for the works that need doing.  A working group must be put together as soon as possible to deal with this emergency.  Farmers in the area have put in for the basic payment scheme, the areas of natural constraint scheme and the green low-carbon agri-environment scheme.  The bog is sliding down the steep mountain and spreading out and destroying their land.  These are small family farms whose owners are working in the difficult conditions that naturally arise in bogland areas.  They deserve help in this emergency.<\/p>  <p>  We need the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, the OPW, the council and the fisheries and farming bodies to come together and work to put a fund in place.  The Department of Agriculture Food and the Marine needs to reach out in the first instance.  This problem will not be cleaned up overnight and it will not be solved tomorrow.  The Department needs to offer reassurance in respect of any inspections undertaken over the next four to five years for the areas of natural constraint scheme, the green low-carbon agri-environment scheme and other environmental schemes.  That is the first thing that needs to be sorted.  The roads in the area will also need rectifying.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Harkin and I spoke last week to an elderly woman and some of the other lovely, salt-of-the-earth people who live in this area.  They are frightened that if the bridge at the top of the mountain collapses, nothing will stop the bog from coming down.  Local knowledge suggests that there was a lake that disappeared years ago located where the trees have started moving.  There are large volumes of material that need sorting out, but the only thing that will really sort this problem out is a proper plan and the money to implement it.  Will the Minister of State ensure the different bodies get together to work out a plan?  There is no point in scratching our heads for a month until more rain comes and the bridge at the top of the mountain collapses.  We will be in trouble then because there are several houses at risk.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070800046#ZZ00400","speaker":"1508"},{"type":"speech","time":1594226100,"counter":247,"content":"<p>I thank Deputies Harkin and Fitzmaurice for their good wishes and for bringing this matter to my attention.  I can give a response from the perspective of my Department and the agency within my remit, which is the National Parks and Wildlife Service.  As Deputy Fitzmaurice noted, however, there are several agencies involved.<\/p>  <p>  The legislation underpinning the protection and conservation of nature includes the Wildlife Acts 1976 to 2018 and the European Communities (Birds and Natural Habitats) Regulations 2011.  Natural heritage areas have been designated under the Wildlife (Amendment) Act 2000.  The EU's bird directive and habitats directive provide for the protection of certain habitats and species across the Union, giving a framework for specific measures to be taken to target areas of concern in each member state.  In essence, the 2011 regulations transpose these directives into national law and provide for the nomination and designation of special protection areas, SPAs, aimed at the protection of threatened species of birds, and special areas of conservation, SACs, aimed at protecting other animal species and habitats.<\/p> <p>Ireland is an EU stronghold for blanket bogs, which provide essential ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration and water regulation, as well as harbouring many important plant and animal species.  Under the habitats directive, Ireland has identified 50 special areas of conservation for the protection of blanket bog and there are 73 blanket bog national heritage areas.  These SACs include lowland and mountain blanket bogs, predominantly along the western Atlantic seaboard, but also widely distributed on upland areas.  Many of the SAC sites identified for the protection of blanket bogs are extensive and include complexes of other habitats such as dry heath, transition mire, acid grasslands, rivers and streams.  Protected species found there include dunlin, golden plover, whooper swan, red deer, otter and freshwater pearl mussel.  Blanket bogs, together with other peatlands, have formed in the Irish landscape since the last ice age and, together with remnants of primeval forests, are some of our oldest surviving ecosystems.<\/p> <p> In November 2019, the National Parks and Wildlife Service of the Department was awarded &euro;12.4 million in funding under the EU LIFE programme for an EU LIFE integrated project entitled Life Wild Atlantic Nature which aims to protect and restore blanket bog and associated habitats.  The project seeks to improve the conservation status in the special area of conservation network of blanket bog.  The project start-up has been delayed by the Covid-19 pandemic, but is scheduled to take place over nine years and will be undertaken with the consultation and involvement of local landowners and communities.<\/p> <p> Boleybrack mountain was nominated for designation as an SAC in June 2003 and is afforded protection under the 2011 regulations.  It comprises an extensive upland plateau situated to the north of Lough Allen in County Leitrim and is dominated by active mountain blanket bog and wet heath.<\/p> <p> I was very concerned to hear about the bog slide affecting the community in Drumkeeran, County Leitrim.  The site at Shass Mountain is in Boleybrack Mountain special area of conservation.  Officers from the National Parks and Wildlife Service have been to the site to investigate the extent of damage to the SAC.  Initial findings indicate that the bog slide originated within the southern section of Boleybrack Mountain SAC, along the southern flank of the forestry plantation.  The land where the slide originated is now very unstable and further slippages may occur.<\/p> <p> The volume of peat loss appears substantial, given the amount of land affected downstream.  A significant amount of peat from within the SAC has slid into the headwaters of a stream which is a tributary of the Diffagher river which enters Lough Allen.  The peat material has been carried up to 5 km and deposited within the flood plain along the distance.  A drone survey or equivalent may be needed to fully assess the scale of the damage.<\/p> <p> I understand that Leitrim County Council is currently the lead agency dealing with the incident.  The Office of Public Works is in contact with engineers in the council and providing advice as required.  In addition, the forestry inspectorate of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and Coillte have been on site since the event and have examined it in detail.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020070800046#ZZ00500","speaker":"1512","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1594226700,"counter":249,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his reply.  I know he has his own portfolio.  He referred to the birds directive and the habitats directive.

I hear what the Minister of State is saying regarding having people on the ground looking at the situation and assessing it, but I speak to people from Drumkeeran every day and they have heard nothing.  They know that people are looking at the situation, etc., but they want to see action.  They want to know that their homes and lands are protected.<\/p>  <p>  The focus may be on protecting the habitat.  If we do not do something to stabilise what is happening in the area, the habitat will be destroyed as well.  People need to know that they are the primary focus.  The Minister of State knows as well as I do that if that is not made clear, they will start to see the habitats directive and similar legislation in a negative context.  It is not negative legislation and was never meant to be such, but people must come first.<\/p>  <p>  We need support to be provided to Leitrim County Council.

Are we going to sit and watch a bridge collapse - in fairness, bridges are neither the portfolio nor the responsibility of the Minister of State - if there is further rain and possibly more bog coming down the mountain with it?  Are we going to stand by while, in the words of Deputy Harkin, the species known as people lose their lives?  Rapid action needs to be taken on this issue.<\/p>  <p>  Anyone listening to these proceedings who is familiar with the situation knows that the designation and the habitats directive and all that has damn all to do with this issue.  This problem involves part of a bog sliding down a mountain onto people's land and around houses.  People are frightened and roads have been destroyed.  A large section of the bog could come down if the bridge in question, which was built hundreds of years ago - in fairness, it has held out mightily - fails.  If it goes, we will be in trouble.  Regardless of when the site was designated or whatever else was done with it, we must not have people with pieces of paper stating that an environmental impact assessment or another appropriate assessment is needed.
