In relation to this report, our concerns were heightened at the reported very elevated lice levels at a number of fish farms during the critical migration period for wild Atlantic salmon, a protected species under the Habitats Directive. <\/p>  <p>Scientific research both in Ireland and internationally indicates that the impact on vulnerable wild salmon smolts (juveniles), during outward migration to distant feeding grounds, of heavy sea lice infestation can have a highly damaging effect on the numbers of these juveniles that survive and return to their natal river to spawn and create the next generation of fish which are genetically unique to that river. Recent peer reviewed research internationally has shown that sea lice emanating from fish farms can add up to an additional 39% mortality on these salmon smolts.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052100051#WRB03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1260"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Broadband Plan Administration","counter":115,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052100051#WRB03900"},{"type":"question","counter":116,"qnumday":97,"qnumall":"[21482\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052100051#WRB04000","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the number of homes in counties Sligo and Leitrim that are in the amber intervention area for the national broadband plan; when the roll out of the plan will commence; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1343","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":117,"content":"<p>The purpose of the National Broadband Plan is to ensure that over 1.1 million of our citizens in rural Ireland have the same opportunity to participate in the digital society as citizens living in urban areas.

The measure applies across the public service, including the Defence Forces. However, it does not apply in relation to employment with the commercial semi-State bodies or where public service pensioners are employed outside the public service.<\/p>  <p>  Pension abatement in the public service is structured to ensure that a pensioner's combined earnings from their current public service job plus their existing public service retirement pension do not exceed the current equivalent of pensionable salary from their old public service job. Depending on those variables, the actual impact (if any) from the measure on a person&rsquo;s public service pension will vary from person to person. \u00a0For example, where a person&rsquo;s combined public service earnings from their current job plus pension are less than the current equivalent of their pensionable earnings from their old job e.g. in the Defence Forces, there is no reduction of pension.<\/p>  <p>  I should point out that prior to 1 November 2012, this abatement principle \/ concept already operated as a standard feature of public service pension schemes generally.  However, this was only within individual sectors and bodies where a public service pensioner resumed working in his or her former occupation, e.g. Defence Forces, Garda, Civil Service etc. The 2012 Act extends the principle across and between all sectors without exception, thereby restoring the arrangements that were in place until 1965.<\/p>  <p>  I should also state that a public service pensioner already in public service employment immediately before 1 November 2012 is not affected by the change while he or she remains in that post\/position. \u00a0However, if their employment status changes after that date, for example, where they secure a new post through promotion with their current public service employer or where they move to a different post or public service body, their pension is subject to abatement in accordance with the legislation.<\/p>  <p>  The Public Service Pensions (Single Scheme and other Provisions) Act 2012 comes under the remit of my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, and the question of any changes to that Act would therefore be a matter for him in the first instance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052100052#WRC00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1365"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Army Barracks","counter":143,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052100052#WRC00500"},{"type":"question","counter":144,"qnumday":106,"qnumall":"[21410\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052100052#WRC00600","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"the position regarding St. Bricin's military facility (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1369","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":145,"content":"<p>My\u00a0Officials have had proactive engagements with the Land Development Agency (LDA) both prior to and since its formal establishment in relation to potential landholdings which may be of interest to them for the development of housing provision.

The Commission&rsquo;s annual assessments are based on careful analysis and monitoring, drawing on a continuous dialogue with the Romanian authorities and with other EU countries, civil society, international organisations, independent experts and a variety of other interlocutors.<\/p>  <p>  Romania was deemed to have made good progress over a number of years.\u00a0 However, over the past three years\u00a0the European Commission has conveyed concerns to the Romanian Government.\u00a0 Earlier this month, Commission Vice-President Frans Timmermans wrote to the Romanian President, the Presidents of the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate, and the Prime Minister, setting out in some detail the Commission&rsquo;s opinion that various legislative amendments, which have mostly been introduced via emergency ordinances that bypass normal stakeholder consultations, have contributed to the weakening of judicial independence and the fight against corruption and crime. He warned that unless corrective measures were quickly applied, or if further negative steps were taken, the Commission would initiate the Rule of Law Framework enabling dialogue between the two sides aimed at avoiding the triggering of Article 7 of the Treaty on European Union.\u00a0 The Rule of Law Framework would temporarily replace the CVM process, although it would take account of the CVM benchmarks and recommendations.\u00a0 Mr. Timmermans also noted that the CVM would remain operational into the future, until its benchmarks and recommendations were fully and satisfactorily met.\u00a0 Furthermore, the letter warned that the Commission would act swiftly in response to any EU Treaty infringements by Romania.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland shares the objectives of the Commission, which are to help the Romanian authorities find solutions to the rule of law issues that have emerged, and to resume and indeed accelerate progress towards meeting the CVM benchmarks and recommendations.  The Irish Embassy in Bucharest and Embassies of twelve like-minded countries issued a joint statement in April, which called on all parties involved in drafting emergency Government ordinances to avoid legislative changes that would weaken the rule of law and Romania&rsquo;s ability to fight crime and corruption. Legislative changes currently under consideration risk breaching common European values, undermining the rule of law, and negatively impacting on Romania&rsquo;s economic development and the well-being of its citizens. We have urged the Romanian Government to take into account the steps recommended by the European Commission, the European Parliament, the EU Council, and the Council of Europe&rsquo;s Venice Commission and GRECO. The fact that Romania currently holds the EU Presidency places Romania in a special position of responsibility, and we have urged the Romanian Government to reaffirm political commitment to our shared values.

Since 2011, the Syria conflict has cost the lives of well over 400,000 people. As the conflict enters its ninth year, nearly 12 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance inside Syria, and more than 80 per cent of people live below the poverty line. Over 6 million people are displaced inside Syria, and a further 5.6 million have fled to neighbouring countries and the wider region. The Assad regime and its allies have repeatedly targeted civilians, through deliberate attacks, including chemical attacks, on civilian infrastructure such as homes, hospitals and schools, the use of &ldquo;starve or surrender&rdquo; techniques and the denial of humanitarian assistance, and forced displacement in the interest of demographic engineering. Other groups, most notably ISIS, have also perpetrated atrocities. <\/p>  <p>  While the conflict had been less intense in recent months, in recent weeks there has been an escalation of the conflict in the north-west of Syria, in the area around Idlib. Conflict there between the regime and other armed groups has displaced almost 200,000 people, has killed over 100 civilians, and has left hundreds injured. I condemn in particular the airstrikes that are reported to have targeted medical facilities and schools. <\/p>  <p>  All parties must uphold their ceasefire commitments and cease military activities in the Idlib region. Any attempt at a purely military approach to the situation there risks endangering hundreds of thousands of others. Those with influence on the Syrian regime have a responsibility to exert pressure to ensure that civilians are protected, and to encourage the Syrian Government to engage fully with the UN-led peace process. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland and the EU firmly believe that eight years of war have shown that military action cannot bring lasting peace to Syria. We support the UN-led efforts to bring about a political resolution to the conflict, in accordance with the 2012 Geneva Communiqu&eacute; and UN Security Council Resolution 2254. What is needed to bring a sustainable end to the violence is a Syrian-owned and Syrian-led process. The EU provides direct assistance to the Geneva peace talks and has launched, in coordination with the UN, an initiative to develop political dialogue with key actors from the region to identify common ground. <\/p>  <p>  The UN Special Envoy&rsquo;s efforts are currently focused on establishing a constitutional committee, made up of Syrians of different political views, to chart the way forward for the country and unlock a broader political process.

In March 2019, Ireland pledged a further &euro;25 million to the crisis, bringing the total amount of humanitarian assistance committed to the Syria crisis to over &euro;143 million since 2012 &ndash; our largest ever response to any single crisis.

I am aware of this situation and of the broader climate of violence and intimidation which exists for political and community activists and leaders in Colombia, and I would like to take this opportunity to urge the Government of Colombia to investigate these cases in full. <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, Ireland opened its new Embassy in Bogot&aacute; earlier this year. While Ireland&rsquo;s new Embassy&rsquo;s focus will be on developing the bilateral political and economic relationship with Colombia and on continuing to support the country&rsquo;s transition to a post-conflict society, having a permanent presence in Bogot&aacute; means that we will be much better positioned to monitor issues such as the situation of human rights defenders in the country. <\/p>  <p>  Officials at our new Embassy, as well as at my Department in Dublin, meet regularly with human rights leaders and civil society actors from across the country. The Embassy is following the situation in La Guajira closely and regularly engages with partner organisations in Colombia that are involved in monitoring human rights in this region. <\/p>  <p>  Embassy officials intend to visit La Guajira in the near future and meet with human rights defenders and civil society groups. We also regularly raise human rights concerns in our exchanges with the Government and official representatives of Colombia, including the situation of human rights defenders and community leaders.  <\/p>  <p>  Ireland also engages on the issue of intimidation and violence against human rights defenders and civil society actors at EU level. Former T&aacute;naiste Eamon Gilmore in his position as EU Special Envoy to the Colombian peace process, a role in which he is supported by my Department, recently led the 11th session of the EU-Colombia Human Rights Dialogue. <\/p>  <p>  Special Envoy Gilmore has visited the region of La Guajira in the past and, during this dialogue with representatives of the Colombian Government, he raised the alarmingly high figures of attacks against human rights defenders across the country. Particular reference was made to the disproportionately high level of violence against indigenous leaders, and the need for collective protection measures.  <\/p>  <p>  Ireland remains fully committed to supporting Colombia&rsquo;s transition to a peaceful post-conflict society, a key element of which is the vindication and protection of human, environmental and social rights. Significant challenges remain, but Ireland supports the full implementation of the peace agreement, which will ensure a more peaceful, stable and prosperous future for all Colombians.  <\/p>  <p>  Ireland has provided more than &euro;14 million in funding to Colombia since 2007, mainly channelled through the United Nations, and Colombian and international NGOs focusing on the areas of human rights, conflict prevention, peacebuilding and supporting livelihoods for rural populations. <\/p>  <p>  My Department provides funding directly to the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights in Colombia to support its important work in promoting and protecting human rights, including in some of Colombia&rsquo;s most isolated and challenging regions, as well as to the Inter American Commission on Human Rights, which provides protection measures to community leaders and activists operating in Colombia and elsewhere in Latin America. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland was also a founding member of the EU Trust Fund for Colombia, and will contribute &euro;3 million over the five-year lifespan of the Fund. The Fund finances projects targeted at the marginalised rural areas of Colombia which have been most affected by conflict, and all projects incorporate a human rights and gender perspective.<\/p>  <p>  I firmly believe that Colombia&rsquo;s peace accord provides the framework in which the endemic violence and impunity which has afflicted Colombian society for decades can successfully be addressed. Ireland sees our partnership with Colombia as a long-term commitment, and we will continue to strongly support the full implementation of the accords. <\/p>  <p>  We will continue to engage with the Colombian Government, EU and multilateral partners, and civil society groups and human rights defenders on this issue and on the broader human rights situation in the country. I can assure the Deputy of our continued commitment to assisting the Colombian people in their goal of achieving a brighter, more peaceful and more prosperous future for all Colombians.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052100053#WRD02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Finance","counter":220,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052100053#WRD02700"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Insurance Costs","counter":219,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052100053#WRD02600"},{"type":"question","counter":220,"qnumday":133,"qnumall":"[21598\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052100053#WRD02700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will address the ongoing issue of returning immigrants being charged high car insurance due to their no claims bonus expiring, even though no claims have been made against the policy.","asker":"1250","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":221,"content":"<p>At the outset it is important to note that as Minister for Finance, I am responsible for the development of the legal framework governing financial regulation.  Neither I nor the Central Bank of Ireland can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products, as these matters are of a commercial nature, and are determined by insurance companies based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept.  This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance which expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products.  Consequently, I am not in a position to direct insurance companies as to the pricing level or terms or conditions that they should apply in respect of particular categories of drivers or vehicles.  <\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this, the difficulties faced by returning emigrants in respect of motor insurance was recognised by the Cost of Insurance Working Group&rsquo;s and was the subject of a particular recommendation.  In this regard, a protocol was agreed between Insurance Ireland and the Department of Finance in relation to returning emigrants, under which insurance companies committed to accepting the driving experience of such drivers gained while abroad, when the driver has had previous driving experience in Ireland.  The details of it is available on Insurance Ireland&rsquo;s website and the websites of its member companies. <\/p>  <p>  The guiding principle of the protocol is to ensure that a returning emigrant is not treated differently to any other driver, subject to verification of their continued driving experience and the normal acceptance criteria of the company.  Thus, a returning emigrant will not be disadvantaged from spending that time abroad.  Furthermore, under the protocol, insurance companies will not distinguish between countries on the basis of which side of the road driving takes place therein.  My Department continues to review the implementation of this recommendation through its regular engagement with Insurance Ireland.  <\/p>  <p>  With regard to the specific scenario in the Deputy&rsquo;s question more precisely, I understand that in general, insurance companies set a date by which a no-claims bonus will expire, where the driver has held no insurance in their own name for 2 or more years.  This applies whether the person continues to reside in Ireland, or they decide to move abroad and this is primarily a commercial matter for insurance companies.  The protocol recognises this scenario and states that if more than two years have passed since the Irish motor insurance policy was cancelled\/lapsed, the Irish No Claims Discount is no longer valid.  Notwithstanding this, Insurance Ireland members have agreed through the protocol that if the person has claims-free driving experience in a different country in their own name, they will take this experience into consideration if that person seeks a quotation from an insurer, on their return to Ireland, subject to the appropriate verifiable documentation being provided.   <\/p>  <p>  Finally, I believe that the overall implementation of the CIWG&rsquo;s recommendations is having a significant impact with regard to private motor insurance.  The latest CSO figures from April 2019 show that the price of motor insurance is now 24.4% lower than the July 2016 peak, consequently the average consumer should be seeing reductions when renewing their motor insurance.  In addition, I would note that representations made to my Department from returning emigrants have dropped significantly in the last year.  I am hopeful that this reflects that more are receiving insurance cover in line with the protocol referenced above.  The Government is determined to continue working to ensure that these positive pricing trends can be extended to other forms of insurance, including those relevant to businesses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052100053#WRD02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Broadband Plan Expenditure","counter":222,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052100053#WRD02900"},{"type":"question","counter":223,"qnumday":134,"qnumall":"[21819\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052100053#WRD03000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the projected budgetary impact of the national broadband plan from 2019 to 2024, or the latest available date; and the estimated way in which this will impact the gross general Government balance in each affected year and as a percentage of GDP and GNI, in tabular form.","asker":"1280","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":224,"content":"<p>The Government's decision to proceed with the National Broadband Plan (NBP) was taken on the basis that additional expenditure required beyond that allocated within the National Development Plan (NDP) framework will be funded by future revenues and will accordingly not have funding repercussions for other planned projects within the NDP.<\/p>  <p>  Based on preliminary assessments, current indications are that no additional budgetary impact is envisaged for 2019 or 2020, while the NBP will require c. &euro;200m in additional funding in 2021 and 2022 and c. &euro;300m in 2023.

They therefore should be treated with caution.<\/p><p>Further, as the Deputy will already be aware, the estimates in relation to the tapering of credits are based on tax returns for 2016 following a bespoke exercise undertaken to break down the gross incomes of taxpayer units to an individualised level and a manual estimation process (outside of Revenue&rsquo;s usual tax modelling software).  As that exercise can only split gross incomes, this estimation process required a number of assumptions to be made in relation to the distribution of credits.<\/p><p>In relation to those questions which contain changes to the Universal Social Charge, these figures for the USC are from the Revenue micro-simulation model, Tax Modeller, and are estimates for 2019.

There would be significant development work (and associated cost and time) required to implement any changes to this basis. Were such a change implemented, it may lead to outcomes different to those modelled at present using the estimated data.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052100053#WRD04800","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"NAMA Operations","counter":243,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052100054#WRE00400"},{"type":"question","counter":244,"qnumday":146,"qnumall":"[21418\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052100054#WRE00500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his views on the proposed sale by NAMA of the National Asset Residential Property Services DAC, NARPS, special purpose vehicle and the impact of a sale on the long-term security of tenure for the tenants of the 1,230 properties held by same.","asker":"1215","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":245,"content":"<p>National Asset Residential Property Services DAC (NARPS) is NAMA&rsquo;s social housing special purpose vehicle (SPV) which has provided over 1,300 new units for social housing.

Consequently, following the publication of its Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance in 2017, the Cost of Insurance Working Group undertook an examination of the employer liability and public liability insurance sectors.\u00a0 This second phase culminated in the publication in January 2018 of the Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance.\u00a0 Much work has been done to date through the implementation of both reports of the Cost of Insurance Working Group and achievements to date include:<\/p>  <p>  - the establishment of the Personal Injuries Commission, and its subsequent recommendations relating to addressing award levels for soft tissue injuries;<\/p>  <p>  - the Law Reform Commission (LRC) has commenced its work to undertake a detailed analysis of the possibility of developing constitutionally sound legislation to delimit or cap the amounts of damages which a court may award in respect of some or all categories of personal injuries, as part of its Fifth Programme of Law Reform;<\/p>  <p>  - increasing transparency around the cost of private motor insurance through the establishment of the National Claims Information Database in the Central Bank;<\/p>  <p>  - reforms to the Personal Injuries Assessment Board through the Personal Injuries Assessment Board (Amendment) Act 2019;<\/p>  <p>  - amendments to Sections 8 and 14 of the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004 to make it easier for businesses and insurers to challenge cases where fraud or exaggeration is suspected;<\/p>  <p>  - the reform of the Insurance Compensation Fund to provide certainty to policyholders and insurers;

I am advised by the TAC that it is difficult to provide an actual quantum figure because the original quantum of tax under appeal may be modified post filing of the notice of appeal (i.e. where an aspect of the appeal is settled or withdrawn), the parties may disagree in relation to the precise quantum of tax in dispute, or the monetary value of an appeal is not always calculable (e.g. in appeals where the rate of tax is in dispute or where the quantum in dispute represents a refusal of loss relief or of deductions or in appeals in relation to the refusal of Tax Clearance Certificates).\u00a0 Subject to these caveats, as at 30 April, 2019 the TAC recorded the quantum of tax under appeal amounting to approximately &euro;3.7 billion. Of this amount, &euro;2.5 billion is comprised in 10 appeals, five of which were received by the TAC in the last week of December 2018.<\/p>  <p>  Some appeals before the TAC cannot be progressed when the Commission has to await the outcome of court proceedings.\u00a0 For example, a stay may have been placed on the progression of the appeals by the TAC by Order of the High Court, Court of Appeal or Supreme Court. Of the 10 highest-value appeals before the TAC, two appeals with a combined value of &euro;1.67 billion are currently stayed by Court Order and cannot be progressed by the TAC until the stays are lifted.<\/p>  <p>  In\u00a0 view of the growing backlog of appeals, I commissioned an independent review of the workload and operations of the TAC in 2018.\u00a0 In line with the review's recommendations, I sanctioned the doubling of the TAC&rsquo;s annual budget in 2019, to allow for additional staffing resources at all levels and additional funding for improved ICT systems. In June 2018 the TAC moved to a new, larger premises that allow for the scheduling of simultaneous hearings, to ensure greater and more efficient use of Commissioner&rsquo;s time. This is resulting in a reduction in the time parties have to wait for their appeal to be heard.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In addition, a Public Appointments Service competition for the recruitment of Temporary Appeal Commissioners was completed recently and appointments from the resulting panel are expected shortly. Legislation is also in progress to create the role of Chairperson of the TAC, as per a recommendation of the independent review.<\/p>  <p>  With the substantial increase in resources at the TAC, I expect the overall number of appeals and the quantum of tax under appeal with the TAC to begin to decrease steadily over the coming year.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052100055#WRF00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"NAMA Operations","counter":296,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052100055#WRF00600"},{"type":"question","counter":297,"qnumday":165,"qnumall":"[21664\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052100055#WRF00700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the impact on the general Government balance of the transfer of the &euro;2 billion National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, surplus for 2020 to the State.","asker":"1288","askee":"1292"},{"type":"question","counter":298,"qnumday":166,"qnumall":"[21665\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052100055#WRF00800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his plans for the &euro;2 billion National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, surplus to be collected in 2020; the way in which he plans to use it; when he plans to use same; the way in which the transfer of funds will be administered; and the location of its transfer.","asker":"1288","askee":"1292"},{"type":"question","counter":299,"qnumday":167,"qnumall":"[21666\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052100055#WRF00900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if the anticipated payment of &euro;2 billion from the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, in 2020 has been factored into the debt projection in the stability programme update; if not, the way in which it would reduce debt as a quantum and a percentage of gross domestic product and gross national income; and if it is fractured in to show the way in which not using it for debt reduction would affect the debt figures.","asker":"1288","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":300,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 165 to 167, inclusive, together.<\/p><p>NAMA was established in December 2009 and its debts of nearly &euro;32 billion represented a substantial contingent liability to the State.<\/p><p>The State recapitalised the domestic banking system at a gross cost of &euro;64 billion, adding around 40 per cent of GDP to national debt. <\/p><p>Total government debt now stands at over &euro;200 billion; this is the equivalent of &euro;42,500 for every\u00a0person in the State.<\/p><p>As per Eurostat guidance, while the NAMA surplus paid to the Exchequer will have a positive impact on the Exchequer balance it will not impact on the general government balance. <\/p><p>However, such repayment will reduce the Exchequer Borrowing Requirement, decreasing the rate at which debt is incurred by the state.

developments in this area, the position remains the same as in my response to the Deputy's PQs regarding the same scenarios on 19 June 2018 which is as follows:<\/p>  <p>  In order to estimate the potential revenue from a wealth tax, it is necessary to identify the wealth held by individuals. As there is currently no such wealth tax in operation in Ireland, the Department understands that the Revenue Commissioners have no basis or requirement to compile the data needed to produce estimates in relation to a potential wealth tax. Although an individual's assets and liabilities are declared to the Revenue in a number of specific circumstances (for example, after a death), this information is not a complete measure of assets and liabilities in the State, nor is it recorded in a manner that would allow analysis of the implications of an overarching wealth based tax. <\/p>  <p>  However, in 2013 the Central Statistics Office conducted the first comprehensive survey of household wealth in Ireland (the Household Finance and Consumption Survey (HFCS)). The survey provides information on the ownership and values of different types of assets and liabilities along with more general information on income, employment and household composition. <\/p>  <p>  During 2016, my Department, jointly with the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI), conducted a research project into the distribution of wealth in Ireland and the potential implications of a wealth tax using the HFCS. The research formed part of an on-going joint-research programme with the ESRI on the Macro-Economy and Taxation. The research paper, available on the ESRI website, presented results on the composition of wealth across both the wealth and income distributions in Ireland. A number of wealth tax scenarios were then applied to the Irish data (wealth tax regimes from other jurisdictions and hypothetical scenarios). In each case, the associated tax bases and revenue yields, the number of liable households across the income distribution, and the characteristics of the households affected are outlined. <\/p>  <p>  The wealth tax scenarios in the research paper that are closest to the wealth taxes outlined by the Deputy in his questions are the high threshold-large exemptions scenario (which best matches the scenario set out in PQ 21934\/19), and the high threshold-no exemptions scenarios (which best matches the scenario outlined in PQ 21932\/19) in Table 5 of the Department of Finance\/ESRI study. <\/p>  <p>  The first of these scenarios (high threshold-large exemption) has a personal threshold of &euro;1.0 million (doubled if married and a &euro;500,000 increase per child), applies a 1% tax rate and excludes farms, the household main residence, business and pension assets. This scenario, given the distribution of household wealth in Ireland in 2013, is estimated to raise &euro;53 million as outlined in Table 8 of the Department of Finance\/ESRI study. The research notes that its tax revenue estimates are static; in other words, no behavioral response to the tax is modeled. The estimate of &euro;53 million, therefore, is likely to be an upper estimate of the revenue that could be raised. <\/p>  <p>  The second scenario (high threshold-no exemption), applies a 1% tax rate but allows for no exclusions. This scenario, given the distribution of household wealth in Ireland in 2013, is estimated to raise &euro;248 million as outlined in Table 8 of the Department of Finance\/ESRI study. Again, the research notes that its tax revenue estimates are static; in other words, no behavioral response to the tax is modeled. The estimate of &euro;248 million, therefore, is also likely to be an upper estimate of the revenue that could be raised.  <\/p>  <p>  Given that the above scenarios are not identical to those outlined in the Deputy's questions, care should be taken in interpreting the revenue estimates. <\/p>  <p>  In order to estimate the yield from a tax with the precise parameters as outlined in the Deputy's questions, it would be necessary to seek the agreement of the CSO to revisit its original survey data for this specified purpose. This would be a significant undertaking that would take considerable time and resources to complete. It is also noted that the HFCS does not include specific data on the global assets for those domiciled or ordinarily resident and the domestic assets for those resident for tax purposes. As such, any estimate on the yield obtained from HFCS data would not fully capture the parameters outlined in the Deputy's question.<\/p>  <p>  However, there are a number of additional scenarios set out in the paper which the Deputy may find informative.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052100055#WRF05200","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Real Estate Investment Trusts","counter":337,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052100056#WRG00500"},{"type":"question","counter":338,"qnumday":185,"qnumall":"[21939\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052100056#WRG00600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the expected revenue from ending the capital gains tax exemption from the sale of property held within REITs.","asker":"1288","askee":"1292"},{"type":"question","counter":339,"qnumday":187,"qnumall":"[21941\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052100056#WRG00700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the estimated revenue from introducing a minimum dividend withholding tax rate of 25% and of 30% on all dividends paid by REITs.","asker":"1288","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":340,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 185 and 187 together.<\/p>  <p>  The regime for the operation of Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) in Ireland was introduced in Finance Act 2013.

Loss relief for corporation tax is a long standing feature of the Irish Corporate Tax system and is a standard feature of Corporation Tax systems in all OECD countries.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Section 396C of the TCA 1997 previously restricted NAMA participating institutions to offset losses against a maximum of 50% of taxable profits in a given year. At the time of its introduction the Government had limited involvement in the banking system. However, by Finance Bill 2013, this measure was considered to have outlasted its initial purpose. Due to the substantial holdings that the State had, by that time, acquired in the banking sector (99.8% AIB and 15% of Bank of Ireland), the restriction was deemed to be acting against the State&rsquo;s interests.<\/p>  <p>  Section 396C was repealed to reduce the State&rsquo;s role as a &lsquo;backstop&rsquo; provider of capital and to protect the existing value of the State&rsquo;s equity and debt investments.

This roadmap takes stock of the changing international tax environment, outlines the actions Ireland has taken to date and the further actions that will be taken over the coming years to ensure that our corporation tax code is line with international best practices.\u00a0 It outlines the various commitments we have made to tackle global tax avoidance, including those made in respect of the 15 actions of the OECD BEPS Action Plan but it also includes details in relation to the transposition of the EU Anti-Tax Avoidance Directives (&lsquo;ATAD&rsquo;), which comprise measures that directly correspond to specific BEPS actions.<\/p>  <p>  The Country-by-Country (CbC) Reporting, a tool developed by the OECD in accordance with Action 13, and the Knowledge Development Box which is in line with BEPS Action 5 were introduced in Finance Act 2015.\u00a0 Ireland is also fully compliant with the exchange of information on cross border tax rulings requirements in line with BEPS Action 5.<\/p>  <p>  The commitments set out in the roadmap regarding the remaining BEPS actions included commitments with regard to legislation to be introduced in Finance Act 2018. \u00a0\u00a0Finance Act 2018 introduced controlled foreign company (&lsquo;CFC&rsquo;) rules (BEPS Action 3) with effect from 1 January 2019. The purpose of CFC rules is to discourage the artificial diversion of income to low tax jurisdictions. As such they are not designed primarily to raise Exchequer revenue, but rather to modify taxpayer behaviour.<\/p>  <p>  The final legislative steps required to allow Ireland to complete the ratification of the BEPS multilateral instrument (BEPS Actions 6, 7, and 15 and certain aspects of BEPS Actions 2 and 14) were also taken in Finance Act 2018. The changes introduced to the application of Ireland&rsquo;s tax treaties are primarily anti-avoidance in nature and are aimed at stopping international tax planning strategies known as treaty shopping. It is not possible to estimate the potential impact on the Exchequer from the changes that will be made to the application of Ireland&rsquo;s tax treaties.<\/p>  <p>  The Corporation Tax Roadmap also enumerates further commitments to action over the next two years, including the introduction of anti-hybrid and anti-reverse hybrid rules (BEPS Action 2); an interest limitation ratio (BEPS Action 4); updating of transfer pricing rules (Actions 8-10); further work on mandatory disclosure rules (BEPS Action 12) and dispute resolution (BEPS Action 14).\u00a0 It will not be possible to estimate the impact on the Exchequer of such measures, were they implemented by the end of 2019, until the process of designing the measures is significantly further advanced. <\/p>  <p>  No specific direct tax measures have been recommended to date in addressing the tax challenges associated with the digital economy (BEPS Action 1). Work continues at OECD and EU level in relation to this.\u00a0 As a result, it is not possible to estimate the impact on the Exchequer of BEPS Action 1.<\/p>  <p>  BEPS Action 11 focuses on data collection and analysis. It does not make any specific recommendations in relation to tax changes. It relates to measurement of BEPS and suggests improvements in data collection. Therefore, it is not a revenue raising action and as a result, it is not possible to estimate the budgetary impact of BEPS Action 11.<\/p>  <p>  As I outlined in the roadmap, the confluence of the OECD BEPS outcomes and the most significant US tax reform in recent history is likely to lead to significant changes in the structure of multinationals over the next number of years. The purpose of the programme of changes set out in the Roadmap is to ensure that Ireland remains on a sustainable path for growth and investment in this rapidly-changing international tax environment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052100056#WRG02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Financial Services Sector","counter":356,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052100056#WRG02400"},{"type":"question","counter":357,"qnumday":192,"qnumall":"[21948\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052100056#WRG02500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the estimated additional revenue that would be raised by increasing the bank levy by each of 10 percentage points and by 10%; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1288","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":358,"content":"<p>Section 126AA of the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999 imposes an annual levy on certain financial institutions on the basis of the amount of deposit interest retention tax (DIRT) payable by them in a specified &lsquo;base&rsquo; year.

The rates are based on a methodology which takes account of both overhead costs (such as car purchase costs, depreciation and insurance) and also running costs (fuel costs and maintenance). The rates are intended to reimburse an officer for the costs incurred and are not considered to be a source of emolument or profit. As such, these rates are not considered to be an incentive for officers to use their own cars for official travel.<\/p>  <p>  All-electric vehicles, including both cars and electric bicycles, are a relatively new and developing technology. Comprehensive information such as that available for petrol\/diesel driven cars is not yet available for electric vehicles and, as a consequence, it has not yet possible to devise a mileage rate for electric cars and bicycles in the same manner as for petrol\/diesel vehicles. The current policy of my Department is that civil servants using all-electric vehicles may claim reimbursement at the lowest mileage rate (0 &ndash; 1200 CC) which currently stands at 37.95 cent per kilometre. This policy will be kept under review and will be adjusted as appropriate as the situation with electric vehicles becomes clearer.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware that the Revenue Commissioners administer a tax relief scheme for employers to provide a bicycle to employees where the employee does not incur a tax cost for benefit in kind. The Cycle to Work Scheme operates by way of a salary sacrifice and may also be used towards the cost of an electric bike. Where an officer uses their own bicycle for official travel, they may claim mileage at a rate of 8 cent per kilometre. This rate has been in place since 2007 and was determined by reference to annual wear and tear, the average cost of a bicycle, depreciation, maintenance, cleaning and repairs, and protective clothing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052100057#WRH05800","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Forensic Science Ireland Laboratory","counter":432,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052100058#WRJ00400"},{"type":"question","counter":433,"qnumday":222,"qnumall":"[22046\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052100058#WRJ00500","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 65 of 10 April 2019, the deadline date for the return of tenders; the number of tenders received; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1301","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":434,"content":"<p>Further to my response to Parliamentary Question No. 65 of 10 April 2019 regarding the Forensic Science Laboratory Project at the Backweston campus.

In this regard, the contractual position in respect of the working hours of SNAs is as outlined in their contracts of employment which were agreed with the school management authorities and the relevant Trade Unions representing SNAs (F&Oacute;RSA and SIPTU) prior to their introduction in 2005. The working week for SNAs is defined in paragraph 2.5 of their contract as follows: &quot;You will be required to work normal classroom hours including class break periods and in addition to attend before and after school in order to help with the preparation and tidying up of classrooms, reception and dispersal of children etc. The hours of work will normally be from [xxxx] to [xxxx] daily during term time.&quot;<\/p><p>This standard contract has been designed to be flexible to cater for the different spectrum of working hours across all the various schools including primary, post-primary and special schools. No set hours were agreed but instead, full-time SNAs are expected to work for the normal school hours in the school that they are working in, and in addition to be available for a period of time before and after school in order to help with reception and dispersal of children and preparation and tidying up of classrooms etc. These times are set locally by the school management and will vary from school to school depending on the requirements of the school. <\/p><p>In addition, all SNAs were required to be available for a number of days at the start and finish of each school term not exceeding 12 in total. Under the Croke Park Agreement it was agreed to introduce greater flexibility to the use of these 12 days.

This was agreed with the Unions representing SNAs (F&Oacute;RSA and SIPTU) when the contract was devised in 2005. This condition of service places a clear onus and obligation on the SNA to attend at their place of work and be available for work during the month of June.<\/p><p>It is a matter for school management as their employer to determine the precise work that is to be completed by SNAs during the month of June.

This discussion also focused on the implementation of the proposed EU Regulation, as well as on the existing structures and processes to report and remove illegal content, how they can be improved, how Government and industry can work closer together to address illegal content and a future framework for tackling this type of material.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, action is also taking place on a national level to tackle illegal content online through the Action Plan for Online Safety 2018-2019 which contains twenty-five actions under five main goals.  This is very much a whole of Government approach and\u00a0actions are assigned to six Government Departments for implementation, including my own.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052100061#WRM02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"International Protection","counter":611,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052100061#WRM02300"},{"type":"question","counter":612,"qnumday":284,"qnumall":"[21352\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052100061#WRM02400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if accommodation at a centre (details supplied) includes three bunk beds in one room for six applicants; the amount paid for this accommodation; and his views on whether this is humane and adequate accommodation for the persons there.","asker":"1367","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":613,"content":"<p>Currently,\u00a0all accommodation sourced by my Department for persons seeking international protection must meet the requirements of Section 63 of the 1966 Housing Act, which sets out the minimum space requirements per person in bedrooms.\u00a0 New\u00a0National Standards for accommodation provided to persons in the protection process will further improve the quality of life for applicants by providing a framework for the development of person-centred, high quality, safe and effective services and supports for residents of accommodation centres.\u00a0\u00a0The National Standards will require that all accommodation provided to persons seeking international protection is clean, safe, properly furnished and complies with all statutory requirements.\u00a0 These standards, which will be\u00a0adopted shortly, have been\u00a0prepared by\u00a0officials from my Department, in conjunction with officials from the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, representatives of NGOs and current residents.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The development of National Standards was one of the main recommendations of the Report of the Working Group into Improvements in the Protection Process, which was chaired by Judge Bryan McMahon.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The implementation of the\u00a0National Standards in the future, combined with\u00a0ongoing improvements such as the roll-out of\u00a0cooking facilities and independent living through the current procurement process, demonstrate the continual improvements\u00a0being made to the accommodation provided to persons seeking international protection in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  Having regard to the information supplied by the Deputy, I have asked officials from my Department\u00a0to visit the centre\u00a0within the next ten working days\u00a0and carry out an examination of the premises to ensure that accommodation is in compliance with the requirements of the Housing Act.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052100061#WRM02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1277"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Immigrant Investor Programme Applications","counter":614,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052100061#WRM02600"},{"type":"question","counter":615,"qnumday":285,"qnumall":"[21360\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052100061#WRM02700","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"when the remaining formal decision letters regarding applications to the immigrant investment programme will issue to applicants who applied in 2018; and if all outstanding investor applications from 2018 have been reviewed by the INIS evaluation team.","asker":"1250","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":616,"content":"<p>The Immigrant Investor Programme (IIP) was introduced in April 2012 to encourage inward investment and create business and employment opportunities in the State.\u00a0 The programme provides investors with the opportunity to invest in Ireland.

All applications for a certificate of naturalisation are processed and assessed individually in accordance with the provisions of the Act.  A determination on whether an applicant satisfies the statutory criteria attendant to naturalisation can only be made after an application is received.  The nature of the naturalisation process is such that, for a broad range of reasons, some cases can take longer than others to process.  In some instances, completing the necessary checks may take a considerable period of time.  Where a decision is made, the certificate cannot be issued until the applicant attends a citizenship ceremony arranged for the purpose of swearing the oath of allegiance before a judge.  <\/p>  <p>  Processing timescales can often be impacted due to further documentation being required from the applicant, or payment of the required certificate fee being awaited, or the applicant not engaging with the office.  In some instances, the applicant themselves may request that a hold be put on their application, for example, where they may have returned to their country of origin for a prolonged period, to facilitate them in making arrangements to return to reside in the State, or where they have difficulty in obtaining satisfactory evidence of their identity or nationality.  In other instances issues can arise at the final stage of the naturalisation process, for example, where additional information comes to light which requires to be considered before a final decision is taken. <\/p>  <p>  Accordingly, the nature of the naturalisation process is such that, for a broad range of reasons, some cases can take longer than others to process and thus an average wait time for applications is not a meaningful measure.  However, I can say that in general, it takes around 6 months for a standard application to be processed from the date it is received to the date a decision is made.  These processing timescales are being maintained notwithstanding an increase in application numbers over the past year.  <\/p>  <p>  The granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is a privilege and an honour which confers certain rights and entitlements, not only within the State but also at European Union as well as international level.  It is therefore important that appropriate procedures are in place to ensure that the integrity of the regime for granting Irish citizenship through the naturalisation process is held in high regard both at home and internationally.<\/p>  <p>  It is recognised that the naturalisation application process is a complex one which requires a considerable amount of supporting documentation but this is necessarily the case given the honour of being granted Irish citizenship and the significant benefits attendant to securing an Irish passport, particularly in the context of visa free travel to other jurisdictions.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware of the wide ranging Transformation Programme currently under way in my Department. The INIS Service Improvement Plan 2018-2020 dovetails with this programme and commits the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department to significant investment in technological developments including the roll-out of online forms and payments for citizenship applications as well as streamlining of processes and procedures.  Such developments are expected to deliver significant improvements to customer experiences.  <\/p>  <p>  INIS devotes a considerable amount of its overall resources to the processing of these cases.  It also operates a dedicated phone helpline and email helpdesk available for all applicants to enable queries to be dealt with, including the progress of their application.

These Regulations provide that all applicants must have a proven proficiency in two languages; one of which must be Irish or English. This requirement applies without discrimination to all candidates.  Such competency may be proven by achieving the relevant grades in an Irish Leaving Certificate or for English or Irish through such assessments as set out by the Public Appointments Service.  While two languages are required, applicants who do not possess proficiency in Irish but have a second language will be deemed eligible under the Regulations. <\/p>  <p>  The Public Appointments Service (PAS), on behalf of the Garda Commissioner, manages the initial recruitment stages for selection of Garda Trainees and I, as Minister, have no direct involvement in the matter.  I have, however, been informed that PAS, which conducts tests as part of the competitive selection process, carefully considers all requests for reasonable accommodations.\u00a0 In considering such requests, PAS is conscious of the rights of people with disabilities and of the obligations on it to observe those rights and to act in accordance with the provisions of the relevant equality legislation. <\/p>  <p>  As a public body established under the Public Service Management (Recruitment and Appointments) Act, 2004, PAS is also obliged under section 34(1)(b) of that Act to ensure that &ldquo;standards of probity, merit, equity and fairness&rdquo; apply to all of its recruitment and selection work.\u00a0 These binding standards are set out in the Code of Practice for Appointment to Positions where the Garda Commissioner has Statutory Responsibility, as published by the Commission for Public Service Appointments.<\/p>  <p>  I am further advised that in considering requests for reasonable accommodations, PAS has a fundamental duty to ensure it is being fair to all candidates who have entered a particular competition and that the key principle of appointment on merit is being observed.\u00a0 To assist PAS in considering a request for accommodations in a fair and balanced way, its policy is to ask candidates to indicate on their application if they require special accommodations and to submit evidence in support of their request.\u00a0 PAS will consider letters or reports from relevant professionals which clearly indicate the nature of the disability and the type of accommodation(s) that may be relevant to the person.\u00a0 PAS has given additional time to people with dyslexia where they have supporting evidence.

This will ensure that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na maintains its strong bond with the diverse communities it serves.

I might add that some 4,000 young people participate in Garda Youth Diversion projects in any one year.<\/p><p><b>Referrals to the Garda Diversion Programme 2012 &ndash; 2017<\/b><table><tr><th>Year <\/th><th>Age<\/th><th>Percent <\/th><th>Number <\/th><\/tr><tr><td>2012<\/td><td>12<\/td><td>4%<\/td><td>490<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>13<\/td><td>8%<\/td><td>980<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>14<\/td><td>12%<\/td><td>1470<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>15<\/td><td>19%<\/td><td>2327<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>16<\/td><td>21%<\/td><td>2572<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>17<\/td><td>35%<\/td><td>4286<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>Total <\/td><td>99%*<\/td><td>12246<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2013<\/td><td>12<\/td><td>4%<\/td><td>417<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>13<\/td><td>8%<\/td><td>834<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>14<\/td><td>13%<\/td><td>1355<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>15<\/td><td>19%<\/td><td>1980<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>16<\/td><td>23%<\/td><td>2397<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>17<\/td><td>33%<\/td><td>3439<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>Total <\/td><td>100%<\/td><td>10420<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2014<\/td><td>12<\/td><td>4%<\/td><td>400<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>13<\/td><td>8%<\/td><td>799<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>14<\/td><td>13%<\/td><td>1299<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>15<\/td><td>19%<\/td><td>1898<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>16<\/td><td>22%<\/td><td>2198<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>17<\/td><td>33%<\/td><td>3297<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>Total <\/td><td>99%*<\/td><td>9991<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2015<\/td><td>12<\/td><td>4%<\/td><td>392<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>13<\/td><td>8%<\/td><td>785<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>14<\/td><td>14%<\/td><td>1373<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>15<\/td><td>19%<\/td><td>1863<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>16<\/td><td>22%<\/td><td>2158<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>17<\/td><td>33%<\/td><td>3236<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>Total <\/td><td>100%<\/td><td>9807<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2016<\/td><td>12<\/td><td>4%<\/td><td>378<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>13<\/td><td>9%<\/td><td>851<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>14<\/td><td>14%<\/td><td>1323<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>15<\/td><td>20%<\/td><td>1890<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>16<\/td><td>23%<\/td><td>2174<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>17<\/td><td>30%<\/td><td>2835<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>Total <\/td><td>100%<\/td><td>9451<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2017<\/td><td>12<\/td><td>4%<\/td><td>424<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>13<\/td><td>10%<\/td><td>1061<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>14<\/td><td>16%<\/td><td>1697<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>15<\/td><td>20%<\/td><td>2121<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>16<\/td><td>21%<\/td><td>2227<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>17<\/td><td>29%<\/td><td>3076<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>Total <\/td><td>100%<\/td><td>10607<\/td><\/tr><\/table>*Figures taken from the Section 44 Monitoring committee reports, discrepancies are due to percentage rounding.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052100062#WRN02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1277"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Deployment","counter":666,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052100062#WRN02100"},{"type":"question","counter":667,"qnumday":305,"qnumall":"[21902\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052100062#WRN02200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of the most recent recruits from Templemore that are being stationed to County Cork;

Garda management keeps the distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.<\/p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that the Cohort Model of resource allocation is currently utilised for the allocation of personnel within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including newly attested probationer Garda&iacute; from the Garda College.  The allocation and transfer of Garda Personnel using the Cohort Model is determined by a number of factors, including crime and non-crime workload, minimum establishment, population, area, policing arrangements, and operational strategies.  When considering the allocation of resources to a Division, comprehensive consultation is carried out with local Garda management during which all factors are taken into consideration.<\/p><p>In relation to the allocation of newly attested Garda&iacute;, it is important to keep in mind that they have a further 16 months of practical and class-room based training to complete in order to receive their BA in Applied Policing.  To ensure that they are properly supported and supervised and have opportunities to gain the breadth of policing experience required, the Commissioner's policy is to allocate them to specially designated training stations which have the required training and development structures and resources in place, including trained Garda tutors and access to a permanently appointed supervisory Sergeant who is thoroughly familiar with their responsibilities under the training programme.<\/p><p>I am further informed by the Commissioner that while not all Garda Stations are training stations, the allocation of probationer Garda&iacute; to a Divisional training station facilitates the reassignment of Garda&iacute; to other stations within the Division, if required, by the Divisional Officer.<\/p><p>The information in relation to the number of new recruits allocated to each\u00a0Garda Station is available on my Department&rsquo;s website through the link below, as supplied by the Commissioner.<\/p><p><i>http:\/\/www.justice.ie\/en\/JELR\/08_Allocation_of_Probationer_Garda&iacute;_by_Division_and_Station_2014_to_March_2019<\/i><font color=\"#0000FF\">.<\/font><\/p><p>For more general information on Garda Facts and Figures please see the link below:<\/p><p><i>.<\/i><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052100062#WRN03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Immigration Status","counter":684,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052100063#WRO00700"},{"type":"question","counter":685,"qnumday":320,"qnumall":"[21984\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052100063#WRO00800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the progress to date in the determination of a case pursuant to section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 in the case of a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":686,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department that, in response to a notification pursuant to the provisions of Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended),\u00a0written representations have been submitted on behalf of the persons concerned. <\/p>  <p>  These representations, together with all other information and documentation on file, will be fully considered, under Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and all other applicable legislation, in advance of\u00a0final decisions being made.\u00a0  <\/p>  <p>  Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to the INIS of my Department by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.

The review is an important priority for me and for my Department. I expect a draft report with options for reform to be submitted to me in the coming weeks. The review has undergone some delay, due to other urgent legislative priorities and also due to important judgments from the Supreme Court and the European Court of Human Rights in the intervening period since the announcement of the review. These judgments will be taken into account in the review. <\/p>  <p>  The Review is addressing several issues that have been raised in submissions to the Review, including questions relating to the level of damages which has been raised by the print media in recent campaigns in this field. Specifically, the review will address, among other issues: \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  - Whether changes should be made to the respective roles of the judge and the jury in High Court defamation cases, in particular in relation to the question of damages;<\/p>  <p>  - Whether any change should be made to the level or type of damages which may be awarded in defamation cases, or to the factors to be taken into account in making that determination.<\/p>  <p>  The core aim of defamation law in general is to find the right balance between protecting an individual&rsquo;s good name and privacy, and protecting the right to freedom of expression, taking account of the vital role in our democracy played by a free and independent press. It is important that the Defamation Act operates in practice to ensure that damages awarded to a plaintiff are fair and proportionate to the harm suffered by them in the context of a defamatory statement. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy refers to the so called &ldquo;serious harm&rdquo; test which was introduced in section 1 of the Defamation Act 2013 in England and Wales. Since the enactment of the 2013 Act in\u00a0England and Wales, this test requires a claimant when initiating a defamation action to prove that a potentially defamatory statement has caused or is likely to cause serious harm to the reputation of the claimant before the case can proceed. The effects of this requirement on defamation law in England and Wales and its possible effects in the Irish context are being considered as part of the review. This is only one of several options being examined at the moment to determine which reforms would be most effective and appropriate in the Irish legal context. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052100063#WRO02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Naturalisation Applications","counter":699,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052100063#WRO02200"},{"type":"question","counter":700,"qnumday":325,"qnumall":"[22125\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052100063#WRO02300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if an application for naturalisation by a person (details supplied) sent by post from D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 28 March 2019 has been received; when they can expect to receive the return of their British passport; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1349","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":701,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department that an application for a certificate of naturalisation was received from the person referred to by the Deputy on 2 April 2019.

A robust traceability system will support our continued efforts to gain new export markets for Irish sheep meat.  <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the current national sheep identification system is widely acknowledged to be very complex, with an over reliance on the manual transcription of individual sheep identification numbers, leading to errors in the recording of information that is essential in tracing an animal back to the holding of its origin. <\/p>  <p>  The extension of electronic identification will simplify the sheep tagging system by significantly reducing the record keeping requirements for sheep farmers moving sheep to livestock marts and slaughter plants operating as approved Central Points of Recording (CPRs).  This will provide a more accurate and robust sheep traceability system in support of animal health and public health objectives and thus support the further development and sustainability of the sheep industry.<\/p>  <p>  My officials are working very closely with marts and slaughter plants to ensure that as many of these premises as possible will operate as CPRs with effect from 1st June.  It is my understanding that the major sheep processing slaughter plants are making significant progress in this regard.  Marts are similarly well disposed to operating as CPRs and are proactively engaging with the CPR process with a view to having facilities in place at the earliest opportunity.  I accept that the upgrading of mart facilities to CPR standards will be an incremental process and, on the basis of their proactive engagement, I anticipate that a significant number of marts will be in a position to operate as CPRs in a relatively short period. <\/p>  <p>  Keepers moving sheep to approved CPRs will continue to be required to fill out a dispatch document to accompany the sheep on movement but will not be required to list the individual numbers of each sheep consigned to a specific batch. All that will be required of them in that regard is to record, in the relevant part of the dispatch document, the total number of sheep associated with that document.  The CPR will scan all presented sheep and will provide the keeper (and purchaser where appropriate) with a printed list of all presented tag numbers (LPT).  The serial number of the corresponding dispatch document will be printed on the LPT also to facilitate the keeper in associating this list with his\/her copy of the dispatch document.  It is important that this LPT is checked by the keeper for accuracy.  This document and the copy of the dispatch document must be kept by the keeper for record keeping purposes.<\/p>  <p>  Where it is not feasible for marts or slaughter plants to upgrade their facilities to CPR requirements, farmers can continue to move sheep to these premises by either scanning and printing out the tag numbers of the sheep to be moved for attachment to the relevant dispatch document or by continuing to record the individual number of each sheep presented to a non-CPR mart or slaughter plant on the dispatch document.<\/p>  <p>  The extension of EID to all sheep will further enhance traceability across the sheep sector and will assist in the Government's efforts to maintain and expand the export markets for Irish sheep meat.  Indeed, I was very pleased to announce during my trade mission to China just last week that the Chinese authorities have agreed to an inspection visit on sheep meat in Ireland in August this year.  I will also be travelling to Japan in June to build on the efforts made there to date in pursuing market access and increasing market opportunities in line with Food Wise 2025 and our response to Brexit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052100072#WRX01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Beef Industry","counter":1175,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052100072#WRX01300"},{"type":"question","counter":1176,"qnumday":490,"qnumall":"[21689\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052100072#WRX01400","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if consideration will be given to seeking protected geographical indication status exclusively for suckler beef rather than the entire herd, enabling suckler beef to be sold as a premium product; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1370","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":1177,"content":"<p>I am very conscious of the role played by suckler farming in sustaining the rural economy and rural communities across Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  A Protected Geographical Indication (PGI), as referred to by the Deputy, is a product, which must be produced,\u00a0processed or prepared in a particular geographical area, and where a specific quality reputation, or other characteristics are attributable to that area.

It works on the basis of tradable certificates - two certificates are awarded per litre of sustainable biofuel if that biofuel is produced from wastes or residues, or one certificate is awarded per litre for all other sustainable biofuels.   For each calendar year, a fuel supplier must hold sufficient biofuel obligation certificates to demonstrate compliance. Suppliers can meet their obligation either by placing sufficient amounts of biofuel on the market themselves, or by purchasing certificates from other suppliers with a surplus. The number of certificates required is determined by the biofuel obligation rate which increased in January 2019 from 8% by volume to 10% by volume.

The availability of ubiquitous high speed broadband will bring significant benefits in areas of e-Health, e-Education, smart farming, regional development and tourism.<\/p>  <p>  The Government's National Broadband Plan (NBP) aims to ensure high speed broadband access (minimum 30 megabits per second) to all premises in Ireland, regardless of location. The NBP, which is pillar 5 of the Action Plan for Rural Ireland, has been a catalyst in encouraging investment by the telecoms sector. In 2012, less than 700,000, or 30% of Irish premises had access to high speed broadband.

Following rigorous evaluation by the Department, I recently brought a recommendation to Government to confer Preferred Bidder status on Granahan McCourt, the remaining bidder in the NBP procurement process and Government agreed to this at its meeting on 7 May. <\/p>  <p>  The Government Decision means that it is intended to award the State Intervention contract to National Broadband Ireland, subject to the contract close, including the finalisation of financial and legal documents.

It is anticipated that between 7 and 23 BCPs will be deployed in each county. BCPs will provide a community based high speed broadband service, enhancing online participation and allowing for the establishment of digital work hubs in these locations. A deployment plan will be made available by the Bidder once the contract is signed. The Bidder is aiming to pass 133,000 premises by end of the second year of the overall deployment, with 70-100,000 passed each year thereafter until roll out is completed. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052100074#WRZ04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Broadband Plan Data","counter":1306,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052100074#WRZ04200"},{"type":"question","counter":1307,"qnumday":539,"qnumall":"[21654\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052100074#WRZ04300","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the unit price of cable per kilometre in the context of the national broadband plan; the number of optic strands per cable line; the price of infrastructure rental; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Following rigorous evaluation by my Department, I recently brought a recommendation to Government to confer Preferred Bidder status on Granahan McCourt, the remaining bidder in the NBP procurement process and Government agreed to this at its meeting on 7 May. <\/p>  <p>  The Government decision means that it is intended to award the State Intervention contract to National Broadband Ireland, subject to the contract close, including the finalisation of financial and legal documents. Deployment of the NBP State Intervention network will commence shortly after that. The Bidder has indicated that the NBP State intervention will take an estimated 7 years from the beginning of deployment.<\/p>  <p>  In the first year of this roll out, the Bidder will deploy approximately 300 Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) across all counties. It is anticipated that between 7 and 23 BCPs will be deployed in each county. BCPs will provide a community based high speed broadband service, enhancing online participation and allowing for the establishment of digital work hubs in these locations. A deployment plan will be made available by the bidder once the contract is signed. The Bidder is aiming to pass 133,000 premises by end of the second year of the overall deployment, with 70,000 to 100,000 passed each year thereafter until roll out to the 540,000 is completed. <\/p>  <p>  Roll out of the National Broadband Plan State intervention to the approximately 44,000 businesses in the intervention area will take place against the backdrop of a significant and rapid transformation in the structure of global and national economies. <\/p>  <p>  A growing number of businesses and industries, particularly digitally intensive enterprises, will need Gigabit connectivity to create new applications and business models to produce, distribute and sell their goods and services more competitively. From manufacturing systems to ordering and delivery processes, from data storage and analytics to internal and external communications, their future competitiveness requires cost-effective access to such connectivity. The State intervention will provide this connectivity to businesses from day one of connection.<\/p>  <p>  One of the key elements of the NBP Intervention Strategy is a requirement to put forward specific speeds and connection times to meet the best practice needs of the business community. The predominantly fibre solution proposed by the Preferred Bidder in the NBP will facilitate and support these types of business services and the network to be built will provide that confidence and assurance to all businesses in the Intervention Area.<\/p>  <p>  The cost of providing high speed broadband internationally is dependent on a range of factors including the cost of labour and materials, the governance and regulatory regime in place and the preferred technology selected by operators and policy makers. It is therefore not possible to state whether the cost of broadband is increasing internationally. However, while each country may have a different approach Ireland is not alone in pursuing fibre as a solution for provision of high speed broadband in rural areas. While the procurement process did not specify a preferred technology all bidders in the process proposed fibre as the best solution. My Department considered other technologies such as 4G and 5G or fixed wireless. It agreed with the national and international expertise in this area that a fibre-based solution was the most cost-effective way to address all premises with a future proofed solution over the 25 years of the contract. This is in line with the approach being adopted in other EU countries and internationally.<\/p>  <p>  Fibre can meet the requirements and additional capacity can be added over time at low additional cost to network operators. Fibre can deliver up to 10 Gbps of speed with no major upgrades required, ensuring that the solution is future proofed and has a low running cost, making it an extremely efficient solution. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052100075#WRAA03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Post Office Network","counter":1351,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052100075#WRAA03600"},{"type":"question","counter":1352,"qnumday":553,"qnumall":"[22105\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052100075#WRAA03700","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"if the postal services, including counter services and the network of offices nationally, can be utilised to deliver other services compatible with those provided by An Post and the retention of the maximum number of jobs in the postal sector; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":1353,"content":"<p>The provision of postal services and counter services is an operational matter for An Post and not one in which I, as Minister, have a function. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052100075#WRAA03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Waste Management","counter":1354,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052100075#WRAA03900"},{"type":"question","counter":1355,"qnumday":554,"qnumall":"[22106\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052100075#WRAA04000","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the extent to which he can encourage an accelerated programme to discourage the use of single-use plastics; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":1356,"content":"<p>I am fully committed to discouraging the use of single use plastics as evidenced by the fact that I secured Government approval in January this year to ban the purchase of some commonly used single use plastic items by Government Departments and all public bodies and state agencies under the aegis of Ministers.  <\/p><p>I am awaiting the final adoption of a Directive from the EU which will enable me to take more concrete measures to ban certain single use plastics and make the producers of others responsible for some waste management and clean up costs. <\/p><p>I firmly believe that education is an essential tool in preventing the use of unnecessary plastic and managing the waste arising from it.

Engagement with relevant stakeholders including the European Commission&rsquo;s Directorate General (DG) for Competition, will continue in the coming months. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052100075#WRAA05600","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Renewable Energy Generation","counter":1372,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052100076#WRBB00200"},{"type":"question","counter":1373,"qnumday":562,"qnumall":"[22120\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052100076#WRBB00300","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"if he will direct ESBN and EirGrid to deploy additional resources to connect renewable generators to the grid faster in view of the fact that a climate emergency has been declared; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1298","askee":"1293"},{"type":"question","counter":1374,"qnumday":563,"qnumall":"[22121\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052100076#WRBB00350","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"if he will direct all parties involved to speed up the allocation of grid capacity for renewable generators in view of the fact that a climate emergency has been declared; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1298","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":1375,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 562 and 563 together.<\/p>  <p>  The declaration of a climate and biodiversity emergency by the D&aacute;il on 9 May underlines the importance of the work currently under way to develop a new All of Government Climate Action Plan. <\/p>  <p>  The challenge is such that a significant step-up in policy ambition and delivery is required by all sectors, to ensure that we at least meet our 2030 targets and get on a clear pathway to meeting our 2050 objectives. In the electricity sector, this will require a major upscaling of capacity in terms of connecting renewable generation to the grid and a range of actions will be included in the forthcoming Plan. The Plan will set out how this Government intends to make Ireland climate resilient across our entire society. This will involve setting climate goals in all key sectors, including electricity, agriculture, transport and industry. It will have a strong focus on implementation, including clear timelines and steps needed to achieve each action.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, the new Framework will set out clear actions required to achieve the ambition of meeting 70% of energy demand from renewable sources by 2030. The management of connections to the electricity grid, including processes and connection charging rules, is a matter for EirGrid and ESB Networks under rules determined by the Commission for Regulation Utilities (CRU), which is an independent statutory body.

The provision of insurance cover and the price at which it is offered are commercial matters for insurance companies and\u00a0are based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept and adequate provisioning to meet those risks.

They provide support and guidance to local service providers and parents in relation to the childcare programmes and support quality in keeping with national frameworks and policy objectives.

access and meaningfully participate in the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme.  It was introduced in June 2016 and is administered by Pobal on behalf of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  AIM is a child-centred model, involving 7 levels of progressive support, moving from the universal to the targeted, based on the needs of the child in the context of the pre-school setting they are attending.<\/p><p>AIM Level 1 includes the new higher education programme in Leadership for Inclusion in the Early Years (LINC),\u00a0established in 2016 with the first intake of students graduating in October 2017.  Pre-school settings employing an Inclusion Coordinator (who has graduated from LINC and has agreed to take on the role of Inclusion Coordinator (INCO) in the pre-school setting) can apply for\u00a0an increase of &euro;2 per child per week in the rate of ECCE capitation payable to that setting.  Applications for this increased rate of ECCE capitation were accepted from 2017.\u00a0<\/p><p>AIM Level 2 provides information for parents and pre-school providers.  A dedicated website has been launched under this level - www.aim.gov.ie - and an AIM Communications Strategy is also being developed.<\/p><p>AIM Level 3, in recognising the requirement to continue to develop a qualified workforce that can confidently meet the needs of all children wishing to participate in the ECCE programme, provides for a multi-annual training programme for pre-school practitioners.<\/p><p>AIM Level 4 provides access to mentoring for pre-school practitioners from a team of dedicated AIM Early Years Specialists. <\/p><p>AIM Level 5 provides for access to specialised equipment, appliances, assistive technology and\/or minor alterations capital grants for early years&rsquo; settings to ensure children with a disability can participate in the ECCE programme.<\/p><p>AIM Level 6 provides access to HSE therapeutic services where they are critical to enable the child to be enrolled and to meaningfully participate in the ECCE programme.<\/p><p>AIM Level 7 provides additional assistance in the pre-school room where this is critical to ensuring a child&rsquo;s participation in the ECCE programme.  In line with emerging best practice to support the integration and independence of children with a disability, AIM does not fund Special Needs Assistants (SNAs).  Rather, it provides financial support to the pre-school provider, which can be used either to reduce the adult to child ratio in the pre-school room or to buy in additional assistance to the pre-school room.

The applicant must also qualify for certain Social Protection payments. <\/p>  <p>  The widowed or surviving civil partner grant is different in nature to many payments, including the widowed or surviving civil partner&rsquo;s pension, as it is a once off grant, paid at the time of a bereavement, and does not contribute to the ongoing costs of raising a child, beyond the immediate period of the bereavement. <\/p>  <p>  The reason a spouse does not receive a widowed or surviving civil partner grant in the circumstances outlined by the Deputy is that the person has not entered into marriage or a civil partnership with the person they were co-habiting with.

It has been designed to harness the potential of private sector interest in social housing delivery in a new set of long-term leasing arrangements, in a manner designed to leverage off-balance sheet funding opportunities in accordance with Rebuilding Ireland objectives.<\/p>  <p>  Following the launch of the Social Housing Strategy 2020, a wide variety of developers, investors, financiers, Approved Housing Bodies and others expressed an interest in being involved in the provision or financing of social housing across the country. A structured, formal process was put in place to facilitate engagement with these bodies.  A body called the Social Housing Investment Proposals Clearing House Group - or the Clearing House Group - was established in 2015 to examine and consider proposals and to meet with the companies, groups and institutions involved. Arising from the workings of that group, Government took the decision in February 2016 to develop a new enhanced leasing scheme, which would provide lessors with a longer-term contract with a greater proportion of market rent available, in exchange for more responsibility with regard to management and maintenance and greater risk transfer from local authorities. The Government decision at that time was informed by a consideration of indicative costs including comparative costs with other delivery schemes.<\/p>  <p>  In the period after February 2016, the Clearing House Group concluded its work and my Department, the National Development Finance Agency, the Housing Agency and local authorities worked to develop a new set of long-term enhanced leasing arrangements that met the requirements of that Government decision.<\/p>  <p>  A further set of costings were undertaken to inform the decision of Government to move forward and launch the enhanced leasing scheme in January 2018. These costings were undertaken using information on average lease costs, at that time, and the expected level of take-up of the scheme, which is targeted at 2,500 units by end 2021.  The costs of the Enhanced Lease are included in the Government's commitment to multi-annual funding to deliver on the targets set out in Rebuilding Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  There are a number of factors, which ensure that leasing is good value in the long term for the State. The cost of delivering social housing units under the traditional construction and acquisition model is not adequately captured by the up-front capital expenditure, as each unit will carry a stream of ongoing costs over the long-term including management, maintenance and remediation. Furthermore, during the term of the lease, the responsibility for structural matters remains with the property owner and not the local authority.  At the end of the lease term &ndash; 25 years is a substantial period - the dwelling can require major renovation or upgrading resulting in a significant capital cost, which under leasing is not borne by the local authority but by the owner. <\/p>  <p>  To date, there have been two Calls for Proposals, where interested parties were given the opportunity to make qualifying submissions to the scheme. The first Call for Proposals ran from 31 January 2018 and the Housing Agency accepted submissions from interested parties until 12 April 2018.  After that Call for Proposals, my Department carried out a review of the submission process, to reflect on the nature of the submissions made, and amendments were made to the scheme, including the introduction of a Pre-Planning Suitability Assessment process, in order to allow proposers that have yet to obtain planning permission for their lands, an opportunity to gauge the interest of the relevant Local Authority in any proposals for housing that might come forward with planning.  Other amendments included stricter submission quality control measures, to improve the quality of the submissions.  <\/p>  <p>  The launch of the Second Call for Proposals, in August 2018, reflected this process review.  The scheme is the subject of ongoing monitoring by my Department, as is the case with all social housing delivery programmes. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052100080#WRFF01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Vacant Sites Levy","counter":1610,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052100080#WRFF01800"},{"type":"question","counter":1611,"qnumday":644,"qnumall":"[21616\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052100080#WRFF01900","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the estimated additional revenue that would be raised by each extra one percentage point on the vacant site levy.","asker":"1288","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":1612,"content":"<p>Under the vacant site levy provisions in the Urban Regeneration and Housing Act 2015, planning authorities are empowered to apply a vacant site levy of 3% of the market value of relevant vacant sites where a site exceeds 0.05 hectares in area, was in the planning authority&rsquo;s opinion vacant or idle in 2018, and is in an area identified by the planning authority in its development plan or local area plan for residential or regeneration development. As signalled in Budget 2018, the rate of the levy has been increased to 7% for sites on a local authority vacant sites register from 2019 onwards and in respect of which site owners will become liable to with effect from January 2020.<\/p>  <p>  My Department does not maintain a central register of vacant sites, as each local authority administers the vacant site register in respect of their functional area. As provided for under the Act, the register in respect of each local authority is available for inspection at its offices and online on its website. However, on foot of a recent review of the on-line vacant site registers across all local authority areas, I understand that there are collectively over 380 individual sites currently on the local registers. Over\u00a0120 of these sites were entered on the local vacant site registers on 1 January 2018 and are therefore subject to the levy in 2019, unless development works were activated in the interim. <\/p>  <p>  The specific information sought by the Deputy in relation to the amount of the levy that would be raised in particular circumstances is not available in my Department. However, based on the current legislative provisions and a recent review of the sites currently listed on local authority registers, it is estimated that the levy proceeds nationally could be of the order of &euro;7.6m in 2019 (applying the current 3% levy rate) and &euro;22.7m in 2020 (applying the increased 7% levy rate). The latter estimate for 2020 is based on the number of sites currently included on the local vacant site registers and in respect of which market valuations have been attached to the registered sites. It is anticipated that the number of registered sites in respect of which market valuations will be obtained will increase in the coming months which should result in an increase in the estimated levy proceeds nationally for 2020.<\/p>  <p>  My Department continues to monitor implementation of the levy to ensure that it is being effectively applied, in line with its intended purpose of incentivising the development of vacant or under-utilised sites in urban areas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052100080#WRFF02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Housing Adaptation Grant Eligibility","counter":1613,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052100080#WRFF02100"},{"type":"question","counter":1614,"qnumday":645,"qnumall":"[21630\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052100080#WRFF02200","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the grants or other funding available for a sensory room in newly built houses for children with non-verbal autism; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1350","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":1615,"content":"<p>My Department provides Exchequer funding to local authorities to support the Housing Adaptation Grants for People with a Disability in private houses.\u00a0 These grants are available to assist in the carrying out of works which are reasonably necessary for the purposes of rendering a house more suitable for the accommodation of a person with a disability who has an enduring physical, sensory, mental health or intellectual impairment.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The detailed administration of the grants, including the assessment, approval and payment of individual grants to applicants, is the responsibility of the relevant local authority.

This positions members of the public to engage with their local authority in relation to addressing individual derelict sites in their local areas.<\/p><p>It is a matter for local authorities to determine the most appropriate use of the legislation within their respective functional areas. <\/p><p>Under the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2018, both the Derelict Sites Levy and the Vacant Sites Levy will increase from 3% to 7% of the market valuation of relevant sites with effect from January 2020. This change in the rate of the levies is intended to ensure that the levies have more meaningful impact and that the powers of local authorities in tackling dereliction and vacancy are strengthened for the purpose of bringing relevant sites into productive use, thereby facilitating urban regeneration and development while also combatting land hoarding. <\/p><p>In addition, the Planning and Development (Amendment) (No.2) Regulations 2018, which came into operation on 8 February 2018, provide for an exemption from the requirement to obtain planning permission in respect of the change of use of certain vacant commercial premises, including vacant areas above ground floor premises, to residential use. This measure is aimed at facilitating the productive re-use of qualifying vacant commercial buildings as homes, while also facilitating urban renewal and the bringing on stream of increased housing supply.<\/p><p>In relation to progress on a more general level, Rebuilding Ireland aims to deliver over 50,000 additional social housing homes through build, acquisition and leasing programmes and also aims to support some 87,000 additional households through the Housing Assistance Payment Scheme and the Rental Accommodation Scheme, over the 6 year period of the Plan. \u00a0<\/p><p>Very significant progress has been made in delivering on Rebuilding Ireland's targets, with over 72,000 households having had their housing need met under the Plan by\u00a0end 2018. This level of delivery has been reflected in the reductions recorded on housing waiting lists, with the number of households on waiting lists reducing by 13,941, or over 16%, between 2017 and 2018 alone.<\/p><p>Rebuilding Ireland has been increasing the capacity of local authorities and Approved Housing Bodies\u00a0to deliver social housing over the past three years and clear results are being delivered.\u00a0 This is evident in the fact that\u00a0there was an 85% increase in new build social homes in 2018 when compared to 2017 and the\u00a0number of new social housing homes built in 2018 was eight times greater than the number built in 2015, the year before Rebuilding Ireland was initiated.<\/p><p>My Department\u00a0supports delivery through\u00a0the development and implementation of policy and legislation\u00a0geared towards enhanced supply and also through the provision of significant funding for local authorities. In addition, my Department works closely with each individual local authority to support them to deliver their minimum targets, and where possible to exceed their targets and advance their pipelines for additional delivery in the coming years. The quarterly Construction Status Reports which I publish provide an overview of all new build social housing completed and being advanced across the 31 local authorities.\u00a0 The latest report, which sets out the position at end 2018,\u00a0is available on the Rebuilding Ireland website at \u00a0<i><\/i>.<\/p><p>The coming three years will see further increased output of social housing throughout the country and I have recently written to each local authority outlining ambitious targets for 2019.
