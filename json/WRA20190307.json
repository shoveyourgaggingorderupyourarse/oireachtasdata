These projects will receive over &euro;70 million in government funding between now and 2021 and they represent the health, food, ICT and manufacturing sectors in Ireland. The projects involve partners right across the country, showing that excellence in collaborative research, development and innovation transcends county borders and every part of Ireland is capable of participation in one of the most unique Funds Ireland has developed. In fact, 18 of the successful projects involve partners based outside the capital. The projects are co-funded by the enterprise partners in each consortium.<\/p>  <p>   A second call will launch in 2019 but the date has not yet been finalised.

I am focused on both supporting and sustaining existing employment levels in regional Ireland while also working to create new economic opportunities and jobs in every county of Ireland. My Department and its agencies are working to ensure that employment and investment are distributed as evenly as possible across the country including in County Meath. <\/p>  <p>Co. Meath forms part of the Mid-East region and on 7th February 2019 I launched the new Regional Enterprise Plan to 2020 for the Mid-East. Building on the previous Regional Action Plan for Jobs 2015 to 2017, the new Plan targets a 10-15 percent growth in employment over the period to 2020 and to ensure that unemployment reduces to within at least one percentage point of the State average. Since commencing the Regional Action Plan for Jobs in 2015, excellent progress has been made on job creation in the Mid-East region, with 42,400 more people in employment in the region from Q1 2015 (baseline year) to Q4 2018. The unemployment rate in the Mid-East region at Q4 2018 stands at 4.9 percent, below the State average of 5.4% and down from 9.6 percent in Q1 2015. <\/p>  <p>  Total employment in IDA Ireland's client companies now stands at 229,057, with 58% of all IDA employment outside of Dublin. This represents the highest number of people employed by IDA clients outside of Dublin in the history of the organisation. The last 12 months have seen more IDA jobs added in the regions than at any time over the past 17 years. <\/p>  <p>  I am pleased to say that County Meath has seen a 4% increase in foreign direct investment (FDI) employment in the last year. There are now 19 IDA-supported client companies in the County employing 1,632 people. Meath continues to maintain a strong contingent of overseas firms in the Financial Services, Manufacturing and Biotechnology sectors with key clients such as ArcRoyal, International Fund Services and Alltech performing well in the County. <\/p>  <p>  A total of 18,846 new jobs were created in EI companies in 2018 (net 9,119 jobs created). In County Meath, 500 new jobs were created by Enterprise Ireland client companies.  A total of 7,135 people are now employed in 155 Enterprise Ireland supported companies in Co. Meath.  In the period 2016 - 2018 Enterprise Ireland paid &euro;4,146,291 million to client companies in Meath to support companies to be innovative, improve competitiveness and to diversify their global footprint. <\/p>  <p>  The Local Enterprise Office (LEO) Meath is the &lsquo;first-stop-shop&rsquo; for providing advice and guidance, financial assistance and other supports to those wishing to start or grow their own businesses in the county. <\/p>  <p>In 2018, LEO Meath supported the creation of 231 gross new jobs and approved 37 grants in total for the year, to a value of &euro;470,165.   LEO Meath ran training courses for 894 participants and provided mentoring services for 306 participants. I also announced an extra &euro;5 million in Budget 2019 which will enable the LEOs, including LEO Meath, to support a broad variety of home-grown micro-enterprises.<\/p>  <p>  While progress has been made in helping to generate new economic opportunities in County Meath, the Government remains determined to achieve more. That is why work is continuing to unlock further the economic potential of County Meath. My Department and its Agencies are pivotal to this. The energy and resources we have invested into regional growth is, as the evidence illustrates, now helping produce results. We will continue to do our utmost to encourage further such job growth across all parts of Ireland in the time ahead.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030700038#WRB00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Job Creation Data","counter":12,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030700038#WRB00800"},{"type":"question","counter":13,"qnumday":14,"qnumall":"[11230\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030700038#WRB00900","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"her views on the regional spread of additional jobs added over the 12 months of 2018.","asker":"1335","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":14,"content":"<p>Since the launch of the Regional Action Plan for Jobs (RAPJ) there has been an increase of 266,900 people in employment across the State since Q1 2015 to Q4 2018, with 166,400 people in the regions outside of Co. Dublin entering employment in that period.<\/p>  <p>  The recently published Q4 2018 CSO Labour Force Survey employment figures are overall very positive. Figures show that employment continues to grow strongly with 50,500 jobs created in the year from Q4 2017 to Q4 2018. This brings total employment to 2,281,300, the highest number at work ever recorded. <\/p>  <p>  During this period, the number of people employed and the unemployment rate decreased in all regions. While the number of people in employment increased in six of the eight regions in the last year, the exceptions to this are the Mid-West and the Border region. <\/p>  <p>  We remain committed to achieving an overall jobs uplift of between 10 and 15 per cent in each region by 2020 and to bring and\/or maintain unemployment levels in each region to within at least one percentage point of the State average.<\/p>  <p>  Unemployment has fallen in every region since the launch of the RAPJ in 2015. Only two regions, the Midlands and South-East are currently outside the unemployment target set for 2020.<\/p>  <p>  Earlier this month I announced very good results from the Local Enterprise Offices around the country.

These stakeholders include: the Local Authorities, the LEOs, the enterprise agencies, the Regional Skills Forum, tourism bodies, private sector &lsquo;enterprise champions&rsquo;, and others.<\/p>  <p>  It is also important to note that as well as meeting the numerical targets, it is also about creating jobs that are of good quality and sustainable over the longer term.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is focused on this agenda at the national level through the Future Jobs Ireland initiative, and we are focused on this agenda through these new Regional Enterprise Plans.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030700038#WRB01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"EU Legislation","counter":15,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030700038#WRB01100"},{"type":"question","counter":16,"qnumday":15,"qnumall":"[9385\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030700038#WRB01200","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if her French or German counterparts have spoken or written to her or officials on her behalf regarding their proposals to reform EU competition law; and if so, her views on their proposals.","asker":"1283","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":17,"content":"<p>A document entitled &ldquo;A French-German manifesto for a European industrial policy fit for the 21st century&rdquo; was launched in Berlin on 19 February 2019 by the Ministers of the Economy of both France and Germany which includes their proposals for reforms of EU competition law.<\/p>  <p>  The document has not, as yet, been officially communicated to me, or to my officials by our French or German counterparts, nor have I nor my officials been approached formally or informally on the matter. <\/p>  <p>  As EU competition law falls within the exclusive competence of the EU Commission under the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, it would be premature to comment on the proposals prior to any formal discussion on the issue by the EU Commission and EU Member States.

I am focused both on sustaining existing employment in the regions whilst also working to significantly grow both job creation and investment in every county of the country. <\/p>  <p>  The recent annual results of the IDA have shown that we are making significant progress in increasing foreign direct investment supported jobs in the regions. In 2018, for example, 56% of all net new jobs created by the Agency were in locations outside Dublin. Similarly, every region in Ireland posted net gains in jobs last year. There are now over 132,000 people employed across 681 firms in IDA client companies outside the capital with 58% of all IDA-supported employment now outside of Dublin. This represents the highest number of people employed in the regions by IDA clients in the Agency&rsquo;s history with 2018 seeing more IDA jobs added in the regions than at any time over the past 17 years. <\/p>  <p>  The IDA is working, on a daily basis, to promote regional cities and towns to potential investors. Since the beginning of IDA Ireland&rsquo;s &lsquo;Winning&rsquo; Strategy in 2015, 407 investments have been secured for the regions and almost 27,000 net jobs have been added on the ground in locations outside Dublin. To put that in context, an average of 102 investments have been won annually for locations beyond Dublin, compared to an annual average of 69 under the previous strategy. This a testament to the focus IDA Ireland has placed on regional investment and the whole of government action to enhance our regional offering.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to emphasise that FDI only forms one part of investment in regional locations. Indigenous enterprise is responsible for a significant portion of employment growth, especially outside Dublin. Companies supported by Enterprise Ireland (EI) created over 9,000 net new jobs last year with every region benefitting from these increases in employment.  There are now over 215,000 people employed in EI-supported companies, with 64% of these jobs located outside of Dublin.<\/p>  <p>  The Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) have also performed well with 3,656 net new jobs created in 2018. This brings the total number of people employed in LEO-supported companies to 36,666, with 83.7% of these jobs located outside Dublin.<\/p>  <p>  I remain optimistic about the job creation potential of Irish companies across the regions. To date, I have launched eight of nine Regional Enterprise Plans that my Department has spearheaded with regional stakeholders.  The final plan for the South East will be launched on 22 March.  These Plans will play an important role in encouraging regional investment and job creation across the regions. <\/p>  <p>  I want to emphasise that creating jobs in the regions will remain a key objective of the IDA, EI, the LEOs and my Department. We are collectively focused on delivering the fairest possible spread of investment across the country. The energy and resources we have invested into regional growth is, as the evidence illustrates, producing results. We will continue to do our utmost to encourage further such job growth across all parts of Ireland in the time ahead.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030700038#WRB02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Job Creation","counter":33,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030700038#WRB02900"},{"type":"question","counter":34,"qnumday":21,"qnumall":"[11150\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030700038#WRB03000","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if she will consider, in conjunction with the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, establishing a task force to tackle unemployment blackspots nationally; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1327","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":35,"content":"<p>I do not have plans at present to establish a task force to tackle unemployment blackspots. We have made extraordinary progress in reducing unemployment in recent years and there are a number of major initiatives currently underway to build on this success. <\/p>  <p>  Employment continues to grow strongly with 49,900 jobs created in 2018, bringing total employment to 2,272,200, an all-time high. There are over 392,900 more people at work since the first Action Plan for Jobs was launched in Q1 2012. This includes a 19.7 per cent increase in employment outside Dublin. The Programme for Government set targets for 200,000 new jobs by 2020, with 135,000 of these outside Dublin. The 200,000 new jobs target was met in Q4 2018, while 133,000 jobs have been created outside Dublin, which equates to 98.5% of the target. <\/p>  <p>  From Q4 2017 to Q4 2018 the unemployment rate decreased in all eight regions with, for example, the rate in the Mid-West region decreasing from 6.1% to 5.6%. This has declined from a high of 16.7% in Q3, 2012.  In the Mid-West region, employment has grown from 189,000 at the start of 2012 to 211,000 at the end of 2018.<\/p>  <p>  In April 2018, I asked all the Regional Action Plan for Jobs Implementation Committees to start a process to refresh and refocus all Regional Plans to ensure their relevance and impact out to 2020, so that they continue to deliver jobs in every region. The outcome of this refresh process is nine new Regional Enterprise Plans to 2020, with eight Plans launched to date.  Shaped from the &lsquo;bottom-up&rsquo; by regional stakeholders, and overseen by my Department, the new Regional Enterprise Plans complement national level policies and programmes emanating from the &lsquo;top-down&rsquo; and, there is strong alignment with Ireland&rsquo;s national enterprise policy, Enterprise 2025 Renewed and the forthcoming Future Jobs Ireland initiative.  Regional stakeholders include the Local Authorities, the LEOs, the enterprise agencies, the Regional Skills Forum, tourism bodies, private sector &lsquo;enterprise champions&rsquo;, and others.<\/p>  <p>  For example, the Strategic Objectives and actions in the Mid-West Plan are set out alongside the Enterprise Agencies&rsquo; (Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland) and the Local Enterprise Offices core activities in Co. Limerick and the wider region. In this way the new Plans add value and support the work of the agencies on the ground in the Mid-West, through a collaborative approach.  Initiatives to be pursued under this Plan's objectives of particular significance for Limerick include the development of an Autonomous Mobility Testbed; the positioning of Limerick\/Mid-West as a national centre for advanced manufacturing; and the development of a Sports Tech cluster - building on the initial study by Limerick City and Co. Council. <\/p>  <p>  Guided by this new Regional Enterprise Plan, the Mid-West Region and Co. Limerick in particular are well positioned to build on this success and to continue to see the benefits and results of collaborative and innovative initiatives that can make a significant impact on enterprise development and unemployment in the region. <\/p>  <p>  More broadly, I will shortly publish Future Jobs Ireland, a new whole of government, multi-annual framework designed with the aim of integrating innovation and resilience into our economy. It will ensure our enterprises and workers are well positioned to adapt to the technological and other transformational changes our economy and society will face in the years ahead. Future Jobs Ireland proposes a paradigm shift if we are to sustain and increase labour market participation by easing barriers to entry into the workforce including investment in Early Learning and Care, providing tailored activation and training supports and generating attractive employment opportunities.

The recent performance of IDA Ireland, the State Agency tasked with promoting inward investment into Ireland, demonstrates the progress we are making in this context. By the end of last year, total employment in the IDA&rsquo;s client companies stood at 229,057, the highest on record. Every region in Ireland has seen foreign direct investment (FDI) employment gains and there are now over 132,000 people employed across 681 firms in IDA client companies located outside of Dublin. I am determined, together with the IDA, to see this trend continue and we will be doing everything possible in 2019 to encourage more firms to invest further in the regions. <\/p>  <p>  Donegal has benefitted from this strong regional focus. The County has experienced a 60% increase in FDI-driven employment since 2012, with job numbers in IDA client firms there increasing from 2,223 in 2012 to 3,564 at the end of last year. In 2018 alone, the total of IDA supported jobs in Donegal increased by 5%, with the County now home to 12 IDA companies including SITA, Optibelt and Pramerica. <\/p>  <p>  As regards new-name investors, there was one new name investment in 2009 in Donegal representing 2.5% of the national total in that year.

The small differences arise mainly from the unit of measurement used for comparison purposes. <\/p>  <p>  Unlike the OECD, who only published headline figures for the total economy, the CSO also provided the Irish Times with initial estimates of labour productivity for the Domestic Sector showing that output per hour worked in 2017 was $54.20 (&euro;47.80), which is significantly lower than OECD headline figure of $99.50 (&euro;87).

County Meath has reported a twofold increase in site visits with six visits in 2018. County Cavan hosted two site visits, whilst there were three site visits to County Monaghan, compared to one visit in 2017. <\/p>  <p>  While more work remains to be done, the Border region has benefitted from the IDA's regional focus. The area experienced a 3% growth in employment by overseas companies in 2018 and we are already working hard to increase this figure in 2019. As part of that work, the IDA are directly investing in a building programme to help ensure property solutions are in place for overseas companies considering investing or expanding outside our major cities. <\/p>  <p>  As part of Budget 2019, I allocated an additional &euro;10m for the next phase of the IDA Regional Property Programme (RPP). The RPP includes plans for an Advanced Technology Unit (ATU) at Knockaconny, County Monaghan. As the Deputy will be aware, earlier this week, I announced  the appointment of a design and delivery team for this Unit.  The wider Border region will also benefit from the RPP, with new buildings planned for Dundalk and Sligo, which I am confident will help generate new opportunities for the wider area. <\/p>  <p>  The IDA has a dedicated regional manager for the North East\/North West Region and an office in the Cavan Innovation and Technology Centre. As part of its strategy to promote the area, it is focusing on sectors including agrifood, manufacturing, tourism and internationally traded services. The Agency's staff regularly engage with key stakeholders on the ground in Cavan and Monaghan, including with local authorities, public bodies, the education sector and companies from both its own client base but also from the indigenous sector. County Meath, meanwhile, is being actively marketed by the IDA as a location for second sites for multinationals in the Dublin region, with a focus on building clusters in existing sectors like high-value manufacturing and international services.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to emphasise that FDI, of course, only forms one part of investment in regional locations. Indigenous enterprise is responsible for a significant portion of employment growth, especially outside Dublin. Both Monaghan and Cavan have seen promising growth in the numbers employed in Enterprise Ireland-backed firms, with increases of 5% and 6% respectively. County Meath has seen a 4% increase in EI-backed businesses.

It will also increase the ability of Enterprise Ireland (EI) to support greater R&amp;D activity in its client companies in several critical sectors in order that Irish firms can be as competitive as possible on EU and world markets.  <\/p>  <p>  In terms of State aid, in November 2017 a Technical Working Group on State Aid, comprising representatives from DG Competition, the Department of Business, Enterprise &amp;amp; Innovation, Enterprise Ireland and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, was established.  The objective of the Group is to scope and design schemes to support enterprises impacted by Brexit in line with State Aid rules.  The most recent meeting of the Group was in Brussels at the end of February this year. <\/p>  <p>  Much has been achieved by this Working Group.  It has examined and explored a range of opportunities within State Aid rules including the development of the Future Growth Loan Scheme under GBER rules,  and the expansion of Ireland&rsquo;s Rescue and Restructuring Scheme to include Temporary liquidity aid, and to increase the budget for the Rescue &amp;amp; Restructuring Scheme to &euro;200 million.

These measures aim to assist businesses in identifying key risk areas and the practical preparatory actions to be taken over the coming weeks.<\/p>  <p>  Brexit was one of my top priorities in the allocation of funding for my Department in Budget 2019, and I have allocated further funding to Brexit-related support from the agencies and offices of my Department.  An additional &euro;5 million capital funding has been allocated to the Local Enterprise Offices, which represents an increase of 22%, and a further &euro;1 million allocated to InterTrade Ireland to help SMEs prepare for the particular North-South challenges associated with Brexit. I have allocated an additional &euro;3m to Enterprise Ireland and &euro;2m to IDA Ireland to expand their global footprints and drive the diversification of trade and investment.  Additional resources have also been distributed across Science Foundation Ireland and the Health and Safety Authority and the NSAI for 2019 to support enterprises adjust to the new relationships with the UK and pursue new opportunities.<\/p>  <p>  Informed by detailed research, my Department has put in place a package of measures in response to the needs of businesses affected by Brexit-related uncertainty. <\/p>  <p>  I allocated an additional &euro;1million to InterTradeIreland (ITI) as part of Budget 2019.  ITI works with SMEs on an all-island basis and is particularly well-placed, given its remit to develop cross-border trade, to help SMEs prepare for the particular North-South challenges associated with Brexit. <\/p>  <p>  The ITI Brexit Advisory Service provides a focal point for SMEs working to navigate any changes in cross-border trading relationships arising as a result of Brexit.  As part of this service, ITI has organised a series of awareness events focused on improving knowledge of customs processes and procedures and identifying actions that can be taken in areas such as logistics and supply chain management.  To date, more than 4,000 SMEs have directly engaged with the Brexit Advisory Service. <\/p>  <p>  ITI also offers a Brexit Start to Plan voucher scheme, which enables businesses to get professional advice on how best to plan and prepare for the UK's withdrawal from the European Union.  This support helps businesses obtain advice on specific areas such as tariffs, currency management, regulatory and customs issues and movement of labour, goods and services.  ITI vouchers are worth up to &euro;2,250 (inclusive of VAT) each.  Companies are finding the vouchers very useful and there has been strong demand which can be attributed to the media campaign conducted by ITI across a range of platforms.  As of its most recent report and the end of November 2018, 811 businesses have applied for a Brexit Start to Plan voucher, of which 657 have been approved. In addition, on Monday this week, I launched for ITI a further financial support - &pound;5,000 in matched funding which will support companies in implementing a change identified in their Brexit action plan.<\/p>  <p>  The Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) are the first-stop-shop for anyone seeking guidance and support on starting or growing their business.  The LEOs have organised various events to enable companies to learn about the potential impacts and opportunities of Brexit. In addition, 471 LEO clients have received one-to-one mentoring solely focused on Brexit.  As of February 2019, the LEOs are also offering customs training workshops to support in businesses trading with third countries in advance of the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the EU.<\/p>  <p>  The LEOs engage in a number of other schemes to help companies prepare for Brexit.  Technical Assistance Grants for Micro Export are offered as an incentive for LEO clients to explore and develop new market opportunities, as of February 2018, 419 LEO clients were approved assistance under the grant. Also, additional capital funding of &euro;5 million was announced in Budget 2019 for local enterprise development.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the six LEOs in the Border region are working together with their Northern Ireland counterparts under the EU Co-Innovate Programme.  The aim of Co-Innovate is to give SMEs from the manufacturing and tradable services sectors in the eligible regions the tools and tailored support to help them to innovate, differentiate and compete successfully. <\/p>  <p>  In December 2018, I announced a further &euro;30 million in funding for successful projects under Call 2 of the competitive Regional Enterprise Development Fund (REDF). <\/p>  <p>  In April 2017, I asked all the Regional Action Plan for Jobs Implementation Committees to start a process to refresh and refocus all Regional Plans to ensure their relevance and impact out to 2020. This will ensure that the Plans remain effective and that they continue to deliver jobs across the country, in all regions, and can be robust in addressing the challenges we face, including Brexit.  As a result, both the North-West and the North-East will both have their own plans in the new iteration and Brexit will be an ongoing priority area for both Committees.  These plans are being finalised and will be published in February. <\/p>  <p>  The &euro;300 million Brexit Loan Scheme provides relatively short term working capital, 1-3 years, to eligible businesses with up to 499 employees to help them innovate, change or adapt to mitigate their Brexit challenges.  The scheme is open to eligible businesses from all regions of the country, including those in the Border counties.  Businesses can confirm their eligibility with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) and if deemed eligible, can apply to one of the participating finance providers for a loan under the scheme.<\/p>  <p>  The scheme was launched in March 2018 and, as at close of business on 1st March, there have been 479 eligibility applications received of which 430 have been approved and 82 loans progressed to sanction at bank level to a value of &euro;17.35m. <\/p>  <p>  The Future Growth Loan Scheme was announced in Budget 2019.  The scheme will provide a longer-term facility, 8 to 10 years, of up to &euro;300m to support strategic capital investment for a post-Brexit environment by business at competitive rates.  This is jointly funded by the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  Loans of &euro;50,000 to &euro;3m will be available, with loans of under &euro;500,000 being provided on an unsecured basis.  The scheme will be available to eligible Irish businesses, including those in the primary agriculture and seafood sectors, to support strategic, long-term investment in a post-Brexit environment.  The SBCI has completed the open call process for this scheme, and it is expected that this Scheme will be operational in early 2019.<\/p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland has established a Prepare for Brexit online portal and communications campaign, as well as an online &ldquo;Brexit SME Scorecard&rdquo; to help Irish businesses self-assess their exposure to Brexit and a &ldquo;Be Prepared Grant&rdquo; to support SME clients in planning to mitigate risks arising from Brexit.  It has also launched a new Eurozone Strategy to help SMEs broaden their export footprint beyond the UK.<\/p>  <p>  Over 4,400 businesses have used Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s Brexit Scorecard to date and 85% of EI client firms are now taking actions, while 168 applications for the Be Prepared grant have been approved.  190 EI clients have received funding under its &ldquo;Act On&rdquo; programme, which supports the engagement of a consultant to help clients identify weaknesses and improve resilience.  EI has also hosted 13 Brexit Advisory Clinics.<\/p>  <p>  EI also recently launched a new Customs Insights Online course which is a new online training support to help all businesses understand how customs work including the documentation and process required to operate and succeed post Brexit.  The Customs Insights course explains in clear and simple terms the main customs rules and included the key actions companies can take to prepare for customs after Brexit and the options from Revenue that are available to make the customs process more efficient.  This will be available for any company to use whether they are importers or exporters and also whether they are agency clients or not. <\/p>  <p>  In order to help build the enterprise capability, under the Regional Enterprise Development Fund (REDF) EI invested in seven successful projects in the Border region with a total funding allocation of more than &euro;10.6 million.  This funding will drive enterprise development and job creation in the Border Region.<\/p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland will continue to engage with its clients to ensure they have the supports required to prepare for any kind of Brexit. <\/p>  <p>  My Department and I have been very active in the 'Getting Ireland Brexit Ready' public information campaign.  This campaign includes workshop events throughout the country aimed primarily at business and people most impacted by Brexit.  A &lsquo;Getting Ireland Brexit Ready&rsquo; event was recently held in Monaghan in October and I was delighted to welcome many businesses from the Border Region. Officials from my Department and agencies also participated in the Getting Ireland Brexit Ready event in Letterkenny in Donegal on 30 November 2018, which included Enterprise Ireland, IDA, the LEOs, NSAI and the HSA. <\/p>  <p>  While I have seen a very positive uptake of the supports available, not everyone is engaging.  With Brexit around the corner, I want businesses, particularly those around the Border counties to know my Department and agencies are here to help.  My Department and its agencies are providing extensive supports, schemes and advice to ensure that businesses are prepared for any Brexit scenario.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030700039#WRC00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Regional Enterprise Development Fund","counter":68,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030700039#WRC00900"},{"type":"question","counter":69,"qnumday":32,"qnumall":"[11161\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030700039#WRC01000","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"when the next round of the regional enterprise development fund will open for applications; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1343","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":70,"content":"<p>The Government has made a significant commitment under Project Ireland 2040 to target &euro;4 billion to support the key priorities of rural renewal, urban regeneration, the achievement of climate action objectives, and the development of new technologies.

These programmes are focused on different elements which aim at maximising outputs from investment in online trading such as: <\/p>  <p>  - Marketing, focused mainly on development of an online\/mobile marketing strategy<\/p>  <p>  - Social Media, with the majority of programmes focused on educating the client base on how to use the different social media platforms to support their business<\/p>  <p>  - eCommerce Sales Strategy, including how to convert website visits into sales<\/p>  <p>  - Search Engine Optimisation, including web analytics and video optimisation for web.<\/p>  <p>   As Chair of the Retail Consultation Forum, I have prioritised supporting the retail sector to develop their online capability in order for them to expand their market reach nationally and internationally and enhance their competitiveness. In 2017, data from the CSO showed that 66% of Irish enterprises in the Wholesale and Retail Sector reported having a website or homepage, with only 28% able to facilitate online ordering. <\/p>  <p> In support of this, I introduced a new pilot Online Retail Scheme administered by Enterprise Ireland, the first call of which opened on 24th October 2018 and closed on 5th   December 2018. I announced the eleven successful applicants on 1st March 2019 in Skibbereen, Co. Cork. A second call will issue later this year.<\/p>  <p>  The Online Retail Scheme will support retail businesses of 20 employees or more who are ready to strategically grow their online capability. Eligible expenditure under the Scheme includes activities such as research, strategy development, implementation and training. The Scheme launched with a fund of up to &euro;625,000, which was later doubled to &euro;1.25m as part of the Department&rsquo;s 2019 Budget. <\/p>  <p>  In recognition of the strong role the retail sector plays in supporting regional development and vibrant communities, at least 50% of the total number of grants awarded under the Scheme will be prioritised for retail SMEs with their headquarters outside of county Dublin, subject to applications meeting the minimum standards required.<\/p>  <p>   As we move towards 2020 Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s focus is to assist client companies build on the strength of their 2018 performance by supporting them to start, innovate, be competitive and to diversify their global footprint. The ability to conduct businesses trade online is vital for business and provides one of the most cost-effective ways to develop an export market. Enterprise Ireland is focused on helping export focused clients across all sectors to exploit the Internet as a route to market and to assist them in developing a strategy that will shape how they do business online. <\/p>  <p>  To support this, Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s Internet Marketing Unit provides grant support and non-financial support such as guidance, workshops and seminars to companies.  In addition, under Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s Business Process Improvement Grant, client companies can apply for grant support to undertake an e-Marketing Improvement Assignment. This support is designed to assist senior managers in client companies to maximise the opportunities presented by the Internet as a business development channel. Using one-to-one training and action-based learning, consultants\/ trainers work with clients to plan and implement an eMarketing strategy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030700039#WRC02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Regional Aid","counter":80,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030700039#WRC02100"},{"type":"question","counter":81,"qnumday":36,"qnumall":"[11269\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030700039#WRC02200","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the beneficiaries of the EU regional aid status of Kells and north County Meath granted in 2014; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1225","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":82,"content":"<p>Regional development - whether in north Meath or further afield - remains an absolute priority of mine.

The IDA is focused, as am I, on increasing that percentage further in 2019. <\/p>  <p>  With regard to IDA activity in Meath in particular, the Agency regularly engages with key stakeholders on the ground in the county, including with local authorities, public bodies, the education sector and companies from both its own client base but also from the indigenous sector. The Agency also owns sites in Meath that are actively marketed to its clients through its network of offices in Ireland and overseas. I am confident that the ongoing work by the IDA in the county will lead to more investment and job creation for the wider area in due course.  <\/p>  <p>  In terms of recent performance, Meath has seen a 4% increase in foreign direct investment (FDI) employment in the last year. There are now 19 IDA-supported client companies in the County employing over 1,600 people. Meath continues to maintain a strong contingent of overseas firms in the financial services, manufacturing and biotechnology sectors with key clients such as ArcRoyal, International Fund Services and Alltech performing well in the County.  The client base there shows that the area remains an attractive destination for FDI and overseas firms. <\/p>  <p>  While progress has been made in helping to generate new economic opportunities in Meath, the Government remains determined to achieve more. That is why work is continuing to unlock further the economic potential in the county. The IDA remains pivotal to this and the Agency is engaging with its clients and with other enterprise agencies to create jobs and source new investment there.<\/p>  <p>  As regards beneficiaries of grant support in County Meath, Enterprise Ireland has supported a number of projects there under the relevant state aid guidelines.

There are a number of cross-departmental efforts which will assist in the development of eHubs, including the Regional Enterprise Development Fund (REDF), the Urban Regeneration and Development Fund and the Rural Regeneration and Development Fund. <\/p>  <p>  I recently announced allocations under the second call of the REDF administered by Enterprise Ireland.

These stakeholders include: the Local Authorities, the LEOs, the enterprise agencies, the Regional Skills Forum, tourism bodies, private sector &lsquo;enterprise champions&rsquo;, and others.<\/p><p>I launched the new Regional Enterprise Plan for the North-West region, which covers Donegal, Leitrim and Sligo, on the 25th February in Drumshanbo. <\/p><p>The Regional Enterprise Plan for the North-West is focused around six &lsquo;Strategic Objectives&rsquo; and each of the six Objectives involves a focus on Co. Sligo as part of the North-West region; as follows:<\/p><p>1.Identify and enhance the visibility of skills available to employers and potential investors in the North-West;<\/p><p>2.Achieve a step-change in the level of entrepreneurship in the North-West;<\/p><p>3.Harness the potential of the blue economy and the North-West coastline as a source of new employment generation;<\/p><p>4.Maximise the potential of the Wild Atlantic Way and tourism for the North-West; <\/p><p>5.Develop a regional network of landing spaces to support co-working; and<\/p><p>6.Support the digitalisation of SMEs in the North-West.<\/p><p>The Strategic Objectives and actions in the North-West Plan are set out alongside the Enterprise Agencies&rsquo; (Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland) and the LEOs&rsquo; core activities in Co. Sligo and the wider region. In this way the new Plans add value and support the work of the Agencies on the ground in the North-West, through a collaborative approach. <\/p><p>It is encouraging that the unemployment rate in the Border region, which includes Co. Sligo (along with Donegal, Leitrim, Cavan, and Monaghan) has reduced from 8.5 percent in Q1 2015 to 3.8 percent in Q4 2018, currently the lowest unemployment rate in the country.<\/p><p>The focus for Co. Sligo and the North-West over the period to 2020 under the new Regional Enterprise Plan will be to maintain an emphasis on employment growth, aiming to outperform the rate of growth achieved since 2015 to date and to ensure that sustainable, quality jobs are created and maintained in the region. The collaborative strategic objectives and actions in this Plan, along with the core activities of the various Agencies and Bodies involved in supporting enterprise development over the coming two-year period will support this. <\/p><p>Finally, it is important to note that the Government has put several funding streams in place to support regional development, and the North-West has seen many successes through these ongoing initiatives. They include my Department&rsquo;s Regional Enterprise Development Fund; the Rural and Urban Regeneration and Development Funds under Project Ireland 2040; and the Town and Village Renewal Scheme. <\/p><p>Under the &euro;60 million competitive Regional Enterprise Development Fund (REDF), the North-West region has secured total funding of over &euro;5.2 million to date under the two completed Calls - one of these projects, the development of a new enterprise centre at Strandhill involves an investment of just over &euro;1.9 million.<\/p><p>Guided by this new Regional Enterprise Plan, the region and Co.

To date, these clinics have been held in Letterkenny, Tralee, Portlaoise, Claremorris, Cootehill, Charleville, Dublin, Galway, Dundalk, Waterford and Limerick. Further events are planned in Galway, Cork, Letterkenny and Dublin ahead of the withdrawal date. <\/p>  <p>  EI has also been running a PrepareforBrexit communications campaign, featuring the Brexit SME Scorecard and the PrepareforBrexit.ie website, which offers information on the likely impacts of Brexit on Irish businesses and how these impacts might be mitigated.

In this regard the Deputy will be aware of the commitment under the Programme for Partnership Government to create 200,000 new jobs by 2020, 135,000 of which are to be located outside of Dublin and the roles identified for EI and IDA in the Programme to achieve this commitment. <\/p>  <p>   In addition to the aforementioned evaluations and Programme for Partnership Government commitments, the Deputy will also appreciate that budgetary discussions in the course of the estimates process are clearly informed by a variety of other factors not least, the position of the public finances, the economic cycle and emerging challenges, the most recent of which clearly is Brexit.<\/p>  <p>   The Deputy will appreciate, therefore, that the allocations to my Department&rsquo;s Enterprise Agencies, which have been significantly increased in recent years, have been informed by the evidence of the aforementioned evaluations of the value of EI\/IDA supports in promoting enterprise and employment, the employment and regional development commitments under the Programme for a Partnership Government and the need to prepare enterprises for emerging challenges such as Brexit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030700039#WRC04200","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Regional Enterprise Development Fund","counter":102,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030700039#WRC04300"},{"type":"question","counter":103,"qnumday":43,"qnumall":"[11177\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030700039#WRC04400","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the status of the regional enterprise plans; her views on the way in which this will benefit County Louth and the north-east; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1329","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":104,"content":"<p>In April 2018, I asked all the Regional Action Plan for Jobs Implementation Committees to start a process to refresh and refocus all Regional Plans to ensure their relevance and impact out to 2020, so that they continue to deliver jobs across the country, in every region, and can be robust to address the challenges we face, including Brexit.<\/p><p>The outcome of this refresh process is nine new Regional Enterprise Plans to 2020, which build on the very strong progress made on employment creation under the Regional Action Plan for Jobs 2015-2017. I am currently in the process of launching the new Plans, with eight Plans launched to date. <\/p><p>Shaped from the &lsquo;bottom-up&rsquo; by regional stakeholders, and overseen by my Department, the new Regional Enterprise Plans to 2020 complement national level policies and programmes emanating from the &lsquo;top-down&rsquo; and, there is strong alignment with Ireland&rsquo;s national enterprise policy, Enterprise 2025 Renewed and the forthcoming Future Jobs Ireland initiative. <\/p><p>They are two-year, focused Plans, which are also &lsquo;live&rsquo; documents, so new initiatives can be adopted during their operation by the regional stakeholders working together.<\/p><p>The principle behind the Regional Enterprise Plans is collaboration between regional stakeholders on initiatives that can help to realise the region&rsquo;s enterprise development potential. These stakeholders include: the Local Authorities, the LEOs, the enterprise agencies, the Regional Skills Forum, tourism bodies, private sector &lsquo;enterprise champions&rsquo;, and others.<\/p><p>I launched the new Regional Enterprise Plan for the North-East region, which covers counties Cavan, Monaghan and Louth, on the 25th February in Cootehill. <\/p><p>The Regional Enterprise Plan for the North-East is focused around five &lsquo;Strategic Objectives&rsquo; and each of the five Objectives involves a focus on Co. Louth as part of the North-East region; as follows:<\/p><p>1.Leverage the full extent of talent residing in the North-East to drive new enterprise investment and growth;<\/p><p>2.Implement a holistic approach to workforce development in the North-East, matching workers&rsquo; skills to needs in the region&rsquo;s enterprises and further developing the knowledge, skills and competencies of those currently in the workplace;<\/p><p>3.Strengthen SME resilience in the North-East to achieve development and growth in the face of external challenges;<\/p><p>4.Drive a higher level of economic success in the North-East by building on niche strengths and fostering clustering amongst enterprises;<\/p><p>5.Strengthen the attractiveness of the North-East as a destination to visit.  <\/p><p>Initiatives in the new Plan that are of particular significance to Co. Louth include the focus on business clustering in sectors such as financial services, payments and precision engineering; and more intensive engagement between DKIT and the Regional Skills Forum on meeting emerging sector specific skill set needs regionally.<\/p><p>The Strategic Objectives and actions in the North-East Plan are set out alongside the Enterprise Agencies&rsquo; (Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland) and the LEOs&rsquo; core activities in Co. Louth and the wider region. In this way the new Plans add value and support the work of the Agencies on the ground in the North-East, through a collaborative approach. <\/p><p>It is encouraging that the unemployment rate in the Border region, which includes Co. Louth (along with Donegal, Leitrim, Cavan, Monaghan and Sligo) has reduced from 8.5 percent in Q1 2015 to 3.8 percent in Q4 2018, currently the lowest unemployment rate in the country.<\/p><p>The focus for Co. Louth and the North-East over the period to 2020 under the new Regional Enterprise Plan will be to maintain an emphasis on employment growth, aiming to outperform the rate of growth achieved since 2015 to date and to ensure that sustainable, quality jobs are created and maintained the region. The collaborative strategic objectives and actions in this Plan, along with the core activities of the various Agencies and Bodies involved in supporting enterprise development over the coming two-year period will support this. <\/p><p>Finally, it is important to note that the Government has put several funding streams in place to support regional development, and the North-East has seen many successes through these ongoing initiatives. They include my Department&rsquo;s Regional Enterprise Development Fund; the Rural and Urban Regeneration and Development Funds under Project Ireland 2040; and the Town and Village Renewal Scheme. <\/p><p>Under the &euro;60 million competitive Regional Enterprise Development Fund (REDF), the North-East region has secured total funding of over &euro;5.4 million to date under the two completed Calls.<\/p><p>Guided by this new Regional Enterprise Plan, the region and Co. Louth is well positioned to build on this success and to continue to see the benefits and results of collaborative and innovative initiatives that can make a significant impact on enterprise development in the region.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030700039#WRC04500","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement","counter":105,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030700039#WRC04600"},{"type":"question","counter":106,"qnumday":44,"qnumall":"[11149\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030700039#WRC04700","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the new powers proposed for the corporate enforcement authority; if she is satisfied the new agency will have strong enough powers to robustly tackle white collar crime; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1327","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":107,"content":"<p>One of the actions in the Government's package of Measures to Enhance Ireland&rsquo;s Corporate, Economic and Regulatory Framework, published in November 2017, is the establishment of the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement (ODCE) as a stand-alone agency. <\/p>  <p>  The General Scheme of the Companies (Corporate Enforcement Authority) Bill 2018 to establish the ODCE as a stand-alone agency was published on 4 December 2018.

We understand the importance of achieving the best possible spread of employment and investment across the country and my Department and its Agencies have been working hard towards that goal. Significant progress has already been made, with 58% of all IDA client-supported employment now located outside of Dublin. This figure represents the highest such figure in the history of the Agency. Our aim is to increase this percentage further in 2019.<\/p><p>The availability of marketable serviced land and buildings in advance of demand is a key element in the IDA's ability to compete for mobile foreign direct investment (FDI). Not only does such a supply of properties help the Agency to secure high quality jobs but it also allows projects to begin at an earlier date by diminishing difficulties associated with land acquisition, planning and construction. It therefore remains an important means by which the IDA can encourage and attract new investors to Ireland. The IDA currently owns 29 properties across Ireland. Of these, 14 are occupied by IDA clients with the remainder available for prospective or existing investors. The table below sets out the location of these various properties. <\/p><p>Site visits help the IDA showcase regional locations to prospective investors. The Agency hosted 607 site visits in 2018, with over 55% of these visits taking place in regional locations.<\/p><p>I want to emphasise that the IDA does its utmost to encourage its clients to locate or expand in regional Ireland. This is just as much a priority for the Agency as it is for my Department and the Government. Indeed, the IDA is continuing to target an increase of investment of 30% to 40% in every region by the end of its current strategy in 2019. At the same time, we must recognise that the final decision as to where to invest always rests with the firm concerned. It is also the case, no matter what efforts we make to underline the undoubted benefits of regional locations, that certain overseas companies will only consider investing in large urban areas for various commercial or operational reasons. <\/p><p>We are though achieving real results in deepening the spread of regional FDI. The IDA&rsquo;s 2018 results bear out that assessment. Last year the Agency delivered 113 regional investments with 56% of net new jobs created outside Dublin. Moreover, the last four years have seen over 44,000 new FDI-driven jobs created outside the capital.

The integrated nature of the trading relationship that runs north and south of this island and the strong economic links are very clear to all.<\/p>  <p>  As the deputy will be aware, negotiations on both the EU-UK Withdrawal Agreement and political declaration on the framework for the EU-UK future relationship, were conducted on behalf of the EU27 by the EU's Chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, and the Commission's Article 50 Taskforce. <\/p>  <p>  Since taking up office as Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation I have met with various UK Ministers, particularly Ministers at the Department of International Trade, the Department responsible for developing the UK&rsquo;s post-Brexit trade and investment relationship with the EU, to discuss issues including Ireland-UK trade and the impact of Brexit on this relationship.<\/p>  <p>  - In January 2018 I met with Hilary Benn MP and a group of UK Parliamentarians to discuss issues around the UK exiting the EU. <\/p>  <p>- In February 2018 I met with Minister of State at the Department for International Trade, Mr Greg Hands MP.<\/p>  <p>  - In April 2018 during an EI trade mission to Manchester I met with the Mayor of Greater Manchester, Mr Andy Burnham at which Brexit, among other issues, was discussed.<\/p>  <p>  - In June 2018, on a visit to London I met with the Secretary of State for International Trade, Mr Liam Fox MP and with the Minister of State in the Department for International Trade, Mr Greg Hands MP. This meeting agenda focused on Ireland-UK trade, EU trade policy and global trade challenges. <\/p>  <p>  - During my visit to London in June 2018 I also met with the Minister of State at the Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, Ms Claire Perry MP to discuss industrial strategy and innovation. <\/p>  <p>  - In September 2018 in the course of a trade mission to Scotland, I met with the Scottish Minister for Trade, Investment and Innovation, Mr Ivan McKee.<\/p>  <p>  - At various EU Council meetings this year I have met with various EU counterparts, including UK colleagues, both formally and informally. This included meetings with the UK Minister of State for Trade and Investment, Mr Greg Hands MP and, on two occasions with the U.K. Minister of State for Trade Policy, Mr George Hollingbery MP. Maintaining the strength of the Irish-UK trading relationship was a key focus of these discussions. <\/p>  <p>  My Ministerial colleagues, Ministers Pat Breen and John Halligan have also, at various times, met with their UK counterparts.<\/p>  <p>   Minister Breen met with the following UK counterparts:<\/p>  <p>  - Parliamentary Under Secretary of State at the Department of Business, Energy &amp;amp; Industrial Strategy, Lord Henley in March 2018 and in May 2018; <\/p>  <p>  - Scottish Cabinet Secretary for the Economy, Jobs and Fair Work, Keith Brown MSP in March 2018; <\/p>  <p>  - Minister for State for Culture, Communications and Creative Industries, Margot James in April 2018; <\/p>  <p>  - Scottish Minister for Trade, Investment and Innovation, Ivan McKee in August 2018;<\/p>  <p>  - Minister of State for Trade Policy, Mr George Hollingbery in November 2018.<\/p>  <p>  Minister Halligan met in February 2018, May 2018, and February 2019 with the UK Minister for Higher Education and for Universities, Science, Research and Innovation, Sam Gyimah. Minister Halligan also met Minister Joseph Johnson, then Minister of State for Universities, Science, Research and Innovation in Tallinn, Estonia on 24th July 2017 on the margins of the Informal meeting of Research Ministers. The purpose of the meeting was to enhance the existing bilateral research and innovation cooperation and identify new areas of opportunity for UK and Irish researchers and innovators to collaborate further.<\/p>  <p>  I can further assure the deputy that my Department and its agencies are providing extensive supports, loan schemes and advice to assist businesses to prepare for Brexit. I am particularly committed to ensuring that Enterprise Ireland, the Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) and InterTrade Ireland (ITI) continue to work with companies in the Border region to drive innovation, competitiveness, internationalisation and Brexit preparedness.<\/p>  <p>  As part of Budget 2019, I allocated an additional &euro;1million to InterTradeIreland (ITI). The ITI Brexit Advisory Service provides a focal point for SMEs working to navigate any changes in cross-border trading post-Brexit. ITI also offers a Brexit Start to Plan voucher scheme, worth up to &euro;2,250, for professional advice on preparing for Brexit and I am pleased with the very positive take-up to date of the ITI voucher scheme. <\/p>  <p>  I also allocated additional capital funding of &euro;5 million in Budget 2019 to the LEOs to step-up their Brexit preparedness work. Some 402 LEO clients have benefitted from one-to-one Brexit mentoring. In addition, the six LEOs in the Border region are working together with their Northern Ireland counterparts under the EU Co-Innovate Programme, to help firms to innovate, differentiate and compete. Recently I launched the LEO customs training programme aimed at familiarising companies with customs procedures.<\/p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland has a wide range of supports available and are actively engaged with companies in helping them to prepare. Enterprise Ireland Annual Results for 2018 showed that every region in Ireland recorded increases in employment, including a 9% increase in the North West and a 3% increase in the North East.

It has examined and explored a range of opportunities within State Aid rules including the development of the Future Growth Loan Scheme under GBER rules,  and the expansion of Ireland&rsquo;s Rescue and Restructuring Scheme to include Temporary liquidity aid, and to increase the budget for the Rescue &amp;amp; Restructuring Scheme to &euro;200 million. Through the mechanism of the Technical Working Group Ireland has fully utilised the provisions of the State aid framework to enable the investment by Enterprise Ireland of &euro;74 million in Brexit impacted businesses in 2018.<\/p>  <p>  The Group is currently working closely with DG Agriculture to explore the range of opportunities under the Agriculture and Forestry State aid guidelines, and as part of this  State Aid approval was received in February for capital investment by Enterprise Ireland in an Irish cheese producing company, Carbery Food Ingredients Ltd, to help the company towards financing a diversification project to mitigate the impacts of Brexit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030700040#WRD02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement","counter":144,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030700040#WRD02600"},{"type":"question","counter":145,"qnumday":58,"qnumall":"[11044\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030700040#WRD02700","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the progress in strengthening the powers and effectiveness of the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1325","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":146,"content":"<p>Organisational reforms in the ODCE were commenced in 2012 to enhance the capability of the Office to investigate complex breaches of company law and to ensure a more efficient and effective use of its resources.

The General Scheme is currently subject to pre-legislative scrutiny by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Business, Enterprise and Innovation.<\/p><p>Changing the structure of the ODCE from an office to a statutory agency will provide greater autonomy to the agency in relation to staffing resources and ensure it is better equipped to investigate increasingly complex breaches of company law.

I am focused both on sustaining existing employment in the regions whilst also working to significantly grow both job creation and investment in every county of the country. <\/p>  <p>  The recent annual results of the IDA have shown that we are making significant progress in increasing foreign direct investment (FD) supported jobs in the regions. In 2018, for example, 56% of all net new jobs created by the Agency were in locations outside Dublin. Similarly, every region in Ireland posted net gains in jobs last year. There are now over 132,000 people employed across 681 firms in IDA client companies outside the capital with 58% of all IDA-supported employment now outside of Dublin. This represents the highest number of people employed in the regions by IDA clients in the Agency&rsquo;s history with 2018 seeing more IDA jobs added in the regions than at any time over the past 17 years. <\/p>  <p>  The IDA is working, on a daily basis, to promote regional cities and towns to potential investors. Since the beginning of IDA Ireland&rsquo;s &lsquo;Winning&rsquo; Strategy in 2015, 407 investments have been secured for the regions and almost 27,000 net jobs have been added on the ground in locations outside Dublin. To put that in context, an average of 102 investments have been won annually for locations beyond Dublin, compared to an annual average of 69 under the previous strategy. This a testament to the focus IDA Ireland has placed on regional investment and the whole of government action to enhance our regional offering.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to emphasise that FDI only forms one part of investment in regional locations. Indigenous enterprise is responsible for a significant portion of employment growth, especially outside Dublin. Companies supported by Enterprise Ireland created over 9,000 net new jobs last year with every region benefitting from these increases in employment.  There are now over 215,000 people employed in EI-supported companies, with 64% of these jobs located outside of Dublin. <\/p>  <p>  I remain optimistic about the job creation potential of Irish companies across the regions. To date, I have launched eight of nine Regional Enterprise Plans that my Department has spearheaded with regional stakeholders.  The final plan for the South East will be launched on 22 March.  These Plans will play an important role in encouraging regional investment and job creation across the regions. <\/p>  <p>  I want to emphasise that creating jobs in the regions will remain a key objective of the IDA, Enterprise Ireland and my Department. We are collectively focused on delivering the fairest possible spread of investment across the country. The energy and resources we have invested into regional growth is, as the evidence illustrates, producing results. We will continue to do our utmost to encourage further such job growth across all parts of Ireland in the time ahead.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030700040#WRD03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Regional Enterprise Development Fund","counter":150,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030700040#WRD03200"},{"type":"question","counter":151,"qnumday":60,"qnumall":"[11247\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030700040#WRD03300","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the status of the regional enterprise plans; her views on the way in which this will impact County Kildare; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":152,"content":"<p>In April 2018, I asked all the Regional Action Plan for Jobs Implementation Committees to start a process to refresh and refocus all Regional Plans to ensure their relevance and impact out to 2020, so that they continue to deliver jobs across the country, in every region, and can be robust to address the challenges we face, including Brexit.<\/p><p>The outcome of this refresh process is nine new Regional Enterprise Plans to 2020, which build on the very strong progress made on employment creation under the Regional Action Plan for Jobs 2015-2017.

Insurance Ireland reported that it has distributed the medical reporting template to its members, who will begin to implement the use of the form within their individual companies.  <\/p>  <p>  - On the second recommendation, PIAB are engaging with Irish College of General Practitioners and the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland to develop a training package for medical professionals who complete personal injury medical reports.<\/p>  <p>  - The third recommendation relates to the Book of Quantum.  This has been superseded by the PIC&rsquo;s Second and Final Report which recommends that a Judicial Council, when established, be requested by the Minister for Justice and Equality to compile judicial guidelines for appropriate general damages for various types of personal injury. <\/p>  <p>  - The fourth recommendation advocates that relevant injury data be collated and published by appropriate bodies.  PIAB published data, on 5 November 2018, in relation to whiplash-related injury compensation awards resulting from road traffic accidents, in line with this recommendation.<\/p>  <p>  The Second and Final Report made a further 10 recommendations.  While they are not timebound, I would expect that they should be implemented as soon as possible by the relevant bodies.  Following publication of this Report, I wrote to relevant Government colleagues and other organisations including the Garda Commissioner, Insurance Ireland, The Law Society, The Council of the Bar of Ireland and the Law Reform Commission seeking co-operation in advancing the implementation of the recommendations relevant to them.  <\/p>  <p>  Progress on implementing the recommendations will be reported on through the Cost of Insurance Working Group Progress Reports.  <\/p>  <p>  Four of these recommendations relate directly to recommendations in the two Cost of Insurance Working Group Reports.  The updates below provide detail on the implementation of the remaining six as at the end of 2018.<\/p>  <p>  - Recommendations one and two provide that the Judicial Council when established, be requested to compile guidelines for appropriate general damages award levels for various types of personal injury. Due to the time required to enact and operationalise the Judicial Council Bill, the Department of Justice and Equality is working with PIAB on a process whereby an interim guideline relating to the priority soft-tissue\/whiplash area would be delivered. Options to achieve this will shortly be proposed for discussion with the judiciary and the Courts Service as appropriate.<\/p>  <p>  - Recommendation four provides for the development and roll-out in all relevant locations of &lsquo;Best Practice&rsquo; standard treatment plans for soft tissue injuries.  The HSE&rsquo;s Emergency Medicine Programme (EMP) has advised that the model outlined in the PIC&rsquo;s case study, whereby patients are referred early to a physiotherapist when treating soft tissue injuries, such as whiplash, is both recommended and common practice in Emergency Departments.  It strongly endorses the implementation of this approach and has agreed to survey the availability of these resources nationally.<\/p>  <p>  - Recommendation five provides that in cases where an insurer deals directly with a claimant, no offer of settlement or payment of a personal injury claim can be made unless and until a detailed medical report has been obtained.  Insurance Ireland has advised that it is standard practice for insurers to base personal injury claims settlements on medical reports.<\/p>  <p>  - Recommendation nine encourages insurers and other relevant parties to adopt the same internationally recognised injury coding system (the World Health Organisation&rsquo;s ICD-10 system).  Insurance Ireland has advised that this will be considered by insurers on an individual basis.<\/p>  <p>  - Recommendation ten relates to the establishment of a National Medical Research Study on the Prevention and Management of Soft Tissue (&lsquo;Whiplash&rsquo;) Injuries.

This included defining procedures, identifying the requirements and needs of the organisation and agreeing terms and conditions with the individual.\u00a0In order to allow for a transparent scheme to facilitate the re-entry of former Officers of the PDF, a policy framework,\u00a0setting out terms and conditions was necessary. <\/p>  <p>  The terms and conditions for the recommissioning scheme include the\u00a0provision that the re-commissioning of former officers of the PDF, including in the Air Corps,\u00a0shall only be considered in specific circumstances.

Actions to get Ireland Brexit ready have already been taken by the Government, with dedicated measures announced in Budgets 2017, 2018 and 2019. <\/p>  <p>  \u00a0Over the course of the last three budgets I have introduced, through the enterprise agencies, an extensive suite of enterprise supports to assist firms to meet the challenges presented by Brexit. They range from liquidity support through short-term and longer-term loans, to restructuring aid for businesses in severe operating difficulties. The majority of enterprise supports are open to all companies, including SMEs and not just those that are clients of the enterprise agencies. <\/p>  <p>  \u00a0Specifically, these supports include:<\/p>  <p>  - The &euro;300 million Brexit Loan Scheme launched in March 2018 providing loans of up to 3 years to businesses impacted by Brexit. As of this month, 350 firms have been approved under this Scheme by the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) in the agrifood, retail and distribution, manufacturing, hospitality and transport sectors, and &euro;15.73 million in loans to 63 businesses has been sanctioned at bank level; <\/p>  <p>  - A &euro;300 Longer Term Loan Scheme was approved in Budget 2019. Legislation was passed in December 2018 to provide for loans of 8 to 10 years for investments in fixed assets. This Scheme will be launched shortly and I would like to encourage businesses to start preparing their plans to avail of this facility;<\/p>  <p>  - Enterprise Ireland is working closely with regionally important larger companies in exposed sectors such as food to support strategic investments to build resilience &ndash; EI invested &euro;74 million in these businesses in 2018; <\/p>  <p>  - An expanded network of overseas offices and in-market supports to help firms diversify markets and to consolidate market share in the UK where appropriate.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, a strong focus is now being placed on upskilling and familiarisation around customs:<\/p>  <p>  - As a result of the additional funding provided to the LEOs in 2019, additional support for training in customs procedures is being made available to companies, helping them navigate the post-Brexit trading environment, and supporting market diversification. I was pleased to launch the first of these Customs Training Workshops, along with the Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform, in Cavan on 25 February last.<\/p>  <p>  - An online Enterprise Ireland &lsquo;Customs Insight Course&rsquo; also helps businesses looking at customs for the first time to understand key concepts, documentation and processes. It advises on the key actions companies can take to prepare for Brexit and highlights the various supports available.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, an EU State aid approved Rescue and Restructure Scheme is in place to deal with events such as sudden shocks. A recent announcement of an increase in sanction from &euro;20 million to &euro;200 million is most welcome and is a demonstration of the commitment of support from the EU Commission.\u00a0 This increased budget allows the Irish State to put in place a fund, should it be required, to offer both rescue aid and temporary restructuring aid to SMEs in financial difficulty or experiencing acute liquidity needs. The scheme will be activated if and when it is needed.<\/p>  <p>  A further important aspect of supporting businesses in the face of a hard Brexit relates to a range of regulatory functions undertaken by regulatory agencies within my Department and additional funding was made available in the context of Budget 2019. \u00a0The agencies involved are the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, the Health and Safety Authority, the National Standards Authority of Ireland, the Irish National Accreditation Board and the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority. These agencies play a vital role in supporting businesses to operate effectively, especially in the area of certification and standardisation. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, over the course of the last 18 months, officials from my Department have been in regular dialogue with the European Commission about the scope of additional enterprise support measures that we may require in a hard Brexit.<\/p>  <p>  In January I met with Commission Vestager to outline the consequences of any disorderly exit on the Irish economy and the Commissioner acknowledged that Ireland is more exposed than any other EU member State to the impacts of Brexit.<\/p>  <p>  The Commissioner committed to providing the highest level of cooperation with Ireland including a dedicated team to deal with Irish cases in an expedited way and intensified engagement between my Department and DG Competition continues.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of a legislative response to Brexit, my Department is sponsoring Part 3 of the Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union (Consequential Provisions) Bill 2019. This part increases the ability of Enterprise Ireland to provide a competitive and flexible offering to its client companies in terms of R&amp;D grants and will allow Enterprise Ireland to provide low interest debt instruments. <\/p>  <p>  In summary, I am satisfied that my Department, its offices and agencies, are preparing to the greatest extent possible for Brexit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030700043#WRG01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Job Creation","counter":320,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030700043#WRG01600"},{"type":"question","counter":321,"qnumday":118,"qnumall":"[11504\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030700043#WRG01700","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if she remains satisfied regarding the availability of power communications technology to facilitate job creation throughout the regions; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":322,"content":"<p>The feasibility of power communications technologies as a means of providing quality broadband infrastructure in the regions is a matter for my colleague the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment but clearly, reliable high-speed broadband is essential to increase the attractiveness of regional areas for investment. <\/p>  <p>  Delivering improved connectivity can enhance the growth prospects of small and micro businesses and create opportunities arising on a regional basis, such as, remote working, cloud computing and business efficiencies, all of which serve to diversify the rural economy.<\/p>  <p>  High quality telecommunication infrastructure is fundamental to capturing new opportunities for entrepreneurship and improving regional and sectorial economic growth. Access to high speed broadband is crucial for the growth of small and micro businesses, as it facilitates digitalisation, improves their online visibility and expands their export base, as highlighted by ESRI research last year. According to this research, the online presence was vital in the facilitation of export participation by Irish services firms with many selling products online.<\/p>  <p>  Enhancing Ireland&rsquo;s international and national connectivity with adequate and competitively priced broadband service is also critically important to attract and sustain the current and future investments in ICT, digital media and other data intensive sectors. While the Irish economy is one of the fastest growing in the world, some regions in Ireland suffer from a lack of adequate critical infrastructure. In order to unlock the potential of regional locations, the Government, through the implementation of the National Planning Framework and the full roll out of the National Broadband Plan, is committed to providing adequate infrastructure which will increase the regional attractiveness as a location for inward investment.<\/p>  <p>  Substantial investment has been made by the private and public sector to date which has significantly improved broadband offering in recent years, especially in urban centres. Since the publication of the National Broadband Plan in 2012, the commercial telecommunications sector has invested over &euro;2.75 billion on upgrading and modernising networks which support the provision of high speed broadband and mobile telecommunications services.<\/p>  <p>  Access to connectivity continues to improve.

With this in mind, I am committed to publishing the National Clean Air Strategy this year, which will provide the policy framework necessary to identify and promote integrated measures across Government that are required to reduce air pollution and promote cleaner air, while delivering on wider national objectives. <\/p>  <p>  Given the wide range of pollutant sources, it is important that action is coordinated across various sectors. There are a number of plans under development, including the National Air Pollution Control Programme, and the National Energy and Climate Plan, which are relevant to the clean air agenda. I am keen to ensure that synergies are maximised between these plans and the National Clean Air Strategy, with a view to achieving lasting reductions in the health and environmental impacts of air pollution. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to the number of deaths the Deputy quotes, I note that this figure is the global figure for early mortalities attributable to air pollution in Ireland. While domestic solid fuel burning is the primary source of particulate matter, it is not the only source, and a ban on smoky coal is not the only policy option available to reduce the amount of solid fuel burned for domestic heating within the State. For example, my Department is funding, a range of schemes, operated through the SEAI, to support households in retrofitting their homes to make them more energy efficient and reduce the use of fossil fuels in domestic heating. In addition, the National Development Plan includes a range of projects in the transport sector, which is also a source of particulate matter pollution, including: massively increasing the numbers of electric vehicles on the road by 2030 with additional charging infrastructure to cater for planned growth; transitioning to a low emission urban public bus fleet with no diesel-only buses purchased from 1 July 2019; and investing in sustainable travel measures, including improved cycling and walking networks for metropolitan areas. <\/p>  <p>  My Department is also funding the Environmental Protection Agency&rsquo;s roll-out of the Ambient Air Quality Monitoring Programme (AAMP), which will greatly improve the data available on air pollution in Ireland, facilitating the design and targeting of policy measures to tackle it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030700046#WRK01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Broadband Service Provision","counter":527,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030700046#WRK01600"},{"type":"question","counter":528,"qnumday":195,"qnumall":"[11393\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030700046#WRK01700","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"his plans to improve broadband telecommunications in an area (details supplied) in view of the concerns of householders and local business regarding the poor quality of broadband to date; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1270","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":529,"content":"<p>In April 2017 my Department published an updated version of the National Broadband Plan (NBP) High Speed Broadband Map.

These Broadband Officers are acting as single points of contact in local authorities for their communities. The appointment of these officers is already reaping rewards in terms of ensuring a much greater degree of consistency in engagements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030700046#WRK01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Litter Pollution Fines","counter":530,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030700046#WRK01900"},{"type":"question","counter":531,"qnumday":196,"qnumall":"[11422\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030700046#WRK02000","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"if he will provide the updated data for 2017 and 2018 regarding a table (details supplied).","asker":"1222","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":532,"content":"<p>The data requested by the Deputy for 2017 is now available on my Department's website at <i>www.dccae.gov.ie<\/i>.

I have been clear that the level of State subsidy for the National Broadband Plan State intervention would be determined through the NBP procurement process. <\/p>  <p>  Prior to the launch of the procurement process for the National Broadband Plan State intervention my Department undertook a public consultation on the NBP State Intervention Strategy. A preliminary cost benefit analysis (CBA) was also completed prior to the launch of the procurement, in line with the Public Spending Code. This CBA has been updated at key points during procurement. <\/p>  <p>  I am regularly briefed by my officials on the NBP. I understand that the cost of the solution proposed by the bidder is significantly higher than that anticipated prior to the extensive engagement with bidders that has occurred in developing the necessary solution. The NBP procurement process has determined what the cost of delivering high speed broadband to every premises in the Intervention Area would be. This will in form the recommendation to the government before it makes a decision to appoint a preferred bidder. <\/p>  <p>  There has been ongoing engagement with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in relation to the final bid.

This excludes any provision for immediate ex-gratia lump sum payment of pension as sought, which could entail a further Exchequer cost of up to &euro;318 million.<\/p>  <p>  CE supervisors may qualify for the State Pension (Contributory) if they have accrued sufficient PRSI contributions.
