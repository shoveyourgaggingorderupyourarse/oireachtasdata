The focus of the scheme was those former PDF personnel with particular skillsets identified as required by the Chief of Staff. <\/p>  <p>  The scheme allows for initial re-enlistment for a minimum of six months and up to 3 years and the duration of the re-enlistment offered depends on the vacancies that exist. The re-enlistment of former personnel with the relevant skills and experience is one of the many actions being pursued to address skills shortages in the PDF. It was a medium to long term initiative which pre-dated the COVID-19 crisis but was accelerated to assist both in the PDF response to the crisis and beyond. <\/p>  <p>  There has been a positive response to the scheme, with over 670 applications received. I am informed by the military authorities that a large number of those applicants, some 384, did not ultimately meet the criteria for re-enlistment, with many exceeding the maximum age limit for service in the Permanent Defence Force at their rank.  <\/p>  <p>  I understand that there are currently approximately 143 eligible applicants who are at various stages in the assessment process.  The process includes file assessment and interview in addition to medical and security clearance phases. As the Deputy will appreciate, there is a requirement to ensure that any personnel re-enlisted are capable of meeting the requirements of the jobs for which they are sought.<\/p>  <p>  Following recommendations by the Chief of Staff, sixteen personnel have been inducted to date with a further four scheduled to be inducted on 9th October 2020. I understand that further recommendations by the Chief of Staff of personnel to be re-enlisted under the scheme are imminent.<\/p>  <p>  Separately, a scheme which provides for the re-commissioning of former Officers of the Permanent Defence Force is also in place. To date, five Flying Officers have been re-commissioned, with further re-commissioning of Officers likely.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the re-enlistment and re-commissioning of these personnel and wish them well in their renewed careers in the Defence Forces.

The Board indicated that the issues raised had received due consideration and that they were not prepared to alter their findings.  <\/p>  <p>  A review was conducted in 2004 by military officers for the purpose of a broader examination of the Jadotville case. This Board recommended that the events of Jadotville and the contribution of the 35th Battalion be given recognition.

On the occasion of the 55th anniversary of the Siege of Jadotville, a Unit Citation to honour the collective actions and bravery of the men of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company was issued.

This will ensure that implementation of the recommendations will comply with the provisions of the FEMPI Acts and will not compromise the stability of the Public Service Stability Agreement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100800066#WRB02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Defence Forces Review","counter":35,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100800066#WRB02600"},{"type":"question","counter":36,"qnumday":20,"qnumall":"[29139\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100800066#WRB02700","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"when the commission on Defence will be established.","asker":"1591","askee":"1457"},{"type":"question","counter":37,"qnumday":23,"qnumall":"[29106\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100800066#WRB02800","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"his plans for the commission for the future of the Defence Forces; the person who will be on the board; if representatives of the Defence Forces personnel such as an organisation (details supplied) will be on the commission; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1486","askee":"1457"},{"type":"question","counter":38,"qnumday":24,"qnumall":"[22242\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100800066#WRB02900","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"if the commission on the future of the Defence Forces has been constituted; the way in which he plans to address pay deficiencies in the Permanent Defence Force; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1519","askee":"1457"},{"type":"question","counter":39,"qnumday":37,"qnumall":"[28529\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100800066#WRB03000","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"the progress made regarding the establishment of a commission on the future of the Defence Forces; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1521","askee":"1457"},{"type":"question","counter":40,"qnumday":53,"qnumall":"[29110\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100800066#WRB03100","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"his plans for the commission for the future of the Defence Forces; if representatives of an organisation (details supplied) will be on the commission; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1478","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":41,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 20, 23, 24, 37 and 53 together.<\/p><p>Establishment of a Commission on the Defence Forces is an important commitment made in the recently agreed Programme for Government.

One of the key areas identified for urgent action was the development of a manpower policy with an emphasis on lowering the age profile of PDF personnel. <\/p>  <p>  As a result, new terms and conditions were introduced for personnel enlisting after 1 January 1994 and new contracts for enlisted personnel were for a period of five years&rsquo; service. Since that time, the maximum period of service has been extended out to twenty-one years for line Privates and Corporals. <\/p>  <p>  In 2015, following an adjudication in the Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme for PDF members, Privates and Corporals in receipt of Tech Pay Group 3 or higher may be extended to age 50 subject to meeting certain criteria for continuance in service. A review of contracts of service for Line Corporals and Privates and Corporals in receipt of Technical Pay 1 and 2 was recommended. <\/p>  <p>  An agreement was subsequently reached with PDFORRA in 2019 that all Privates and Corporals recruited post 1994, be allowed to continue in service to 31 December 2022 (or until they reach the age of 50), provided these personnel met certain criteria during the interim period, including medical grades and fitness tests. This agreement was subsequently extended to include post 1994 Sergeants, who also could continue in service to the same date, subject to their meeting agreed criteria in the interim period. <\/p>  <p>  There is  currently therefore,  a moratorium on mandatory discharging of Privates and Corporals who have reached 21 years service and this moratorium also extends to  post 1994 Sergeants, subject in all cases to their meeting certain criteria. <\/p>  <p>  A review of service limits for enlisted personnel is currently being progressed in the context of a broader review provided for in the High Level Implementation Plan - \"Strengthening Our Defence Forces\". As this review which will encompass upper age limits for Privates, Corporals and Sergeants as well as senior NCOs is currently underway, it would be inappropriate to pre-empt any recommendations that may arise.  <\/p>  <p>  Turning to the pensions aspect, in the public service generally the payment of retirement benefits is deferred &ndash; or preserved &ndash; to a future date for any scheme member who leaves the scheme before a certain age.  This is known as preservation of benefits and the concept is a long established feature of public service pensions. <\/p>  <p>  The specific occupational pension scheme terms of members of the PDF &ndash; which depend on factors such as the date a person first joins the public service &ndash; fall into the following three distinct fast accrual categories: <\/p>  <p>  - Those who joined the PDF before April 2004;<\/p>  <p>- Those who joined on or after 1st April 2004 and before 1st   January 2013; and<\/p>  <p>- Those who join on or after 1st   January 2013 as members of the Single Public Service Pension Scheme.<\/p>  <p>The pension scheme terms for personnel who joined the PDF before April 2004 provide for the payment of pension and gratuity immediately on retirement after relatively short periods of service, and regardless of age.  The minimum qualifying period for immediate payment of pension and gratuity on retirement is 21 years&rsquo; service for enlisted ranks.  Therefore, a Private or NCO who enlisted between 1st January 1994 and 31st   March 2004 qualifies for immediate payment of retirement benefits after 21 years&rsquo; service.  There is no minimum pension age or provision for deferred benefits.<\/p>  <p>  However, all personnel joining the PDF since April 2004 have a minimum pension age of 50, with pension and gratuity payable immediately on retirement at that age.  If leaving before age 50, payment of retirement benefits is deferred until age 60 under the &lsquo;post-April 2004&rsquo; schemes, and until the Contributory State Pension age of 66\/68 under the Single Pension Scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100800066#WRB04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":51,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 23 and 24 answered with Question No. 20.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Defence Forces Reserve","counter":52,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100800066#WRB04400"},{"type":"question","counter":53,"qnumday":25,"qnumall":"[29127\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100800066#WRB04500","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"the enrolment in the Reserve Defence Force; the proposals for recruitment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1556","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":54,"content":"<p>The Government recognises the important role that the Reserve Defence Force (RDF) plays in contributing to Ireland's defence capability. <\/p>  <p>  The White Paper on Defence sets out a blueprint for the development of the RDF and that their primary role is to support the Permanent Defence Force in crisis situations. <\/p>  <p>  The RDF is comprised of the Army Reserve (AR), the Naval Service Reserve (NSR) and the First Line Reserve (FLR).

The Defence Forces continue to carry out the roles assigned by Government, including security operations, critical supports to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and ATCA supports to other Government Departments and Agencies. In particular, the Defence Force are playing an active and important role in the Covid 19 response, providing a broad range of supports to the HSE.  <\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the above, the Government has acknowledged the recruitment and retention issues in the Defence Forces that are resulting in operational challenges primarily across the Naval Service and Air Corps. <\/p>  <p>  A range of actions have been taken to date to address the recruitment and retention issues, and further actions are currently under consideration.  <\/p>  <p>  Civil and Military management are actively engaged in measures to address the recruitment and retention challenges in the Naval Service. It is clear that the situation the Naval Service is facing remains challenging, in particular there are a number of pinch points with particular specialists in terms of recruitment and retention. The Department and the Defence Forces are assessing a range of options to manage the current challenges in the short, medium and longer term. Both myself and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform have received separate briefings from the Naval Service on the current challenges. The Department has engaged in discussions with DPER on this matter and these discussions are ongoing. <\/p>  <p>  The Air Corps has also experienced challenges. In this context the Emergency Aeromedical Service (EAS) and the GASU (Garda Air Support) have been prioritised.  A Service Commitment Scheme for pilots was sanctioned by DPER and implemented in the third quarter of 2019. This has had a stabilising effect. Other measures such as a recommissioning scheme for former Air Corps pilots has also boosted pilot numbers and a range of initiatives which will see accelerated training through outsourcing, are restoring capacity to the Air Corps as quickly as possible. <\/p>  <p>  The Defence Forces continue to contribute fully to overseas peace support operations. There has been an added complication arising from Covid 19 with members of the Defence Forces deploying on overseas missions now required to quarantine for 14 days before deploying overseas and to self-isolate on return. The question of appropriate allowances for this additional requirement has been agreed with DPER. <\/p>  <p>  In summary, a range of HR initiatives are being progressed  which are aimed at enhancing the capabilities of the Defence Forces.. These include changes to recruitment practices and implementation of the findings of the Public Service Pay Commission (PSPC) Report on recruitment and retention issues in the Defence Forces.

On the 9th September, a large force of Katangese Gendarmerie surrounded them and early on the morning of the 13th September \"A\" Company came under attack. From the 13th to the 17th September they endured almost continuous attack. They were taken into captivity on the 17th September and remained in captivity until finally released on the 25th October 1961.<\/p>  <p>  The issue of the award of medals to the men of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company, 35th Infantry Battalion was addressed in 1962 and 1965. A properly constituted Medals Board considered the various cases presented. The board did not award any medals whose citations mention Jadotville. The Chief of Staff of the day considered the decision of the Board and was satisfied with the findings. Subsequently at that time, the question was raised again in a letter to a newly appointed Chief of Staff. He forwarded the letter to the original Medals Board and asked that they reconvene and review their decision. The Board indicated that the issues raised had received due consideration and that they were not prepared to alter their findings.  <\/p>  <p>  A review was conducted in 2004 by military officers for the purpose of a broader examination of the Jadotville case. This Board recommended that the events of Jadotville and the contribution of the 35th Battalion be given recognition. In this context, a number of measures have taken place to honour and to commemorate the events at Jadotville and the very significant contribution of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company and of the 35th Battalion, as a whole, to the UN Peace Support Mission in the Congo.<\/p>  <p>  Recognition of their contribution over the years include: <\/p>  <p>  A. A presentation of scrolls to \"A\" Company in 2006. <\/p>  <p>  B. Portraits of Lt Col McNamee (35th Battalion Commander) and Comdt Quinlan (Company Commander &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company) were commissioned in 2006. <\/p>  <p>  C. In July of 2010 the 50th anniversary of the first deployment to the Congo was commemorated in a highly publicised and well attended event in Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnel. <\/p>  <p>  D. A nominal roll of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company, printed in copper, was affixed to the monument in Custume Barracks and was unveiled as part of the 50th Anniversary of the Jadotville affair in September 2011. <\/p>  <p>  E. On the occasion of the 55th anniversary of the Siege of Jadotville, a Unit Citation to honour the collective actions and bravery of the men of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company was issued. This was the first time a Unit Citation was awarded within the Defence Forces.  <\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, on 13th June 2017, the Government decided, as an exceptional step, to award a medal known as &ldquo;An Bonn Jadotville&rdquo; or &ldquo;The Jadotville Medal&rdquo; to each member of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company, 35th Infantry Battalion and to the family representatives of deceased members to give full and due recognition in honour of their courageous actions at the Siege of Jadotville.  This medal presentation ceremony took place on 2nd December 2017 in Custume Barracks, Athlone.  This location is considered the spiritual home of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company and it is from here that &ldquo;A&rdquo; company assembled in advance of their fateful deployment to the Congo.   <\/p>  <p>  Over the past number of years various representations have been received in my Department outlining the courage and bravery of \"A\" Company.

My primary concern, as always in these situations, is for the workers and families who have been impacted by this decision. Many of these workers have been with the company for many years. The Government will make every State support available to those affected in order to help them transition and find new employment opportunities.<\/p>  <p>  The IDA have worked hard to sustain and support the firm&rsquo;s presence here and have had close and regular contact with management, both at a local and corporate level. The IDA also provided support to employee representatives as they put together a plan for efficiency savings that could be made at the Ballinasloe plant.<\/p>  <p>  Now that the decision has been taken to close the facility, the IDA is working closely with the company to market the plant to potential investors. The IDA has introduced a number of companies who are interested in the Ballinasloe facility to Aptar management team and has also arranged visits to the site. <\/p>  <p>  Both the IDA and Enterprise Ireland will use the employee skills audit that has been carried out in their efforts to attract new investment to Ballinasloe. The IDA Regional team has also connected employees of Aptar with the local Intreo office as well as the Education and Training Board, Local Enterprise Office, Regional Skills Forum West and Galway Mervue Roscommon Training Centre.<\/p>  <p>  My Department and its Agencies have been working hard, over a sustained period, to support job creation in the regions. This has included setting ambitious targets to ensure that employment and investment are distributed as evenly as possible across the country. Last year, there were over 21,000 people employed in IDA-supported firms in Galway. This is almost double the number employed in 2010 (11,235). While the period ahead may prove more challenging, securing new foreign direct investment for our regions will be a key priority.<\/p>  <p>  Wider enterprise efforts are also underway to generate new growth in Galway and the surrounding area. For example, regional stakeholders &ndash; including Enterprise Ireland, the LEOs and the Higher and Further Education Institutes &ndash; are working together on implementation of the Regional Enterprise Plan for the West. This is aimed at strengthening the environment for job creation in the region and Ballinasloe will also benefit from this.<\/p>  <p>  Another important initiative in this context is the Regional Enterprise Development Fund, through which over &euro;16.7m in funding for the West &ndash; over three competitive calls &ndash; has been approved for collaborative regional enterprise projects. The region has had particular recent success, with five Galway-based projects being awarded a total of &euro;9.6m. These projects are currently being developed and their completion will enhance the attractiveness of the area for further investment and job creation.<\/p>  <p>   While the announcement of job losses at Aptar is very disappointing, I want to assure you that the Government and its agencies are working to create employment opportunities in the West and across all of our regions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100800068#WRD00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1474"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental

Deputy that the Government has committed to ensuring that local development plans are developed to stimulate economic activity for those areas that were expecting economic development arising from new fossil-fuel infrastructure. As part of this, the Government will consider the potential of the Shannon Estuary in terms of regional economic development across transport and logistics, manufacturing, renewable energy and tourism, and develop a strategy to achieve this potential, with support from the Exchequer.  <\/p>  <p>  I can however assure the Deputy that jobs and enterprise in the regions is a priority of Government and I want to have a situation where all regions are enabled to realise their potential as contributors to economic growth. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Programme for Government provides that as Ireland moves towards carbon neutrality it does not make sense to develop LNG gas import terminals importing fracked gas.   <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that my Department&rsquo;s nine Regional Enterprise Plans to 2020 were launched by my Department in early 2019 with the South-West Regional Enterprise Plan which covers counties Kerry and Cork being launched in February of that year.  These Plans play a central role in supporting the delivery of balanced regional enterprise development and in ensuring that employment growth is spread across all regions. The Plans are also maintained as &lsquo;live&rsquo; agendas which aim to be agile and responsive to both new opportunities and new challenges, for example: Brexit, Climate Action, Digital Economy, and most recently, the COVID-19 pandemic economic impacts.<\/p>  <p>  At the end of June this year my predecessor as Minister, Heather Humphreys TD met with the Chairpersons of the nine Regional Enterprise Plan Committees including the Chair of the South-West Committee on a conference call and invited them to work with their Committees to identify proposals that would help to address economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic in their region. These groups are meeting in virtual format over the coming weeks to focus on this and will report back to my Department, with a view to contributing to the development of the National Recovery Plan in due course. <\/p>  <p>I can advise the Deputy that the South West Regional Steering Committee met on 28th   July last and considered the range of COVID-19 and wider economic challenges for the South West region and indeed issues arising in relation to vulnerable jobs and sectors.

For example, earlier this year, my Department facilitated &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta client companies to access an initial &euro;5m available from the Sustaining Enterprise Fund.

Undoubtedly, Udar&aacute;s together with Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland have key roles to play in promoting job creation throughout the country and particularly so in the Gaeltacht areas. The Government for its part is determined to ensure that all three Agencies receive the necessary resources to enable them to do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100800068#WRD02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1474"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Trade Agreements","counter":159,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100800068#WRD02900"},{"type":"question","counter":160,"qnumday":67,"qnumall":"[24048\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100800068#WRD03000","dept":"Department of Trade, Enterprise and Employment","minister":"Minister for Trade, Enterprise and Employment","question":"his views on a recent report from a university (details supplied) with regard to the Mercosur deal and the way in which it contradicts the EU Green Deal; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1478","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":161,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, negotiations for an EU-Mercosur Agreement were concluded in June 2019, marking the EU&rsquo;s largest trade deal to date. The Agreement includes a Trade and Sustainable Development (TSD) chapter, which the European Commission has highlighted builds on the highest standards found in other modern Agreements &ndash; such as those with Mexico or Japan. <\/p>  <p>  The TSD chapter promotes sustainable development as part of the trade relationship between the EU and Mercosur through commitments on environmental protection, climate change and labour rights. The basis of the TSD chapter is the premise that increased trade should not come at the expense of the environment or labour conditions.<\/p>  <p>  Critically, the TSD chapter of the EU-Mercosur Agreement is subject to a specific dispute settlement procedure. Therefore, should the EU or Mercosur consider that the other party is not abiding by the rules, or honouring their commitments, formal government-level consultations can be requested. If the situation is not resolved, an independent panel of experts can be asked to examine the matter and prepare a report with recommendations. This report, including the recommendations, would be made public so that stakeholders and the relevant institutions on both sides can follow up on the relevant issues.<\/p>  <p>  I should also point put that the EU Green Deal makes clear that trade policy can serve &ldquo;as a platform to engage with trading partners on climate and environmental action&rdquo;. In this regard, the EU-Mercosur Agreement includes a specific article on climate change, in which the EU and Mercosur agreed to strong language committing both parties to fully implement the provisions of the Paris Climate Agreement. The EU-Mercosur Agreement also includes commitments on fighting deforestation and the sustainable management of forests, as well as on responsible business conduct.  It is, therefore, welcome that both the EU and Mercosur agree that strong environmental standards are vital to the success of the Agreement. <\/p>  <p>  The EU Green Deal also underlines the Commission&rsquo;s efforts to step up their implementation and enforcement of sustainability commitments in trade agreements and, as I have previously stated, enforceable guarantees, which strengthen environmental protections, particularly with regard to the Amazon rainforest and climate action, are a priority for me and this Government in terms of our assessment of the benefits from the Agreement.

and if the information on which the definition is based will be provided.","asker":"1525","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":196,"content":"<p>The 2019 Climate Action Plan defines just transition as the need to plan appropriately to ensure that areas most affected by Ireland&rsquo;s transition to a low-carbon, climate-resilient society are supported and equipped to contribute to this transition, while ensuring a strong economy and the availability of suitable enterprise and employment opportunities.    The Programme for Government notes that the transition to a low-carbon future will unleash huge changes in society that, while presenting significant challenges, will also bring a range of opportunities, the impacts of which will be unevenly spread and will manifest themselves in different ways. The Programme for Government, therefore, affirms the necessity for a just transition pathway to be found, which delivers alternative job opportunities to sectors and regions most affected, and ensures that vulnerable groups are helped, as transformative policies are implemented. This will require the anticipation of challenges and planning for responses to them.<\/p>  <p>  At EU level, the European Commission Communication on a European Green Deal, published in December 2019, identifies the role of just transition in supporting the low carbon transition in a fair and inclusive way, and sets out the objective of managing the transition to address future significant structural changes in business models, skills requirements and relative prices, taking account of how citizens, depending on their social and geographic circumstances, will be affected in different ways.<\/p>  <p>  The Government recognises that the transition out of peat in the Midlands is the first test of a just transition for Ireland. \u00a0The first progress report of the Just Transition Commissioner, Mr Kieran Mulvey,\u00a0 published\u00a0on\u00a022 May, reflects a comprehensive engagement with relevant stakeholders in the Midlands, setting out the analysis of the challenges facing the region, and for Bord na M&oacute;na workers, their families and communities, arising from an accelerated exit from peat harvesting. The report contains important recommendations. The Government is already acting on a number of these and is committed to preparing an implementation plan to address the remainder, which I intend to publish in the coming weeks. The\u00a0recommendations and associated actions will support\u00a0job creation efforts and create new opportunities for Bord na M&oacute;na workers in the Midlands.<\/p>  <p>  A number of actions are already underway which will\u00a0support\u00a0job creation. This includes &euro;20 million for a new energy efficiency retrofitting scheme in the Midlands, and &euro;5 million for peatland rehabilitation outside of the Bord na M&oacute;na estate. A dedicated Just Transition Fund\u00a0is making available\u00a0up to &euro;11 million in 2020 to fund innovative projects that contribute to the economic, social and environmental sustainability of the Wider Midlands region, and which have employment and enterprise potential. On foot of its recent call for proposals under this Fund, my Department published an initial list of\u00a0sixteen successful projects on 9 September and additional projects will be approved\u00a0in the coming weeks. <\/p>  <p>  The Government has also committed &euro;15 million, as part of the July Stimulus Plan, in order to commence a multi-year programme to rehabilitate 33,000 hectares of Bord na M&oacute;na peatlands. This additional funding will support a just transition by maintaining jobs in the Midlands, as well as laying the foundation for more substantial and sustainable job creation into the future. The enhanced rehabilitation scheme will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by significantly increasing the area of wetland habitats in post-production peatlands. Further additional benefits include increasing biodiversity, improving water quality and supporting bog eco-system services.<\/p>  <p>  The development and implementation of policy on just transition will also be informed by relevant research, including the March 2020 National Economic and Social Council report, &lsquo;Addressing Employment Vulnerability as Part of a Just Transition in Ireland,&rsquo; and the most recent Annual Review of the Climate Change Advisory Council, published last month.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100800069#WRE00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Service Obligation Levy","counter":197,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100800069#WRE00500"},{"type":"question","counter":198,"qnumday":79,"qnumall":"[29510\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100800069#WRE00600","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"his views on ring-fencing a percentage of the public service obligation levy for community-owned renewable energy projects; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1525","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":199,"content":"<p>The PSO levy has been in place since 2001, and is a charge on all electricity customers without exception. It consists of a set of support schemes designed to facilitate national electricity policy objectives for renewables and security of supply. From a policy standpoint, the PSO has been and will continue to be a vital policy support for the development of renewable electricity and to enable Ireland to reach EU renewable energy targets and our own national energy and climate targets. The legal basis for the PSO levy and its method of calculation are set out in regulations made under the Electricity Regulation Act 1999 and the Public Service Obligations Order 2002 (S.I. 217 of 2002) under which the CRU, the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, is assigned responsibility for calculation of the levy each year. The methodology for determining the PSO levy charge is set out in the Public Service Obligations Order 2002 (S.I. 217 of 2002). <\/p><p>The renewable electricity support scheme (RESS) will be funded through the PSO levy on all electricity consumers in the same way as all other renewable schemes. <\/p><p>It is my intention that communities all over the country should be able to generate electricity and reap the benefits in their own localities from the sale of that electricity. In that regard, I aim to ensure the delivery of approximately 100 community electricity generation projects by 2030. The RESS will drive the delivery of this objective. Last month I announced that seven community projects had filled the allocated community capacity in the first commercial auction under the scheme. In future onshore RESS auctions, there will be additional capacity allocated to the community category and I expect that only fully community-owned projects will be eligible.<\/p><p>In order to ensure an adequate pipeline of such projects, an enabling framework of capacity-building supports is being developed by my Department and the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI). It includes information dissemination, trusted intermediary and adviser services, enabling grants, soft development loans and a simplified grid connection process. The SEAI has commenced assessing the next wave of community projects through the sustainable energy community network. The initial call has already identified 20 of the more mature projects for immediate support. A further wave of projects has been identified for later support. A dedicated telephone number and email address: communityress@seai.ie, along with web pages from SEAI can be accessed to facilitate further community engagement.In effect, as the RESS community supports will be funded from the PSO as provided in the State Aid decision on the Scheme,\u00a0a portion of the PSO has already been allocated to community energy projects. It is important to note that successful projects from the first RESS auction are not expected to be energised until at least 2021.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100800069#WRE00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":200,"content":"<p>Question No. 80 answered with Question No. 73.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Electric Vehicles","counter":201,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100800069#WRE00800"},{"type":"question","counter":202,"qnumday":81,"qnumall":"[29517\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100800069#WRE00900","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"his plans for the roll-out of electric charging points in County Mayo (details supplied); the timeline for the roll-out; and if a survey has taken place in County Mayo regarding suitable locations for such charging points.","asker":"1601","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":203,"content":"<p>In line with the Programme for Government and the Climate Action Plan 2019, this Government\u00a0is fully committed to\u00a0supporting\u00a0a\u00a0significant\u00a0expansion and modernisation of the electric vehicle charging network over the coming years.There are currently circa 650 standard public charge points and over 100 fast charge stations (the majority of which are operated by the ESB) in Ireland.

In light of this, I wrote to the Minister for Health to request a temporary cessation of PMC assessments until such times as a revised basis for such assessments is established. The medical officers who are responsible for conducting PMC assessments need to have assurance that the decisions they make are based on clear criteria set out in legislation.

I can give a commitment that I will seek to bring clarity to this situation as soon as possible such that PMC assessments can re-continue based on a firm legal basis. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100800070#WRF03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic Supports","counter":286,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100800070#WRF03600"},{"type":"question","counter":287,"qnumday":111,"qnumall":"[29273\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100800070#WRF03700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will address a matter on the spend and stay scheme (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1487","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":288,"content":"<p>The Stay and Spend scheme provides tax relief by means of a tax credit at the rate of 20% on qualifying expenditure of up to &euro;625 per person, or &euro;1,250 for a jointly assessed couple, in respect of 2020 and 2021.

There are other holiday accommodation providers who are not legally required to register with F&aacute;ilte Ireland but may choose to be voluntarily listed.  The process for registration or listing with F&aacute;ilte Ireland requires the service provider to make a self-declaration that their business complies with all statutory requirements. For those holiday accommodation providers who apply to be listed, the voluntary application process is very simple and quick and only incurs a nominal fee of &euro;1 for both 2020 and 2021. <\/p><p>Guidance can be found on F&aacute;ilte Ireland&rsquo;s website.

The cost of the scheme in 2019, excluding motor tax, was &euro;72m. <\/p>  <p>  The Scheme is open to severely and permanently disabled persons as a driver or as a passenger and also to certain organisations. In order to qualify for relief an organisation must be entered in the register of charitable organisations under Part 3 of the Charities Act 2009, be engaged in the transport of disabled persons and whose purpose is to provide services to persons with disabilities.<\/p>  <p>  In order to qualify for relief the applicant must hold a Primary Medical Certificate (PMC) issued by the relevant Senior Area Medical Officer (SAMO) or a Board Medical Certificate (BMC) issued by the Disabled Driver Medical Board of Appeal. Certain other criteria apply in relation to the vehicle and its use, including that the vehicle must be specially constructed or adapted for use by the applicant.   <\/p>  <p>  The terms of the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994 set out the following medical criteria, and that one or more of these criteria is required to be satisfied in order to obtain a PMC:<\/p>  <p>  - be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs; <\/p>  <p>  - be wholly without the use of one leg and almost wholly without the use of the other leg such that the applicant is severely restricted as to movement of the lower limbs; <\/p>  <p>  - be without both hands or without both arms; <\/p>  <p>  - be without one or both legs; <\/p>  <p>  - be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both hands or arms and wholly or almost wholly without the use of one leg; <\/p>  <p>  - have the medical condition of dwarfism and have serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs.  <\/p>  <p>A Supreme Court decision of 18 June found in favour of two appellants against the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal's refusal to grant them a PMC. The judgement found that the medical criteria set out in the Regulations did not align with the regulation making mandate given in the primary legislation to further define criteria for &lsquo;severely and permanently disabled&rsquo; persons. <\/p>  <p>  In the first instance, I acknowledge that the persons who successfully challenged a decision by the Medical Board of Appeal to refuse them a PMC are, on the basis of that Supreme Court decision, entitled to seek access to the Scheme. The Supreme Court decision raised complex issues, including the manner in which the persons concerned can access the Scheme, given that the Regulation which set out the medical eligibility criteria was not found to be invalid and given that the persons concerned were not assessed for a PMC on the single criterion of being permanently and severely disabled.<\/p>  <p>  However, in the particular circumstances, I consider that both persons merit access to this Scheme and I instructed my officials to liaise with the Medical Board of Appeal to request that Board Medical Certificates are issued to them in light of the Supreme Court decision. In this regard I understand that the Board are amenable to this course of action and that Board Medical Certificates will be issued to the persons concerned shortly.<\/p>  <p>  More generally, the Deputies will appreciate that the complex legal and policy issues raised by the Supreme Court decision will require careful consideration. In parallel to that consideration there is a need to examine how best the Scheme can target resources to those persons who most need them. My officials are currently examining the judgement, in conjunction with the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office, and will bring forward any policy and\/or legislative proposals, as necessary, for my consideration in due course.  <\/p>  <p>  In the interim, on foot of the legal advice received, it became clear that it was appropriate to revisit the six medical criteria set out in Regulation 3 of Statutory Instrument 353 of 1994 for these assessments. In such circumstances, it is not proposed to continue with PMC assessments until a revised basis for such assessments is established. The medical officers who are responsible for conducting PMC assessments need to have assurance that the decisions they make are based on clear criteria set out in legislation. While Regulation 3 of Statutory Instrument No. 353 of 1994 was not deemed to be invalid, nevertheless it was found to be inconsistent with the mandate provided in Section 92 of the Finance Act 1989.<\/p>  <p>  My officials were in contact with the Medical Board of Appeal and with officials in the Department of Health and will continue to liaise with them, as required, going forward. I have also written to the Minister for Health to request that there are no further PMC assessments until a sound legal basis for such assessments is re-established. <\/p>  <p>  While it is regrettable that PMC assessments are currently not taking place and I acknowledge that this will result in a growing waiting list, I anticipate that the work that is currently ongoing in relation to this matter will provide a proper basis for me to make a decision on the best pathway forward and to address the current legal uncertainty surrounding the Scheme. I can give a commitment that I will seek to bring clarity to this situation as soon as possible such that PMC assessments can re-continue based on a firm legal basis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100800070#WRF04500","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Contracts","counter":296,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100800070#WRF04900"},{"type":"question","counter":297,"qnumday":116,"qnumall":"[29352\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100800070#WRF05000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the contracts with public relations agencies and consultants entered into by his Department; and the remit of these contracts including the costs in tabular form.","asker":"1514","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":298,"content":"<p>My department has entered into contracts with public relations agencies and public relations consultants during 2019 and to date in 2020 as outlined in the following table:<\/p><p> <table>    <tr>       <th>Year<\/th>       <th>Description<\/th>       <th>Amount<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2019  <\/td>       <td>Daniel J Edelman Ireland Limited.<br \/><br \/>Provision of specialist advice on the use of social media in an international context for the international launches of the Government of Ireland&rsquo;s Ireland for Finance Strategy.<\/td>       <td>&euro;24,395<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2020 (to date)<\/td>       <td>Daniel J Edelman Ireland Limited.<br \/><br \/>Provision of specialist advice on the use of social media in an international context for the international launches of the Government of Ireland&rsquo;s Ireland for Finance Strategy.<\/td>       <td>&euro;4,879<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2019 <\/td>       <td>Switch Your Bank website hosting 2019 &ndash; Language Communication<\/td>       <td>&euro;2,066.40<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2020 (to date)<\/td>       <td>Switch Your Bank Website hosting 2020 &ndash; Language Communication<\/td>       <td>&euro;2,066.40<\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p><p>*The cost of the Switch your Bank campaign is fully recoupable by AIB and Permanent TSBin the context of their restructuring plans.

In most cases the compliance checks are a relatively straightforward enquiry requiring proof of eligibility for the scheme and evidence that the funds were properly passed on to qualifying employees.

The aim of this guidance is to give smaller companies greater clarity in how they can demonstrate to Revenue that their R&amp;D tax credit claim satisfies the science test. Where a company spends up to &euro;200,000 on activities which Enterprise Ireland or other such bodies have reviewed and confirmed as R&amp;D, then in most cases Revenue will accept that those activities pass the science test.

However, I intend, with my colleague the Minister for Employment Affairs &amp;amp; Social Protection  to consider all the issues involved in relation to this matter and will continue to engage constructively with the relevant stakeholders.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100800071#WRG01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1459"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Coastal Erosion","counter":319,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100800071#WRG01500"},{"type":"question","counter":320,"qnumday":124,"qnumall":"[29381\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100800071#WRG01600","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if recent meetings have taken place with officials from the relevant Departments and stakeholders in respect of the coastal erosion problem at Portrane, County Dublin; if so, the decisions which were taken; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1564","askee":"1459"},{"type":"speech","counter":321,"content":"<p>I am advised, in respect of coastal erosion at the Burrow, Portrane, County Dublin, that Fingal County Council is leading on this issue, as it is a matter for Local Authorities in the first instance to assess and address problems of coastal erosion in their areas.

Last year, a number of changes in respect of section 481 were introduced: in July 2019, the EU Commission gave approval in respect of two aspects of Ireland's tax credit: the extension of the Section 481 credit until 2024 which provides certainty for film production companies on the future availability of the credit, ensuring the continued growth of our film industry; and the introduction of the Regional Film Development Uplift which offers an additional tapered tax credit over a period of 4 years and supports the development of a vibrant creative audio-visual sector across the country. Changes were also made to the section 481 Certification process and since 2019 the film tax credit now operates on a self&ndash;assessment basis. 2019 also saw the introduction of a new category of qualifying production &ldquo;<i>Short film of feature quality&rdquo;. <\/i>The Steering Group will continue to keep section 481 under review over the lifetime of the Audiovisual Action Plan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100800071#WRG04700","answer":true,"speaker":"1471"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Sports Funding","counter":352,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100800071#WRG04800"},{"type":"question","counter":353,"qnumday":135,"qnumall":"[29438\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100800071#WRG04900","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the status of the large scale sport infrastructure fund; if grants approved earlier in 2020 still stand; if the commitment of at least &euro;100 million made as part of Project Ireland 2040 still holds; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1481","askee":"1471"},{"type":"speech","counter":354,"content":"<p>The LSSIF was launched in 2018 to provide Exchequer support for larger sports facility projects including swimming pools with at least &euro;100m being made available over the period to 2027.

Irish Water&rsquo;s primary function is to provide clean safe drinking water to customers and to treat and return wastewater safely to the environment. <\/p>  <p>  It is recognised that our waste water networks require ongoing and sustained investment to bring these up to the required standard of treatment; to deal with population growth; and to adapt to the impacts of climate change. In this regard, significant investment in waste water infrastructure continues and is provided for in the Irish Water Strategic Funding Plan. It is estimated that &euro;1.9bn will be invested in waste water projects between 2019 to 2024. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to Dublin Bay, the EPA has classified the water quality as &lsquo;good&rsquo; under the water framework directive for the period 2013 to 2018, an improvement on the &lsquo;moderate&rsquo; status achieved during the 2007 to 2009 period.<\/p>  <p>  The EPA&rsquo;s most recent bathing water quality report, released earlier this year, also highlights the encouraging progress being made in improving bathing waters across the country and I was particularly pleased to see the continual increase in the number of bathing waters meeting or exceeding the minimum water quality requirements.<\/p>  <p>  However, there are instances of bathing water quality issues in some specific areas of Dublin Bay, with Merrion Strand recently declassified as a bathing water. There are multifaceted sources of pollution that may be impacting on the bathing water quality in Dublin Bay. This includes sewer misconnections to surface water drains and streams, sewer storm water overflows, wildlife and dog-fouling.

Planning permission was granted for the project in April 2019, and the project is currently underway. <\/p>  <p>  Given a legacy of underinvestment in water services infrastructure in Ireland, the scale of remedial work necessary in our water system will take a number years and investment cycles to fully resolve.

Through our Embassy in Mozambique, Ireland, together with the EU and Member States, engages in regular dialogue with the Government of Mozambique, which includes a priority focus on human rights issues. Last month Ireland participated in a formal dialogue between the EU and the Government of Mozambique, where the EU side called on the Government to investigate all allegations of human rights abuses, including those perpetrated by State security forces, and to ensure that the perpetrators are brought to justice. During this dialogue, the EU and Member States also stressed the importance of freedom of the press and the need to ensure that the people of Mozambique have access to accurate media coverage of the ongoing conflict.

Skills Training ensures that Defence Forces personnel have the requisite individual, specialist, and crew skills.

Future equipment priorities for the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service are considered in the context of the White Paper on Defence as part of the capability development and equipment priorities planning process.  The principal aim over the period of the White Paper is to replace and upgrade, as required, existing capabilities in order to retain a flexible response for a wide range of operational requirements both at home and overseas.<\/p>  <p>  The mid-life upgrade programme for the Army&rsquo;s fleet of eighty MOWAG Armoured Personnel Carriers will extend the utility of the fleet and provide greater levels of protection, mobility and firepower. To date almost half of the fleet have been upgraded with the remainder due by late 2022. Additionally, twenty-four 4 x 4 Armoured Utility Vehicles (AUVs) were acquired in 2017, and in 2018 delivery was taken of ten new armoured logistic vehicles. These measures will provide essential force protection overseas. A capability requirement for additional AUVs has been identified and this project has been allocated funding and is being progressed.<\/p>  <p>  There is also continuous investment in the non-armoured vehicle fleet. In 2019 a contract was signed with Toyota Ireland for the replacement of the Army's fleet of 3\/4 tonne 4 X4 vehicles, the first of which entered service in early 2020. In March of this year a tender process completed for the supply of one hundred and twenty (120) new 4 X 4 Troop Carrying Vehicles, with the award of a contract to Westward Scania, based in Strokestown, Co. Roscommon. The first vehicles are scheduled for delivery in 2020 with delivery of all 120 vehicles concluding by 2023. Funding is provided on an on-going basis for the required maintenance of vehicles in the military transport fleet, both at home and overseas.<\/p>  <p>  The White Paper on Defence provides that the Air Corps will see the Cessna fleet replaced with three larger aircraft suitably equipped for Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance tasks. In December 2017, following a tender competition, a contract was awarded to Pilatus Aircraft Ltd for three PC-12 NG Spectre aircraft.  These aircraft, arrived in Casement Aerodrome last month and are currently in the final stages of a period of testing and acceptance and are expected to be fully operational in the coming months. <\/p>  <p>  In March 2020 an order was placed with Pilatus Aircraft Ltd for an additional PC-12 NG aircraft to provide very immediate additional fixed wing capacity to meet the unique situation arising from the COVID-19 pandemic.  This aircraft provides the Air Corps with a further agile resource to service urgent requests from the HSE and other agencies of the State.  <\/p>  <p>  The White Paper also provides for the replacement of the CASA 235s with consideration to be given to their replacement with larger more capable aircraft which would enhance maritime surveillance and provide a greater degree of utility for transport and cargo carrying tasks. A contract for the supply of two C295 Maritime Patrol Aircraft was entered into with Airbus Defence and Space in December 2019, with delivery of the aircraft expected in 2023.<\/p>  <p>  The White Paper on Defence also sets out an ambitious programme of capital investment in the Naval Service  including the mid-life refit and upgrade of the P50 class vessels, L&Eacute; R&oacute;is&iacute;n and L&Eacute; Niamh, as well as, in due course, the replacement of L&Eacute; Eithne.  The P50 mid-life upgrade programme is well underway.  The replacement of the flagship L&Eacute; Eithne with a multi role vessel (MRV) is the next scheduled component of the White Paper fleet investment programme.  Projects for other vessel replacement will be considered over the life-time of the White Paper in the context of overall capability development and funding and the Equipment Development Plan (EDP) process.  The EDP outlines that the MRV project is in planning ongoing stage within the indicative timeframe of 2020 to 2024.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to Defence Forces communications systems, there is continued investment in the development of suitable network enabled communications in order to meet the challenges of an increasingly complex operational environment. In July of this year a tender competition was commenced with the publication by my Department of a Pre-Qualification Questionnaire inviting expressions of interest from economic operators for the supply of Software Defined Radios to the Defence Forces. The scope of the project consists of two main requirements; Personal Soldier Radios and Multi-Band Handheld, Manpack, Vehicular and Airborne radios. Given the complexity of the requirements the procurement process is expected to be comprehensive in nature with the first radios not expected to enter service before 2023. <\/p>  <p>  The examples given, whilst not exhaustive, demonstrate my commitment to update and upgrade the Defence Forces equipment and capability, within the financial envelope available. In accordance with the National Development Plan, the capital allocation for Defence was been increased to &euro;113 million for 2020, an increase of &euro;7 million. The National Development Plan provides for a total of &euro;541 million for Defence over the period 2018-2022. This level of capital funding will allow the Defence Organisation to undertake a programme of sustained equipment replacement and infrastructural development across the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service as identified and prioritised in the Defence White Paper and builds on the significant investment programme over recent years. <\/p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the Defence Forces have the necessary modern and effective range of equipment available to them which is in line with best international standards in order to fulfil all roles assigned to them by Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100800073#WRJ05000","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Defence Forces Recruitment","counter":476,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100800073#WRJ05100"},{"type":"question","counter":477,"qnumday":177,"qnumall":"[29541\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100800073#WRJ05200","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"the number of promotions throughout the Army, Navy Service and Air Corps currently awaiting approval at each rank; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":478,"content":"<p>All promotions in the Permanent Defence Force are approved without delay providing that a vacancy exists for a suitably qualified individual.

Currently, almost 20% of the total Education Vote or &euro;1.9bn is invested in supporting children with special needs.  <\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the extent of this investment, there are some parts of the country, including South Dublin, where increases in population and other issues have led to concerns regarding a shortage of school places.<\/p>  <p>  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has responsibility for coordinating and advising on the education provision for children nationwide. NCSE is continuing its engagement with schools, patron bodies, parents and others across South Dublin to bring the required additional special class and special school placements on stream. While progress has been achieved, the NCSE has identified the need for additional special class and special school places in South Dublin for the current school-year. <\/p>  <p>  Normally, special class and special school places are established with the full cooperation of the schools in areas where they are required.  However there are some parts of the country where the NCSE has faced challenges in getting schools and their patrons to provide new special class or special school places.  <\/p>  <p>  As Minister, I have a power under Section 37A of the Education Act 1998 (as inserted by Section 8 of the Education (Admissions to Schools) Act 2018), to direct a school to provide additional provision where all reasonable efforts have failed.  The legislation contains a procedure through which the capacity of schools in an area can be tested and through which ultimately a Ministerial direction can be made requiring a school to make additional special education provision available. <\/p>  <p>  The legislation was used for the first time in 2019, in respect of the Dublin 15 area. Significant progress has been made in that area on foot of action taken under Section 37. A new Special School was established and six schools have agreed to open special classes thereby meeting the need for additional places in the area. The experience of Dublin 15 shows that real and practical challenges can be addressed by working together to provide additional special class and special school places.<\/p>  <p>  A Report from the NCSE, prepared in accordance with Section 37A (2) of the Education Act 1998 (as inserted by Section 8 of the Education (Admissions to Schools) Act 2018), confirming the need for additional special education places in South Dublin was submitted to the then Minister in April last. This Report is available on my Department&rsquo;s website. <\/p>  <p>  Statutory notices under the Act were subsequently issued on 26 June, 2020 to 39 schools identified by the NCSE. The issue of the notices is but the first step in a very transparent multi-step process, the purpose of which is to establish if the school has capacity to provide new places. At each stage of the process, schools are given the opportunity to make representations and there is also an option for arbitration at a later point. Statutory notices issued under the Act together with the representations received from the schools and their patrons are published on my Department&rsquo;s website. The representations received to date have all been published and are a matter of public record. Schools may be visited as part of this process to establish the circumstances of individual schools. <\/p>  <p>  It would not be appropriate for me to comment further at this stage on the legislative process which is currently underway.<\/p>  <p>  In 2020, a national inventory of school capacity was developed using the Department&rsquo;s Geographic Information System (GIS). In 2019, as part of their annual enrolment returns to the Department in the Primary On-line Database (POD) and the Post-Primary On-line Database (PPOD), schools were requested to provide information in respect of overall demand for school places and available capacity within their schools. <\/p>  <p>  The compilation and analysis of this information at local, regional and national level through the Department&rsquo;s GIS will be an important additional feature of the school planning process. This is the first year of this initiative and the approach taken will provide a cost effective and efficient method to the provision and analysis of up to date data in relation to demand and capacity across over 3,000 primary schools and over 750 post-primary schools.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100800074#WRK01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1472"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Teaching Council of Ireland","counter":496,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100800074#WRK01600"},{"type":"question","counter":497,"qnumday":186,"qnumall":"[29271\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100800074#WRK01700","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if a person (details supplied) can be given a Teaching Council number; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1487","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":498,"content":"<p>Under the Teaching Council Acts 2001-2015 the Teaching Council is the body with statutory authority and responsibility for the regulation of the teaching profession in Ireland including the registration of teachers in the State. <\/p>  <p>  The Teaching Council have currently registered over 3,000 Newly Qualified Teachers this year, it has also registered over 940 teachers across all 4 registration routes since May.<\/p>  <p>  I am informed the Teaching Council advise that, for teachers qualified outside of Ireland, the assessment and registration process may typically take up to 12 weeks from receipt of all application documentation and depending on the time of year, recommending that applicants apply in advance of their planned return to or commencement of teaching in Ireland.

The arts give expression to and extend children&rsquo;s understanding, their imagination and their creativity through a broad range of experiences. The Arts Education curriculum (1999) at primary consists of three subjects: Music, Drama and Visual arts. The curriculum enables children to creatively express ideas, feelings and experiences.<\/p>  <p>  The primary curriculum is in the process of undergoing review and redevelopment. As part of this process consultation is underway (to the end of 2020) on a draft Primary Curriculum Framework. In the redeveloped curriculum Arts Education is presented as one of five broad curriculum areas. Arts Education would continue to support learning in visual arts, music and drama, as well as supporting other aspects of arts education such as dance, film and digital media, and enabling schools to engage with local, national and international initiatives and opportunities.<\/p>  <p>  The Creative Ireland Programme, led by the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, is a five-year all-of-government, culture-based initiative that emphasises the importance of human creativity for individual, community and national well-being.  Under this programme the Creative Youth Plan was published in December 2017 and aims to increase the opportunities for engagement by children and young people in artistic and cultural creativity, helping them to discover and develop new skills and talents that enhance their development and growth, and add to the richness of their overall learning experience. The Plan has initiatives both targeted at schools and out-of-school settings, as well as providing teachers with CPD. <\/p>  <p>  Among key initiatives for schools under Creative Youth are Creative Schools and Creative Clusters. <\/p>  <p>  Creative Schools is led by the Arts Council in partnership with the Department of Education, the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs provides tangible supports for schools to place arts and creativity at the centre of school life. Schools participate in the initiative over a two year period and are provided with access to a &ldquo;Creative Associate&rdquo; and funding. <\/p>  <p>  As of 2020, 464 schools have enrolled in the initiative. Of these there were 113 primary schools in 2018, 144 in 2019 and 119 in 2020. Each school is allocated a grant of &euro;2,000 per year over a two year period to develop and implement  bespoke creativity plans. Total funding of &euro;3.096m is being provided in 2020 to support the initiative (between the Departments of Education and Skills and Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media and Arts Council). This total investment includes additional resources made available under the July Stimulus Package which has enabled the provision to each participating school of an additional &euro;1,100 in 2020 , meaning the grant awarded for the 2020\/21 school year is &euro;3,100 per school. <\/p>  <p>  Creative Clusters is an initiative of Department of Education, led by and in partnership with the Education Support Centres Ireland (ESCI, formerly ATECI) and funded through the Schools Excellence Fund. The purpose of this pilot scheme is to demonstrate how the arts and creativity can support clusters of schools to work together over a two year period to address common learning challenges, identified by those schools. The initiative commenced in the 2018-19 academic year and as of September 2020, there are 220 schools across 65 clusters involved. In 2018, the number of primary schools engaged was 54, with 64 engaged in 2019 and 62 in 2020. <\/p>  <p>  Clusters receive access to a &ldquo;Cluster Facilitator&rdquo; and grant funding of &euro;1,500 per participating school, up to a maximum of &euro;7,500 per cluster, each year over the two years. As part of the July Stimulus, the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media  is providing an additional &euro;1,000 to each participating school for the 2020\/21 school year. <\/p>  <p>  My Department also provides funding to Music Generation for the provision of performance music education for children and young people. Under Creative Youth, Music Generation is being expanded to all areas of the country. Initiated by Music Network, Music Generation has been co-funded by U2, The Ireland Funds, the Department of Education and Local Music Education Partnerships. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100800074#WRK02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Special Educational Needs","counter":502,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100800074#WRK02200"},{"type":"question","counter":503,"qnumday":188,"qnumall":"[29299\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100800074#WRK02300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if a child (details supplied) can be found a place in a school that will suit their needs, as per the recommendations of their early intervention team clinicians; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1478","askee":"1582"},{"type":"question","counter":504,"qnumday":189,"qnumall":"[29300\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100800074#WRK02400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if she can task the SENO in the appropriate area to support a child (details supplied) and their family in locating an appropriate school place in a primary school with an ASD unit; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1478","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":505,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 188 and 189 together.<\/p><p>Enabling children with special educational needs to receive an education appropriate to their needs is a priority for this Government.

NCSE is continuing its engagement with schools, patron bodies, parents and others across South Dublin to bring the required additional special class and special school placements on stream.

Significant progress has been made in that area on foot of action taken under Section 37.

There are no plans to change this status of CE supervisors. The Department&rsquo;s role continues to be that of CE funder. <\/p>  <p>  This issue was examined by a Community Sector High Level Forum, chaired by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  A number of Departments, including my own Department, were represented on this group, as were the unions and Pobal. <\/p>  <p>  As part of this process a detailed scoping exercise was carried out with input from the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service (IGEES) on the potential costs of providing Exchequer support for the establishment of such a pension scheme for employees across the Community and Voluntary sector in Ireland.  This exercise estimated a potential cost to the State of between &euro;188 million and &euro;347 million per annum depending on the numbers involved.  This excluded any provision for an immediate ex-gratia lump sum payment of pension as sought, which could entail a further Exchequer cost of up to &euro;318 million. <\/p>  <p>  In its findings, the High-level Group stated that while CE supervisors and assistant supervisors represented only a very small part of the wider community and voluntary sector, any explicit provision of State funding for such a scheme in respect of CE Supervisors could potentially give rise to claims for funding for employees of similar schemes in the broader sector.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform stated that it had to have regard to the full potential Exchequer exposure associated with setting such a precedent.<\/p>  <p>  At this point, I wish to acknowledge the valuable and dedicated service that CE supervisors provide in running CE schemes delivering local based community services while  providing a valuable training and development opportunity to the long-term unemployed and to those often furthest removed from the labour market.<\/p>  <p>The current position is that officials from my Department, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Unions are in ongoing discussions on the matter. The funding of any potential pension provision for CE supervisors will ultimately be a matter for the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and will need to be considered in the wider economic and budgetary context in which any such scheme will need to operate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100800075#WRL04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1563"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Payments Administration","counter":582,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100800075#WRL04700"},{"type":"question","counter":583,"qnumday":215,"qnumall":"[29546\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100800075#WRL04800","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the correct level of payment including the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance, Covid-19 related support payable in the case of a person (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":584,"content":"<p>The person concerned is currently in receipt of Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance at the weekly rate of &euro;246.70 which is the correct payment for a person of her circumstances.<\/p><p>The spouse of the person concerned is in receipt of Illness Benefit at the full personal weekly rate of &euro;203.

It is framed to account for periods during which there is a low incidence of the disease, with isolated clusters and low community transmission, through to situations where there is a high or rapidly increasing incidence, widespread community transmission and the pandemic is escalating rapidly in Ireland and globally. It recognises the need for society and business to be allowed to continue as normally as possible and is designed so that either national or county level restrictions can be applied. <\/p><p>The Plan reflects a careful consideration of the impact of the introduction of restrictions on employment and livelihoods, keeping as many businesses open as possible at different stages, while acknowledging that some businesses and services are critical.

This is a generic policy framework for rare diseases. The scope of the plan is broad given that there are approximately 8,000 rare diseases affecting millions of EU citizens; and consequently, there can be a dearth of expertise and knowledge about some rare diseases, simply because they are so rare. <\/p>  <p>  Many of the major recommendations of the plan have already been implemented and in December 2013 the National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases was established as a joint initiative between the HSE and the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland. A Clinical Advisory Group was established to oversee the programme, a Clinical Lead and Programme Manager were appointed, and a multidisciplinary National Working Group was established to provide support to the programme workstreams and the National Plan was firmly embedded in the Programme.<\/p>  <p>  The opening of the National Rare Disease Office, (NRDO) in 2015 was a significant milestone for people living with a rare disease, their families and their healthcare professionals.  Prof Eileen Treacy is the Director of the National Rare Diseases Office, whose purpose it is to provide current and reliable information about genetic and rare diseases to patients, families and healthcare professionals. <\/p>  <p>  On foot of the HSE Chief Clinical Officer&rsquo;s (CCO), review of all the national clinical programmes in April 2019, it was recommended that the National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases be operationalised and incorporated into the National Rare Disease Office. From 01 September 2020, the NRDO will be the main contact point and driver for national HSE rare disease projects and initiatives. The work of the NRDO will be overseen and governed by HSE Acute Operations. This means that the National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases will be wound down and any outstanding projects will be transferred to the NRDO.<\/p>  <p>  Building on the significant progress to date, themes for inclusion in a roadmap for the coming period have been agreed with the Rare Disease Task Force, which comprises the main rare disease advocacy groups; Rare Disease Ireland, the Medical Research Charities Group (MRCP), and  the Irish Platform for Patient Organisations, Science and Industry (IPPPOSI). Meetings, to ensure that the input and the voice of the patient is represented in the continuing work ongoing in relation to Rare Diseases will continue to take place with the Rare Disease Task Force, the HSE and the Rare Disease Office. <\/p>  <p>  A number of key themes have now been identified for progression in the coming period, including: Patient Awareness; European Reference Networks; Research &amp;amp; Registries; Access to Services; Access to Medicines; Diagnosis; Education &amp;amp; Training and Legislation &amp;amp; Policy.

The higher the sensitivity of a test the lower the probability of incorrectly classifying an infected animal as uninfected (a false negative result). The SICCT Tb skin test used in Ireland has a sensitivity of approximately 80% i.e. it can, on average, detect around 80% of bTB-infected cattle. In some cases, this sensitivity figure can be higher, and in others, it can be lower. There are several factors which can affect this sensitivity figure:<\/p>  <p>  -  The skin test cannot detect very recently infected cattle, as their immune system has generally not had the time to respond to the bTB bacteria. This is called the pre-allergic phase.  At least 6 weeks must have passed after an animal becomes infected with TB before the Tb skin test will detect the infection. <\/p>  <p>  -  The skin test can detect around 90% of cattle where the infection has advanced such that there would be visible bTB lesions. However, as the disease progresses further, an infected animal&rsquo;s immune system becomes damaged and the Tb skin test becomes less likely to work.<\/p>  <p>  The specificity of a test is the ability of a test to correctly identify as negative an animal that is free from infection. The higher the specificity the lower the probability of incorrectly classifying an uninfected animal as infected. The SICCT Tb skin test has an excellent test specificity of 99.98%, thus it is rare that a non infected animal will be classified as infected.   <\/p>  <p>  Good quality testing facilities and assistance on the day are essential in carrying out a TB test. As with all tests, failure to perform the test properly will result in the specificity and the sensitivity of the test being reduced.  My Department has robust quality control systems to ensure high quality testing.  These include quality control relating to the tuberculin used in the test; the only facility in Europe to measure the potency of tuberculin in naturally infected animals, lab based potency testing and supervision of the manufacturing facility. <\/p>  <p>  Quality Control  in relation to equipment includes the requirement to service equipment annually, approval and inspection of servicing providers and on-farm inspection of equipment.  My Department also has robust quality control in relation to test performance; testing only being performed by veterinary practitioners, tests being subject to veterinary certification, advanced IT systems for reporting of tests, IT systems for measurement and comparison of test performance, risk-based targeting of test inspections by Veterinary Inspectors, inspection and blood testing of reactor animals. <\/p>  <p>  The tests recognised by the European Commission for the purposes of TB testing which can be used here are:<\/p>  <p>  -  The single intradermal comparative skin test (SICTT) which is the test most widely used in an Irish context.<\/p>  <p>  -  The gamma interferon test (a blood test) which is used as an adjunct to the SICTT in known infected herds.<\/p>  <p>  Another blood test, the Tb elisa test, is also used as a tool where there are intractable TB breakdowns to try to identify chronically infected individual animals which are still clinically normal but whose immune system is not capable of reacting to the tuberculin skin test.<\/p>  <p>  My Department uses the above two blood tests in addition to the skin test as appropriate. My Department has been very actively involved over many years in efforts to develop and validate new and improved Tb tests, and we remain actively involved in such efforts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100800081#WRR02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1546"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Harbours and Piers","counter":918,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100800081#WRR02400"},{"type":"question","counter":919,"qnumday":328,"qnumall":"[29451\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100800081#WRR02500","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if an application was made by Wexford County Council in 2018 for funding to repair storm damage to the slipway at Seaview, Kilmore, County Wexford that occurred in 2014; the status of the application; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1619","askee":"1546"},{"type":"speech","counter":920,"content":"<p>My Department owns, operates and maintains six designated State-owned Fishery Harbour Centres, located at Castletownbere, Dingle, Dunmore East, Howth, Killybegs and Ros An Mh&iacute;l under statute.

The EU fruit and vegetables regime supports POs for implementing operational programmes with funding contributions.
