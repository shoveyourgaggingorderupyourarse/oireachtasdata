While I am confident that these actions once implemented early can deliver emissions reductions that would allow maintenance of our current national herd count, market conditions are likely to indicate a reorientation of systems within the herd.<\/p><p>There are already a significant number of measures in place which support these actions ranging from enhanced regulation to improve nitrogen use efficiency such as seen in the recent review of our Nitrates derogation to incentives which encourage afforestation and improved animal efficiency such as the BDGP and BEEP schemes.  However, I am not complacent on this important issue and my Department continues to review and develop new measures that will realise the ambition for the sector.<\/p><p>Higher ambition on environmental and climate action are part of the new CAP, post-2020, and it is proposed that 40% of the overall CAP budget will contribute to climate action. This will require farmers to achieve a higher level of environmental ambition through both mandatory and incentive-based measures.  All mechanisms, such as the CAP reform, market incentive and regulation will be investigated in full by all the relevant stakeholders, including industry, to mobilise the necessary actions as swiftly as possible.  While the mitigation potential for agriculture is limited, agriculture can and must play a key role in contributing to Ireland&rsquo;s climate change and energy targets in the years ahead.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500059#WRB01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Greyhound Industry","counter":51,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500059#WRB01700"},{"type":"question","counter":52,"qnumday":71,"qnumall":"[41885\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500059#WRB01800","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the way in which he can ensure that a key objective of the Irish Greyhound Board&rsquo;s strategic plan 2018-22, which is to maintain animal welfare at the centre of the industry, will be met; the way in which the greyhound care fund is addressing the welfare and health issues of greyhounds.","asker":"1291","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":53,"content":"<p>Bord na gCon (BnG) is a commercial state body, established under the Greyhound Industry Act, 1958 chiefly to control greyhound racing and to improve and develop the greyhound industry.

A Greyhound Care Fund has been established which will be funded by a percentage from sponsorship and admission fees, effective from September 2019 and will be further funded from a percentage of the Tote income from November.       <\/p>  <p>  I am confident that Bord na gCon is rebuilding the industry within a modern framework with the welfare of the racing greyhound at its core.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500060#WRC04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Beef Industry","counter":139,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500060#WRC04400"},{"type":"question","counter":140,"qnumday":100,"qnumall":"[41983\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500060#WRC04500","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the status of the beef crisis; his plans to assist farmers on this matter; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1271","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":141,"content":"<p>There have been a series of formal negotiations with beef sector stakeholders, facilitated by my Department, since early August, culminating in an agreement being reached between stakeholders on Sunday 15 September. <\/p><p>The full text of the Agreement is available on my  Department's website: <\/p><p>The Agreement involves a number of interventions which will provide immediate benefit for beef producers, as well as a range of strategic measures which seek to address structural imbalances in the sector.<\/p><p>Beef producers will benefit from an immediate increase in a range of bonuses. This will increase the level of bonus being paid on certain animals, as well as significantly increasing the number of animals which are eligible for a bonus. The cumulative effect is that over 70% of all steer and heifers slaughtered will now be eligible for a bonus on top of the base price paid. <\/p><p>A number of actions in the area of market transparency, beef promotion and strengthening the position of the farmer in the supply chain are included in the Agreement. These measures set a course towards greater clarity for all stakeholders involved in the beef supply chain, primarily farmers.  <\/p><p>My Department is also proactively engaging with several potential beef Producer Organisations, which have to potential to strengthen the bargaining power of beef farmers in the supply chain.  Two beef producer organisations have been formally recognised by my Department in recent weeks. <\/p><p>I have established a Beef Market Taskforce to provide the leadership to develop a sustainable pathway for the future of the beef sector in terms of economic, environmental and social sustainability. The Taskforce will provide a robust implementation structure for commitments entered into in the Agreement, with timelines and stakeholder engagement.  Furthermore, the Beef Market Taskforce will offer a suitable platform for strategic engagement with key stakeholders, including retailers and regulatory authorities.<\/p><p>I have appointed Michael Dowling as independent Chair of the Taskforce, and its membership includes representatives from my Department, relevant State agencies, farm organisations and the meat industry.  The Beef Taskforce scheduled for yesterday, 14 October, was adjourned, as members of the Taskforce were prevented from attending the meeting.  It is in the interests of everyone involved in the beef industry that the work of the Taskforce goes ahead.  The Taskforce&rsquo;s remit is to monitor the implementation of the actions arising from the agreement reached on 15 September and offers  the most viable platform for strategic engagement with key stakeholders.  It was a great pity that farm representatives were not in a position to air the legitimate concerns of farmers at the Taskforce.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500060#WRC04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of An Taoiseach","counter":143,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500060#WRC04700"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Taoiseach's Meetings and Engagements","counter":142,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500060#WRC04650"},{"type":"question","counter":143,"qnumday":101,"qnumall":"[41960\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500060#WRC04700","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if the European Union (Withdrawal) (No.2) Act 2019 was discussed when he met Prime Minister Johnson recently.

The Act provides, among other things, that a person must be an Irish citizen before a passport can be issued to him\/her. In order to meet this legal requirement, each person must demonstrate an entitlement to Irish citizenship in his\/her passport application.<\/p>  <p>  As part of the identity and citizenship verification process, the Passport Service requires applicants themselves, or the applicant&rsquo;s guardian in the case of applications for children, to submit all necessary supporting documents in order to establish the applicant&rsquo;s identity and entitlement to citizenship. It is not possible for the Passport Service to obtain these documents on an applicant&rsquo;s behalf from other State or non-State bodies. <\/p>  <p>  The applicant referred to was born in Ireland after 1 January 2005. Any possible claim to citizenship for the applicant is governed by the terms of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956 as amended (&ldquo;The 1956 Act&rdquo;). Section 6A of the 1956 Act provides that a person born in the State on or after 1 January 2005, where neither parent is an Irish or British citizen or otherwise entitled to reside in the State or Northern Ireland without restriction at the time of that person&rsquo;s birth, may claim citizenship by birth in the State (and thereby establish eligibility for an Irish passport) only where a parent has been lawfully resident in the State for three years of the four years preceding his\/her birth.<\/p>  <p>  In such cases, proofs of lawful residence in the State are required to determine if a parent has the required three year residence. The 2004 amendment of the 1956 Act makes particular provisions for nationals of EU Member States, who may make a declaration concerning their residence in the island of Ireland within the 4 years preceding their child&rsquo;s birth. In such cases, the EU national is regarded as having resided on the island of Ireland for the declared periods for the purposes of the 1956 Act, unless the contrary is proved. These declarations must be supported by documentary evidence to verify residence in the State. For non-EU parents, permission to remain in the State recorded on passports, and\/or registration cards, as issued by the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB), are acceptable proofs of a parent&rsquo;s lawful residence in the context of a passport application.<\/p>  <p>  In this case, proof of lawful residence in the State for either of the parents for the required time-period prior to the applicant's birth was not submitted in support of the passport application. In the absence of such proof of lawful residence, an entitlement to citizenship, and therefore eligibility for an Irish passport, was not established. I am advised by the Passport Service that letters were issued to the applicant&rsquo;s father on 23 September and 30 September outlining what documents were required in order to establish this lawful residence. <\/p>  <p>  If lawful residence in the State for the required time-period cannot be established, it may be open to the applicant in question to apply for Irish citizenship through naturalisation. A parent or guardian may lodge an application for naturalisation on behalf of a child if and when the conditions for naturalisation (including minimum residency terms) are satisfied. Citizenship, including naturalisation, comes under the remit of the Department of Justice and Equality. Further information on citizenship and naturalisation is available on the website of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500061#WRD03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Syrian Conflict","counter":177,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500061#WRD03400"},{"type":"question","counter":178,"qnumday":113,"qnumall":"[41742\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500061#WRD03500","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"his views on a planned Turkish invasion of northern Syria; his views on whether such an invasion by the Turkish military poses a threat to the Kurdish community and minority ethnic and religious groups in the region; his further views on whether such an invasion will also hamper the fight against Daesh-ISIS; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1309","askee":"1286"},{"type":"question","counter":179,"qnumday":118,"qnumall":"[41749\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500061#WRD03600","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"his views on the US Administration&rsquo;s decision to withdraw troops from northern Syria; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1221","askee":"1286"},{"type":"question","counter":180,"qnumday":126,"qnumall":"[42285\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500061#WRD03700","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"his views on the military action by Turkey in the Kurdish controlled part of Syria; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1434","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":181,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 113, 118 and 126 together.<\/p>  <p>  On 6 October, the US announced the withdrawal of US troops from north-east Syria, ahead of a Turkish offensive into Syrian territory. Turkey commenced military operations on 9 October, with the stated aim of preventing &lsquo;the creation of a terror corridor&rsquo; along its border with Syria. These developments are deeply troubling. Turkey's military action has the potential to further destabilise a region which is still reeling from the fight against ISIS.<\/p>  <p>  While we understand Turkey&rsquo;s security concerns about its own territory, these concerns should be addressed through political and diplomatic means, in accordance with international humanitarian law. I am particularly concerned about the humanitarian impact of a military escalation and its potential to cause further displacement of civilian populations. In a statement on 9 October, I stressed that the protection of civilians and respect for international humanitarian law must be paramount. <\/p>  <p>  I am also concerned about the long-term security implications of these developments. The fight against ISIS made decisive progress earlier this year. However, there remain individuals who have the potential to take advantage of any relaxation of vigilance Any unilateral military action against those groups which played a decisive frontline role in the fight against ISIS risks undermining this progress. It is also imperative that terrorist fighters remain securely detained, until their situation can be resolved, in order to prevent them joining the ranks of terrorist groups.<\/p>  <p>  The position of the EU was made clear in a Declaration released on 9 October by the High Representative, reaffirming that a sustainable solution to the Syrian conflict cannot be achieved militarily, and calling upon Turkey to cease the unilateral action. <\/p>  <p>  It is unlikely that the so-called &lsquo;safe zone&rsquo; in north-east Syria, as envisaged by Turkey, would satisfy international criteria for refugee return as laid down by UNHCR. Ireland and the EU have maintained that returns of refugees and internally-displaced people to their places of origin must be voluntary, dignified and safe. The EU has been clear that any attempt at demographic change would be unacceptable. The EU will not provide stabilisation or development assistance in areas where the rights of local populations are ignored.<\/p>  <p>  All military action in Syria risks undermining the work of the UN in attempting to facilitate a negotiated end to the conflict, and a political transition which meets the legitimate aspirations of the Syrian people. I take this opportunity to reiterate Ireland&rsquo;s strong support for the work of the UN Special Envoy and urge all parties to engage with the UN-led process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500061#WRD03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Foreign Conflicts","counter":182,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500061#WRD03900"},{"type":"question","counter":183,"qnumday":114,"qnumall":"[41743\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500061#WRD04000","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"his views on the ongoing protests in Hong Kong and the escalating tensions and violence; if he has discussed the situation with his Chinese counterpart; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1309","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":184,"content":"<p>I am concerned about the ongoing protests in Hong Kong, and in particular the escalation in the levels of violence in recent weeks.

His recent hearing covered a broad range of issues in varying levels of detail and, while interesting as indications of his thinking, can only be properly evaluated within the institutional context in which the EU and its Member States work. <\/p>  <p>  The Treaty on the European Union stipulates that the Council adopts Common Foreign and Security Policy decisions by unanimity. While there are very limited circumstances in which Qualified Majority Voting (QMV) can be used, such as when appointing a Special Representative on the basis of a proposal by the High Representative\/Vice President, the Treaty explicitly precludes decisions having military or defence implications from any such derogations. Under the Treaty therefore, EU military crisis management missions can only be approved by a unanimous decision of the Council. <\/p>  <p>  With regard to the security-related aspects of Mr Borrell&rsquo;s remarks, we understand them to refer in part to the European Defence Fund, but primarily to the proposed European Peace Facility, which remains under discussion at technical working group level in Brussels.

Such a decision is for the Council to make by unanimity.<\/p>  <p>  One of the specific issues which has not been agreed among Member States is the proposal to expand the share of costs from military CSDP operations which would be funded in common, rather than directly by the troop contributing State. As to the overall level of spending envisaged, the outgoing High Representative\/Vice President proposed that the European Peace Facility should have a budget of &euro;10.5 billion over seven years. However, this budget would include all aspects of the proposed new European Peace Facility, including the incorporation into it of other existing EU initiatives which are currently funded through other mechanisms including, for instance, the African Peace Facility which funds important work by the African Union in preventing and resolving conflict on that continent.

Ireland and the EU have been clear from the beginning that this situation can only be solved by political means, and that efforts to impose a military solution will be both fruitless and dangerous. We fully support the efforts of the UN Special Envoy for Yemen, Martin Griffiths, to bring about a political resolution, starting with the implementation of the December 2018 Stockholm Agreement, which was signed by the Government of Yemen and the Houthi de facto authorities.<\/p>  <p>  After more than four years of conflict in this extremely poor country, almost 80% of the population of Yemen is in need of humanitarian assistance. Humanitarian access is a critical issue in a context where millions are unable to pay for food and medical care even when it is available, due to the collapse of the economy under the strains of conflict. Commercial access is also extremely important, since the Yemeni population cannot survive on aid alone. Bureaucratic impediments and delays to movements have unfortunately been common across Yemen, both in areas under Coalition or Government control, and areas controlled by the Houthis. It is imperative that the implementation of the Stockholm Agreement is progressed to ensure that humanitarian and commercial goods can enter Yemen freely.<\/p>  <p>  The EU is the largest donor to the UN Verification and Inspection Mechanism (UNVIM). UNVIM was established in May 2016 to facilitate more efficient verification that imports of commercial goods at Yemen's ports do not contain arms. Following the Stockholm Agreement, UNVIM has also been assigned the role of supporting the Yemen Red Sea Ports Corporation in the management and inspection of ports. Ships are checked for arms and other contraband by UNVIM first in Djibouti and again at an arrival point 30km off the port of Hodeidah. The UNVIM operation is making an important contribution to ensuring the continued flow of commercial goods to Yemen.<\/p>  <p>  I am aware of reports of a recent surge in the number of ships which are waiting to dock in Yemen, due to additional checks being undertaken by the Coalition after UNVIM checks. I understand that this delay in access is leading to a fuel crisis in Yemen which is exacerbating an already dire humanitarian situation. UNVIM was established at the request of the official Government of Yemen, and these additional checks are not acceptable given the importance of these goods to the people of Yemen. <\/p>  <p>  I understand that UNSE Griffiths is currently working with all parties towards a solution which will bring the ships currently being held by the Coalition to dock in Hodeidah. Mr. Griffiths enjoys our full support in these efforts. <\/p>  <p>  I have made my views on the importance of unrestricted humanitarian access and the free flow of commercial goods to Yemen absolutely clear to the Coalition parties. At my last meeting with the Saudi Ambassador I relayed Ireland&rsquo;s concerns in this regard directly, and officials from my Department remain in regular contact with the Saudi and UAE embassies.

However, even on a symbolic level, it risks marginalising Israeli citizens who are not Jewish, in particular the 20% of Israeli citizens who identify as Arab or Palestinian. It sends worrying signals about their status and their right to equality in the country which is their home. Some of these Israelis have expressed fears that the new law, which has the status of a Basic Law, may be a starting point for discrimination against minorities within Israel. There have been public demonstrations in Israel to express concerns about this Law, and concerns about the law have featured in debates during this year's Israeli election campaigns. <\/p>  <p>  The Israeli Declaration of Independence stated that Israel will ensure complete equality of social and political rights to all its inhabitants irrespective of religion, race or sex. For those Israelis whose first language is Arabic, the official status which that language has hitherto had is symbolically important of their status as equal citizens, as well as being important from a practical perspective. \u00a0This law sets out to privilege Jewish communities, and I know that many Israelis, both Arab and Jewish, have reacted with dismay to this. <\/p>  <p>  A key point is that this new law states that \"... the right to exercise national self-determination in the State of Israel is unique to the Jewish people\". Nobody is denying the strong connection between the Jewish people and Israel. But Israel is also a home to many who are not Jewish, and this law sends a worrying signal about their rights as Israeli citizens, and the part they have to play in Israel&rsquo;s democracy.\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  I am also particularly concerned about the references to Jewish settlement. There have been different interpretations of whether this refers to Israel only, or also to the West Bank, but the ambiguity is very unhelpful in a volatile situation. The Government is wholly opposed to the construction of settlements in the occupied Palestinian territory. This language is also extremely worrying in the context of a number of pieces of legislation being proposed, and already passed, by the Knesset, which blur the lines between Israel and the West Bank.<\/p>  <p>  The EU made its views on the Nation State Law known to Israel at the time, including the fact that this law could complicate the path to the two state solution. The law has not been specifically discussed at the EU Foreign Affairs Council. Last year my Department signaled our concerns about the Nation State Law to the Israeli Embassy in Dublin. We continue to monitor the situation closely through our Embassy in Tel Aviv and Representative Office in Ramallah. Israel is currently in the process of forming a Government and we will continue to follow the actions of the new government in this area. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500061#WRD05400","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Northern Ireland","counter":198,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500061#WRD05500"},{"type":"question","counter":199,"qnumday":120,"qnumall":"[41751\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500061#WRD05600","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the status of efforts to restart the Executive in Northern Ireland; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1221","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":200,"content":"<p>The continuing absence of the power-sharing Executive and Assembly in Northern Ireland and the North South Ministerial Council is of grave concern for the Government, as it is for the British Government.<\/p>  <p>  I have engaged extensively with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland throughout the latest talks process, to encourage the parties to reach an accommodation.

Lebanon has welcomed a particularly large number of refugees from Syria, reportedly up to 1.5 million people. This number is equivalent to a third of the country&rsquo;s population, and is the highest concentration per capita of refugees in the world.

The EU&rsquo;s partners provide those in need with humanitarian supplies and access to urgently-needed health, education, water, and sanitation services, as well as cash-based assistance for Syrians affected by the crisis.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Since its establishment in December 2014, a significant share of the EU&rsquo;s support to help Syrian refugees has been provided through the EU Regional Trust Fund in Response to the Syrian Crisis, which is focussed on an integrated EU aid response to address longer-term resilience for Syrian refugees, as well as easing pressure on host communities and their administrations. The EU also funds the Facility for Refugees in Turkey (FRIT), which aims to meet the immediate humanitarian needs of Syrian refugees in Turkey and to bring about long-term sustainable improvements in their health, education and self-reliance. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Ireland and the EU have been clear in our support for those Syrian refugees who wish to return to their homes. However, we believe that any returns must be voluntary, dignified and safe, and based on an accurate picture of the conditions at home.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  I discussed the situation in Syria with my EU colleagues at the Foreign Affairs Council yesterday. We condemned Turkey&rsquo;s military action, which seriously undermines the stability and the security of the whole region, and\u00a0urged Turkey to cease its unilateral military action in North East Syria and to withdraw its forces. Member States also unanimously agreed that they would suspend arms exports to Turkey.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The EU remains committed to the unity, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Syria. This can be assured only through a genuine political transition in line with UNSCR 2254 and the 2012 Geneva Communique, negotiated by the Syrian parties within the UN-led Geneva process.\u00a0Ireland will continue to work with the EU to respond to recent developments in north-east Syria, to contribute to the humanitarian effort, and to support the UN-led peace process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500061#WRD06900","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Human Rights","counter":213,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500061#WRD07000"},{"type":"question","counter":214,"qnumday":125,"qnumall":"[42166\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500061#WRD07100","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"his views on the position of Ireland on the ongoing political crisis and human rights violations in Bahrain; if he will consider introducing a joint statement at the Human Rights Council in Geneva condemning the ongoing abuse of human rights in Bahrain and demanding the release of political prisoners; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1324","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":215,"content":"<p>The human rights situation in Bahrain remains a matter of concern. Although Bahrain has repeatedly stated its commitment to improving its human rights record and safeguarding human rights as enshrined in the Bahraini Constitution, there are ongoing instances of violations of fundamental freedoms there, including violations of freedom of opinion and expression, as well as the targeting of human rights defenders. Ireland attaches a high priority to safeguarding human rights defenders, and continually advocates for freedom for civil society actors to operate in a safe and enabling environment, without repression.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  I was alarmed to learn of the executions of three people in July, including two human rights activists. A moratorium on the death penalty had been in place in Bahrain since 2010, and we saw the resumption of capital punishment in Bahrain in 2017 as a very negative development. Ireland condemns the use of the death penalty in all circumstances. Along with our EU partners, Ireland calls on Bahrain to again introduce a moratorium on executions, as a step towards the abolition of the death penalty. <\/p>  <p>  I am also aware of reports of inhumane detention conditions as well as allegations that political prisoners in Bahrain have been tortured. I understand that a large number of prisoners held in Jau Prison in Bahrain went on hunger strike in response to these conditions. Ireland\u00a0urges all States to\u00a0safeguard\u00a0the human rights of prisoners and detainees and\u00a0is committed to the prevention and eradication of torture and other forms of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.<\/p>  <p>  Respect for human rights is an integral part of Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy and we consistently seek to raise our concerns on human rights issues through the most appropriate and effective channels. Our active participation at the UN Human Rights Council is particularly important in that regard. Ireland regularly raises the case of human rights in Bahrain at that forum, in the form of national statements and its support to EU Statements. For example, in September 2018, Ireland expressed concerns about the ongoing restrictions on civil society space and the treatment of human rights defenders, and called on Bahrain to respect freedom of opinion and expression. In February 2019, Ireland reiterated concern at the ongoing detention of human rights defenders. In our Item 4 statement at the Human Rights Council in July 2019, Ireland called on Bahrain to ensure respect for freedom of opinion and expression, and the right to a fair trial. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland also took the opportunity at the most recent Council in September 2019 to reiterate its opposition to the use of the death penalty in all circumstances. Since 2012, Ireland has signed five Human Rights Council joint statements on the human rights situation in Bahrain, which expressed concern on a number of fronts including the mistreatment of detainees, repression of demonstrations, and the arbitrary deprivation of nationality without due process. We shall consider carefully any opportunity to participate in a joint statement at a future Human Rights Council session, and I have asked my officials to keep the matter under review.<\/p>  <p>  Our principled stance on human rights also feeds into our bilateral dialogue and we raise our human rights concerns directly with the Bahraini authorities at every opportunity. When I met the Bahraini Foreign Minister in New York last month I made a point of raising the human rights situation directly with him, expressing the hope that we can have an open and honest discussion on these issues. In addition, officials from my Department meet regularly with advocacy groups and Bahraini human rights defenders to discuss the situation in Bahrain. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to monitor developments in Bahrain, and to call on the Bahraini Government to deliver on its stated commitment to make progress in relation to human rights.\u00a0We shall do so both directly with Bahraini officials, as well as at EU and international level, including at the Human Rights Council, whenever opportunities arise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500061#WRD07200","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":216,"content":"<p>Question No. 126 answered with Question No. 113.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Finance","counter":219,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500062#WRE00300"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"NAMA Portfolio","counter":218,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500062#WRE00200"},{"type":"question","counter":219,"qnumday":127,"qnumall":"[41863\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500062#WRE00300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the buildings owned by NAMA in Newbridge, County Kildare; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1257","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":220,"content":"<p>As the Deputy may be aware, NAMA does not own property, rather NAMA has acquired loans for which properties act as security.

However, the Central Statistics Office, does  track the cost of insurance to consumers as part of the Consumer Price Index (CPI).  <\/p><p>My officials advise me that the CPI statistics include price indices for certain types of insurance, such as health insurance, insurance related to a dwelling (property insurance), and motor insurance.  They would note however that it would be difficult to determine a meaningful figure for the increase or decrease in overall insurance costs as each type of insurance may not necessarily reflect an overall average figure.  However, with regard to the types of insurance with which I have policy responsibility for, I understand that the overall increase as per CSO data over the period requested for motor insurance is approximately 22.5% and for property insurance is approximately 19%.  The Deputy will appreciate that for motor insurance, this doesn&rsquo;t reflect the fact that prices fell in the early part of the decade, increased substantially between 2013 and 2016, and have since fallen 24% from their peak.  With regard to the figures for motor insurance between 2018 and 2019, the cost of motor insurance has decreased by 8.3% and the cost of property insurance has increased by 2.6%.  I would note however that insurance costs to businesses are not tracked through the CPI index therefore it is not possible to provide information on employer and public liability insurance.  <\/p><p>Notwithstanding the limitations of the figures above, it is widely recognised that there have been issues around the cost and availability of insurance in more recent years, particularly with regard to motor, and employer and public liability insurance.  This is why the Government established the Cost of Insurance Working Group in 2016.  It has produced two reports, the <i>Cost of Motor Insurance Report<\/i>and the <i>Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance Report,<\/i>and is continuing to work to implement the recommendations of each report.  Its most recent Progress Update was published in July and shows that the vast majority of recommendations and actions due by Q2 2019 have been completed. Going forward, there are some further measures that will be carried out by Government over the next few months and into 2020.  These include the following:<\/p><p>- Commencement of the remaining parts of the <i>Judicial Council Act 2019<\/i>, which provides for the establishment of a Personal Injuries Guidelines Committee.  It is now matter for the Judiciary to put in place the Judicial Council and to operationalise the Personal Injuries Guidelines Committee, which will introduce new guidelines to replace the Book of Quantum; this is an essential step if award levels are to be reduced.<\/p><p>- The completion of the Central Bank&rsquo;s feasibility study into adding Employer and Public Liability insurance to the National Claims Information Database (NCID). In addition, the first report of the NCID, on motor insurance, is due by the end of the year;<\/p><p>- The completion of the CSO&rsquo;s feasibility study into tracking the cost of business insurance, as it does with other forms of insurance including motor. The CSO is due to report back to my Department by the end of the year;<\/p><p>- The Law Reform Commission&rsquo;s work to undertake a detailed analysis of the possibility of developing constitutionally sound legislation to delimit or cap the amounts of damages which a court may award in respect of some or all categories of personal injuries. It is expected that there will be a public consultation on this by the end of the year; and,<\/p><p>- The furtherance of measures necessary to implement Pre-Action Protocols (PAPs) for personal injury cases, beginning with medical negligence cases.<\/p><p>Finally, as mentioned above in the context of the commencement of the <i>Judicial Council Act 2019<\/i>, it is recognised that the single most essential challenge to be addressed, if we are to overcome issues regarding the cost and availability of insurance, is a sustainable reduction in insurance costs, in particular award levels.  In this regard, this Act provides for the establishment of a Personal Injuries Guidelines Committee upon the formal establishment of the Judicial Council.  This Committee is tasked with introducing new guidelines to replace the Book of Quantum.  While the Government cannot interfere in their deliberations, I would hope that the Judiciary will recognise the importance of this issue and prioritise it accordingly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500062#WRE01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Carbon Tax Implementation","counter":227,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500062#WRE01100"},{"type":"question","counter":228,"qnumday":130,"qnumall":"[42290\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500062#WRE01200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the impact assessments his Department has carried out regarding increased carbon taxes; and his views on the various NGO reports that estimate that those least well off in society are the most impacted by carbon taxes such as the one introduced in budget 2020.","asker":"1291","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":229,"content":"<p>As part of a joint research programme between the Department of Finance, the Revenue Commissioners and the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI), the ESRI published research on the impacts of increases in the carbon tax, including distributional impacts.

The work is being divided across two Pillars &ndash; Pillar One and Pillar Two.  <\/p><p>I understand that the deputy is referring to the public consultation document published on 9 October in respect of the &lsquo;Pillar One&rsquo; proposals. The consultation paper outlines a proposed &lsquo;Unified Approached&rdquo; developed by the OECD Secretariat after continuous consultation with countries.<\/p><p>The work under &lsquo;Pillar One&rsquo; focuses on the distribution of taxing rights in respect of highly digitalised activities and seeks to undertake a coherent review of the profit allocation and nexus rules used in the existing international tax framework.  There has been three differing proposals under discussion and this unified approach is an attempt to find consensus based on the common features of those proposals.  <\/p><p>The unified approach is an OECD Secretariat proposal to allow for discussion and to form the basis for future negotiation between countries. The unified approach has been referred to by the OECD as &ldquo;<i>sketching the first draft of an architecture<\/i>&rdquo; of an eventual solution. While the unified approach represents an advancement of the Pillar One proposals, there are significant remaining questions and a huge amount of technical consideration and discussion is still needed. <\/p><p>The detail of the proposal is set out in the OECD public consultation document which is available at:  <\/p><p>In summary, the OECD document proposes creating a new taxable nexus for certain highly digitalised consumer facing businesses and rules for calculating how much profit should be considered to relate to this new nexus.  At the same time, the approach largely retains the current transfer pricing rules based on the arm&rsquo;s length principle but complements them with new solutions in areas where tensions in the current system are the highest.<\/p><p>The proposal also seeks to increase tax certainty for taxpayers and tax administrations by agreeing rules on how the tax due in respect of marketing and distribution functions should be calculated.  <\/p><p>At this early stage it is not possible to estimate the potential impact in monetary terms of the implementation of any outcome which may eventually be agreed at the OECD.  Technical working parties at the OECD are examining the various issues in detail and no decisions have yet been made. Work on estimating any potential impact is underway by my Department and the Revenue Commissioners and this work will continue to evolve as the proposal develops. Currently however there is insufficient clarity to properly assess the potential impact on tax revenues of any of the proposals under discussion at the OECD. Ultimately any monetary impact will depend on the detail of whatever is actually agreed globally.<\/p><p>Regarding the issue of whether all countries must sign up to the proposal, the OECD operates on the basis of consensus.  It is hoped and envisaged that a consensual agreement is reached that all members of the BEPS Inclusive Framework will sign up to.  Where all countries do not sign up to a final proposal, this may damage the effectiveness of any agreement, and may result in further fragmentation to the international tax system with the potential for double taxation. <\/p><p>Ultimately, any changes will also need to be implemented by countries for them to be effective, either through domestic law changes or via multilateral instruments similar to the OECD BEPS Multilateral Instrument.<\/p><p>In terms of timelines, the OECD&rsquo;s ambition is to seek political agreement during 2020 although further technical work and work in respect of implementation is likely to continue over a longer period. <\/p><p>A further public consultation will be launched on the separate 'Pillar Two proposals' in mid-November.  <\/p><p>Ireland recognises that further change to the international tax framework is necessary to ensure that we reach a stable global consensus for how and where companies should be taxed.  A certain, stable, and globally agreed international tax framework is vital to facilitate cross border trade and investment.  We remain convinced that the OECD BEPS Inclusive Framework is the correct forum for this work to be carried out. There are a variety of views at the OECD table and the eventual outcome of the work will need to strike a balance to reflect these differing perspectives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500062#WRE02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Exemptions","counter":238,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500062#WRE02200"},{"type":"question","counter":239,"qnumday":133,"qnumall":"[41613\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500062#WRE02300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if exemptions can be made in the case of a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":240,"content":"<p>I am advised by Revenue that two specific reliefs are provided for in section 134(1), Finance Act 1992 in respect of persons transferring their residence to the State and transferring a business into the State.

This assessment will in many cases include insurers own presumptions based on their private modelling and research. Consequently, neither I, as Minister for Finance, nor the Central Bank can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products or have the power to direct insurance companies to provide flood cover to specific individuals or businesses. This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance (Solvency II Directive) which expressly prohibits Member States from doing so.<\/p>  <p>  Having said that, I am conscious of the difficulties that the absence or withdrawal of flood insurance cover can cause to homeowners and businesses, and that is one of the reasons the Government has been prioritising investment in flood defences over the last number of years.<\/p>  <p>  In May last year, the OPW completed the most extensive and comprehensive study on flood risk through the National Catchment-based Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) Programme which identified the flooding risk to 300 communities. The Flood Risk Management Plans prepared under the CFRAM Programme identify 118 flood relief schemes in addition to the 35 flood relief projects that are already in design and development under the existing capital programme. I have been informed by the OPW that Flood Relief Works have already been completed in a number of areas in Limerick City, including Clancy&rsquo;s Stand and Harry&rsquo;s Mall (mid 2000&rsquo;s) and Howley&rsquo;s Quay (2012).<\/p>  <p>  Current government policy in relation to increasing flood insurance coverage is focused on the development of a sustainable, planned and risk-based approach to managing flooding problems. This it believes should in turn lead to the increased availability of flood insurance. To achieve this aim there is a focus on:<\/p>  <p>  - prioritising spending on flood relief measures by the Office of Public Works (OPW) and relevant local authorities,  <\/p>  <p>  - implementation of flood relief management plans by the OPW to implement flood relief schemes, and   <\/p>  <p>  - maintaining channels of communication between the OPW and the insurance industry, in order to reach a better understanding about the provision of flood cover in marginal areas.  <\/p>  <p>  This commitment is underpinned by a significant capital works investment programme to be delivered by the OPW and Local Authorities, and complemented by a Memorandum of Understanding between the OPW and Insurance Ireland, which provides for the exchange of data in relation to completed flood defence schemes. <\/p>  <p>  The nature of this arrangement is that, overall, there has been an increase in the provision of flood insurance cover observed in areas protected by these schemes over the period 2015 to 2019, according to Insurance Ireland Flood Survey Results. It should be noted that my Department is continuing to actively examine what can be done to increase the level of cover in areas with demountable defences.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of the use of flood maps and insurance provision, flood maps are community based maps and provide a useful resource for planning and cannot be used for commercial purposes. The Disclaimer and Conditions for Use of OPW Flood Maps on floodinfo.ie includes a provision that users of the website must not use the flood maps, or any other content of the website, for commercial purposes. It should be noted that the insurance industry has informed OPW that it uses its own flood modelling tools for assessing the level of risk that it is willing to underwrite in relation to individual properties, and does not use the OPW Flood Maps to inform its flood modelling.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, you should be aware that a consumer can make a complaint to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman in relation to any dealings with a Financial Services or Insurance provider during which they feel they have been unfairly treated. In addition, individuals who are experiencing difficulty in obtaining flood insurance or believe that they are being treated unfairly may contact Insurance Ireland which operates a free Insurance Information Service for those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in relation to insurance ((01 676 1914 or feedback@insuranceireland.eu).  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500062#WRE03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Insurance Costs","counter":249,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500062#WRE03500"},{"type":"question","counter":250,"qnumday":138,"qnumall":"[41782\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500062#WRE03600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of businesses impacted by increased employer and public liability insurance; the estimated proportion that could be forced out of business as a result of increased insurance costs over the next couple of years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1313","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":251,"content":"<p>At the outset, it is important to note that as Minister for Finance, I am responsible for the development of the legal framework governing financial regulation and my Department does not collect the type of information being sought by the Deputy. I understand that the Central Bank does not collect such information either.  Therefore, I am unable to provide the Deputy with information on the number of businesses impacted by increased employer and public liability insurance costs, or the number that might be expected to be effected by such increased insurance costs in the next couple of years.  <\/p><p>Notwithstanding this, I am very much aware that there are certain businesses that are having difficulties arising from either the affordability or even the availability of insurance, particularly in specific sectors such as leisure, hospitality and recreation. In this regard, the work of the Cost of Insurance Working Group (CIWG), particularly its <i>Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance Report <\/i>highlights these difficulties. Therefore, there is a clear understanding of the impact of this problem on businesses across the country.  <\/p><p>Unfortunately, neither I, nor the Central Bank of Ireland, have any direct role over the pricing of insurance products.  This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance, which expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules, which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products. A further constraint is the fact that, for constitutional reasons, the Government cannot direct the courts as to the award levels that should be applied.<\/p><p>The Deputy should note however that through the work of the CIWG, there is a recognition that the single most essential challenge which must be addressed if we are to overcome the current cost and availability problems is to provide for a sustainable reduction in insurance costs. <\/p><p>In this regard, the establishment of the Personal Injuries Commission (PIC) and the publication of its two reports, which included a benchmarking of award levels between Ireland and other jurisdictions for the first time has been very helpful in identifying the scale of the problem that is faced.  This research showed that award levels for soft tissue injuries in Ireland were 4.4 times higher than in England and Wales.  The PIC recommended that a Judicial Council be established and that it should compile guidelines for appropriate general damages for various types of personal injury. In carrying out this exercise, the PIC believes that the Judiciary will take account of the jurisprudence of the Court of Appeal, the results of its benchmarking exercise, etc.<\/p><p>As the Deputy is aware, the Government with the support of all parties in the Oireachtas prioritised the passing of the <i>Judicial Council Act 2019. <\/i>This Act provides for the establishment of a Personal Injuries Guidelines Committee upon the formal establishment of the Judicial Council.  This Committee is tasked with introducing new guidelines to replace the Book of Quantum.  While the Government cannot interfere in their deliberations, I would hope that the Judiciary will recognise the importance of this issue and prioritise it accordingly.<\/p><p>Other steps taken to date to address the cost of insurance include the following: <\/p><p>- The establishment of the National Claims Information Database in the Central Bank to increase transparency around the future cost of private motor insurance.  The Central Bank is due to make its first report by the end of 2019, and will make recommendations to me regarding potentially expanding the scope of the Database to include employer and public liability insurance.  I would also note that the CSO is due to report to the CIWG shortly on a final view as regards the feasibility of tracking insurance prices for businesses, following completion of a pilot project it has been conducting on the same;<\/p><p>- Reforms to the Personal Injuries Assessment Board through the <i>Personal Injuries Assessment Board (Amendment) Act 2019<\/i>to strengthen the powers of PIAB around compliance with its procedures;<\/p><p>- Commencement of the amendments to Sections 8 and 14 of the <i>Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004<\/i>to align the timeframes by which claims should be notified to businesses with GDPR time limits on the keeping of CCTV footage to make it easier for businesses and insurers to challenge cases where fraud or exaggeration is suspected;<\/p><p>- The reform of the Insurance Compensation Fund to provide certainty to policyholders and insurers, resulting from the failure of Setanta Insurance; <\/p><p>- Various reforms of how fraud is reported to and dealt with by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including increased co-ordination with the insurance industry, as well as the recent decision by the Garda Commissioner to develop a divisional focus on insurance fraud which will be guided by the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau (GNECB) which will also train Garda&iacute; all over the country on investigating insurance fraud, and the recent success under Operation Coatee, which targets insurance-related criminality, and;<\/p><p>- The commencement and prioritisation by the Law Reform Commission (LRC) of its work to undertake a detailed analysis of the possibility of developing constitutionally sound legislation to delimit or cap the amounts of damages which a court may award in respect of some or all categories of personal injuries, as part of its Fifth Programme of Law Reform.<\/p><p>I believe that these reforms are having a significant impact with regard to private motor insurance (CSO figures from September 2019 show that the price of motor insurance is now 24% lower than the July 2016 peak).  The Government is determined to continue working to ensure that these positive pricing trends can be extended to other forms of insurance, particularly those relevant to businesses.<\/p><p>In conclusion, I would like to assure the Deputy that important reforms are taking place and that I am confident that if the level of awards are reduced as a result of the Personal Injuries Guidelines Committee, then the insurance premium and coverage issues that are being experienced by certain businesses should recede.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500062#WRE03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Civil Service Staff Data","counter":252,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500062#WRE03800"},{"type":"question","counter":253,"qnumday":139,"qnumall":"[41818\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500062#WRE03900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of full-time and part-time civil servants his Department has recruited by grade in each of the years 2014 to 2018 and to date in 2019; the number of full-time and part-time civil servants his Department has lost due to retirement by grade in the same period; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1226","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":254,"content":"<p>I wish to inform the Deputy that the number of full-time and part-time civil servants the Department of Finance has recruited by grade in each of the years 2014 to 2018 and to date in 2019; the number of full-time and part-time civil servants the Department of Finance has lost due to retirement by grade in the same period is outlined in the attached document. <\/p><p>  \">Recruitment<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500062#WRE04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Data","counter":255,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500062#WRE04100"},{"type":"question","counter":256,"qnumday":140,"qnumall":"[41835\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500062#WRE04200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the estimated amount it would cost to scrap the 50 cent stamp duty per cheque or bills of exchange; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1227","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":257,"content":"<p>I am advised by Revenue that the Stamp Duty charge on cheque payments in 2018 amounted to almost &euro;13 million.<\/p><p>Revenue has also confirmed that the annual cost to the Exchequer would be broadly similar if the charge was abolished. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500062#WRE04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Universal Social Charge Application","counter":258,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500062#WRE04400"},{"type":"question","counter":259,"qnumday":141,"qnumall":"[41839\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500062#WRE04500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the reason a person (details supplied) did not qualify for the USC charge reduction in 2019.","asker":"1250","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":260,"content":"<p>Section 531AN of the Taxes Consolidation Act (TCA) 1997 provides for a reduced Universal Social Charge (USC) rate of 2% on all income above &euro;12,012, where a person&rsquo;s total income in a year does not exceed &euro;60,000 and where the person is aged 70 or over or holds a full medical card.

These rules were strengthened following the crisis, including through the Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance, which was approved by referendum in Ireland in May 2012.  <\/p><p>Of course, no set of rules is perfect and on Budget Day, my Department published a scoping paper entitled <i>Addressing Fiscal Vulnerabilities. <\/i>Amongst other things, this paper identifies and outlines vulnerabilities arising from the &lsquo;one-size-fits-all&rsquo; approach taken by the European fiscal framework. From an Irish perspective, the fact that the rules are formulated in GDP terms is increasingly problematic. As my Department has outlined on many occasions, GDP overstates the &lsquo;true&rsquo; size of the Irish economy and, as such, ratios expressed as a share of GDP give a misleading picture. <\/p><p>In addition, the calculation of adherence to the MTO remains troublesome. This requires estimates of the structural budget balance: the headline balance adjusted for the impact of the economic cycle (cyclical component) and excluding temporary measures. The cyclical component, in turn, requires an estimate of the output gap - an unobserved variable that is calculated using a harmonised, one-size-fits-all approach which does not sit well with the Irish economy. The difficulties inherent in the structural balance are well understood in the EU. In many senses, some of these complexities are a necessary evil, as to promote counter cyclical policies, estimates of the cyclical position of the economy are needed. However, Ireland is more affected than most by these issues given the unique aspects of our economy.<\/p><p>These issues notwithstanding, I am encouraged by recent discussions regarding the fiscal rules at EU level. In particular, I support efforts to increase the transparency, predictability and simplicity of the rules. I, along with my officials, will continue to engage in these talks. That said, I do accept that there are difficult trade-offs involved. This means that finding agreement may be challenging. As such, we must continue to consider the domestic application of the existing fiscal rules. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500062#WRE05500","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Carbon Tax Implementation","counter":270,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500062#WRE05600"},{"type":"question","counter":271,"qnumday":145,"qnumall":"[42021\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500062#WRE05700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if the increase in the carbon tax immediately applies to white diesel, green diesel and kerosene; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1341","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":272,"content":"<p>The increase in carbon tax applied to auto diesel and petrol from midnight on Budget night.

All other MOT rates remain at their current levels until 1 May 2020 when new rates will take effect subject to the enactment of the Finance Bill 2019.   <\/p>  <p>  The current rate of MOT for marked gas oil (MGO), also referred to as &ldquo;green agricultural diesel&rdquo;, is &euro;102.28 per 1,000 litres, comprised of a carbon charge component of &euro;54.92 and a non-carbon charge component of &euro;47.36 per 1,000 litres.  These rates did not increase from Budget night. From 1 May 2020 the MOT rate for MGO will be &euro;117.78 per 1,000 litres, arising from the increase of the carbon component from &euro;54.92 to &euro;70.42; the non-carbon component will not change from its current level of &euro;47.36 per 1,000 litres. <\/p>  <p>  When carbon tax was increased in Budget 2012, provision was made for a tax relief for farmers to compensate them for the increase. The statutory basis for the tax relief is section 664A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997. It is available to individuals and companies that carry on a trade of farming and are entitled to claim an income tax or corporation tax deduction in respect of farm diesel.   <\/p>  <p>  Section 664A provides that a farmer may take an income tax or corporation tax deduction for farm diesel (including any carbon tax charged in respect of the diesel) and then a further deduction for farm diesel which is equal to the difference between the carbon tax charged and the carbon tax that would have been charged had it been calculated at the rate of &euro;41.30 per 1,000 litres of farm diesel (the 2012 baseline).  Revenue advise me that agricultural contractors are not entitled to this relief as they are not carrying on a trade of farming. This, they advise, is because farming, which is defined in section 654 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, requires the occupation of farm land and agricultural contracting does not involve the occupation of farm land. However, Revenue agricultural contractors who incur expenses in relation to farm diesel in the course of their trade of agricultural contracting may claim an income tax or corporation tax deduction for those expenses, including any carbon tax charged in respect of the diesel.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500062#WRE06100","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Corporation Tax Regime","counter":276,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500062#WRE06200"},{"type":"question","counter":277,"qnumday":147,"qnumall":"[42026\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500062#WRE06300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the effective rate of corporation tax that has been charged to companies here in the past year; the effective rate of corporation tax that has been charged to indigenous businesses in the past year; and the effective rate of corporation tax that has been charged to foreign direct investment companies in the past year.","asker":"1443","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":278,"content":"<p>I am aware that on the matter of the effective corporate tax rate paid by corporations in Ireland, there have been seemingly conflicting figures and methodologies used in reference to Ireland.

It establishes an equitable and progressive system of universal and income-related subsidies for children up to the age of 15, and provides an innovative and user-friendly online application process to access those subsidies.<\/p>  <p>  As part of the online application, there is a requirement to identify individuals in order for them to apply for these childcare subsidies. Government has already invested in MyGovID - a safe, secure and reusable system for online verification of individuals, and it is appropriate that MyGovID be utilised for the delivery of the scheme.<\/p>  <p>  It does not make sense for the Department of Children and Youth Affairs to develop its own electronic identity system to support its digital services.

Where we already have a suitable, reusable identification system in place for the Public Service, I will not allow taxpayers' money to be directed into the building of redundant infrastructure in this area. Importantly, the money spent on building redundant identity infrastructures, or the money spent on inefficient methods of identification for every public service transaction, is money not spent on the actual end product of the services, which, as I am sure the Deputy will agree, is what people are actually interested in and need.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Children and Youth Affairs will use MyGovID to deliver the National Childcare Scheme quicker and cheaper than it would otherwise be in a position to do so if MyGovID were not in existence. A paper based channel, which is more resource intensive and slower to set up, will open shortly afterwards as an alternative route.This is Government striving to deliver the benefits of the scheme to people as quickly and as efficiently as possible.

The CFRAM programme culminated with the launch on 3 May 2018 of 29 Flood Risk Management Plans, which proposed 118 new outline flood relief projects, on top of the 42 major projects already completed and the 33 major schemes at planning, design or construction within the existing capital works programme of the Office of Public Works (OPW). <\/p>  <p>  The flood relief schemes at Dundalk \/ Blackrock South, Drogheda, Carlingford \/ Greenore, Baltray and Ardee are in the first tranche of projects to be progressed by Louth County Council:<\/p>  <p>  - The proposed flood relief scheme at Dundalk \/ Blackrock South, Co. Louth, for which the CFRAM Programme estimated a total preliminary cost of &euro;40.54 million, would involve a series of hard defences, including flood embankments and walls, rock armour coastal protection, demountable barriers, road raising, a sluice gate and tanking of two properties, protecting 1,880 properties when completed.<\/p>  <p>  - The proposed flood relief scheme at Drogheda, Co. Louth, for which the CFRAM Programme estimated a total preliminary cost of &euro;16.83 million, would involve construction of a series of hard defences (flood embankments and walls) along the River Boyne and improvement of conveyance, hard defences and a flow diversion channel on various tributaries, protecting 381 properties when completed.<\/p>  <p>  - The proposed flood relief scheme at Carlingford and Greenore, Co. Louth, for which the CFRAM Programme estimated a total preliminary cost of &euro;23.41 million would involve construction of a series of hard defences (flood embankments and walls) and two pumping stations, protecting 409 properties when completed.<\/p>  <p>  - The proposed flood relief scheme at Ardee, Co. Louth for which the CFRAM Programme estimated a total preliminary cost of &euro;840,000 will also be progressed directly by Louth County Council with full funding from the OPW. The work proposed will involve the construction of a series of hard defences (embankments and walls) protecting 7 properties when completed. <\/p>  <p>  - There is one proposed scheme initially not included in the first tranche of implementation. The scheme at Baltray, Co. Louth at a projected cost estimate of approximately &euro;1.93 million would involve the construction of a series of hard defences (embankments and walls) protecting 73 properties when completed. However, the countywide project steering group comprising OPW and local authority representatives, has decided to progress this project simultaneously with Drogheda.<\/p>  <p>  OPW has also established Engineering Consultancy Framework Agreements, which Louth County Council will be using to procure services to progress the design, development and planning of each project and which will help to speed up the process to construction. In addition, the Council has been provided with additional staffing resources by OPW to assist in the implementation of these schemes.<\/p>  <p>  The Steering Group for flood relief schemes in County Louth has proposed the following prioritisation for progression of first tranche projects for County Louth:<\/p>  <p>1.  Dundalk\/Blackrock South and Ardee - to be progressed simultaneously.<\/p>  <p>2.  Drogheda and Baltray - to be progressed simultaneously.<\/p>  <p>3.  Carlingford\/Greenore<\/p>  <p>  The Steering Group last met on 9 October 2019 where the tender documents for the appointment of consultants for Dundalk\/Blackrock South &amp;amp; Ardee were formally signed off. Louth County Council are expected to tender for environmental and design consultants for the Dundalk\/Blackrock South and Ardee Flood Relief Schemes in the coming weeks with a proposed tender return date of January 2020. Work will commence on tender documentation for engineering consultants to progress the Drogheda and Baltray schemes shortly thereafter.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that the measures set out in the flood risk management plans are not definitive and final, and that as part of the project-level assessment required to prepare the measure for planning\/ Public Exhibition, more detailed assessments are required at a local level and further public and stakeholder consultation will be undertaken. As such, there is further scope for the community's views to influence the measures that are progressed to implementation.<\/p>  <p>  In County Meath, the proposed flood relief scheme at Mornington, with an estimated cost of approximately &euro;530,000, will be progressed directly by Meath County Council with full funding from the OPW. The work proposed will involve the construction of a series of hard defences (embankments and walls) protecting 51 properties when completed. <\/p>  <p>  Once consultants are appointed to progress each scheme, consultation with statutory and non-statutory bodies, as well as the general public, will take place at the appropriate stages to ensure that all parties have the opportunity to input into the development of the proposals within the scheme. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500063#WRF02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1363"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Office of Public Works Projects","counter":317,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500063#WRF02800"},{"type":"question","counter":318,"qnumday":162,"qnumall":"[41720\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500063#WRF02900","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the status regarding extra costs submitted by a contractor associated with the Kevin Street Garda divisional headquarters to the Office of Public Works; if he will provide the sum associated with the additional costs; if the OPW are disputing the bill in its entirety; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1226","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":319,"content":"<p>The issues under dispute between the Office of Public Works and the Contractor have been referred by the contractor for conciliation under the dispute resolution procedures provided for in the Public Works Contract.

Under the legislation each school is required to prepare, publish and implement a Student and Parent Charter in accordance with national guidelines to be published by the Minister after consultation with the education partners. <\/p>  <p>  Decisions regarding the use and deployment of digital technology in schools is a matter for the Board of Management of each school. Circular 0038\/2018, which issued to all schools last year, requires schools to consult with teachers, student and parents in the development of policy around the use of digital devices in school. This consultation requirement will be underpinned in law once the Parents and Students Charter Bill is enacted.  <\/p>  <p>  It is important for schools, in conjunction with parents to retain local autonomy for decisions on the use of digital technology, including tablet devices, laptops, and learning platforms and how to manage their integration into classroom practice based on their own particular context and needs.<\/p>  <p>  While recognising the potential benefits associated with the use of digital technology, to enhance teaching and learning, as set out in the Digital Strategy for Schools, it is also very important that we continue to work together to raise awareness to the risks and provide support to teachers, students and parents in developing their awareness to combat any risks associated with the use of the internet.<\/p>  <p>  The Digital Learning Framework, which is in its second year of dissemination to schools, provides clarity for school leaders and education providers on how to create a shared vision for the effective use of digital technologies in teaching and learning. The dissemination of the Framework is accompanied by an extensive CPD programme provided by my Department&rsquo;s teacher support service, the PDST. This includes guidance for schools on how to develop a digital learning plan and complements School Self Evaluation planning processes. <\/p>  <p>  The Professional Development Service for Teachers (PDST) and its Technology in Education team offers advice to schools on the use of digital technology in education with wide range of information available on its website on the use of devices and offers  support to schools on teaching, learning and assessment, to facilitate students' active learning and collaboration. Specific items for consideration including software and hardware requirements, purchasing regulations, are addressed in this support information.<\/p>  <p>  As regards online safety, there are extensive training and curricular supports available, including through the Social Personal Health Education (SPHE) curriculum and the Framework for Junior Cycle and the Webwise Programme to assist schools in the development of policies and practices on the safe use of the internet and to promote students&rsquo; mental, emotional, social and physical wellbeing.  This includes supports on the development of an Accepted Usage Policy (AUP) in schools and on prevention of bullying and harassment using the internet. The Webwise Team have developed (and consistently update) a Teachers Hub; A Parents Hub and a Youth Hub which includes resources to tackle issues such as cyberbullying, image sharing and online coercion and extortion. Its most recent resource HTLM Heroes is targeted at primary school children and was developed to assist and support educators when teaching students about the safe and responsible uses of the internet. HTML Heroes will be taught as part of Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) curriculum.<\/p>  <p>  The Action Plan on Bullying sets out my Department's approach to tackling bullying in schools. These actions focus on support for schools, teacher training, research and awareness raising and aim to ensure that all forms of bullying, including cyberbullying, are addressed. As part of the implementation of the Action Plan the National Anti-Bullying Procedures for Primary and Post Primary school, were published and are being implemented by all primary and post primary schools in the country. Under the procedures the prevention of bullying must be an integral part of the written anti-bullying policy of every school and must outline the specific education and prevention strategies to be implemented by the school.  This must include documenting the measures being taken by the school to explicitly address the issues of cyber-bullying as well as other explicit forms of bullying.<\/p>  <p>  Arising from the Action Plan my Department also funds a number of awareness raising initiatives, including the provision of anti-bullying training for parents to enable them to assist their children when issues of bullying arise.  Funding is also provided to the National Anti-Bullying Research and Resource Centre (ABC) to carry out research into all forms of bullying and towards the ongoing maintenance and development of the national anti-bullying website www.tacklebullying.ie, which provides a single point of information and support for young people, parents and teachers affected by bullying. <\/p>  <p>  The PDST has a dedicated Health and Wellbeing team comprising 22 full time personnel. This team supports teachers and schools, through the Social Personal Health Education (SPHE) curriculum to develop and promote the personal development, health and wellbeing of the student; to create a positive school environment and culture; and to prevent and tackle bullying including online bullying and harassment.    <\/p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s Online Safety Hub, a single online access point www.gov.ie\/besafeonline provides links to a wide range of online safety resources and information for parents, teachers, young people and the general population from the six key Government Departments responsible for the implementation of the Government's Action Plan on Online Safety.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500064#WRG00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1290"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Functions","counter":370,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500064#WRG01000"},{"type":"question","counter":371,"qnumday":180,"qnumall":"[41631\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500064#WRG01100","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the position regarding the establishment of a new department of higher education and research; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1225","askee":"1290"},{"type":"speech","counter":372,"content":"<p>There are no plans to establish a new department of higher education and research.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The\u00a0importance of the higher education system\u00a0in the wider education sector, and the economy as a whole, has been underlined\u00a0through the\u00a0existence of a dedicated Minister of State for Higher Education who\u00a0has overseen a significant programme of reform to safeguard and enhance the higher education system in Ireland.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  This includes, but is not limited to delivery of the System Performance Framework for Higher Education 2018-2020;\u00a0the Technological Universities Act, 2018 which enabled the establishment of the first Technological University in January 2019;\u00a0the Qualifications and Quality Assurance (Amendment) Act, 2019 which is designed to\u00a0safeguard the integrity of the National Framework of Qualifications and the reputation of higher and further education and training in Ireland.\u00a0 This Act will also\u00a0improve standards in the international education sector in Ireland.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Senior Academic Leadership Initiative has been launched which will introduce an additional 45 senior academic leadership posts over the coming years to assist in accelerating gender balance at senior levels.

This funding and other measures are being deployed\u00a0based on our ongoing engagement with the European Commission on\u00a0the State aid framework and my Department continues to explore, through the Irish\/EU State aid Technical Group, all opportunities within existing State aid rules.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Much has been achieved by this Group to date including the Brexit Loan Scheme, the Future Growth Loan Scheme, the expansion of the Rescue and Restructuring Scheme to include Temporary Restructuring Aid and the subsequent increase in state aid flexibilities in relation to these Schemes.\u00a0 Through the Working Group, approval was received, for example, to provide support to Carbery Food Ingredients towards financing a large diversification project to mitigate the impacts of Brexit and further options, through the Agriculture state aid Guidelines, are being developed to support large food companies.\u00a0 The work of this Group is ongoing.<\/p>  <p>  Should issues arise that require an approach that does not fit within the existing State Aid rules, this will be raised as part of the Technical Working Group discussions.\u00a0 I have received assurances from Commissioner Vestager, Commissioner for Competition, that the Commission stands ready to act urgently in mitigation against the impacts on Brexit on Irish firms.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the potential for introducing an employment subsidy scheme, while this is primarily a matter for my Ministerial colleagues, in the Departments of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and Education and Skills, I know that the existing system of systematic short-time working arrangements remains in place and are being utilised by the Intreo offices countrywide. <\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, a group comprising officials from those Departments and my own Department continue to meet and are examining policy options in this space in event of a hard Brexit and an early-warning coordination process has been established for firms experiencing difficulty. \u00a0Intreo offices (under the auspices of Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection) stand ready to work with employers experiencing short term difficulties in all sectors, with the objective of keeping workers close to the labour market as viable firms adjust.\u00a0In addition, there has been strong engagement between relevant Departments regarding responses for the tourism\/hospitality and freight sectors. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  \u00a0The suite of additional supports for business announced in the Budget of up to &euro;110 million for a combination of lending and repayable grants to be available for deployment in a No Deal scenario are all designed as targeted and temporary, supporting viable but vulnerable businesses and with built in assurances to safeguard the State&rsquo;s investment.

I am pleased to say that in general there has been strong and meaningful engagement throughout 2019 from the microenterprise sector with the LEO network and in particular the LEO Brexit offering. <\/p><p>I am confident therefore that in the days and weeks ahead, the LEO network will continue its robust and meaningful engagement with its many clients and will remain an integral component in this Government&rsquo;s toolkit to prepare our microenterprise sector to face any challenge that comes its way as a result of Brexit, whatever form that may take.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500069#WRM03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff Data","counter":729,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500069#WRM03600"},{"type":"question","counter":730,"qnumday":314,"qnumall":"[41811\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500069#WRM03700","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the number of full-time and part-time civil servants her Department has recruited by grade in each of the years 2014 to 2018 and to date in 2019; the number of full-time and part-time civil servants her Department has lost due to retirement by grade in the same period; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1226","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":731,"content":"<p>Staffing resources are an ongoing priority to ensure my Department&rsquo;s continued ability to facilitate the wide mission and volume of work in a range of challenging policy areas.

There are 10 Supported Care Homes in Community Healthcare Organisation Area 5 providing accommodation and support services to older people with low to medium dependency levels.  The residents cannot be maintained independently at home, but do not yet require nursing home care.  <\/p>  <p>  The HSE acknowledges the role played by these Homes in reducing possible admission to nursing homes and I have been assured by the HSE that it is committed to ensuring Supported Care Home are supported. The HSE will provide about &euro;2.5 million in Section 39 funding this year towards the operational costs of the Homes.  <\/p>  <p>  HIQA is the independent statutory body established to register and inspect all residential homes for older people. The current regulatory regime aims to ensure the provision of high-quality, safe and effective services to people living in these centres, whether they are nursing homes providing 24-hour nursing care or supported care homes for people with lower dependencies.<\/p>  <p>  As people get older, their housing needs may change.  Earlier this year the Government published a Policy Statement &ldquo;Housing Options for our Ageing Population&rdquo; which provides a policy framework to support our ageing population through increasing the accommodation options available to them and give them meaningful choice in how and where they choose to live. It also sets out a package of key actions to assist the development of models of supported housing that promote integration between housing and health and social care services.    <\/p>  <p>  An Inter-Departmental and Inter-Agency Implementation Groups has been established to progress the programme of actions contained in the policy statement. This will assist in developing a menu of solutions which are available nationally to provide enhanced housing and support options for older people.<\/p>  <p>  The establishment of the Implementation Groups and the implementation of the policy statement are key actions in the 2019 Sl&aacute;intecare Action Plan. Many of the health related action points are influenced by and integrated with broader Sl&aacute;intecare actions.<\/p>  <p>   The level of funding available to supported care homes is being considered in the context of the HSE's National Service Plan for 2020.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500070#WRN01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1261"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":781,"content":"<p>Question No. 332 answered with Question No. 324.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Reviews","counter":782,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500070#WRN01600"},{"type":"question","counter":783,"qnumday":333,"qnumall":"[41673\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500070#WRN01700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of medical card reviews that have been carried out to date in 2019; the number that have been refused to date; and the number that have been successful to date","asker":"1302","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":784,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for attention and direct reply to the Deputy. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500070#WRN01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medicinal Products Reimbursement","counter":785,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500070#WRN01900"},{"type":"question","counter":786,"qnumday":334,"qnumall":"[41674\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500070#WRN02000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his plans or the plans of the HSE to restore allowances to a society (details supplied) that were cut during the austerity years; and his further plans to add coeliac disease to the long-term illness scheme","asker":"1302","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":787,"content":"<p>The Deputy will be aware that the HSE has statutory responsibility for decisions on pricing and reimbursement of medicinal products under the community drug schemes in accordance with the provisions of the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013. <\/p><p>In September 2012, Gluten-free products were removed from the list of GMS reimbursable items, with a number of other products.

At the end of September 2019, there were 4,130 patients on CHI&rsquo;s General Paediatric Outpatient waiting list, which is a 35% reduction when compared to the same period last year.<\/p><p>Furthermore, CHI at Connolly will provide a further 1,300 outpatient appointments between September and December 2019. CHI advise that they are currently in the process of expanding these clinics to provide a focus on the specific requirements for some patients including asthma, allergy, faltering growth and constipation. When fully operational, CHI at Connolly is expected to provide 17,000 outpatient appointments (General Paediatrics and Orthopaedic clinics) every year  <b>. <\/b><\/p><p>Management of referrals is a key enabler to reducing waiting lists, and in this regard CHI advise that they have initiated a referrals process whereby all referrals from the three children&rsquo;s hospitals are managed centrally. The group is progressing its ICT requirements to have a single Patient Administration System across all CHI sites (the three children&rsquo;s hospitals and CHI at Connolly). <\/p><p>The central referrals team, through administrative and clinical validation are ensuring that all appointment slots are used appropriately and that where appropriate, patients who do not need hospital care, are removed from the waiting list, which is assisting in the waiting list reduction.<\/p><p>Another example of innovation in referral pathways is the TORC project (Triage of Referral Clinics). This is one of a number of virtual clinics currently being held across CHI and involves the active triage of referrals, the provision of advice and commencement of treatment for patients. As a result, patients may then either not have to attend an outpatient clinic appointment or can begin their pathway of care prior to attendance. CHI advise that this has been very successful in achieving a discharge rate of up to 30% of patients contacted. In addition, patients can begin their diagnostics prior to attending an appointment which ensures the best use of resources and reduction in follow-up attendances for patients and their families. <\/p><p>CHI is continuing with a number of other initiatives including moving Dermatology referrals towards a more centralised structure together with a virtual clinic model in this specialty. <\/p><p>CHI continues to engage with the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) to secure funding for initiatives in 2019 to address access to patients for specialties including ENT, Ophthalmology, General Paediatrics, Orthopaedics and Gastroenterology. <\/p><p>CHI advises that recruitment of additional consultants for CHI specialties with the longest OPD waiting times (Allergy, Dermatology, Radiology, Gastroenterology, Rheumatology, Orthopaedics &amp;amp; ENT) is also underway following CHI securing additional National Service Plan funding in 2019. In appointing these positions, the multidisciplinary teams are also reviewing their current work practices and identifying new ways of working to ensure appropriate management of waiting lists. <\/p><p>In relation to the question raised by the deputy regarding the number of children on waiting lists for a first outpatient appointment across all specialties, the attached spreadsheet, provided by the HSE BIU, shows the breakdown by hospital in tabular form.<\/p><p>  \">OPD Waiting list<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500070#WRN02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Waiting Lists","counter":792,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500070#WRN02600"},{"type":"question","counter":793,"qnumday":336,"qnumall":"[41676\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500070#WRN02700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the one-to-five-year alternative care pathway for children with comorbidities who require and cannot access timely scoliosis care in an acute hospital setting here in view of the ongoing crisis in recruitment and retention of healthcare professionals.","asker":"1302","askee":"1251"},{"type":"question","counter":794,"qnumday":337,"qnumall":"[41677\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500070#WRN02800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his plans to allow for the outsourcing of scoliosis surgeries via the NTPF in view of the ongoing crisis in recruitment and retention of healthcare professionals and the excessive wait times for scoliosis surgery experienced by children.","asker":"1302","askee":"1251"},{"type":"question","counter":795,"qnumday":341,"qnumall":"[41681\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500070#WRN02900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of spinal monitoring surgeries that have been cancelled and rescheduled in Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland hospitals during 2018 and to date in 2019 due to a lack of access to a spinal monitoring team;

It is a type of non-Hodgkin&rsquo;s lymphoma &ndash; a cancer of the immune system.<\/p>  <p>  The Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) has been updating my Department on this matter as further research is published and as evidence continues to emerge at both a European and international level and while the risk of developing BIA-ALCL has been shown to be more common than first thought, it still remains a rare condition. <\/p>  <p>  Breast implant devices and tissue expanders can have various types of surface texturing and the risk of developing BIA ALCL appears to be related to the degree of surface texturing on the breast implant or tissue expander.  Other breast implants may have a different risk of developing BIA-ALCL. Implants with a lesser degree of surface texturing appear to have a less common association with BIA-ALCL.  A range of breast implants with different degrees of surface texturing have been used in Ireland.  <\/p>  <p>  The Health Service Executive (HSE) has decided to communicate publicly on this matter at this time in order to increase awareness of BIA ALCL, ensure that women in Ireland are fully informed on this issue and are given the appropriate advice. My Department has been working alongside the HSE in this regard. <\/p>  <p>  On October 9 2019, the HSE published an information notice on their website in relation to this matter. This notice provides further background on BIA ALCL including its relationship with textured breast implants and tissue expanders, signs and symptoms to be aware of, when to seek medical attention and further advice to women who may be affected by this issue. <\/p>  <p>  The HSE will issue letters to people who have received textured breast implants or tissue expanders during surgery in Ireland. These letters will have advice on what the individuals should do if they are concerned. The issuing of these letters by the HSE is due to commence in the coming weeks.<\/p>  <p>  The details referred to in the question relate to an article that appeared in the Irish Independent on October 5, headed &ldquo;Probe over cancer link to breast implants&rdquo;. The article wrongly referred to 14 reports of &ldquo;potential breast cancer illness&rdquo; related to breast implants having been reported to the Health Products Regulatory Authority. The paper in question subsequently issued a correction, clarifying that the Health Products Regulatory Authority had advised that it had received 14 complaints of breast implant illness.

On foot of NIAC&rsquo;s recommendation, my Department asked the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) to undertake a health technology assessment (HTA) to establish the clinical and cost-effectiveness of extending the current immunisation programme, which offers HPV vaccination to all girls in their first year of second level education (generally 12 to 13 year olds), to a programme that also offers the vaccination to boys in their first year of secondary school.<\/p>  <p>  HIQA completed the HTA in December 2018, recommending that the HPV immunisation programme be extended to include boys.  A policy decision was made to extend the HPV immunisation programme to include boys starting in September 2019 with the introduction of a 9-valent HPV vaccine.  However, the HIQA report published in December 2018 did not recommend an HPV catch-up programme for older boys for several reasons:<\/p>  <p>  - Vaccinating boys in the first year of secondary school provides the best possible protection against HPV infection;<\/p>  <p>  - Boys are already benefitting from the indirect herd protection provided by the girls' HPV vaccination programme which started in 2010.<\/p>  <p>  The ages at which vaccines are recommended in the immunisation schedule are chosen by NIAC in order to give each child the best possible protection against vaccine preventable diseases.

Therefore, the gender neutral HPV vaccination programme targets all girls and boys in first year of secondary school to provide maximum coverage.

The FSAI is the body responsible for enforcement of regulations governing traceability, labelling and provision of food information to customers.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Labelling of food is governed by the EU food legislation on the provision of Food Information to Consumers (Regulation (EU) No. 1169\/2011), which lays down strict rules on labelling of ingredients. Country of origin labelling is mandatory for certain meats and other products such as honey and wine. From 1 April 2020 it will be mandatory to indicate the country of origin of the primary ingredient (which makes up more than 50% of a food) if it is different from the country of origin of the product as a whole. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Primary responsibility under EU law for the safety and traceability of food placed on the market lies with food business operators. The role of National Competent Agencies is to verify compliance with this requirement.

These controls are applied at different stages in the food supply chain. Regulation (EC) No. 178 of 2002 sets out the general principles and requirements of EU food law and stipulates that food business operators must, at all stages of production, processing and distribution within their business, ensure food law requirements are satisfied. In regard to traceability, the regulations require that food business operators have what is\u00a0referred to as the &lsquo;one step forward, one step backward&rsquo; traceability system. There are additional requirements for certain fishery and aquaculture products under the Control Regulation (Regulation 1224\/2009 and Implementing Regulation 404\/2011) from first sale to subsequent stages of production, processing and distribution up to retail.\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  My Department has a permanent veterinary presence at all of its approved slaughter plants. Controls at plants only engaged in secondary processing are carried out at a frequency based on an annual risk assessment. An annual audit of imported products is carried out in each Department-approved plant, including checks on physical identity, labelling and documentary checks.<\/p>  <p>  Extra veterinary checks are carried out on selected consignments of foods imported into DAFM-approved establishments from other EU Member States or from Third Countries outside the EU.\u00a0 These checks include, physical checks of product condition, checks of accompanying documentation and checks of labelling and health markings.<\/p>  <p>  The import of products of animal origin from third countries is governed by a comprehensive and robust legislative framework laid down at EU level, controlled by Member States in the first instance, and audited by the European Commission&rsquo;s Directorate General for Health and Food Safety (formally the FVO), to ensure compliance with all of the relevant food safety standards. The legislation imposes health and supervisory requirements designed to ensure that imported products meet standards equivalent to those required for production and trade between Member States. Border Inspection Posts are operated by my Department. Import control procedures on products of animal and fish origin are highly prescriptive and strictly audited by the Directorate to ensure compliance. Inspection reports are published on the Directorate General for Health and Food Safety&rsquo;s website.<\/p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the controls and checks\u00a0in place and enforced by my Department ensure that Irish consumers are protected and correctly informed when they purchase and consume food products.<\/p>  <p>  The Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI) has service contracts in place with the official agencies performing official controls, to verify compliance with the extensive requirements of food labelling legislation, in these establishments.\u00a0 The FSAI reports in detail on the number of inspections and checks carried out, and non-compliance findings.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500076#WRT01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Agriculture Scheme Administration","counter":1204,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500076#WRT01200"},{"type":"question","counter":1205,"qnumday":480,"qnumall":"[42015\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500076#WRT01300","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he will consider using the &euro;22 million underspend from the BEAM scheme to compensate beef and suckler farmers for losses post 12 May 2019; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1440","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":1206,"content":"<p>The objective of the Beef Exceptional Aid Measure (BEAM) is to provide temporary exceptional adjustment aid to farmers in the beef sector in Ireland subject to the conditions set out in EU Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019\/1132.\u00a0 BEAM is funded by a combination of EU aid and Exchequer support, provided in light of the difficult circumstances that Irish beef farmers have been facing as a result of market volatility and uncertainty.<\/p>  <p>  The scheme was designed to target aid to those who had been most impacted by the market disturbance for which it was requested. <\/p>  <p>  Under the implementing regulation, Ireland may grant additional\u00a0national support\u00a0for the measures taken under Article 1 of the regulation\u00a0up to a maximum of 100% of EU funding.\u00a0Therefore, undrawn funds cannot be used for other purposes outside of the measure.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  As the scheme is voluntary, it was a\u00a0decision for individual eligible farmers as to whether to\u00a0participate or not.\u00a0 In response to requests from farm bodies, the period for receipt of applications was extended to 20 September and\u00a0there was support and advice\u00a0available to prospective applicants from\u00a0my Department\u00a0at the National Ploughing Championships.\u00a0 \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In total 34,517 applications were received, representing a potential payment of &euro;78,192,380.

There are certain minimum numbers of inspections that must take place annually under the various schemes. <\/p>  <p>  The method of selecting cases for inspection is set down in EU regulations and is undertaken by means of a risk analysis process with cases being selected on a risk and random basis.  All cases to be selected for inspection must be eligible beneficiaries under the various schemes. Therefore, the selection of cases for inspection, while commencing after the closing date for receipt of applications, i.e. 15th May, is an on-going process so as to ensure this specific regulatory requirement is adhered to.<\/p>  <p>  My Department accepted late applications up to 9th June 2019, with a penalty deduction.

The governing regulations further prescribe that where it is not possible to make an accurate determination on the eligibility of a parcel or parcels of land by means of an assessment of the available imagery, a field visit must be undertaken to verify the position on the ground. <\/p>  <p>  Some 6,840 applicants have been selected for a Remote Sensing inspection in respect of the various 2019 area-based schemes. As of 14th October, my Department had received inspections results in respect of 71% of these cases for final processing. Of these cases, over 90% have been finalised and advanced to payment stage processing, which ensures that any non-inspection related scheme criteria have been met.

It is anticipated that between 7 and 23 BCPs will be deployed in each county. BCPs will provide a community based high speed broadband service, enhancing online participation and allowing for the establishment of digital work hubs in these locations. <\/p>  <p>  The Bidder is aiming to pass 133,000 premises at the end of the second year, with 70-100,000 passed each year thereafter until roll out is completed.<\/p>  <p>  Work continues on finalising the contract and in parallel to this work, I am considering the recommendations of the Joint Oireachtas Communications Committee report which was published recently. I will bring my deliberations of the report to Government in due course.<\/p>  <p>  I note the Deputy&rsquo;s constituent&rsquo;s concerns relating to the reliability of service they have been experiencing from their provider.<\/p>  <p>  Issues relating to the provision of telecommunications services, including connection of service are, in the first instance, a matter for the relevant service provider to resolve. <\/p>  <p>  If, after having exhausted the service provider's complaint handling procedures, a customer is not happy, they may contact the independent regulator, Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg, on 1890 229 668; online at www.askcomreg.ie or by email at Consumerline@comreg.ie, for further assistance and guidance. ComReg will investigate such complaints to ensure that the companies in question are delivering services in line with its licence obligations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500077#WRU02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Environmental Policy","counter":1294,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500077#WRU03000"},{"type":"question","counter":1295,"qnumday":513,"qnumall":"[41636\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500077#WRU03100","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the progress of an announced plan to introduce a nationwide ban on single use plastics; if a policy has been developed; if so, when it will be published; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1274","askee":"1293"},{"type":"question","counter":1296,"qnumday":514,"qnumall":"[41637\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500077#WRU03200","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the specific measures contained within a plan to introduce a nationwide ban on single use plastics that are additional to measures contained within the 2018\/0172 (COD); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1274","askee":"1293"},{"type":"question","counter":1297,"qnumday":534,"qnumall":"[42293\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500077#WRU03300","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"his plans to introduce a smoky coal or single use plastic ban into the future; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1291","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":1298,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 513, 514 and 534 together.<\/p><p>We are committed to leading the way in reducing single use plastics and are working both at a national and European level to tackle the problem.

Commercially sensitive coverage data has been provided to my Department by commercial operators and this data have been anonymised to produce the NBP Map. As such, the number of premises in the dark blue area is not available by reference to each commercial operator but as an aggregated number where at least one operator and in many cases more than one operator is providing high speed broadband services. <\/p>  <p>  As a State intervention, the National Broadband Plan must comply with the requirements of the European Commission&rsquo;s Guidelines on the application of the State aid rules to broadband networks. The Guidelines require, amongst other things, that Member States carry out a detailed mapping exercise and public consultation process in particular to identify as far as reasonably possible those areas where intervention is required.<\/p>  <p>  Since July 2013, my Department has engaged in an ongoing and extensive process of mapping and monitoring of broadband availability in Ireland. This has been supported by a number of public consultations from 2014 to date. This process has included a review of operator networks in line with the assessment criteria published in 2015.<\/p>  <p>  My Department recently consulted publicly to close the ongoing mapping exercise, seeking submissions from operators who wish to have their existing high speed broadband networks or who have developed plans to invest in high speed broadband networks over the next 7 years, to be included on the Department&rsquo;s High Speed Broadband Map. The scope of this consultation included all premises currently included in the Intervention Area as well as all those premises marked as blue on the NBP map. In addition, the Department had identified approximately 46,000 premises in blue areas of the Map where high speed broadband services may not have materialised and sought information in relation to these, or other similar premises, from operators, or the public. That consultation closed on 30 September.<\/p>  <p>  As part of the consultation, over 180 submissions have been received from a variety of stakeholders, including 30 from large and small telecoms operators, with the remainder from local authority broadband officers and members of the public.<\/p>  <p>  Operator submissions will be assessed against the Department&rsquo;s published assessment criteria. Operators submitting planned investments were required to sign a declaration that they would enter into a Commitment Agreement with the Department if their plans satisfied the assessment criteria and were accepted by the Department as being concrete and credible.<\/p>  <p>  Following the conclusion of the Department&rsquo;s assessment, the non-confidential versions of all submissions will be published, as soon as possible, on the Department&rsquo;s website together with the outcome of the assessment.<\/p>  <p>  The consultation will identify where an existing high speed broadband service is available from a commercial operator along with where there are concrete plans to provide such a service. These areas will not be included in the Intervention Area. The outcome will set out the Intervention Area which National Broadband Ireland will be required to deliver as part of the NBP intervention contract. The Department is in the final stages of closing out the contract and will in due course publish a non-confidential version of the contract which sets out the relevant provisions to allow for changes to the number of premises up or down.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500077#WRU04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Inland Fisheries Ireland","counter":1304,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500077#WRU04300"},{"type":"question","counter":1305,"qnumday":518,"qnumall":"[41685\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500077#WRU04400","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 277 of 3 October 2019, if the one completed third-party project application to the midlands fisheries fund referred to is that of instream fisheries enhancement; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1333","askee":"1293"},{"type":"question","counter":1306,"qnumday":519,"qnumall":"[41686\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500077#WRU04500","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 277 of 3 October 2019, if one completed third-party project application to the midlands fisheries fund is the sum total of stakeholders applications to the midlands fund for 2019; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1333","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":1307,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 518 and 519 together.<\/p><p>I can confirm that there was one completed third party application for funding from the 2019 Midland Fisheries Fund.

Irish officials also continue to engage with their French counterparts to ensure that Irish haulers arriving in French ports, particularly Calais, via the landbridge can exit the port as efficiently as possible.<\/p>  <p>  The alternative to the landbridge is the direct shipping connections between Ireland and continental ports. <\/p>  <p>  The assessment of my Department and the Irish Maritime Development Office (IMDO), based on extensive consultations with the shipping sector, is that sufficient capacity should be available on direct routes to continental ports following a &lsquo;no-deal&rsquo; Brexit and should demand for further capacity arise, because of disruption to the GB landbridge, the shipping sector can and will respond quickly to meet such demands.<\/p>  <p>  In the context of Brexit, there has already been an additional increase in capacity over the past 18 months on direct routes with more planned for 2020. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500078#WRV02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Road Projects Status","counter":1353,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500078#WRV02700"},{"type":"question","counter":1354,"qnumday":536,"qnumall":"[42343\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500078#WRV02800","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the allocation in 2020 for the Dunkettle roundabout works; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1224","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":1355,"content":"<p>As Minister for Transport, Tourism &amp;amp; Sport, I have responsibility for overall policy and securing capital funding in relation to the national roads programme.

It also has responsibility for integrated local and rural transport, including management of Local Link services.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Public transport in rural areas of the country is primarily provided by bus and coach services,\u00a0as well as rail\u00a0and small public service vehicles (SPSV) services, which include Taxi, Hackney and Local Area Hackney services. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The bus and coach services include Public Service Obligation (PSO) services operated by Bus &Eacute;ireann and other operators, Bus &Eacute;ireann Expressway services, licensed services provided by commercial operators and Local Link services.\u00a0\u00a0These services comprise conventional fixed services with regular routes, stopping places and timetables and Demand Responsive Transport (DRT) services which respond to local demands and which constitute the majority of Local Link services.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  As I have outlined previously, I am committed to the further development of public transport in rural areas and that is why funding has been increased over the past number of years, for both PSO and Local Link services.\u00a0For example, there has been a substantial increase in funding for Local Link services since 2016, going from &euro;12.2 million in 2016 to &euro;21 million this year. This significant level of investment will continue in 2020.<\/p>  <p>  This\u00a0level of investment in\u00a0Local Link services has enabled the introduction of new regular commuter services and improvements to demand responsive services, as well as the introduction of new evening and night-time services across all counties. Key features of these\u00a0developments include greater integration with existing public transport services and better linkage of services between and within towns and villages.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In addition to its initiatives to improve\u00a0Local Link\u00a0services, the NTA has also designed initiatives to cultivate the provision of SPSV services in some rural areas. Ireland has a dispersed settlement pattern and low population densities in rural areas presents a challenge to the sustainable provision of such services. The NTA launched a new Pilot Local Area Hackney Scheme in August, seeking applications for the provision of\u00a0a local area hackney service in a number of designated areas nationwide. A Pilot Community Car Scheme is expected to be\u00a0announced later this year.<\/p>  <p>  The NTA is continually working with Bus &Eacute;ireann to provide improvements on its\u00a0PSO services, including improvements to many non-urban services. Over 100 stage carriage &amp;amp; rural routes are operated by Bus &Eacute;ireann, generally linking a series of settlements of various sizes in a particular region. The scope and scale of the changes implemented recently or planned for the remainder of 2019\/early 2020, include improvements to its city and town services and non-urban networks, including improvements to the Mullingar and Dundalk Commuter services, Ballina-Westport-Galway Corridor, Ballina-Sligo-Enniskillen Corridor, West Cork Network, Connemara Network, East and West Clare Networks, Kerry Network, Dundalk to Drogheda linking coastal villages and M11 Corridor. Network changes being implemented on stage carriage services focus on delivering enhanced frequency throughout the day with earlier\/later departures, more frequency, increased weekend services including on Sundays\/Public Holidays. <\/p>  <p>  Finally, the Programme for a Partnership Government undertakes to examine how best to improve integration of services in the rural bus network within regions. This matter is being examined and developed by my Department\u00a0in the context of the\u00a0wider work on which it\u00a0has embarked\u00a0around\u00a0a review of public transport (Sustainable Mobility) policy, which is another commitment\u00a0in the Programme for Government.\u00a0\u00a0I will be launching a public consultation shortly seeking the views of all stakeholders.

Within my Department's overall funding allocation, &euro;9m has been assigned in Budget 2020 specifically to provide for a Carbon Reduction Programme to support measures which aid in decarbonising the transport sector. From within this allocation, funding is sourced as required for Green Public Transport Fund projects.<\/p>  <p>  The Fund was envisaged to support the piloting and uptake of energy-efficient and alternatively fuelled technologies for Public Service Obligation (PSO) operations within the bus fleet and small public service vehicles (SPSV) sector, as well as bridging the price differential between such technologies and conventionally fuelled vehicles. The role of the Fund has, however, evolved in line with new policy commitments and increased climate ambition. <\/p>  <p>  Implementing our commitment under Project Ireland 2040, since this summer, Ireland is no longer buying diesel-only urban public buses. The Deputy will be aware that a decision was taken by the National Transport Authority (NTA), which is responsible for procurement of vehicles in the public bus fleets, to purchase hybrid-electric buses in the short term. Dublin Bus has now taken delivery of six electric-hybrid buses, with a further three expected to be delivered before year end, supported by the Green Public Transport Fund. In addition, the Fund was deployed earlier this year to support the Low-Emission Bus Trials, the findings of which will help inform our longer term purchasing decisions for new buses over the coming years. The Climate Action Plan sets out a clear commitment that by the end of 2020, the first one hundred low-emission buses will have entered the urban bus fleet;\u00a0I expect to deploy the Fund\u00a0to contribute towards meeting this target.<\/p>  <p>  Funding has also been targeted to support the transition of the national SPSV (taxi, hackney and limousine) fleet, where electrification presents an achievable decarbonisation pathway, to alternative technologies. I established the Electric Taxi Grant Scheme in 2018, providing grants of up to &euro;7,000 for battery electric vehicles and up to &euro;3,500 for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, in addition to the range of other incentives supporting electric vehicles. This initiative has resulted in the registration of 65 electric taxis to date and will be continued and expanded in 2020.<\/p>  <p>  It is also important to note that while the Green Public Transport Fund has an important role to play in the\u00a0transport emissions\u00a0mitigation effort, it is only one small element of a far wider range of transport measures being implemented to help reduce emissions including: the range of incentives to encourage a transition away from conventional fuels towards lower emitting alternatives, such as EVs; increasing the proportion of biofuels in the\u00a0fuel mix; improving efficiency standards for vehicles; and of course the significantly enhanced funding I am making available to support the development of new and improved public and sustainable transport infrastructure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500079#WRW02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Sports Capital Programme Applications","counter":1417,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500079#WRW02200"},{"type":"question","counter":1418,"qnumday":559,"qnumall":"[42153\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500079#WRW02300","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"when a capital grant will be approved for an organisation (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1216","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":1419,"content":"<p>The 2018 round of the Sports Capital Programme\u00a0closed\u00a0for applications on Friday 19th October last. \u00a0By that deadline, a record 2,337 applications were submitted seeking a total of &euro;162m in funding.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  186 of these applications were for projects that were deemed invalid under the 2017 round of the programme that subsequently\u00a0submitted corrected documents.\u00a0 These applications were assessed first and approximately &euro;7m in allocations to 170 projects were announced on the 17th January.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  619 equipment only applications were assessed next and\u00a0466 allocations with a value of &euro;9.8m were announced to these organisations in May.<\/p>  <p>  Work is now underway in assessing the remaining applications for capital works, including an application from the organisation referred to by the Deputy.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  For the first time, applicants who submitted incorrect documentation under this round are being\u00a0given the opportunity to correct their application\u00a0during the assessment period.

These developments include the Government's National Development Plan and National Planning Framework, jointly referred to as Project Ireland 2040, and the implications of Brexit on Ireland's international connectivity. <\/p><p>The submission highlighted in particular the potential for increased geographical isolation of Ireland&rsquo;s Western and Northwestern regions. I also pointed out that Brexit is likely to have regionally differentiated effects in Ireland and that a hard Brexit could hit Border counties particularly hard. Continued EU support for transport investment projects therefore becomes even more important in the context of Brexit, after which our peripheral location on the western point of Europe will leave us even more isolated from other EU Member States. <\/p><p>The submission also noted that the improvement of regional connectivity along the Western seaboard, linking together the major urban areas to allow the Atlantic Economic Corridor (AEC) achieve its potential, is a major priority for Government. In this regard, I highlighted the work of the AEC Taskforce, chaired by Se&aacute;n Canney TD, Minister of State for Community Development, Natural Resources and Digital Development.<\/p><p>A copy of the submission can be accessed on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following weblink: <\/p><p><i><\/i><\/p><p>Finally, EU Transport Commissioner, \u00a0Ms Violeta Bulc, wrote to EU Transport Ministers in February 2019, announcing that the European Commission is advancing the review of the TEN-T Network, which was due to take place no later than December 2023.

Details on these consultations are yet to be confirmed but they will be an opportunity to elaborate further on the issues raised in the submission and to highlight other key priorities and possible amendments to the TEN-T guidelines that would be necessary in light of relevant developments since 2013. <\/p><p>The Commission intends to present the preliminary findings of the review process in May 2020, with a more detailed document envisaged for Summer 2020.

Accessing suitably qualified staff has been particularly difficult in very recent years and is due to both poor retention rates and the massive increase in investment that has seen a doubling of the number of childcare places and a subsequent major increase in demand for early learning and care practitioners. <\/p><p>The basic qualification requirement to work in the sector is a qualification in early childhood care and education at Level 5 on the National Framework of Qualifications. When this requirement was introduced, unqualified staff who planned to retire in the coming years were given the opportunity to sign a 'grandfather' declaration. These declarations remain valid until September 2021. <\/p><p>A Level 6 qualification is only a requirement for room leaders delivering the ECCE programme. The Pobal 2017\/18 survey indicated that 65% of those working in the sector in mid-2018 then had a relevant qualification at Level 6 or above, indicating that there were enough staff qualified at this level to meet requirements. However, I acknowledge the challenge many providers are reporting in retaining staff and recruiting new staff.<\/p><p>The Department of Education and Skills has responsibility for the training and supply of the  early learning and care workforce and I understand from that Department that the numbers being trained is sufficient to meet  entry requirements. In Pobal&rsquo;s Early Years Sector Profile Report for 2017\/2018, the staff turnover rate stood at 24.7%, which, despite a 3% improvement on the previous year, was at a very high level. I understand the 2018 \/ 2019 report will show a further small improvement. The primary issue that needs to be resolved is one of retention. <\/p><p>I believe that the key to addressing this challenge is undoubtedly improving wages and working conditions. Over the last 5 budgets, the level of public investment in early learning and care and school-age childcare has increased be an unprecedented 138%. We need to keep increasing the level of public investment if we are to secure services that are of high quality, affordable and accessible. However, increased investment by itself will not ensure that staff wages and conditions will improve.<\/p><p>I am doing all that is in my power to improve wages and working conditions in the sector. As well as increased investment generally, I have specifically targeted funding directly to providers, for example, a 7% increase in ECCE capitation in September 2017, &euro;19.4m annually of Programme Support Payments to providers to recognise their administration duties, Higher Capitation payments to ECCE services employing graduates. Also, I have repeatedly called for the sector to pursue a Sectoral Employment Order, which offers a viable mechanism to establish appropriate wage-levels. My Department will readily co-operate with such a process when it is under way.<\/p><p>In First 5, the Whole of Government Strategy I launched with the Taoiseach last November, I made a commitment to develop a new funding model that will leverage additional investment for certain criteria, for example, better pay, or full implementation of the curriculum. First 5<i><\/i>also includes a commitment to develop a Workforce Development Plan for the sector. My Department began work on the Workforce Development Plan earlier this year, and an initial public consultation will take place in the coming weeks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500080#WRX00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff Data","counter":1464,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500080#WRX00500"},{"type":"question","counter":1465,"qnumday":578,"qnumall":"[41812\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500080#WRX00600","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the number of full-time and part-time civil servants her Department has recruited by grade in each of the years 2014 to 2018 and to date in 2019; the number of full-time and part-time civil servants her Department has lost due to retirement by grade in the same period; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1226","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":1466,"content":"<p>The details of the number of full-time and part-time civil servants recruited by grade in each of the years 2014 to 2018 and to date in 2019 in my department are listed in Table 1.1.<\/p><p><b>Table 1.1<\/b><table><tr><th>Grade<\/th><th>2014<\/th><th>2015<\/th><th>2016<\/th><th>2017<\/th><th>2018<\/th><th>2019 (to date)<\/th><th>Total<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>SEC<\/td><td><\/td><td>1<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td>1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>ASC<\/td><td><\/td><td>1<\/td><td>1<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td>2<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>PO<\/td><td>5<\/td><td><\/td><td>5<\/td><td><\/td><td>5<\/td><td>4<\/td><td>19<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>AP<\/td><td>3<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>11<\/td><td>13<\/td><td>11<\/td><td>48<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>HEO<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>11<\/td><td>6<\/td><td><\/td><td>22<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>AO<\/td><td>5<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>7<\/td><td>6<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>3<\/td><td>30<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>EO<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>12<\/td><td>14<\/td><td>16<\/td><td>12<\/td><td>56<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>CO<\/td><td>19<\/td><td>17<\/td><td>33<\/td><td>31<\/td><td>13<\/td><td>6<\/td><td>119<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>SVO<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td>1<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td>1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Total<\/td><td>35<\/td><td>24<\/td><td>69<\/td><td>73<\/td><td>61<\/td><td>36<\/td><td>298<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>The details of the number of full-time and part-time civil servants lost due to retirement by grade in each of the years 2014 to 2018 and to date in 2019 in my department are listed in Table 1.2.<\/p><p><b>Table 1.2<\/b><table><tr><th>Grade<\/th><th>2014<\/th><th>2015<\/th><th>2016<\/th><th>2017<\/th><th>2018<\/th><th>2019 (to date)<\/th><th>Total<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>PO<\/td><td><\/td><td>3<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>8<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>AP<\/td><td><\/td><td>1<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td>1<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>3<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>HEO<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>1<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td>4<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>AO<\/td><td><\/td><td>2<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td>2<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>EO<\/td><td>1<\/td><td><\/td><td>1<\/td><td>2<\/td><td><\/td><td>2<\/td><td>6<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>CO<\/td><td><\/td><td>2<\/td><td>5<\/td><td><\/td><td>2<\/td><td><\/td><td>9<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Total<\/td><td>3<\/td><td>9<\/td><td>9<\/td><td>3<\/td><td>4<\/td><td>4<\/td><td>32<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500080#WRX00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Early Childhood Care and Education Programmes","counter":1467,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500080#WRX00800"},{"type":"question","counter":1468,"qnumday":579,"qnumall":"[41841\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500080#WRX00900","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the reason a child (details supplied) cannot avail of a second free preschool year.","asker":"1250","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":1469,"content":"<p>The Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme is a universal programme available to all children within the eligible age range.

The Scheme was an innovative response to facilitating the development and maintenance of 39 of Ireland&rsquo;s key walking trails. The Scheme includes 1,962 landholders as key participants in the provision of high quality walking trails by contracting them to undertake maintenance work on sections of National Waymarked Ways and other priority walks that traverse their lands. The landholders receive modest payments for maintenance work undertaken in line with agreed work plans.  These trails are part of a larger list of trails which are registered by Sport Ireland which comes under the remit of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.<\/p><p>The table lists the walking trails currently on the Walks Scheme and the length of each trail. The length refers to the full distance of the trail and not just the portion maintained by the landholders under the scheme.  It should be noted that some walks cross Local Authority boundaries and the relevant portion of the walk is recorded under each of the respective county headings.  There are, therefore, more than 39 individual section of walks listed below.<\/p><p>The Programme for a Partnership Government includes a commitment to increase the number of trails covered by the Walks Scheme.  In line with these commitments, funding for the scheme was doubled in Budget 2019 - from &euro;2 million to &euro;4 million - to allow this expansion to proceed. <\/p><p>In February of this year, I invited Expressions of Interest for the inclusion of additional trails in the scheme that meet specific qualifying criteria.  These include the walks meeting a sufficient standard to be included on Sport Ireland Trails register.  To date, 18 Local Development Companies have submitted 57 Expressions of Interest to my Department.<\/p><p>These Expressions of Interest are being reviewed and I expect to be in a position to announce the first tranche of trails to be added to the scheme shortly. There is no closing date for Expressions of Interest at this time, and interested parties can continue submit proposals for additional trails to be included in the Walks Scheme through their Local Authority or Local Development Company. <table><tr><th>WALK<\/th><th>LOCATION<\/th><th>Length of Walk in Km<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Burren Way<\/td><td>CLARE<\/td><td>40.21<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Wood Loop Ballyvaughan<\/td><td>CLARE<\/td><td>1.89<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Black Head Loop<\/td><td>CLARE<\/td><td>12.01<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cliffs of Moher <\/td><td>CLARE<\/td><td>12.00<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Sheeps Head Way<\/td><td>CORK<\/td><td>125.59<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Beara Islands<\/td><td>CORK<\/td><td>26.93<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Beara Cork<\/td><td>CORK<\/td><td>101.20<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Duhallow Way<\/td><td>CORK<\/td><td>43.00<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Whiddy Island Walk<\/td><td>CORK<\/td><td>1.86<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Bluestack Way<\/td><td>DONEGAL<\/td><td>64.00<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Sliabh Liag<\/td><td>DONEGAL<\/td><td>3.90<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Sl&iacute;

Illness Benefit is a payment\u00a0made to insured people who are unable to work due to illness and who\u00a0satisfy certain PRSI contribution conditions. To qualify for Illness Benefit a person must be unable to work due to illness, under the\u00a0pensionable age and satisfy contribution conditions.<\/p><p>2. Invalidity Pension is a pension paid to people who are permanently incapable of work because of illness. \u00a0It is based on a claimant's social\u00a0insurance contributions and is not means tested.\u00a0 To qualify for award of Invalidity Pension a claimant must satisfy both PRSI contribution and medical\u00a0conditions.<\/p><p>Subject to certain conditions persons in receipt of IB and IP may apply for Partial Capacity Benefit (PCB).\u00a0 IB and IP are the only primary\u00a0income support payments from which a person may request to move to a PCB payment.<\/p><p>The PCB scheme seeks to extend the welfare system by responding to individual situations where a person in receipt of IB or IP retains some capacity for, and wishes to, undertake some work in the open labour market - while also continuing to require income support from the State.\u00a0 The objective of the scheme is therefore to support such persons to return to the workplace without fear of the loss of their income support.\u00a0 The level of income support provided where a person moves on to PCB is based on a medical assessment of a person&rsquo;s restriction, regarding their\u00a0capacity for work.<\/p><p>It is important to note in relation to PCB that:<\/p><p>- participation\u00a0is voluntary.<\/p><p>- a person who participates on\u00a0the PCB scheme may return to an Illness Benefit or Invalidity Pension\u00a0payment if, for\u00a0example, the employment ceases or if the person cannot\u00a0continue to work.<\/p><p>- a person on the PCB scheme, with an\u00a0underlying\u00a0entitlement to Invalidity Pension, will retain their Free Travel Pass for a\u00a0period of five years.<\/p><p>- there is no requirement that\u00a0a person must undertake work that is of a &lsquo;rehabilitative or therapeutic&rsquo;\u00a0nature.<\/p><p>- there is no restriction on\u00a0the number of hours\u00a0worked. <\/p><p>- there is no restriction on\u00a0earnings.<\/p><p>PCB has therefore been designed to support persons, in receipt of IB or IP (only), to return to work while also continuing to provide them with income support through the social welfare system.\u00a0 PCB is not designed to provide income support while a person is undertaking an education or training course.<\/p><p>Where a person is not in employment the Department provides a range of supports.\u00a0These include supports such as the back to education allowance (BTEA) as well as both income supports and employment &amp;amp;

As a long term housing support, an assessment of housing need must be completed in order for a household to qualify for HAP. Any household with an identified housing need is eligible for HAP. The Social Housing Assessment Regulations 2011 provide that subject to conditions, a housing authority shall deal with such an application within a period of 12 weeks.\u00a0 Local authorities will prioritise housing needs assessments for those in greatest need and average waiting times are significantly shorter than the statutory maximum in many areas.<\/p>  <p>  If a household has been deemed eligible for social housing support, it is a matter for the local authority to examine the suite of social housing supports available, including the HAP scheme, to determine the most appropriate form of social housing support for that household in the administrative area of that local authority.\u00a0\u00a0Accordingly, the determination of entitlement to HAP,\u00a0including the assessment of an applicant's means,\u00a0is governed by\u00a0the same arrangements as for other social housing supports.<\/p>  <p>  Under the HAP scheme, eligible households source their own accommodation in the private rented sector and the tenancy agreement is between the tenant and the landlord. \u00a0The Residential Tenancies Act 2004 regulates the landlord-tenant relationship in the private rented sector and sets out the rights and obligations of landlords and tenants.<\/p>  <p>  The HAP application form comes in two parts; Section A to be completed by the applicant tenant and Section B to be completed by the landlord or agent. An application for HAP will only be accepted by the local authority when both Section A and Section B are completed, signed and returned, along with the required supporting documentation. \u00a0Any delay in tenants and landlords supplying this information will impact on the processing time of the HAP application. \u00a0The earliest date a HAP payment to the landlord will apply from is the date a complete and valid HAP application has been received by the local authority.<\/p>  <p>  Limerick City and County Council provide a highly effective transactional shared service on behalf of all HAP local authorities. This HAP Shared Services Centre (SSC) manages all HAP related rental transactions for the tenant, local authority and landlord. Once a HAP application has been received and confirmed as valid by the relevant local authority, it is then processed by the HAP SSC. On average, HAP applications are processed by the HAP Shared Service Centre within 2 working days of receipt. Any rental payment arising for a given month will then be made to a landlord on the last Wednesday of that month.<\/p>  <p>  The HAP scheme has been structured in a way that most protects the Exchequer funding by ensuring that payment issues only on valid and complete applications. For this reason rent is paid in arrears\u00a0and ensures that money is only paid in respect of time that the property has actually been occupied by the tenant. This practice also avoids a situation where the local authority has to attempt to recover money from the landlord and simplifies the administration of the scheme.<\/p>  <p>  At the end of Q2 2019, there were more than 48,000 households in receipt of HAP support and over 28,000 separate landlords and agents providing accommodation to households supported by the scheme.

The plan focuses on increasing the delivery of social housing, with a target of delivering 50,000 social housing homes and 87,000 other social housing supports by 2021.\u00a0 In 2018, 8,000 new social homes were delivered nationally and this year, a further 10,000 new social homes will be delivered. \u00a0The Plan also recognises the role of other State Agencies, including the Department of Health and HSE, in delivering services to those experiencing homelessness. \u00a0In September 2017, I established the Homelessness Inter-Agency Group to ensure the effective coordination of the State&rsquo;s response to addressing homelessness.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to increasing\u00a0the supply of housing, we are also committed to ensuring that appropriate emergency accommodation is in place for individuals and families.\u00a0 Budget 2020 provides an allocation of &euro;166m for the delivery of homeless services next year, an increase of &euro;20m on the 2019 allocation.\u00a0 Homeless services are administered on a regional basis and the decisions on the organisation of services, including the provision of emergency accommodation, is a matter for the Management Group of each region.<\/p>  <p>  To minimise the use of hotels and B&amp;Bs for families experiencing homelessness, the Government is supporting local authorities to develop family hubs, through the provision of capital and operational funding.

Households in emergency accommodation are supported by the local authorities and their service delivery partners to identify and secure an independent tenancy. <\/p>  <p>  In September 2018, the Government published the National Implementation Plan for Housing First. Housing First provides homes for rough sleepers and long-term users of emergency accommodation who have complex health needs.\u00a0Housing first tenants are provided with the necessary housing and health supports to ensure that they can sustain their tenancy.

With the resulting rents significantly below market levels, this would mean that many households on moderate incomes will have access to a more affordable and stable form of rental tenure than would otherwise have been the case.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that Cost Rental is not designed to replace social housing provision for low-income households, which remains a priority for this Government. Cost Rental is one of several schemes which my Department is using to provide more affordable housing and deliver on Rebuilding Ireland, the Government&rsquo;s action plan for housing and homelessness.<\/p>  <p>  I have convened a working group within my Department, in conjunction with the Land Development Agency, the Housing Agency, and other expert bodies. This group is developing the policy framework for the broader Cost Rental model and examining how a sustainable financing structure can be established to commence delivery of units at the scale required to get this new category of housing off the ground. The work of this group is being assisted by a consultancy and research support that is being undertaken by the European Investment Bank on our behalf.<\/p>  <p>  This work is being informed through two Cost Rental\u00a0pilot  projects, at the former St. Michael's Estate in Inchicore, and at Enniskerry Road in Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown. The latter of these has already commenced construction, supported\u00a0by EIB funding, and the first homes are anticipated to come on stream from 2021. The selection of further sites for Cost Rental consideration will be informed largely by the financial and operational model that will emerge from the evidence building that is currently underway.<\/p>  <p>  The rents for Cost Rental units will obviously depend upon the overall cost of each development and will vary according to the site and design specifics. However, my Department has identified several factors that can put downward pressure on costs and make Cost Rental more affordable for tenants. These include subvention through the Serviced Site Fund, where &euro;310 million is being made available to local authorities over three years, 2019 to 2021, to support the delivery of infrastructure for the provision thereafter of more affordable housing to purchase or rent.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500082#WRZ00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1614,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 629 and 630 answered with Question No. 627.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Wastewater Treatment","counter":1615,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500082#WRZ01200"},{"type":"question","counter":1616,"qnumday":631,"qnumall":"[42008\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500082#WRZ01300","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the progress in the ongoing talks between the EPA, his officials and officials from Leitrim County Council regarding the design of a wastewater percolation system for County Leitrim that would be acceptable under the 2010 EPA guidelines for wastewater treatment plants; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1343","askee":"1295"},{"type":"question","counter":1617,"qnumday":632,"qnumall":"[42009\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500082#WRZ01400","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the progress in the design of a wastewater percolation system that would be acceptable under the 2010 EPA guidelines for wastewater treatment plants in County Leitrim and in particular if he has reached a conclusion on funding for a pilot programme in co-operation with the Minister for Rural and Community Development.; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1343","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":1618,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 631 and 632 together.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has met with Leitrim County Council on three occasions recently with a view to agreeing the scope of the Council's proposed research project proposal examining the feasibility of a zero discharge wastewater system for single houses.<\/p>  <p>  Separately, the Environmental Protection Agency is reviewing its &lsquo;Code of Practice for Waste Water Treatment and Disposal Systems Serving Single Houses&rsquo;  which sets the current standard for septic tank-type systems.

In addition, an annual cap of 90 days would apply for the renting out on a short-term basis of a person's entire home where it is their primary residence, with such short-term lets being restricted to periods of 14 days or less at a time.\u00a0 Under these arrangements, people who wished to avail of the proposed new planning exemptions to use their own home for home-sharing or limited short-term letting purposes would be required to register this with their local planning authority.<\/p>  <p>  These proposed changes would not affect the operation of holiday homes as typically understood, or longer-term flexible lettings which are provided for those coming to Ireland under employment contracts. <\/p>  <p>  These new planning reforms to regulate the short-term letting sector came into effect on 1 July 2019.\u00a0 The final Working Group report on the regulation of short-term lettings was subsequently published on 26 July 2019.<\/p>  <p>  The purpose of the aforementioned changes to the planning code was primarily to address the longer term rental issues arising from the use of properties for short-term letting in designated rent pressure zones, which are areas of high housing demand.
