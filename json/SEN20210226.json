I am aware Ireland has contributed and plans to spend &euro;50 million in support of global public health, which includes COVAX.  Our money is being used to fund this initiative.  We have a responsibility to ensure equitable access to Covid vaccines.  Ireland should be actively addressing obstacles to equitable access, such as Israeli discriminatory healthcare practice.  What progress has been made to vaccinate Palestinians under this programme?<\/p> <p>Israel's decision to exclude Palestinians from its vaccination distribution programme is not the first time Israel has denied Palestinians lifesaving medical treatments.  We are aware from WHO reports, including one conducted in 2017, that only 54% of Gaza patients who applied for permits to access healthcare in Israel and the West Bank received approval.  The report shows 54 Palestinians, 46 of whom had cancer, died in 2017 following denial of or delay in their permits.<\/p> <p>Even by Israel's poor humanitarian standards, denying Palestinians access to lifesaving medication seems callous.  It is insulting to repeatedly hear praise for Israel's vaccination roll out success when the reality is very different.  It has minutely controlled their lives while denying any meaningful responsibility for their welfare.<\/p> <p>Having regard to the vast funding we give to COVAX, we need to ensure our Government calls for the removal any barriers to access.  It is our prerogative to understand where our funding is going and where access to this funding is being obstructed.  Amnesty International, among many other organisations, condemned the Israeli Government's decision to bar Palestinians from receiving the vaccine.  It described the Israeli action as evidence of the institutionalised discrimination that defines Israeli Government policy towards Palestinians.<\/p> <p>There is no legal or moral justification for Israel's action.  The fourth Geneva Convention asserts that any occupying power has the duty of ensuring and maintaining the medical and hospital establishments and services with particular reference to taking the preventative measures necessary to combat the spread of contagious diseases and epidemics.  Even the Oslo Accords oblige both sides to co-operate in combatting epidemics and assist each other in times of emergency, having regard to the countless examples of discrimination and barriers to access necessary medicines.<\/p> <p>How will we encourage equitable access for Palestinians when Israel continues to be praised by the international media?  The situation in Gaza is dire - I was there and it was an horrific experience to see the people there.  Gaza suffers from electricity cuts that last 12 hours per day.  Thanks to Israel's air, land and sea siege, as well as multiple military assaults on a crowded enclave, there is a severe shortage of medicine and medical equipment along with significant poverty and unemployment.  According to the Palestinian health ministry, the territories have been in financial crisis, leaving them next to no funds to purchase vaccine doses.  Quarantining and maintaining sanitation in Gaza is extremely difficult.<\/p> <p>We need to understand where our funding is going.  In this blatant barrier to access the benefits of our funding, it is paramount we condemn Israeli discriminatory practices and understand what the Department has done to put an end to illegal barriers to accessing the vaccines, which has been and continues to be supported by Irish funding.<\/p> <p>I ask the Minister of State what more we can do to ensure equitable access to vaccinations for Palestinians in the occupied territories.  I welcome the opportunity for the Minister of State to put on record that Ireland will step up to its responsibility to ensure equitable access to Covid-19 vaccines for Palestinians.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021022600002#C00100","speaker":"1632"},{"type":"speech","time":1614335400,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Black for raising this important matter.  Ensuring there are vaccines and that they can be distributed equitably has been at the centre of Ireland's global public health and development assistance responses to the pandemic.  The development of vaccines has been remarkably fast.<\/p> <p>However, the vaccine roll out is complex, as we are aware, with countries at different stages of vaccine approval and global supply shortages.  This means that access to Covid-19 vaccines varies widely between countries, often reflecting income levels.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Colm Brophy:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2427\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2427&amp;amp;pid=ColmBrophy&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=26\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It is important too to invest in the capacity of healthcare systems, so that vaccines, once approved and received, can be delivered to people in a timely and safe manner.  <\/p><p>The principle underpinning our approach to that equitable vaccine distribution is both the right thing and the smart thing in helping protect the most vulnerable everywhere and in also protecting ourselves.  That is why Ireland is a strong supporter of the COVAX facility as the best way to achieve an equitable allocation of vaccines to low and middle-income countries, places such as the occupied Palestinian territories, according to an agreed set of governing principles developed by the World Health Organization.  <\/p><p>COVAX centralises the procurement and allocation of vaccines so that the unit price of vaccines for less well-off countries is minimised.  Working with partners, it ensures that needles, personal protective equipment, PPE, and other necessary ancillaries are also procured and distributed.  Housed within the Global Vaccines Alliance, Gavi, COVAX aims to deliver 2 billion doses of Covid-19 vaccines to 92 low and middle-income countries.  It has also negotiated options for a further 1 billion doses.  <\/p><p>On 3 February COVAX confirmed that the occupied Palestinian territory was a priority participant in its programme and would receive 277,000 vaccine doses in quarter 1 and quarter 2 of 2021.  It is expected that the Palestinian Authority will shortly receive its first COVAX consignment, following quickly on the first COVAX vaccine delivery shipped this week to Africa.  Given the importance the Government attaches to equitable access to vaccines, Irish Aid last week allocated an additional &euro;5 million support to the global vaccine effort.  Some &euro;4 million of that allocation went to COVAX for vaccine procurement and distribution and &euro;1 million to the World Health Organization for its role in ensuring fairness and transparency.<\/p><p>As the Senator outlined, this will bring Ireland Aid's investment in global public health in 2021 to more than &euro;50 million, which includes support to Gavi and the Global Fund, whose work is essential in ensuring that public health systems can mount vaccine campaigns.<\/p><p>There is widespread global support for COVAX.  The EU announced that it would double its contribution to the initiative from &euro;500 million to &euro;1 billion.  When taken with the commitments of individual member states, that will bring the EU pledge to COVAX to &euro;2.2 billion.  In addition, the US has pledged $4 billion, $2 billion of which it has made available for early disbursement.<\/p><p>Ireland continues to monitor issues around vaccine roll out in the occupied Palestinian territory mindful of the unique challenges that this context presents.  The Palestinian Authority launched its own vaccination programme on 2 February administering doses to front-line healthcare workers, although it is very concerning that the programme is being suspended due to supply shortages.  However, I am hopeful that with the impending delivery of the first COVAX consignment and the approval of new vaccines, availability and distribution to the occupied Palestinian territories will improve in the second quarter of 2021.  Separate to the COVAX mechanism, 44,000 vaccine doses have been provided to the occupied Palestinian territory to date: 2,000 doses from Israel, 10,000 from Russia and 20,000 from the UAE to Gaza.  Israel recently announced it will vaccinate 100,000 Palestinians who work in Israel, with that programme beginning this week.<\/p><p>The Government remains mindful of the importance of an equitable roll-out of vaccines in the occupied Palestinian territories, and all other developing contexts.  I can assure the Senator of our continued attention to this issue in the months ahead.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021022600002#C00200","speaker":"1573","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1614335400,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his response.

It is nice to have one of our own Senators, Senator Hackett, here in the role of Minister of State.  I know the Minister of State has a keen interest in this area.  I studied horticulture in my college days so I take a keen interest in the area.  In the middle of a pandemic and with so many problems out there, it is an issue people might not take much heed of.  However, as the Minister of State will know, many people are affected by this horrible fungal disease called ash dieback.<\/p> <p>Going back to my college days, there was not much talk about ash dieback, but people have become more and more aware of the problems that exist because of it.  It was about 2011 or 2012 when it was first established that we had ash dieback in this country.  Some of the people I spoke to in the sector tell me we could have lost almost 90% or even 90%-plus of our ash tree population inside ten years.<\/p> <p>This disease is a major source of concern in the forestry sector.  We have many forestry owners who invested heavily and planted substantial areas of ash.  As the Minister of State knows, the reconstitution scheme was suspended in 2018.  We have this new scheme up and running now and many people tell me they are not happy with the scheme as it operates.<\/p> <p>Many farmers as they got older put some of their land into forestry, particularly into an ash plantation.  In many cases, it was to create a little nest egg when they came to pension age.  Many of those people were of modest means and it was an investment for later in life.  That little nest egg would have given them no major financial concerns as they moved into their later years.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Eugene Murphy:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2444\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2444&amp;amp;pid=EugeneMurphy&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=26\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->They have now been left with what is probably a worthless product.

They have large sections of land that have been badly affected by the fungal disease.  This is a danger because, as the Minister of State knows, mature trees that become infected rot.  In many areas with really small plantations, particularly along roadsides, farmers are living in terrible fear that the trees will fall.  As people, including the Chairperson will know, a tree growing on one's land is one's responsibility, not that of the local authority, Transport Infrastructure Ireland or any other body.<\/p><p>I want an update on the current position regarding this major problem of ash dieback.  Is there anything else we can do for the people affected to take them out of the misery they are in?  I hope that we can in some way be of assistance to the many thousands of people affected.  A person in the industry told me yesterday that up to 20,000 people could be affected.  While there are probably 30,000 ha of ash plantation in the country and 20,000 may seem like a very big number, many of the individuals have very small plantations.

Ash dieback has had a devastating effect on ash plantations throughout the country and I am well aware of its impact on landowners and farmers.  As the Senator highlighted, the effects on native trees across the countryside, whether they are in hedges or standing alone, will be apparent very soon.<\/p> <p>When the disease first presented, almost ten years ago, it was thought that eradication was an option.  My Department introduced an Exchequer-funded reconstitution scheme in 2013 to restore affected forests and it has paid out some &euro;7 million to forest owners since.  While the scheme was a reasonable response at the time, it became evident, given the progression and reach of the disease and based on the scientific knowledge available, that a review of the scheme was needed.  The original aim of the scheme, namely, eradication of the disease from Ireland, was no longer achievable and the disease is now considered endemic here.<\/p> <p>Given that the scientific outlook had changed, a new approach was clearly needed.  A review was undertaken to decide on the best approach.  This included stakeholder and public consultation and detailed field consideration of damage-level evaluation, together with an examination of a broader range of silviculture and management options available to forest owners.  Advice from Teagasc and international experts was also received.  Current support schemes were examined to ensure their continued relevance and value for money, and to ensure that the forest owner was provided with a broad range of silvicultural and management measures.<\/p> <p>On foot of the review, a new ash dieback scheme, known as the reconstitution and underplanting scheme, was launched in June 2020.  This approach aims to encourage the active management of ash plantations in the context of the control and spread of ash dieback disease.  It categorises plantations into three groups based on plantation age and tree size.  Various support options are available depending on the category into which an ash plantation may fall.  The scheme aims to promote the vigorous growth of ash through thinning to realise as much of the potential value of the crop as possible.  It allows landowners who wish to continue growing their ash forest where the presence of the disease is low to continue to get paid their ash premiums.  Since its launch in June, over 268 applications have been submitted.  We have begun to issue approvals and this will continue as applications are assessed.  This, of course, is a demand-led scheme and, because ash was normally a small part of a bigger plantation, many landowners may not opt to engage with the scheme.<\/p> <p>Ash has major cultural significance in Ireland, most notably in hurling, so we are very interested in exploring whether a resistant strain could be developed.  The Department has invested heavily since 2013 in breeding ash for resistance.  I understand there are many projects at an advanced stage.  A very small proportion of ash trees, amounting to about 1% or 2%, show natural tolerance to the pathogen.  This means they show minor symptoms and that the disease does not have the noticeable impact on their growth or health that is has on other trees.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Pippa Hackett:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=0000\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=0000&amp;amp;pid=PippaHackett&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=26\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> Teagasc is working to identify such trees and to build up a gene bank with the ultimate goal of producing tolerant ash seeds that we will be able to use to restore ash trees to Irish forests and hedgerows.  Furthermore, there is a National Council for Forest Research and Development, COFORD, working group that specifically addresses genetics and the important role that plays in adaptation, tolerance and resistance, which has recently released a note entitled, Breeding for Tolerance to Ash Dieback Disease.<\/p><p>In summary, we will continue to support those landowners who wish to manage their ash plantations affected by the disease through the reconstitution and under-planting scheme.

There is dog racing, Galway Bay and Lough Corrib.  We have a rail link to the heart of the city with a motorway to Dublin and Limerick, going through Tuam, giving access to Shannon Airport, Dublin Airport and Ireland West Airport in Knock.<\/p><p>Like any city and its suburbs, we have challenges with traffic, housing, wastewater, water and amenities.  We have many plans submitted such as the Galway city ring road plans which are with An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  There are exciting applications under the urban and rural regeneration development funds, as well as for projects such as the Martin roundabout upgrade and access to Ardaun, a potential growth area in the city, a rail passing bay in Oranmore and a greenway over the Corrib railway viaducts.  There are also various public transport initiatives in the city to improve walking and cycling, including the development of 11 city centre cycle routes, the Dublin Road bus corridor, the Moycullen to city greenway, the Ceannt Station upgrade and a Barna to city greenway.<\/p><p>We have a number of positives and potential projects or initiatives, including the Galway Airport site which is jointly owned by the city and county councils.  There are regeneration projects, including at Ceannt Station, the docks and Headford Road.  We have a large number of IDA Ireland lands, including 240 ha in Athenry and 80 ha in Oranmore.  We have a plan for Ardaun, identified as the main growth area in Galway city and county.  We have the Athenry-Oranmore economic corridor.<\/p><p>The national development plan and Project Ireland 2040 have identified Galway city's suburbs as a growth area.  The 2016 population of Galway city was 80,000 people.  By 2040, projected increases predict that the population will be at 120,000 people.<\/p><p>We all preach balanced regional development and moving the focus and growth from the Dublin and Leinster areas and spreading it around to different cities in the country.  One major limitation on reaching that target in Galway is wastewater treatment.  There is the much talked about and long-awaited plan for a Galway east main drainage wastewater treatment plant.  This plant would encompass Athenry, Oranmore, the east of the city and the Ardaun area, identified by the Department, in conjunction with the city and county councils, as the growth area for our county.<\/p><p>We need the Department to focus on pushing this plan with Irish Water and the local authorities to progress it.  It is absolutely vital.  Not only will it allow growth in that area, but it will also reduce pressure on the Mutton Island facility which is the main wastewater treatment plant in the city.  It will allow the city area to develop, as well as reducing pressure on areas such as Barna and Knocknacarra.  It is badly needed in terms of housing.  We cannot talk about housing unless sufficient wastewater treatment is in place.  We need action and progress on this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021022600002#G00600","speaker":"1665","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1614335400,"counter":27,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Kyne for raising this important matter.

It includes a detailed capital investment plan for the period 2018 to 2027, the National Development Plan 2018-2027, and the 20-year national planning framework.

The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage's implementation support role is primarily focused on strategic and spatial planning, and has focused on bringing forward the institutional, regulatory and investment measures required to deliver compact and regional growth objectives, as set out in the NPF.<\/p><p>As with all public spending departments and agencies across government, there is a wider role in the implementation of the NPF and the NDP through the significant capital investment programmes, for which my Department is responsible in the areas of water, housing, the urban and rural development fund, as well as local government expenditure, which I will now address.  <\/p><p>The Senator has made very valid points in respect of water services.  Since 1 January 2014, Irish Water has had statutory responsibility for all aspects of water services planning, delivery and operation at national, regional and local levels.  As part of budget 2021, funding of over &euro;1.4 billion was secured to support water services.  This includes &euro;1.3 billion in respect of domestic water services provision by Irish Water.  The overall investment will deliver significant improvements in our public water and wastewater services, supported by improved water supplies right across Ireland, including rural Ireland, and support a range of programmes delivering improved water quality in our rivers, lakes and marine areas.  The prioritisation and progression of individual projects is a matter for determination by Irish Water.  Indeed, the Senator has made very valid points in respect of Ardaun, Barna and east Galway in terms of progressing that.<\/p><p>On the important issue of delivering social housing supports for the Galway area, my Department has made substantial funding available, including substantial capital investment, to both local authorities and partner organisations, such as approved housing bodies.  Social housing targets are in place for both local authority areas, and because these targets are challenging, the Galway social housing task force has been in place since 2019 to support the work of local authorities and other stakeholders.<\/p><p>As the Senator has quite rightly pointed out, the overall NPF strategy is for better balanced development between the regions and greater focus on Ireland's cities, where 50% of the development overall is targeted, with 50% of that city growth to be supported to take place in the four cities outside of Dublin, which is key.  As a key driver of the NPF, the &euro;2 billion urban and regeneration fund is focused on supporting high-quality, applicant-led projects.  The Senator has quite rightly articulated that there are a number of exciting projects in Galway for which he has been advocating.

I was concerned by the reply of the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, to a parliamentary question last November in which he stated that the current income eligibility requirements provide for a fair and equitable system of identifying the households facing the greatest challenge in meeting their accommodation needs from their own resources.  I respectfully say they do not.  In the course of their local constituency duties Members meet families, week in, week out, who are just above the criteria and have no prospect of securing long-term housing solutions.<\/p><p>I met a couple this week who live in my village.  They currently pay rent of &euro;1,400 per month.  They have three children and are working people.  They have no prospect of putting a deposit together for a house.  They are excluded from social housing because they earn in excess of &euro;33,750, the income limit for Limerick.  I could have chosen any county, but I wish to discuss Limerick because that is where I am from.<\/p><p>The Minister of State will be aware that rents rocketed under the previous Government, of which he was a member.  He will be aware that, in Limerick, rents increased by 45% between 2016 and 2021.  According to Daft.ie, the rent for a family renting a three-bedroom house went up from, on average, &euro;799 per month to &euro;1,160.  We all know the impact of that big increase and additional cost on families.  It means that not only can they not save for a deposit, but they have to go to community welfare officers just to get by, each week and each month.  As matters stand, these people have no hope.  They are trapped.  They are locked out of the social housing system and are trapped with unscrupulous landlords.  The couple I mentioned had their rent increased by &euro;200 in December.  When they pointed out that the landlord could not do that, as it is illegal under the pandemic rules, he said: \"No problem, I will put the house up for sale and you will have to find somewhere else to live\".  That is the reality at the hard edge of living in rented accommodation.<\/p><p>The problem is that the market is skewed entirely in favour of landlords.  Indeed, I would welcome a comment from the Minister of State on that increase in rent, because I have one word for it.  An increase of 45% in rents in five years is greed, pure and simple.  The Government must respond urgently to this issue.  I have some simple requests.  The Government must raise the limits, and do so without delay.  It must ensure that the working family payment, formerly known as the family income supplement, is not included when calculating income.  That is a massive punishment.  It is bad enough that people are on low pay and that the Government has not addressed the issue of low pay in the economy, but the Government also punishes them by throwing in that calculation to exclude them from qualifying for social housing.  We must also look at the adult income for adult children in households.  We know what is happening.  Adult children cannot move out of the household because the cost of rents is so high.  It is like a perfect storm.<\/p><p>When this Government was formed there was an expectation that there would be a review of the income limits and that they would be urgently moved up, but it has not happened.  Instead, the issue is part of a wider review.  That wider review is absolutely no use to working families who are being thrown off the housing lists because they receive a small, moderate increase in their income.  They are locked out of the housing assistance payment, HAP, and all supports.  There are tens of thousands of families in this predicament of having no supports, and the Minister of State knows it.  They are locked out of getting a mortgage and they are locked out of social housing.  It is grossly unfair.  I hope to receive a positive response from the Minister of State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021022600002#J00500","speaker":"1660","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1614335400,"counter":34,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this important matter.

The 2011 regulations prescribe maximum net income levels for each local authority, in different bands according to the area concerned, with income being defined as assessed according to the standard household means policy.  Under the household means policy, which applies in all local authorities, net income for social housing assessment is defined as gross household income less income tax, PRSI and the universal social charge.  The policy provides for a range of income disregards, and local authorities also have discretion to decide to disregard income that is temporary, short-term or once-off in nature.<\/p> <p>The income bands are expressed in terms of a maximum net income threshold for a single-person household, with an allowance of 5% for each additional adult household member, subject to a maximum allowance under this category of 10%, and 2.5% for each child, subject to a maximum allowance under this category of 10%.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Peter Burke:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2457\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2457&amp;amp;pid=PeterBurke&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=26\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The income bands and the authority area assigned to each band are based on an assessment of the income needed to provide for a household's basic needs plus a comparative analysis of the local rental cost of housing accommodation throughout the country.

The current income eligibility requirements generally achieve this, providing for a fair and equitable system of identifying those facing the greatest challenge in meeting their accommodation needs from their own resources.  However, as part of a broader social housing review and reform agenda, a review of the income eligibility criteria for social housing supports in each local authority is under way.  The review will not be completed until the impacts of parallel initiatives on affordability have been considered as these will inform where the thresholds should lie.<\/p><p>These initiatives include the &euro;200 million local infrastructure housing activation fund and the &euro;310 million serviced sites fund.  From this sum, &euro;50 million has been allocated in 2021 to deliver more affordable homes.  In addition, eligibility conditions for other key affordability initiatives, such as the national cost rental policy and the new affordable purchase shared equity scheme, which are included in the forthcoming affordable housing Bill, together with the Rebuilding Ireland home loan and the help to buy scheme, will all be factored into the work to ensure supports are targeted and given to those who need them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021022600002#K00200","speaker":"1595","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1614335400,"counter":36,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his response.

That is one in five families in the country.  It takes into consideration families that were two-parent families where one parent dies but not when they both remain alive, which it should from an actuarial perspective.  This legislation currently overlooks lone parents and this must be addressed.  As a State, we cannot assume all families are headed by two parents and families have always come in all shapes and sizes.  We must ensure we can support them in what they do rather than in their composition.<\/p><p>One-parent families doing the job of two parents should get the same amount of leave as two-parent families and the State should treat all families in a fair and equitable way.  This is not just about equality as it is also about social justice.  These parents are doing it all - parenting, working and everything else - but they are more vulnerable to hardship and poverty.  The consistent poverty rate for one-parent families is 17.1% versus 5.5% for the population as a whole, according to 2019 figures.  These people are five times as likely to experience deprivation and we know 86% of one-parent families have women as the parent, so we know they are more likely to return to work before their baby is six months old.  They are also less likely to be in employment after nine months because of childcare needs.  Let us remember that part of the legislation's purpose is to promote participation by mothers in the workplace, and it is another reason for the amendment.<\/p><p>I understand how we got here and I agree with what we are doing in trying to ensure we share the care, as it were.  Much of the focus of this legislation is about that and trying to bring more equality between men and women.  Ireland has huge progress to make in this area, including behavioural change, in trying to ensure duties are shared between the sexes.  Covid-19 has shown us that.  It is possible nevertheless to support that objective and one-parent families.<\/p><p>I have provided two options to the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth and the relevant Oireachtas committee.  They could look at transferring paid leave, and where it is not an option, additional leave could be provided for the relevant parent.  This is to ensure we meet all the obligations and objectives of the legislation.  I sincerely hope we can find a workable solution to this matter.

The Covid-19 pandemic has transformed our working and home lives, enabling new ways of working that may eventually assist women to continue their careers who would otherwise have left the workforce due to family obligations.  This is a particularly acute challenge for lone parents, who as the Senator notes tend to be women.<\/p> <p>As the Minister with responsibility for gender equality and for children, Deputy O'Gorman recognises the importance of supporting all families.  A broad range of family leave amendments have been developed in recent years intended to provide support and options for parents in balancing their work obligations and their family life.  Various forms of family leave, combined with access to childcare, are a very important in ensuring women remain part of the workforce and can help prevent them falling into the poverty cycle.<\/p> <p>In November 2019, the Parent's Leave and Benefit Act 2019 introduced two weeks of paid leave for each parent, and this leave must be taken in the first year after the birth or adoptive placement of a child.  The intention of this leave is to enable parents to spend time with their child in the earliest years.  This leave is deliberately non-transferable between parents to ensure both parents are encouraged and supported in taking time out from work to spend time with their child.  It is an entitlement for each parent in their own right, regardless of whether they are in a relationship or live together.  The Act was drafted in such a way as to comprehend the broad complexion of family life that exists and allows for an entitlement for the spouse, civil partner or cohabitant of the parent.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Peter Burke:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2457\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2457&amp;amp;pid=PeterBurke&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=26\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It is important to note that entitlement to parents' leave is for the individual parent, it is not an allocation per family.<\/p><p>In recognition of the unique pressures that Covid-19 has placed on new parents, in December 2020 the Government approved proposals that each parent will be given an additional three weeks of paid parents' leave and the period in which it can be taken will be extended to the first two years after the birth or adoptive placement of a chid.  This change requires legislation to be enacted and its drafting is now well advanced.  I understand that the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, hopes to be in a position to bring this to the Government in the coming weeks.  The Government recognises that many parents are awaiting the introduction of this leave and it is being given a very high priority in the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  I understand that lone parents are shouldering a tremendous burden in the current climate, and often during this time without the support of grandparents or other family members who would otherwise be able to help with childcare or other needs.  The National Strategy for Women and Girls 2017-2020 has specific actions designed to reduce poverty of female-headed households, including lone parent families, and the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth has decided to extend the lifespan of the strategy until the end of this year to enable actions interrupted by Covid-19 to be brought to a conclusion.  An independent evaluation of the strategy will take place this year, which will help to feed into the development of the future strategic policy for gender equality.  Any future strategic policy will continue to place a particular emphasis on the most vulnerable women and girls, including lone parents. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021022600002#M00200","speaker":"1595","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1614335400,"counter":44,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

When one looks behind the software app, one has to look at the human experience of these workers in the gig economy.  These workers are categorised as being self-employed but as part of a subcontracting culture, many young foreign students who come to Ireland to learn English and have a cultural experience are taking this part-time work to pay their way.  They are providing us with a vital service but they are in a no man's land in which the company does not provide them with any employment rights or insurance cover if they are robbed, mugged or in any way injured carrying out their work.

The argument in the case, which was supported by the GMB trade union, was that these drivers were workers who were deserving of employment protections.  We saw a similar announcement from the Italian courts yesterday.  The UK ruling arose from the fact that there are three categories of employment status in the UK, namely, employed, employee and a hybrid status that marries the gig economy flexible model of self-employment with basic employment rights.  We do not have that third category of employment in Ireland.<\/p><p>In my meetings and correspondence with Deliveroo, I have argued that it is not acceptable for a company to establish a business model that does not take cognisance of the different types of employment status that apply and are lawful in a country.  Its business model relies, as Senator Fitzpatrick has said, on riders scrambling for deliveries to maximise their incomes during their shifts.  There are accidents and in recent times we have seen a sinister development involving criminal and anti-social elements.  Deliveroo's business model also facilitates unlawful working by default.  Deliveroo's insistence that drivers are self-employed allows someone else to register under a driver's name on the app and carry out the work.  This means people are working outside the scope of the permissions of their visas.  I do not blame the drivers for doing so and I do not have an issue with it <i>per se<\/i>because these services are a lifeline for communities and the food businesses within them.  However, this practice leads to a reluctance to come forward and report attacks when they occur.  The drivers are policing the city themselves by designating areas in the city as red zones to which they will not deliver.  As a consequence, the communities in question are being stigmatised and denied a service.<\/p><p>I have written to the Minister for Justice and consulted the Garda and Dublin City Council on this.  I have highlighted to the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Varadkar, and the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy English, the feasibility of adopting the hybrid category of employment.  I have looked at submissions on rights, taxation and supports and I believe we can hold companies such as Deliveroo to account.  We can oblige these companies to provide supports to their workers, who are generating profits for them.  We need to engage with the model of the gig economy as a new mode of working, while also ensuring we do not facilitate a race to the bottom through the exploitation of these vulnerable workers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021022600002#O00200","speaker":"1682"},{"type":"speech","time":1614335400,"counter":51,"content":"<p>I thank Senators Fitzpatrick and Seery Kearney for raising this important topic.

The issue of determining employment status is within the remit of the Department of Social Protection, as I am sure both Senators are aware.  Where an issue arises with the employment status of an individual, cases are forwarded to the Revenue Commissioners and the scope section of the Department of Social Protection, or both, for investigation.

This code was drawn up and agreed in 2007 by the relevant Departments in collaboration with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and IBEC.<\/p><p>New unlegislative forms of working arrangements are emerging as the labour market adapts to the opportunities presented by digitalisation, broadband and globalisation.  This includes the emergence of more freelance-type working arrangements known as the gig economy as well as new forms of trading known as the sharing economy.  It is important that policy adapts to provide social protection for workers in these new and emerging forms of work while not stifling social innovation.  The Department of Social Protection, through its Scope and employment status investigation unit, ESIU, is revising and updating the code of practice for determining employment and self-employment status of individuals to reflect new working models and also recent case law in the determination of employment status.<\/p><p>Ireland has a robust suite of employment rights that protects all employees equally.

The Kerry Group has also benefited significantly from project support from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment through Enterprise Ireland.  We were all very excited a number of years ago when we heard the Kerry Group was coming to Millennium Park in Naas, County Kildare.

However, local authorities were unable to provide documents on road safety assessments carried out.  That is extraordinary.  They are giving the reason, yet there are no statistics available to support it, particularly when we take into account that in counties such as Tipperary and Donegal it turned out that less than 1% of roadside hedgerow posed a safety risk.

It came after workers told us that, in many instances, they could not afford to be out sick without pay.  It came after Patricia King of Congress, Greg Ennis of SIPTU and many across the union movement pleaded for a system of paid sick leave in this country.<\/p> <p>Our Bill sought to give workers access to paid sick leave from the first day of falling ill and on full pay.  The Government at that time decided to postpone a vote for six months.  I know it takes time to get good legislation right and I know consultation was needed, but the six months is now up, March is upon us, and we have heard zero inkling from the Government as to its intentions with regard to sick pay.  It is interesting that, in that time, the US Government under Trump introduced a very comprehensive system of sick pay at the end of the December yet, here in this country, we are still waiting.<\/p> <p>In that time, between August and 20 February, 1,681 workers across food workplaces and commercial workplaces were infected with Covid-19 and there were 391 outbreaks.

The Irish Cancer Society also came out last week and said we need to have sick pay, so this is not just about Covid-19 and is about the world of work beyond.  I want to hear what the Government is planning with regard to sick pay because workers cannot afford to wait.<\/p> <p>On another issue, I listened on radio this morning to the news of a new variant of Covid-19, one that was first detected in Nigeria.  I am very worried about the inclination to name a variant after where it was first detected.  We have enough problems with racism in this country without exacerbating it because of a poor or lazy choice of language.  I want to make a special appeal to health experts, to the Government and to all of us in the House that we use the actual terms for the variants &ndash; P1, 501Y, VOC 202012\/01 or B1525.  It is not beyond us to use the appropriate terms as opposed to labelling a country, because we know Covid-19 travels and it does not recognise borders.

What people do not realise is that all around the world, particularly in Europe, Green parties call out human rights abuses and work to actually make the change.

We must see an end to direct provision within the lifetime of this Government.  We all recognise we have waited for it for too long.<\/p><p>In my constituency in Galway, people will know people whose children cannot visit other children in their homes because they live in a centre.  Children cannot bring friends to what are supposed to be homes.  They are not homes but are for-profit facilities which are inhumane.  There have been occasions when people have spoken up about this.  It is very difficult for people who live in a for-profit system to speak up against the system.  They have described the food being given to them as being the very cheapest kind.  Changes have been made in that regard but we need to ensure there is an end to direct provision, that we provide state-of-the-art not-for-profit new builds and that people remain there for no longer than four months before moving on to own-door accommodation.  That is what is in this White Paper.  I refer to vulnerability assessments and ask whether more things need to be put in place for people who are often fleeing very dangerous situations.  Most people in direct provision are women but there is also a large number of children.  Particular supports need to be put in place for these individuals.  I welcome the White Paper.

Members may have read about the case on social media.  Margaret's family had to lodge an appeal following a decision by the Consistory Court of Coventry, which initially refused an Irish-only inscription - in &aacute;r gcro&iacute;the go deo which means in our hearts forever - on Margaret's headstone.  The Chancellor of the Diocese of Coventry said that it could be interpreted as a political slogan.  If one can read, understand and speak the Irish language, one will know very clearly that in &aacute;r gcro&iacute;the go deo is not a political statement.  That ruling says to me that if one does not speak, read or understand the Irish language, then one just assumes something is a political statement because it is written in Irish.  This says quite a bit about the thinking many Gaeilgeoir&iacute; have faced and, in some instances, continue to face.  I am glad to say that following the appeal, Margaret's family were successful and will get to have an Irish-only inscription on their mother's headstone.  Margaret was steeped in the Irish language and culture and in Cumann L&uacute;thchleas Gael in Britain.  As is obvious, it means a tremendous amount to her family that this has been allowed.

It called on the Executive to develop an overarching economic strategy involving all key stakeholders that will layout a clear vision to government and non-government agencies with economic responsibilities, so that we can help develop the supply chains across Ireland to the benefit to all our people.  That was a positive and welcome piece of work.<\/p> <p>It would be right and appropriate if we were to replicate such a motion in this House that acknowledged the protections of the protocol and that worked with economic and business agencies in this State to encourage and layout a vision for them to develop their supply chains and an overarching economic strategy that maximises and implements the protections afforded by the very hard-negotiated and hard-won protocol.

Women were more likely to report their mental health and well-being had been negatively affected.  More than six in ten women said their mental health was impacted.

There was a case of a charity that wanted to appoint a CEO at &euro;150,000 without any money yet raised by it.  Often in these cases the CEO is the only full-time employee.  Groups seem to think about employing highly paid staff before they have even mapped out their governance or focus.

First, like everything in this country, the GAA congress, which convened this morning, is taking place remotely.  The conference room in the Hogan Stand will not have the usual hustle and bustle of delegates from all over Ireland, London and New York.

We had extremely bad weather in Tipperary earlier this week and we had road closures and water outages.  Almost any time we have a mist in Clonmel or Tipperary, we have a water outage.  At the same time we had all these problems, the White Paper on Irish Water was brought before Cabinet.  I ask the Leader if it is possible to bring the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage in to discuss the White Paper in detail.  I ask that because it is important when local authorities are putting local development plans together that we align the priorities of local authorities with the priorities of Irish Water.  That is not happening at the moment.  If we need to think about regional investment going forward, then we need to have those two things aligned.  Serious concerns are raised in the White Paper, and certainly in terms of staffing issues.  Some of the measures seem to be fairly optimistic in terms of having an 18-month implementation period.  A reasonable phased transition should be considered as part of it.<\/p> <p>One of the striking things about the White Paper is governance and accountability.

One can imagine the huge blow it is to them to find that their jobs are going but to also find that the long-established and agreed redundancy terms, agreed with their union, SIPTU, which would have at least ensured some degree of financial security, appears to have been tossed aside by Rehab.

Will the Leader take up with the Minister for Justice, however, the backlog that exists for those who are seeking asylum and permission to remain?  It is vitally important that the time is used now to clear that backlog.<\/p> <p>I congratulate the director and board members of the Hugh Lane Gallery and all those who have been involved in brokering an agreement for the bringing home and sharing of the Hugh Lane bequest.  This is a saga that has gone on since 1915.  Hugh Lane was a young boy from Cork with very limited education who went to the UK.  From a young age, he educated himself in the arts and became one of the first directors of our National Gallery.  Most visionary and altruistic of him was his commitment to open a modern art gallery in Dublin for the people of Dublin.  I was delighted that, ultimately, after a very long saga, they did locate it on Dublin's north side, despite fierce opposition from conservative forces who felt that it would keep workers away from their work and queried why they would want to be distracted by art.  I can say to all of the workers in Dublin that once the pandemic is over, I invite them all to come to the north side and Parnell Square to enjoy the beautiful Hugh Lane bequest and the works of Monet, Manet, Renoir and Degas.  They will be there for everybody to see for free on the north side.  Please put it in your diaries.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021022600002#CC00100","speaker":"1656"},{"type":"speech","time":1614335400,"counter":89,"content":"<p>O'Leary is no longer turning in his grave.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021022600002#CC00200","speaker":"1673"},{"type":"speech","time":1614335400,"counter":90,"content":"<p>I welcome a recent announcement made of a new bus route in west Clare down along the Shannon Estuary which will go through Labasheeda, Kildysart, Ballynacally and other beautiful places that people rarely even hear about.  It is a whole new opening for that part of the county.<\/p> <p>There was much consultation about rural transport and Local Link up to last March with local authorities, local community groups and individuals.  To that end, the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, listened and took action.  As a result, we have Local Link services all over the Twenty-six Counties, including rural Dublin, that offer two services.  The first is door-to-door which is a responsive service for people who have disabilities or cannot drive.  They can ring to get the bus to come their house.  The second is a regular daily service.<\/p> <p>This will monumentally change people's lives in rural areas who have been stuck in their homes with no public transport or relying on neighbours or their parents to give them lifts all the time.  As somebody who lives in the countryside, having to drive my son around for years while forcing him to go out cycling for short distances, for long distances this is phenomenal.<\/p> <p>The costs of the service are affordable with an adult fare at &euro;3 and a student fare at &euro;2.  This will enable people who have disabilities, older people who live alone, or people who want to be independent.  Often it is good for teenagers to be independent of their parents instead of relying on them.  This is good for rural Ireland mentally, physically, socially and environmentally.  It is really important that we have a Minister who values the importance of rural transport.  It might not have the footfall we have in urban areas but he recognises the importance of it at the same time.<\/p> <p>It was great to see this morning's news on the White Paper on direct provision.  I congratulate those I know who have been working with asylum seekers for many years.  They were themselves asylum seekers who, after they got asylum, turned back to work with NGOs and the Movement of Asylum Seekers in Ireland, MASI.  We had a great group in Miltown Malbay where we had a direct provision centre.  I really look forward to this White Paper on direct provision being the beginning of the end of the system, as was promised in the programme for Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021022600002#CC00300","speaker":"1659"},{"type":"speech","time":1614335400,"counter":91,"content":"<p>Over the last number of weeks, the Houses have discussed the report of the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes and Certain Related Matters at length.  Pressure on time and speaking slots has made it impossible for me to contribute.  However, I want to take a few minutes today to put my views on the matter on the record.<\/p> <p>Unfortunately, the report of the commission was attacked by people who had not read it.  They actually admitted that they had not read it.  They claimed that it said there was no evidence of forced adoption.  In fact, anyone who had actually read the report would know that the report made it clear that the mothers in most of those homes had absolutely no choice in reality.  It made a distinction between what is legally termed forced adoption, and what might generally be understood by that term, nowadays, in other words, that people were coerced by circumstance, pressures - religious, moral, family, economic - and so on.  I find the language of the report to be immensely careful.  <\/p> <p>The second point I wish to make is that it is an immensely valuable piece of work.  Members of this House should pay tribute to it.  People should read it - all 3,000 pages of it.  I have not read all 3,000 pages, but I have read about 1,200 pages of it.  It is an immensely valuable piece of work.  I want to pay tribute to the commission for its work.<\/p> <p>The last point I wish to make is that the terms of reference of the commission of investigation set up a confidential committee.  People have misunderstood the purpose of that committee and have thought that it was to create a permanent archive of individual people's experiences.  There is nothing to stop such a permanent archive being created now.  Time did not permit it before, but I want to express my view that I am immensely grateful to the members of the commission of investigation for all of the hard work that they did.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021022600002#DD00100","speaker":"1669"},{"type":"speech","time":1614335400,"counter":92,"content":"<p>The issue I wish to raise today is one that I have spoken about in recent months and it concerns urban regeneration funding.  I raise the issue because I would appreciate it, were the Leader to convey to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage the urgency of the need to make a decision on urban regeneration projects around the country.  I will use the examples of Bridge Street and Linenhall Street in Dundalk to illustrate why it is so important to at least have the outcome of the decision made known to the local authority and to people in Dundalk.<\/p> <p>Louth County Council submitted substantial further evidence and information in April 2020 on why this particular project is so important for the north end of Dundalk town.  It is nearly one year into that process and there has been no response from the Minister yet.  It is important for the council to get a response because it needs to know whether it has been successful.  It not, Louth County Council will need to look at where the project went wrong in order that it can make the necessary additions to make it successful when the urban regeneration fund opens up again in the future.<\/p> <p>I am raising this issue to ask the Leader of the House to convey to the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, the urgency of a decision being made at least in order that the council can determine where it will go from there.  The council has been waiting around for too long now.  I fully accept and understand that Covid-19 restrictions have slowed the process down but I would appreciate it if the Leader could convey the urgency to the Minister.  The decision needs to be made to let the council know whether it has been successful.  The situation does not just apply to my own town.  It is the same for many other provincial towns around the country that are awaiting this announcement.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021022600002#DD00200","speaker":"1670"},{"type":"speech","time":1614335400,"counter":93,"content":"<p>A number of colleagues raised the same issues, so if I respond to one Member, I ask Members to assume that I am responding to all who raised the same issues.<\/p> <p>Senator McGahon raised the issue of urban regeneration funding.  Both this Government and the previous Government have made it an important stay of their commitments to funding projects, both rural and urban, in Ireland.  We know there was literally a lost generation of investment in this country because of the difficulties we faced arising from the financial crash in 2008.  It is most important that we continue to invest.  I will write to the Minister today to ask him about this issue.  I will do so notwithstanding that many public and private sector workers are working from home and there are slight delays in the provision of services but I will certainly write to him today.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Regina Doherty:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2295\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2295&amp;amp;pid=ReginaDoherty&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=26\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> I am pleased that Senator McDowell made his comments on the mother and baby homes commission's report in the House today.  In case people would get a different impression, I should say that the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, came to the House for three separate sessions.  When we decided to have statements on the mother and baby homes at the beginning of this year, I said that he would do so, and he gave a commitment that he would continue to return to the House until every Member who wished to speak on the mother and baby homes got the opportunity to do so.  I am glad the Senator had that opportunity today.  I take his views on board, and he is entitled to them.  I must say, however, that the most important contributions on, and criticisms of, the report were those made by the women and their children who contributed to the report, not just those of politicians and commentators.  Their criticisms of the report were well-founded.  Their opinion that the language in the executive summary was deeply hurtful also must stand, alongside the Senator's compliments today.<\/p><p>Senator Garvey spoke about new bus routes in Clare.  As somebody who lives in a bordering county that has enjoyed local links for many years, I am delighted that every county has them.  It makes an enormous difference for both our younger and older communities.  I am glad the Senator put the new routes in Clare, and the welcome for them, on the record today.<\/p><p>The White Paper on direct provision was released this morning and a number of Members spoke about it.  Some of them have been speaking about this matter for many years.  This is a real Irish trait, where we are still talking about something that was introduced 21 years ago as a temporary measure.  However, we are talking about it today because we have a very progressive and ambitious White Paper.  Again, I pay tribute to the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman.  He has had a tough couple of months, but I know how committed he and the Government are, as are all of us, to ensuring that this ambitious White Paper becomes a reality, not just for the new Irish but also for the people who have been living for far too long without a resolution to their applications.  Please God, it will not take too long for it to become a reality.<\/p><p>Senator Fitzpatrick also mentioned the backlog with the Minister for Justice.  I will raise it with her.  That is no problem.  She spoke very eloquently about Hugh Lane.  It is great that we will have his bequest back in Ireland.<\/p><p>In response to Senator Gavan, I will write to the chief executive officer of the Rehab Group today.  Senator Mullen raised some concerns about the Charities Regulator.  There should be a stipulation that any body that receives State aid under sections 38 and 39, as the Rehab Group does, should not be allowed to walk away from the State agencies that are responsible for protecting the rights of workers in such bodies.  I will write that letter today and send copies to all Members.<\/p><p>Senator Ahearn spoke about road closures and water outages in Tipperary arising from the weather difficulties over the past couple of weeks.  What is important is the White Paper that was released regarding Irish Water.  Again, we cannot make the mistakes that were made in the past and assume that something that is good for one organisation will naturally be good for another.  The local authorities and Irish Water have to work side by side.  The staff members are the same.  They might move from one organisation to the other, but they still provide the vital services we need in rural and urban Ireland.  I will ask for a debate on that with the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, in the coming weeks.<\/p><p>Senator Casey raised the promotion of all the natural assets in this country and the organisations and State agencies that have responsibility for them.  He is correct.  We have come through a very difficult 12 months and there are probably a number of months to go.  The agencies need to change tack in the way they have always done business and recognise that we must reboot certain sectors of the economy that have crumbled in the past year.  I will convey the Senator's thoughts and concerns to the Minister of State with responsibility for the Office of Public Works in the coming days.<\/p><p>Senator Hoey and other Senators spoke about the naming of viruses.  It is an awful shame that we must even have a conversation about racism when discussing a virus that has wiped the floor with every country in the world, without discrimination.  It still comes down to the fact that people use it as a weapon to diminish and demean nations.  It is a shame.  The Senator is correct, and other Members mentioned it, that they all have specific and very long names.  It is lazy of both the media and commentators to call it by the name of the country where it first arose.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Regina Doherty:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2295\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2295&amp;amp;pid=ReginaDoherty&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=26\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We must be mindful not to allow people to weaponise or allow certain sections of society to weaponise something that is causing us so much trouble and issues and allow them to use it for their own purposes.  I take on board the Senator's comments completely and her welcome for the announcement on direct provision.<\/p><p>The announcement of the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, on extending the licences is very welcome but I reiterate that we are still a number of months away from normal life resuming and business returning to normal.  We have to find a way for State agencies and the Government to be able to continue to provide essential services, even in the emergency we are in.  The extension is very welcome.<\/p><p>With regard to the suggestion by Senator Cassells, I am relatively new to the Seanad so I do not think I have ever seen anybody come in from outside and make a presentation.  It would be wonderful and it is certainly something that should be raised with the Committee on Parliamentary Privileges and Oversight.  For what it is worth, and Senator Buttimer raised this also, it is an enormous achievement for Larry McCarthy, who hails from New York and is originally from Cork, to be in this very important position, particularly at a time of such difficulty for the GAA.  We have seen the announcement of its figures, as we will probably see from lots of organisations and businesses in the coming weeks.  It has had a really tough year.  To be fair to Johnny Horan, he has done an incredible job and as really transformed the organisation in recent years.  I congratulate him and wish him well in his future career.  As we all know, he is a teacher and a very good one.  I wish Larry McCarthy the best for the coming three years and I will extend the invitation through the Committee on Parliamentary Privileges and Oversight.<\/p><p>Senator Mullen spoke about the difficulty for charities over the past year and he is correct.  In some instances, giving has increased enormously for some organisations but for most of them it has not.  We have stopped giving to the man on the street or the person selling lines.  An awful lot of local fundraising has been hampered because of the lockdown.  It is important for us to be mindful of the charities we care about when we consider giving.  This does not allow any section 38 or section 39 body not to be able to return financial books to the HSE.  Any body that receives State funding to provide a service on behalf of the State or in conjunction with the State absolutely has responsibilities not just to the Charities Regulator but to the agency that gives it the money.  It is up to these agencies to make sure ensure full governance.  I know the HSE is particularly good at this so it is a bit funny that there is an organisation that has received money two years in a row without returning accounts.  I have to assume the HSE is on top of it but I might just send it a little note to get the information, if Senator will give me the details of the charity later.<\/p><p>Senator Ardagh asked about Princess Latifa.  I will certainly ask the Taoiseach's office for a response on his conversation.  To be fair to the wonderful Mary Robinson, she did admit last week that she had been duped, as can happen the Pope.  She is one of the most incredible international ambassadors we have in Ireland for all of the things she represents.  I will come back to the Senator with a response from the Office of the Taoiseach once I get it.<\/p><p>Senator Black spoke about the impact on mental health and the report issued this week.  What struck me the most about the report was that the biggest issue reported by people between the ages of 18 and 25 was loneliness.  I have two adult teenagers aged 20 and 19 at home and they do not leave the house so they must be lonely.  For years I have been giving out about Snapchat and Facebook and the fact they spend their lives on them but they have probably been a lifeline for them in recent months because otherwise they would not have interaction with their friends.  When we come out of this lockdown, the fallout from the restrictions on every section and age in society is something we will have to deal with and be very mindful of and reactive to.  The report is probably a step in the sand this week to tell us this is what we are dealing with and that there is more to come down the line.  I very much welcome the intervention of Senator Black.<\/p><p>Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile raised the issue of Margaret Keane's gravestone and I am pleased that her family have finally, after what was such a senseless disagreement, got their wishes and will be able to remember their loved one.  I have to tell the Senator it is probably indicative of how many people in the UK see Ireland, which is a huge pity.  It goes to show us that we have an awful long way to go to try to become friends again.  The past couple of years in particular have been acrimonious and have probably raised nationalist feelings in both jurisdictions so we have a bit of work to do there.  I will welcome the Senator's motion on Northern Ireland with regard to the economy and the joint agreements on the protocol and how we can benefit.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Regina Doherty:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2295\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2295&amp;amp;pid=ReginaDoherty&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=26\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I saw a report during the week indicating a huge increase in online trade from the Republic into Northern Ireland.  Many of our young people now seem to be buying from Northern Ireland outlets as opposed to UK or English outlets, and that is very welcome.  It is one positive from a bit of negativity this week.<\/p><p>Senator Pauline O'Reilly raised the very welcome announcement on behalf of the Government by a Green Party Minister of the White Paper on direct provision.  She is right and we need to acknowledge this.  It should not be, and is not, something unique to the Green Party.  Social justice matters should be important to every one of us as individuals, citizens and politicians.  This is a line in the sand again to say that we as politicians and as a nation have decided to do something right for the people who come to our shores seeking our help and that we are going to treat them the way we expect our people to be treated.<\/p><p>Senator Sherlock spoke about the commitment in the programme for Government to introduce the right to sick pay for everybody in this country, rather than just having the sick pay entitlements that currently exist under the social welfare legislation.  I am aware the T&aacute;naiste is working on legislation and will bring proposals to the D&aacute;il in the next couple of months.  I very much look forward to seeing them.  The Senator also mentioned the variants of the virus.<\/p><p>I acknowledge the very welcome presence of Senator Norris this morning.  He looks great, notwithstanding the difficult months and times he has had in the past.  On behalf of all of us, we wish him a speedy recovery.  We want to see him in here every day that we sit, please God.  We wish him well.<\/p><p>Senator O'Loughlin mentioned the events at the Kerry Group.  It is unique that an organisation that has received so much aid and assistance from the agencies on behalf of the State would do what it is doing.  I will ask the office of the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to make contact and ensure not only that the remaining jobs are safe but to see if anything can be done to save the jobs that may potentially go to Kuala Lumpur.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021022600002#DD00300","speaker":"1653","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1614335400,"counter":97,"content":"<p>Order of Business agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Report of Committee of Selection: Motion","time":1614335400,"counter":98,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021022600002#GG00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1614335400,"counter":99,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThat the Sixth Report of the Committee of Selection be laid before the Seanad. <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021022600002#GG00400","speaker":"1653"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1614335400,"counter":100,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.\r\n\r\nSitting suspended at 1.10 p.m. and resumed at 1.30 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Covid-19 (Transport): Statements","time":1614335400,"counter":101,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021022600002#NN00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1614335400,"counter":102,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, to the Chamber for statements on Covid-19 and transport matters.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021022600002#NN00200","speaker":"1659"},{"type":"speech","time":1614335400,"counter":103,"content":"<p>I am very glad to be here to speak to Senators today on the impacts of Covid-19 on the transport sector.  The Minister of State, Deputy Hildegarde Naughton, will follow later this afternoon with statements to the Seanad on the impacts of Covid-19 on the aviation sector.  I will speak to the detail of Covid-19 impacts on other sectors of transport and will also update Members on plans to introduce mandatory hotel quarantine for international travellers from 20 designated countries.<\/p> <p>Early this week the Government published the Covid-19 Resilience &amp;amp; Recovery 2021: The Path Ahead plan.  The plan outlines a cautious and measured approach for managing Covid-19 over the coming year.  For the moment, despite the significant progress that we as a country have made since January, daily case numbers and the number of hospital admissions due to Covid remain high.  It is not currently possible to introduce any easing of restrictions, except for the phased and safe return of children to in-school education.<\/p> <p>I sincerely hope that as we progress through March, we will see the continued reduction of daily case numbers and that all children will be able to return to in-school education by mid-April.  This, however, is not guaranteed and it relies on the continued effort of all our citizens.  I know this is extremely hard and a lot of people are at breaking point.  If we can stick with the plan as advised by our public health experts and continue to make progress and increase the pace of vaccine roll-out, we can in the late spring and summer look forward to some relaxation of measures and be able to meet with our loved ones outdoors once again.<\/p> <p>As Members are aware, Covid-19 has had significant impacts on the transport sector, many of which will be long-lasting in their effects.  I will briefly take the opportunity to outline these and the steps we have taken to address them.<\/p> <p>I will now set out the testing and mandatory hotel quarantine measures in the context of international travel.  As an island, Ireland is heavily reliant in high-quality international connectivity.  This Government, and the preceding one, have kept borders open throughout the pandemic to maintain critical supply lines and for essential travel.  Since the pandemic began, travel to Ireland by air and sea for most of the past year has been at 95% below 2019 levels.  There has been a huge and sustained negative impact on the maritime and aviation sectors.  The Government has acted to balance the safety of our nation with the need to maintain our connectivity and supply chains, all in the context of our position on a shared island and our membership of the EU.<\/p> <p>More recently, experience of new and more infectious variants of the virus have necessitated intensified safeguards to prevent importation and the spread of these variants of concern.  The Government has mandated that any person travelling to Ireland must have taken and have proof of a negative polymerase chain reaction, PCR, test in advance of travel.  Within a day of news emerging of the new variant circulating in the UK we banned flights from Great Britain to Ireland.  We have stopped visa-free travel from South America.  We also have put the quarantine requirement for passengers without an exemption on a mandatory, legal footing.<\/p> <p>This week, the Government has introduced a Bill to provide for mandatory quarantine in hotels for travellers arriving in Ireland from certain designated states.  These will be designated based on the assessed level of risk by public health experts, and this assessment will take into account the presence of new Covid variants of concern.<\/p> <p>All travellers arriving in Ireland who have been in designated states within the previous 14 days will be required to quarantine.  This includes anyone who enters Ireland via Northern Ireland.  Any such travellers will have to book their quarantine in advance and present themselves directly at their quarantine facility following their entry to the State.  Travellers will not be allowed to go anywhere else first.<\/p> <p>The Government is determined to enact this legislation as quickly as possible.  It was passed by the D&aacute;il this week and will come to this House next week.<\/p> <p>Restrictions on international travel will be kept under constant review to ensure travel does not become a weak link in our response as domestic transmission is brought under control.  The Government will continue to balance the imposition of such restrictions, and their impact on morbidity and mortality associated with the disease, with protecting civil liberties.<\/p> <p>I will now turn to the maritime sector.  Over the past year, shipping and ports operations have responded strongly and nimbly to maintain continuity of supply chains of essential goods while mitigating the risk of virus transmission, ensuring both workers and passengers are transported as safely as possible.  I am deeply appreciative of those efforts.  The maritime sector is essential to the continued supply of goods, accounting as it does for 90% of Ireland's international trade in volume terms and I know this sector is facing challenges, not least of which is the significant decline in passenger numbers.<\/p> <p>The haulage and freight industry has also played a huge role in keeping flows of goods moving into and out of the country during the pandemic while also adapting to the huge changes to our supply chains arising from Brexit.  Challenges to the sector have also been compounded by the imposition of testing by some EU member states for international hauliers.  A new French law came into force on 28 January requiring truck drivers arriving in France on direct ferries from Ireland to show a negative Covid PCR test result.  My Department quickly established and funded the operation and supply of Covid tests for commercial drivers travelling to France.  As of 23 February, 4,294 tests have been carried out.  The numbers testing positive are very low, with only ten positive cases, representing 0.23% of the total tested.  My Department is in regular engagement with the French Government and will continue to keep this situation under close review.<\/p> <p>With regard to public transport, just as there has been a very significant drop in international travel passenger numbers to Ireland, impacting our maritime and aviation sectors, so too have we seen a similar downward trend on public transport passenger numbers.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Eamon Ryan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2028\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2028&amp;amp;pid=EamonRyanGP&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=26\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->On public transport, passenger numbers are between 10% and 25% of 2019 levels for rail and bus services, respectively.  Passenger volumes have remained stable during January 2021, with overall public transport demand at 22% of pre-Covid levels.  However, there has been a slight increase in demand in recent weeks, with passenger numbers now close to 25% of pre-Covid levels.  This drop in passenger numbers has inevitably had financial implications for the public transport sector as fare revenues have plummeted.  As part of the 2021 Estimates process, my Department secured significantly higher than normal levels of funding of &euro;670 million for public service obligation, PSO, and Local Link services.  Most recently, Government approved an extension of the temporary supports for the commercial bus sector, which were first introduced last summer.  These supports ensure that public transport services continue to be available to essential workers across the economy and for broader societal reasons.<\/p><p>Road safety services have also been impacted negatively and arrangements have been put in place to assist those affected.  I do not have time in this opening statement to go through all of the measures in detail, but I am happy to come back to these in my closing remarks if Members would like more information.  Suffice it to say, one of the areas I am most concerned about is the existing and growing backlog in driver testing services.  This is necessitated by the reduction in non-essential activity across the economy, and at currently in level 5, driver tests are available only to those who are involved in essential services.  Significant backlogs have resulted from this.  I am in discussions with officials regarding how we can return to the normal target for the maximum waiting time, which is approximately ten weeks.  It is important to recognise that there are no quick fixes and that the continuing build-up of applications mean that it will take some time to achieve this target.<\/p><p>On sustainable mobility, Professor Philip Nolan said last week that we should aim for an outdoor summer this year.  My Department and the National Transport Authority, NTA, are taking steps to provide for additional space for walking and cycling.  This includes a rethinking of our allocation of road space and ensuring we place the pedestrian and the cyclist at the centre of our thinking.  This reallocation of space will contribute to delivery of the Government's roadmap for reopening society and business.  It provides additional safe commuting capacity at a time public transport must run at low capacity for essential workers, who still need to travel to work.  It improves our capacity to socially distance in urban centres and will support the gradual reopening of retail and commercial spaces.<\/p><p>While we can begin to look ahead to better days in the summer, I would like to state unequivocally that I am in no doubt about the scale and depth of the challenges ahead of us, which are like none faced in most of our lifetimes.  They are felt in all sectors of our society, and not least in transport.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021022600002#NN00300","speaker":"1465","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1614335400,"counter":105,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an gCathaoirleach Gn&iacute;omhach.  It is good to see her in the Chair and I welcome the Minister.  It is probably no exaggeration to say it has been a frightening and scary time for all of us in the country.  The Health (Amendment) Bill 2021 on quarantining was before the D&aacute;il this week and it is due before this House on Monday.  While that is a necessary step, it is important that it be balanced with human rights and that is what the Government is doing.<\/p> <p>This is also a time for a reassessment of where we are as a country.  At a meeting of the Joint Committee on Climate Action this week, chaired by Deputy Leddin of the Green Party, we examined emissions from transport, in particular, and different sectors.  If we think about what has happened over the past year where there has been an overall reduction of only 6% in our emissions during a time most of us were at home, it shows the scale of the challenge before us.  We have this opportunity, as the Minister said, if we are going to all be at home, to invest in the kind of transport infrastructure that will make our lives the best they can be while we are in our communities.  We also have an opportunity to bring back economic activity to areas that have not experienced such activity previously.<\/p> <p>We know that international travel will be reduced so what do we do instead?  We must, therefore, reinvest in local tourism and transport.  That is what was laid down in the programme for Government.  We did not know at the time these measures were being put in the programme for Government, however, that they were going to be even more important now than ever before.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Pauline O'Reilly:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=PaulineOreilly&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=26\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We have had many Green wins over the past couple of weeks but they are wins for the Government and society as a whole.  There was &euro;68 million for greenways, with quite a significant portion of that going to Galway, for instance.  We are still seeing the July stimulus funding dripping into communities.  We have seen &euro;240 million for cycling and walking, with 248 new promised staff.  We need to see action on all of that quickly in order to build up our economies.  In my constituency of Galway, having a cycle bridge over the Corrib across the old Clifden railway line will be transformative.<\/p><p>Previously, we discussed roads projects.  We need to address that elephant in the room as well.  When we are looking at emissions, overall there has been a 136% increase in transport emissions in a ten-year period in Ireland and we are now looking at a reduction overall of 7% per annum.  We will need to change the way we look at transport drastically and that means looking at what roads are necessary and what roads are not necessary.  When we look at roads that can bypass towns and bring back public realm spaces in those towns and improve the quality of life in terms of air quality, those are opportunities where we could say that roads actually make people's lives better.  In particular, I am thinking of such places as Moycullen and Tipperary town.  Some of my party's Deputies, such as Deputies &Oacute; Cathasigh and Leddin, would be behind those kinds of projects that would bring life back, particularly where arterial routes are damaging people's quality of life.  A great deal of freight goes along some of these roads that need to be upgraded in order to make people's lives better.<\/p><p>The Minister mentioned freight.  It is a good opportunity to talk about how we manage freight.  Dr. Tadhg O'Mahony came before the Joint Committee on Climate Action of which I am a member earlier on this week and stated that a key plank of improving the sustainability of freight in the EU is achieving a modal shift to rail.  Now that we really have this European funding and other funding, how are we to put that in place to make our lives better?  Rail is long term.  It is outside of what we are looking at but now is probably the time to look at investing in that Waterford-to-Limerick line and the western rail corridor as well.  If we will be switching to electric, maybe it is freight that we should look at first because that is where a great deal of the emissions and the pollution are emanating from.  It is certainly quite clear that even a switch to electric vehicles does not bring the quality-of-life part of the economy back to areas in which we will really need to invest heavily in the aftermath of this pandemic, and as we plan for the future in how we deal with tourism, how we get around and how we deal with a better quality of life for our children that we have seen glimpses of throughout this pandemic.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021022600002#OO00200","speaker":"1693","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1614335400,"counter":107,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister.  Looking around me, we are surrounded by members of the Green Party, including the Acting Chairperson, Senator Garvey.  It is a happy situation that the Acting Chairperson is here.<\/p> <p>I want to express my agreement with Senator Pauline O'Reilly that we have to rethink many issues, but the rethinking is not all one way.  It is not all rethinking on the part of people who are not environmentalists.  Some environmentalists have to do a bit of rethinking too.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Michael McDowell:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=719\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=26\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I will give the House one example.  An Taisce and members of the green movement - I am not so sure of the position of members of the Green Party, in particular - were all against one-off housing in rural areas as a bad thing.  With the roll-out of broadband technology and such developments we are going to have to rethink this notion that it is a good idea to concentrate people in villages and towns for environmental reasons.  I wonder if that is sustainable and I do not think that it coincides with what most Irish people want.  If one looks at an Ordnance Survey map of the 1800s or 1900s, for example, our population has always been scattered and it is naive in my view to think that the orthodoxy of ten years ago, which is that we should get everybody into villages and towns and wave a magic wand over society, is the way forward.  I do not think that it is any more.<\/p><p>My second point is to ask environmentalists to consider the following matter: if we have all electric or hydrogen vehicles in ten or 15 years' time, there is still going to be the same requirement for people to move from A to B for various reasons and there is no reason to give up on roads.  I agree with Senator Pauline O&rsquo;Reilly in that roads are not inherently bad but there is no need to stop the road to Sligo or to stop connecting the north west by really usable roads to Dublin.  It should still be a convenient journey for our hydrogen-powered lorries and electric-powered cars.<\/p><p>I agree with Senator O&rsquo;Reilly that rail is a good thing.  In ways I am a railway buff myself but I have to say that there has to be a sense of the realities here.  When talking about rail for cargo transport in Ireland, this is a model that we had in the 19th century and up to halfway through the 20th century but it is really not that efficient to take stuff off and on to trains and to put it onto vans and lorries for distribution around the country.  Anyone interested in railways would have looked at the Reshaping of British Railways Beeching report and at how lorries killed the railways, branch lines and much freight transport.  We must be practical about these things.  Lorry transport, whether it is hydrogen or electric or whatever, is going to be an important part of the country&rsquo;s transport from now on.<\/p><p>Moving to Dublin city, I was involved professionally in a matter which had to do with planning for satellite towns outside of Dublin in Kildare.  I noticed that Senator Martin referred in the House to people possibly commuting from Kildare to Dublin by bike.  God bless them if they are going to do that in the winter in Ireland.  However, we have to consider if it is a good idea for people to spend two or three hours of their lives commuting daily in and out of cities.  The wider implication of that is that we have to rethink our cities.  What is going on in Dublin at the moment is an absolute scandal.  We are not rethinking Dublin at all.  It is okay to say we will have more cycleways.  I support and have always supported the idea of making Dublin a much more cycle-friendly city.  I will not give out about that but I believe the idea of reimagining Dublin requires much more radical approaches to urban renewal and planning.  The Minister will know from our own patch of the woods that the proposal to build a 14-storey apartment block on a suburban road in Donnybrook, a tower block, is an extraordinary departure from what would normally be considered decent planning.  Density and high-rise are not necessarily the same thing.  One only has to look at Portobello in the Minister&rsquo;s own constituency, or Oxmantown, to see high-density occupation of land but no high-rise.<\/p><p>There is a need to bring the community along with things.  In Dublin, in particular, the changes to the road use, the pedestrianisation and the de-vehicularisation of areas have to be planned very carefully because when &ldquo;normality&rdquo; returns, if ever it does, we are going to be faced with a rotten core at the city centre if we do not have access to it.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Michael McDowell:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=719\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=26\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Not everyone can go by bus or by train.

People have to give up the idea that buses are the answer to everything.  Individual mobility is all important.<\/p><p>This is not a time for people who wear their environmental credentials on their sleeve to say that this is the moment when we rethink everything.  It is time for them to do a lot of rethinking.  Where are the Luas lines to Lucan and Finglas?  I want to see many practical changes from those instead of simply talking about environmentalism, and I mean that in the warmest possible sense.

At this juncture it would be right to recognise the front-line workers in the transport sector working in both public and private companies who have heroically continued with their duties over the past couple of months.  It is often forgotten that they are a key part of the front-line effort and worked so diligently.<\/p> <p>There is no doubt that Covid-19 has wreaked havoc across the economy, none more so than in the transport sector.  Twelve or 13 months ago we thought problems would emanate from Brexit and that the inability to trade goods between North and South and east and west would be the biggest challenges of the aviation sector.  Unfortunately, that has paled into insignificance.  Covid-19 has devastated hundreds of businesses and tens of thousands of jobs and livelihoods across the aviation sector.  Undoubtedly, aviation has been the worst affected sector in terms of size and scale of operations and the livelihoods that have been impacted as a result of the job losses and very significantly reduced incomes, which has caused enormous anxiety and stress in many homes across the country.<\/p> <p>Passenger activity through our airports is running at a fraction of normal levels.  Every business in the sector is haemorrhaging money, notwithstanding the very significant State supports available, which are welcome but are not enough or not necessary to save the businesses through this prolonged period.  Sadly, the optimism of last autumn with the expectation that by early this year we would be into the opening up of foreign travel has faded.  Unfortunately, the chance of foreign travel happening any time this year will be very limited.  That has put further pressure on the businesses and the communities across the aviation sector.<\/p> <p>There is no doubt that the biggest challenge for our country, as an island nation that depends on connectivity and supports a tourism business across the economy that employs between 150,000 and 250,000 people, is the protection of that connectivity.  We need to retain key routes from all our airports to ensure we have a base on which to restart the activity.  The best estimates suggest that we will not be getting back to 2019 passenger numbers until 2024.<\/p> <p>In protecting key routes it is important that we do not look only to Dublin.  We have got to protect routes into Shannon, Cork and other airports but Shannon, which is the airport I know best, supports the economic, tourism and business activity across the mid-west and the west.  It is important that continued funding be provided not just for capital projects but also for the ongoing maintenance and operations of the airport.  We have to keep these businesses effectively on life support until we get back to a level of normality, whatever that might be, but we will get to that point.  We will get to the other side but the airport workers, airline workers and all those in the ancillary businesses who have dedicated their lives to the development of businesses and to supporting the tourism sector attached to the aviation business now need our support and the State should not be found wanting in that regard.<\/p> <p>There is no doubt that our airlines are in very significant financial straits.  Looking at some of the statistics, approximately 20 airlines across the EU got state support last year.  Countries like Denmark, which is around the same size as Ireland, gave SAS &euro;583 million.  Finnair got &euro;286 million from the Finnish Government.  In terms of the bigger airlines, France provided Air France with &euro;7 billion.  Germany gave Lufthansa &euro;9 billion.  Belgian Airlines got &euro;290 million and the Netherlands gave KLM &euro;3.4 billion.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Timmy Dooley:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2015\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2015&amp;amp;pid=TimDooley&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=26\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I believe the State will have to put its shoulder behind the airlines and take a strategic shareholding in Aer Lingus and Ryanair, if necessary, to ensure their continued commitment to this country.  I am not, as some might suggest, talking about nationalising these airlines.  It is about taking a strategic interest at the right time to protect connectivity and, over time, that shareholding can be factored back into the marketplace when we return to a more normalised environment.  We did the same thing for the pillar banks when we had a financial crisis in that the State stepped in to protect our banking system and banking sector.  I believe now is the time for the State to look very seriously at taking a strategic interest in airlines, if necessary, and other airline-associated businesses to ensure they are there to protect the economy that this sector supports when we start to build our way out of this.<\/p><p>Although it is not directly related to transport and relates instead to people who are impacted by the pandemic, I believe the Government is going to have to hold the feet of the banks to the fire again.  They got support in the past and that was the right thing for the economy.  However, I am certainly hearing from people who have lost their jobs and who are on very reduced incomes as a result of Covid, particularly in the aviation sector, that banks are not really engaging in terms of the moratorium.  The reality for many people is that the rainy day fund is gone, savings are gone and moneys that were put aside to educate kids have been used just to sustain life over the past 12 months, yet the banks are still pressurising people, where there were moratoriums on loans and mortgages, to try to find some non-existent source of these moneys.  These people are hard-working and have always shown a commitment to repaying their debts, and they will do so again.  They just need a little time to get through this.<\/p><p>On the issue of e-scooters, I understand there are proposals to bring legislation to the House and the Minister might clarify when he hopes to do that.  It is a method of decarbonising our transport systems in a micro-way, but it is also a personalised mode of transport during this pandemic crisis that gives a social distance to people who want to commute.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021022600002#RR00200","speaker":"1655","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1614335400,"counter":112,"content":"<p>I call Senator John McGahon, who is sharing time with Senator John Cummins.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021022600002#SS00200","speaker":"1659"},{"type":"speech","time":1614335400,"counter":113,"content":"<p>I want to raise two issues.  The first is the practical changes that will arise in transport after Covid.  For the last seven years, I commuted from Dundalk to Dublin and I used a tax saver ticket.  A tax saver ticket is a yearly ticket and a person can use it seven days a week.  If I was to get the Matthews bus from my home town to Dublin, it would cost roughly &euro;2,744 a year, and I could use it at any stage over the seven days.  For the last two years, I decided to get Irish Rail, and an annual ticket with Irish Rail cost roughly &euro;3,620.  Depending on their tax bracket, people could save between &euro;1,000 and 1,300, so they are a great idea.  The problem is that Covid has totally changed what is a normal working week for so many people.  The concept of working from home is going to continue and, as a result, we need to respect and understand that, and tailor commuter tickets to meet that demand.<\/p> <p>Last July, I wrote to the National Transport Authority, NTA, to ask what its plans were to introduce, say, a three-day tax saver ticket, or at least a multi-day ticket that allows hop on, hop off travel, so people are not wasting money by buying something that lasts them a year.  The NTA came back to me to say it was trying to technically facilitate this on the Leap card system.  I followed up in September and October and I got the same response, although, admittedly, I have not followed up since then.  The point is we are now getting to the stage of Covid where people will start to migrate back into offices in the next couple of months and we need to plan for that.  The way we do that is by facilitating multi-share tickets on the Leap card system.<\/p> <p>While this is not a direct responsibility of the Minister, I would like that, at some stage in the future when he is dealing with the NTA, he would ask for an update on that matter.  If we can get that ready to be rolled out the minute people start returning to office life in the summer or in September, it would be a good idea.  The most important point is that it saves people money and gives them more money in their back pockets.<\/p> <p>I want to raise the issue of the bike share schemes and e-scooter schemes with regard to transport levels.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator John McGahon:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=JohnMcGahon&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=26\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Bike share schemes should not only be provided in Dublin, Cork, Galway and other highly populated cities but should also be provided in large and small provincial towns across the country.  I am from the town of Dundalk, which has a population of approximately 40,000 people.  It is an excellent area.  A large number of people are employed in multinational companies and there are thousands of students in Dundalk Institute of Technology, DkIT.  We have great amenities so a bike share scheme could really work in a town like Dundalk.  I would appreciate it if bike share companies not only went Dublin, Galway or Belfast but went to our provincial towns and competed in them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021022600002#SS00300","speaker":"1670","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1614335400,"counter":115,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House.  While there are many challenges across the transport sector, not least in aviation, which I know we will speak about soon, but in the coach tourism sector and across the tourism sector as a whole, there are also many opportunities.  The upgrade of the N24, which Senator O'Reilly referenced in her contribution, is one of those opportunities I would like to speak about.  The N24 is the main arterial route between Waterford and Limerick cities.  It is an integral piece of infrastructure linking the western and mid-western regions with the south east.  It is probably even more important now in the context of Brexit and the onward connection to Rosslare Europort with direct links to Europe.<\/p> <p>I am sure the Minister has been on this road and that he would agree it is one of the worst national primary routes in the country.  The consultation documents for the Cahir to Limerick route, which closed last week, stated that the average speed of cars on the route currently stood at a pathetic 60 km\/h to 65 km\/h.  Data show collisions on the route are higher than average.  As the Minister knows, the target in the national planning framework is that inter-urban travel speed should be at least 90 km\/h.  We have a long way to go to get this route is up to the required standards.<\/p> <p>There have been many false dawns in relation to this project.  When I was in the University of Limerick, I travelled  from Waterford for four years on this road and at that time there was talk about route selections.  However, here we are 15 years later having further consultations on it.  I know the Minister's party was supportive of this route as an alternative to the M20 linking Cork and Limerick but now that that is progressing there is a fear among some in the counties along the route - Limerick, Tipperary, Kilkenny, Waterford and Wexford - that this will be lost as part of a review of the capital plan.  I ask the Minister for reassurances in that regard.  In order to future proof this route post-2040, and for future generations, it has to be at a minimum of dual carriageway standard.  It will also need to reduce travel times between Waterford and Cork cities via Cahir.  There has been a request by Members from across the counties to meet with the Minister.  I would appreciate it if he would accede to that request.<\/p> <p>I support the comments by Senator Dooley on the provisions regarding e-scooters, which I understand will be part of the miscellaneous transport Bill.

Perhaps the only positive of this pandemic has been that many of us have discovered or rediscovered some of the fantastic parks, greenways and amenities within our 5 km.  In my area of the south inner city, the Phoenix Park has been a lifeline for so many.  There is agitation to make the Phoenix Park less accessible to cars and more walking and cycling friendly.<\/p><p>Tens of thousands of people have discovered hidden gems in my area, such as the Irish National War Memorial Gardens in Islandbridge, which is home to Usher Celtic football club and the Civil Service GAA football club.  In that spirit, I welcome the Minister's recent allocation of funding to develop a Liffey greenway from Heuston Station to Islandbridge but I ask that he go further.  There is an opportunity to create a unique urban greenway which would serve hundreds of thousands of Dubliners, by upgrading the greenway on the south side of the River Liffey through Chapelizod as far as Waterstown Park and restoring the magnificent silver bridge across the Liffey to link up with Farmleigh.  That is a former footbridge used by workers travelling to Farmleigh from places such as Palmerstown and Lucan, which is closed and falling into dereliction.<\/p><p>Astonishingly, there is no bridge other than the M50 across the Liffey between Chapelizod and Lucan.  In other words, there is no way for somebody to cross the Liffey on foot, bike or public transport for approximately 9 km.  This could be addressed by restoring the silver bridge and providing a pedestrian entrance to the Farmleigh estate.  Combined with the planned upgrade of walking and cycling routes in the Phoenix park, this would create a unique urban greenway in the heart of the city, stretching from Heuston Station through Chapelizod to Palmerstown, across Farmleigh and back through the park to Cabra, Stoneybatter and Grangegorman.<\/p><p>Such an amenity could serve hundreds of thousands of locals, similar to the Howth cliff walk, and provide those visiting the city with an experience difficult to encounter in another capital city by accessing the gems we have such as the Phoenix Park.  It is something the Minister's party colleague, Deputy O'Gorman, worked on on Fingal County Council along with my party councillor, Councillor Tuffy.  However, I ask the Minister to take the opportunity of his time in government to explore the possibility of providing the city with this lasting legacy.<\/p><p>The Minister, Deputy Ryan, has shown himself to be dynamic over the last couple of months in his Department, in particular in prioritising these types of projects.  These would have a transformative effect on the west side of the city and would be a lasting legacy.<\/p><p>I would like to associate myself with Senator Dooley's comments on transport workers.  They have kept this country going and they are front-line workers in this pandemic.  It was quite a shocking that a disproportionate number of London transport workers suffered and died due to Covid-19, keeping London going over the course of the pandemic.

As someone who has used public transport to access this institution during the course of this pandemic, I have seen first hand the effort they have put in during this period.  It is important we reflect and acknowledge that here in terms of the statements.<\/p> <p>We do not want to encourage people where it is unnecessary that they travel, not least beyond the 5 km restrictions in place at the moment.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Niall &Oacute; Donnghaile:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2477\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2477&amp;amp;pid=NiallODonnghaile&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=26\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->For me, this period presents the Minister, his Department and those of us in these institutions with the opportunity to reflect on how we reimagine our public transport network and infrastructure across the entirety of this island.  It also gives us an opportunity, as other colleagues have regularly said, not only to reimagine how we can improve services and infrastructure but also to take the time to think about what transportation is going to be like after this pandemic.  The needs of people, workers and commuters will fundamentally change as a result of the experience of the past year and more.<\/p><p>That is part of the reason I was so disappointed and shocked at the news, put out under the radar somewhat in the midst of the pandemic, of the cut to a number of Bus &Eacute;ireann Expressway services to destinations throughout the island.  The Belfast to Dublin route had in excess of 1 million journeys in 2019 and that Expressway service has been cut.  To me, that defies all known logic.  I do not understand that decision nor why the Minister has not been more vocal in challenging it and, in the longer term, working to address the removal of that service which is much utilised by visitors, tourists, students and workers.<\/p><p>One of the key commitments of the Government in the New Decade, New Approach document has been the development of the high-speed rail connection between Belfast and Dublin and its connection to Cork and to Derry and the north west.  Will the Minister take the opportunity to update us on how that fundamentally transformative project is progressing?  I know there has been support for it from the Executive, councils along the eastern corridor, the Government in Dublin and partners in the European Union.  I have extended an invitation to the Minister, Deputy Ryan, and the Minister in the North, Nichola Mallon, to come before the Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement to present on that project.  I hope he will take us up on that invitation.<\/p><p>I caveat my final remarks by saying that I understand this issue does not fall within the Minister's departmental brief.  However, the pausing of certain services within the Passport Office over the pandemic period is an important issue that will affect transportation into the future.  I understand this had to happen to minimise unnecessary travel.  I ask the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Passport Office, through the Minister, to take the time to plan how we will meet an inevitable backlog in that service.  The Secretary General of the Department of Foreign Affairs has acknowledged that Passport Office staff are already under huge stress in trying to meet demand.  As someone who engages with the Passport Office regularly, I can say that it does a fantastic, first-class job but it needs more support.  It needs to ensure that once staff come back, when it is safe to do so, there is not a huge backlog to be waded through.  People who are waiting for that service need to know that a backlog will not prolong waiting any undue period for a passport.  I hope the Minister does not mind me asking him to do that and I hope it is something he will consider taking forward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021022600002#UU00300","speaker":"1688","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1614335400,"counter":121,"content":"<p>I echo the comments of Senators McDowell and &Oacute; Donnghaile when they talk about reimagining our transport system.  We have an opportunity to do this post Covid and particularly post Brexit.  I ask the Minister to be even more imaginative.  Senator McDowell referred to hydrogen fuel, but we need to look at how technology is going to shape our transport networks over the next ten years.  For instance, we have seen the use of drone technology in Oranmore to deliver food.  We will see drone technology used to a far greater extent.  I have no doubt we will see automated vehicles in place by the end of this decade.  That will require much regulation on the part of the Minister's Department.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Malcolm Byrne:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;MemberID=1111\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1111&amp;amp;pid=MalcolmByrne&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=26\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The 6G technologies that are currently being developed will allow for the greater use of autonomous vehicles.  The rise of 6G will also give the conspiracy theorists something else to complain about.  It is important in terms of future-proofing the transport infrastructure in this country that we look at how technology will change what we are doing.<\/p><p>To come back to immediate matters, with the twin whammies of Covid and Brexit we have seen our ports come under a lot of pressure but Rosslare Europort has started to boom at last.  I want to hear a commitment that we will move towards classifying Rosslare Europort as a tier 1 port and that it will get the necessary investment to allow it to continue to expand.  Year on year, from January of last year to January of this year, the amount of freight passing through Rosslare increased by over 440%.  Critical to that, and I ask the Minister this in the context of the review of the national development plan that is happening at the moment, is the completion of the M11 motorway from Oylegate to Rosslare.  A previous Senator was right in saying that motorways make sense from an environmental point of view.  We are now seeing trucks and lorries clogging up villages like Oylegate, Kilrane and Rosslare.  It is adding time for our hauliers travelling to Rosslare and disturbing the quality of life in those villages.  That as a priority within the national development plan is critical.<\/p><p>In terms of the development of the railways, I would also make the case for the much underutilised Rosslare to Dublin railway.  Part of the problem is that once one gets to Bray, as the Minister knows, the main interurban trains have to sit behind the DART.  That delays the trains and it remains a problem.<\/p><p>A big challenge to which the Minister made reference is around the delays in driving tests.  Those who are waiting now for their driving tests have been waiting 30 weeks.  I accept those with a job in emergency services are being given priority, but young people waiting for the test are prohibited in many cases from being able to avail of certain jobs and it increases their insurance costs.  Insurance costs for young motorists are already prohibitive but they are waiting 30 weeks.  There has been talk about getting additional testers and so on put it place but I am not satisfied with the response to date that, as we come out of this pandemic, we will be able to address that waiting list quickly enough.<\/p><p>On the tourism side, we need clarification around the issue of a vaccines passport.  When we move beyond this pandemic and allow travel between countries to resume, we need clarity.  It is my view that we should have an EU-wide vaccines passport.  My concern is that different countries would try to adapt different measures or, in the absence of governments doing it, that private companies would decide to try to offer their own system of vaccines passports.  I would not be surprised if Michael O'Leary, for instance, decided to try to introduce a Ryanair vaccine passport and I am certain he will find ways to charge for that.  We need a clear Government position on this issue and it needs to be co-ordinated at a European level.<\/p><p>The Government's approach is right that it should be data, not dates, that determine when we get through this but we also need clarity on when we will be able to allow people to start travelling again.  The pressure will arise once the elderly and vulnerable are vaccinated.  People will start to ask why they cannot go and travel.  This will be important to the tourism sector and to the public, who will be asking each of us in this House this question.<\/p><p>The issue around mandatory quarantining and so on is, to me, a logistics issue.  I cannot figure out why it is something else that has been piled onto the Department of Health.  Why, for instance, from a transport of view, can a tender not go out to tour operators?  I refer to companies like Abbey Ireland and UK and others, who are professionals in terms of knowing how to deal with large groups of people coming into the country, getting off planes and getting to hotels.  It is a very vulnerable sector.  Why can companies like that not be engaged to manage this process?  I am concerned that something as important as this is being shoved again onto the Department of Health when, in reality, it is a logistics issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021022600002#VV00200","speaker":"1638","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1614335400,"counter":123,"content":"<p>The Minister is welcome.  There are many exciting plans in Galway at the moment.  I spoke about them earlier during the Commencement Matters debate.  They cover both road transport projects and public transport projects, including cycling and pedestrian infrastructure.  The Galway city ring road application is with An Bord Plean&aacute;la, and I hope there will be a decision on this in the coming months.  I have been a strong advocate of this important project.  The Moycullen bypass is due to commence soon.  Improvements to the N59 are ongoing.  I always say about roads that once they are built, that is it.  One can use them and one does not have to build them every year.  That they are built once is important.<\/p> <p>There are many projects related to the urban regeneration and development fund.  There are also many related to the rural regeneration and development fund, including a passing bay at the railway line at Oranmore, which the county council has been pushing.  The passing bay is important in promoting commuter rail.  The bus corridor on the old Dublin road is also important.  There is a range of projects under the urban regeneration and development fund to promote cycling, including one to develop the old railway viaducts over the Corrib, as mentioned by Senator O'Reilly.  I believe one can support and advocate for roads and public transport projects at the same time.  I have done so and will continue to do so.<\/p> <p>There is a great tradition, particularly in the countryside, of landowners giving land free of charge for small safety and improvement schemes, be it for a junction, to deal with a bad bend or for another purpose.  I acknowledge that and thank landowners who provide land.  I hope this tradition can be continued.  As the Minister knows, however, there are barriers to connectivity.  There are lands that are not available, be they in the country or the city.  A footpath may end suddenly in a town because a property juts out onto the road.  In my village, Moycullen, money is available but there is no land for a bus pull-in and a bus stop.  In other areas, similar issues arise where footpaths could be built.  That is a challenge for many of the projects.  I hope we can work together to solve some of the problems.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021022600002#XX00100","speaker":"1665"},{"type":"speech","time":1614335400,"counter":124,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the Chamber and thank him for the work he is doing and the contribution he is making, particularly on cycleways and walkways.

The average speed on it is well below the average speed between two urban cities, which is 90 km\/h.  The proposed new N24, connecting Limerick and Waterford, is vital to the future of the southern region.  Connections between Shannon Airport and Rosslare are all the more important after Brexit.  The proposed route will bypass four towns in County Tipperary, namely, Tipperary town, Cahir, Clonmel and Carrick-on-Suir.  Senator Pauline O'Reilly noted earlier how a bypass can enhance the town centres of all such towns.<\/p> <p>I assume the Minister is not aware that a letter was sent to his Department from Tipperary County Council to request a meeting.

I also thank all of the front-line workers in the transport sector who have played a pivotal role.  In particular, I thank the taxi drivers in our cities and towns, many of whom have delivered food to the most vulnerable.  I thank the bus drivers who have maintained the operation of bus fleets and train drivers who have done the same with the train service.<\/p> <p>I will raise with the Minister the issue of trains and rail transport.  If Covid has shown us anything, it has been the lunacy of the commute by car into city centres by tens of thousands of workers.  Day after day, workers got up as early as 5 a.m. to beat the traffic into city centres and battled the stress of trying to get to their places of work.  Now, after nearly a full year of working from home, people have pressed the reset button and asked what in God's name we were doing.  What were we doing to our mental health, the fabric of families and our children, who we were placing in childcare before the sun had even come up?  Many of us have been making these points for many years and said these exact words.  RT&Eacute;, in its &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programmes, has examined commuting and families having to put their kids into childcare at the crack of dawn.  All we get in response is an accepting nod and everything just moves on.  The reason was the rat race of which we are all part.  People either got with the rat race or they were left behind and someone else took their place in the rat race.  The pandemic has reset the button and we are collectively asking ourselves why the hell we were doing that to ourselves and taking apart the very fabric of society.  It was madness.<\/p> <p>I do not advocate that people simply withdraw from cities and places of commerce.  People benefit from working with colleagues.  I am a strong advocate of that as I come from a large urban centre.  I am saying that moving people from their places of residence to their places of work should and must be done by the same means as it is done in all other major cities on the planet, namely, high-quality public rail.  The reset of society offers many areas the opportunity to grasp that approach with both hands.  I know the Minister is passionate about rail transport and a strong advocate of it.  Hundreds of thousands of people commute to work in Dublin from counties Meath, Kildare, Louth and Wicklow.  Most of them are Dublin people who, through planning and housing policies, have been forced to move out to commuter areas.  The key difference between County Meath with its population of 200,000 people and the other commuting counties is that we are the only one of them whose county town has no rail connectivity.<\/p> <p>Eleven years ago, during the last Fianna F&aacute;il-Green Party Government, in which the Minister served, a significant piece of rail infrastructure was developed connecting a refurbished docklands station at the back of the convention centre to a station at Pace on the far side of Dunboyne in County Meath.  The new station, which is located off the M3, was built with a car park with 1,000 parking spaces to allow people to commute into the city.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Shane Cassells:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2448\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2448&amp;amp;pid=ShaneCassells&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=26\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->That line opened on 2 September 2010 and I was lucky to be one of the very first passengers from the Docklands to Dunboyne, along with the then Minister, Noel Dempsey, for the official opening.  There was a great hope that the railway order for the second phase, a continuation of the line to Navan, would be lodged the following year.  That was shelved, however, by the succeeding Government and it has remained on the shelf ever since.  Worse was the fact the National Transport Authority took it off its list of projects five years ago.<\/p><p>Thankfully, there is a reappraisal of this project.  The mood music from both the National Transport Authority and the Minister is far more positive.  I have said in this Chamber before that there is a big difference between this Minister and his predecessor.  The first is that this Minister has actually been to Navan.  I invited the previous Minister to come to Navan to see the difficulties.  He sat in the chair in which the Minister is sitting now and said he would be down but just not too early in the morning.  Five years later, I am still waiting for him.<\/p><p>I am confident that because this Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, is in the job, we might actually get somewhere.  He has seen the need for a town of over 30,000 people to have this rail connectivity.<\/p><p>I acknowledge the work of the National Transport Authority.  Only two weeks ago, it funded &euro;9 million worth of transport initiatives in my town.  I am very grateful to Anne Graham, Michael Aherne and others in the authority for that work.  The Minister has previously praised the efforts of Meath County Council.  I join him in acknowledging the work of the chief executive officer, Jackie Maguire, along with Des Foley and Nicholas Wyatt.  The appetite of the people of Meath is evident.  Meath County Council is doing an online survey with tens of thousands of people logging on every week.<\/p><p>Ultimately, however, the Minister and I know that the project will get the green light based on the scoring metric used by the National Transport Authority on whether it stacks up in terms of population.  It is not even the population now but the projected population in 2070.  If that metric does not stack up, the project will go nowhere.  Before Christmas, the Minister described the case for the Athenry to Claremorris line as weak.  It scored poorly on the National Transport Authority chart.  It is possible, when the numbers are crunched and the authority presents the report to the Minister, that Navan will score highly, possibly in the region of 0.8 to 1 in the baseline.<\/p><p>This is where the Minister needs to back up that report and add that additional element, namely, human beings, the people who rise at 5 a.m. to get to work and have had many years of family life taken away from them.  If the Minister does that, perhaps we can get that first train from Dunboyne to Navan central and we can celebrate together on the achievement of that project.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021022600002#YY00200","speaker":"1641","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1614335400,"counter":129,"content":"<p>After that speech, there is no doubt that the Minister will be back in Navan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021022600002#ZZ00200","speaker":"1674"},{"type":"speech","time":1614335400,"counter":130,"content":"<p>I welcome the significant funding recently announced for transport and roads projects in County Longford.

People can call 091509267 to make a submission.<\/p><p>I ask the Minister to acknowledge and speak on the priority of this project as a national piece of infrastructure.  It is going to complete 270 km of the Dublin to Galway cycleway route.  It is urgent that it is delivered as soon as possible.  We really look forward to the fact that the route selected will be the most scenic, sustainable and strategic option  There will be wonderful things to see and do coming through Ballinasloe, and potentially there will be opportunities to go through Coillte owned areas.  The key point is that landowners and farmers do not have to adhere to the submission deadline of 1 March.  They can engage with the project team at any time.  I encourage farmers and landowners to talk.  They will find out and understand that the FAQs that have been developed and upgraded focus on how the project will avoid severance for lands, look at natural boundaries and will try to ensure that farmers' needs and concerns are heard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021022600002#AAA00300","speaker":"1654"},{"type":"speech","time":1614335400,"counter":134,"content":"<p>I would like to welcome the Minister to the House and congratulate him on the great work he is doing on transport issues, and on greenways in particular. Some &euro;63 million in funding has been allotted for greenways, and &euro;240 million has been set aside for cycleways and walkways.  This will help to change the attitudes of people and how they behave.

One is Ireland West Airport Knock.  It is crucial for the west and north west of Ireland and connectivity to those areas, as well as for the airlines that operate from it.  There is a major crisis for air transport in the country at present.  I spoke to some pilots in the last couple of days.  They said it took Aer Lingus ten years to go from 40 to 70 aeroplanes and that it will take the airline ten years to go from where it is at present to the position it had 12 months ago.  That is significant.  The Government will have to do whatever is necessary to maintain connectivity, keep aeroplanes flying and to ensure we have two carriers operating out of this country, from Ireland West Airport Knock, Shannon Airport, Cork Airport and Dublin Airport.  This is crucial for our country.  We are an island nation and need connectivity.  Indeed, we see how the ferry transport sector is growing at present.  A Senator spoke earlier about how Rosslare is growing.  It is great to see that as well, because it helps our connectivity to Europe.<\/p><p>I welcome the Minister's thoughts on the western rail corridor.  It is very important that this rail would be opened for connectivity between Sligo, Galway, Limerick and Waterford.  I agree with the Minister that it should be a rail link.  If Sligo is to grow to be a city, there must be intercity connectivity with Galway, Limerick, Waterford, Cork and so forth, not only for passengers but also for freight from those regions.  They should be able to be connected by rail.<\/p><p>Like previous speakers, including Senator McDowell, I am a fan of hydrogen.  This is something that will have to be examined.  I cannot see every vehicle in the world being operated by battery only.  Hydrogen will have to operate in some shape or form when it is introduced, particularly for heavy vehicles, heavy goods vehicles and machinery.  There are problems associated with hydrogen.  Hydrogen stored in cars is very dangerous but there is technology available whereby hydrogen can be produced as it is being used, which is much safer.  It is an area that should be examined.  While I am a fan of hydrogen, I am also a fan of the battery car.  As other Senators said, we need to prepare for the autonomous car as well.  I mentioned this a number of years ago.  What is the Department of Transport doing in preparation for the autonomous car, particularly with regard to traffic lights and so forth?  Are they being upgraded and examined so we will not be behind the curve when all this takes place?<\/p><p>I congratulate the Minister on the work he is doing.  I believe an EU vaccine passport will be needed in the future.  Many of us had to have vaccine passports to travel to various other countries.  As one has to take certain vaccines before one can travel to China and other countries, I do not see why we cannot operate a vaccine passport for travelling in the EU over the next couple of years.  It is something the Government should be progressing through our partners in Europe.  It will affect us more than it will affect any other country in Europe because many of the other countries have good rail and bus services between them, whereas we require air transport.  A vaccine passport would be the way forward, in my view.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021022600002#AAA00400","speaker":"1636","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1614335400,"counter":136,"content":"<p>As Senator Lombard is not present, I gave Senator Burke the extra time and did not interrupt him.

It is a rare thing and it is great that we are all on the same hymn sheet in recognising the important work that is being done by the Department and the Minister and in overall agreement on looking again at how we share spaces and design for people and not just for cars.  It is great to hear this unified voice in the House.<\/p> <p>I thank the Minister for all of the funding that has been provided for rural transport.  It is absolutely transformative for people in rural Ireland, including young people, people with disabilities and older people.  It is hugely important for their social connectivity and their mental and physical health and well-being.  I thank the Minister for doing this because we have wanted it for a long time and the previous Minister did not seem to be tuned into this fact at all.<\/p> <p>Trucks are definitely necessary and nobody is talking about getting rid of trucks but we need to look at how we allow them to go straight through all of our villages and towns all of the time.  In other countries this is not the case.  Even within Dublin, DPD, An Post and a few other carriers have realised they do not always need to use trucks and they have switched to smaller electric tricycles.  I am thinking about Ennistymon, Ennis, Kilrush and other places in Clare.  What they do in other countries is that the trucks stop at the outskirts and the goods are moved to smaller vehicles.  We really need to look at how we move goods.  Trucks are very intimidating for people who are trying to cross the road and for small children.  They pose a threat because they are the biggest, heaviest and most dangerous vehicles on the roads.  We need to look at this.  Trucks are necessary but do they have to be allowed to access all areas all of the time?  This is not the case in other countries, where one feels safe in small towns and villages and where the trucks stop at the outskirts.  We are seeing this in Dublin already.<\/p> <p>I remind the Minister about the promise of a feasibility study on a rail line from Shannon Airport.  I am looking forward to it.  I also remind the Minister of the potential for stops in Crusheen and Cratloe on the train line from Galway to Limerick.<\/p> <p>On cycling infrastructure, a new manual is coming out from the NTA and I would like to know when will it come out.  If it does come out, it should not just be best practice but absolutely mandatory for the local authorities because the red paint will not cut the mustard anymore.  It is not good enough.  We need proper cycling infrastructure that is done well and we should stop wasting money on bad cycling infrastructure that does not increase the levels of cycling.  If there is a new manual, it will have to be mandatory for all of the road engineers of Ireland.<\/p> <p>We have regional airports and we will have to have regional rebalance when flights return.  We have to look at the distribution of flights.  They do not all need to go to Dublin.  A total of 90% of flights are still coming into and out of Dublin.  Whatever about increasing flights, we need to ensure incoming flights are distributed fairly.  It is just as important for people to visit the west coast of Clare and Cork as it is for them to come into our capital city.  We need to look at regional rebalance of the distribution of flights into our country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021022600002#CCC00100","speaker":"1659"},{"type":"speech","time":1614335400,"counter":138,"content":"<p>The Minister is welcome to the Chamber.

Senator McDowell seemed to indicate that perhaps people do not want to live in villages or towns.  I would ask the Senator to rethink this because there is huge benefit in being able to live within walking distance of one's local pub, school or church.  The villages and towns we have throughout the country, including the 19th century market towns in particular, have incredible architecture and are underused.  We have a lot of gaps and boarded-up high street premises.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Eamon Ryan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2028\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2028&amp;amp;pid=EamonRyanGP&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=26\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->There is a real question as we rethink this.  Do we let them just fall down and let the villages and towns go or do we bring life back into them to create these really vibrant, thriving, rural-urban communities?  I argue the latter would work best for a variety of reasons.  There would be a great sense of community, better use of existing resources, lower carbon and one could go for a drink at night without having to worry about being breathalysed on the way home.  I could go on.  It is a fundamental question.  Right across the country we are still not building in the centre.<\/p><p>I can put it another way.  Cork County Council is an example of this being done very well and better than other counties.  Sometimes I think it is because it has the scale, architects and planners and it really thought about it.  Perhaps I am biased because of my roots in Cork but we can look at the likes of Clonakilty, Skibbereen, Bantry - I could go on - where there is a concentration on the quality of the town and village that is seeing a revival.  It is bringing real success and it is where people want to go.  I absolutely take the Senator's point about rethinking and I am always open to new thinking.  There is a particular opportunity and the Government policy is to put town centre first.  I stand up for that and I am happy to debate it at length.<\/p><p>There was a range of other contributions, including from Senators Cummins and Ahearn.  I will meet the representatives from Tipperary.  Again going back to my roots, I met a group from Tipperary town, which is close to my Ryan roots.  That was not a matter of disrespect to others along the route.  I said in the D&aacute;il yesterday I am very happy to meet Oireachtas and council representatives about the N24.<\/p><p>Senator Dooley asked about the scooter legislation, which is due to be introduced as part of a miscellaneous provisions Bill.  It will first be published and get to pre-legislative scrutiny.  We know our committees are clogged but subject to that being done, it will come to the House and be a useful contribution.  Senator McGahon indicated that innovative projects like bike-sharing schemes might not just apply to cities and this supports my comments about town centre first thinking being applied to towns like Dundalk or Drogheda.  Senators Moynihan and Currie both raised the matter of the Phoenix Park, which is particularly sensitive and complex now as the park is both for those who go to it and use it and those who go through it.  How do we get that balance right?  It is a major challenge.  As Senator Cassells said, we must move away from the rat race mentality where all of us are stuck in cars clogging up the streets.  That is not working.  Reducing the demand for that through traffic would be a beneficial outcome of this time.  I will cede to their local knowledge in getting the balance right.<\/p><p>Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile spoke about a high-speed rail project and it will be part of a much wider rail review for the country.  It is not just about Dublin, Belfast and Cork.  We agreed to extend it to Derry and look at its potential.  A number of Senators have raised the question of the likes of the western rail corridor.  It is not just the N24 we need to look at but we must look at what to do with the rail line from Wexford to Waterford and Carrick-on-Suir, Clonmel, Cahir, Tipperary town, Bansha and upwards.  It is not just 19th century market towns that are our legacy.  We have a legacy of being the best rail builders in the world and there are strands of rail line left that we are not using, in effect.  Nobody really uses it because it is not designed to be used.  It is still there and just giving up on those assets would make questionable sense.  The Dublin to Belfast route will come under that wider rail review taking place this year.<\/p><p>Senator Byrne asked about Rosslare and to my mind that should be radically enhanced.  I spoke about it in the D&aacute;il yesterday again.

The recent revival and growth in Rosslare Europort is only the start. <\/p><p>Senator Kyne referred to Galway, where there are really significant projects in prospect.  We will face very significant choices in what we prioritise and the timelines around delivering various projects.  I hate to say this but I believe that we have the biggest problem in Galway because of our transport and planning system.  Things go awry when we do not put our planning and transport together.  There is a huge pattern of transport in Galway from one side of the city to the other.  There are real difficulties in this really congested city.  Key to this is not just the transport infrastructure, it is about putting the public transport infrastructure in first and the housing beside that.  The 15-minute town or city concept whereby one has access to everything within 15 minutes would enable us to reduce the overall volume of traffic and reduce congestion.  Planning and transport need to go together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021022600002#CCC00500","speaker":"1465","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1614335400,"counter":144,"content":"<p>The Minister's time is nearly up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021022600002#EEE00200","speaker":"1674"},{"type":"speech","time":1614335400,"counter":145,"content":"<p>I will conclude and I hope I do not disrespect any Member I may have left out.

He and Monsignor Horan were centrally involved.  Jim Ryan, a returned immigrant from Australia, talked up the prospects of Knock airport and we all thought at the time that he was mad.  He spoke of flights coming in and out every day, and everyone was nodding at him and saying \"That's right Jim\", but thank God he was right in the end.  That was only 25 or 30 years ago.  It shows that if one thinks big with a sense of vision and a sense of what is possible, think of what can change in 25 years.

I am pleased to speak to the House on the impacts of Covid-19 on aviation.  As the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, has spoken about plans to introduce mandatory quarantine for international travellers, I will not address that matter but I am happy to speak further on it in my closing remarks if that is required.<\/p> <p>The aviation sector has been massively impacted by the pandemic, with an almost total collapse in international air passenger traffic.  In our airports, traffic in 2020 was down 90% for the period from March to December.  Given this, and the continuing challenges and restrictions of Covid-19, it may take a number of years for the sector to return to 2019 levels.  We will only see the beginning of recovery when there is the possibility of a sustainable return to international travel.<\/p> <p>I would like to talk in more detail about the financial impact on aviation.  As I mentioned earlier, passenger traffic is significantly reduced.  Dublin Airport traffic levels are down 95%, and traffic levels in Shannon Airport and Cork Airport are down around 99%.  Both Dublin Airport Authority, DAA, and Shannon Group have implemented significant cost-saving measures, including the introduction of temporary pay cuts, reduced working weeks and voluntary severance schemes.<\/p> <p>Ryanair closed its aircraft base at Shannon Airport in October and announced in early November that it would cease all flights to Shannon Airport, given the collapse in forward bookings.  Ryanair resumed a limited and disrupted schedule, due to Covid-19 restrictions, to three UK and European destinations on 17 December for the Christmas holiday period and these services ended on 10 January.<\/p> <p>The 2020 annual results for Aer Lingus's parent company, International Airlines Group, IAG, were released this morning and they show a full-year operating loss for Aer Lingus of &euro;563 million, compared with a profit of approximately &euro;300 million in 2019.  These results reflect the serious impact that Covid-19 has had on Aer Lingus and on the airline industry in general, and the outlook for 2021 is not positive.  Aer Lingus is operating at just 15% capacity across its network and has also cancelled its services from Shannon Airport.  There are no scheduled services operating at Shannon Airport until April at the earliest, when Ryanair has indicated it will reopen its base and commence a summer schedule of flights.<\/p> <p>Our smaller airports have also been severely impacted.  In the case of Ireland West Airport Knock, all flight operations were suspended from the end of March to the start of July 2020.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Hildegarde Naughton:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2395\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2395&amp;amp;pid=HildegardeNaughton&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=26\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The airport took the decision to close during that period and had to temporarily lay off most of its staff.  With no scheduled flights, it was forced to close for a second time in 2020, from mid-November to mid-December.  Currently, Ireland West has no scheduled services but is open for general aviation.  The majority of the airport's staff are still on extended lay off.  Other regional airports, such as Kerry and Donegal, were able to remain open with skeleton staff due to the operation of a Government funded public service obligation, PSO, service.<\/p><p>In response to the enormous impact of Covid-19, a number of financial supports have been put in place.  The aviation sector has been able to avail of a range of Government supports for businesses.  This includes the wage subsidy scheme, waiver of commercial rates, tax clawback, the Covid restriction support scheme, the credit guarantee scheme, and the Strategic Bank Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, working capital scheme.  We estimate that over &euro;200 million in operational supports have already been made available to Irish airports and airlines under these schemes.  However, we recognise the need for targeted support for the aviation sector and, therefore, the Government has also agreed a revised &euro;80 million funding package specifically for Irish aviation in 2021.<\/p><p>I will elaborate on how this package has been allocated.  Some &euro;21.3 million is allocated to the regional airports programme.  A new programme for the period 2021-25 was published on 4 February.  This funding will provide capital and operational supports to the airports of Donegal, Kerry and Ireland West Airport Knock, and will meet contracted costs of PSO air services from Donegal and Kerry to Dublin.  Some &euro;32.1 million is allocated to the Covid-19 regional State airports programme.  My Department has developed this programme to provide capital and operational supports to Cork and Shannon airports in 2021.  Airports have already submitted a range of capital proposals, including a significant runway overlay project at Cork.  These proposals are currently being assessed by my Department.<\/p><p>Some &euro;26 million is allocated to the Covid-19 supplementary support schemes.  These schemes required state aid approval from the European Commission and I am pleased to confirm that the Commission announced its approval of the supplementary schemes on 24 February.  Under these schemes, &euro;20 million will be provided for compensation for State airports in light of Covid-19 impacts in 2020.  This funding will provide the airports with flexibility to roll out route incentives-charge rebates, in consultation with airlines, with a view to supporting recovery and growth of connectivity.  Up to &euro;6 million will also be made available to regional airports - Knock, Kerry and Donegal - that provide connectivity under the EU temporary framework in recognition of the impact of Covid-19 on their business.<\/p><p>Taken together, the level of committed Government supports for Irish aviation to date is in the region of &euro;280 million, which is a significant level of support by any measure.  My Department will continue to consider proposals for additional targeted support in light of the deepening crisis in the sector, in particular, in the event of the extension of restrictions on international travel throughout the year.  It stands to reason, however, that supports specifically designed to facilitate growth of air traffic can only be progressed at the appropriate time, taking account of the outlook for the easing of travel restrictions and improving wider epidemiological conditions.<\/p><p>In June 2020, the then Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport announced the formation of a task force for aviation recovery.  The task force was asked to set out recommendations for consideration to assist the Irish aviation sector to recover from the Covid-19 crisis.  The task force delivered its final report in July and recommendations broadly ranged from measures to improve the safety of air travel, to rebuilding regional and international connectivity, and to making financial support measures available to the sector.  The majority of the recommendations have been implemented.  Certain recommendations relating to the growth and incentivisation of air traffic can only be progressed when restrictions on international air travel are lifted.<\/p><p>The scale of the challenges created by Covid-19 are better understood now than when the task force was appointed and submitted its final report last year.  I will be engaging with the National Civil Aviation Development Forum to continue our work in addressing the current challenges.  The NCADF, which brings together senior aviation stakeholders, serves as the established high-level forum for consultation and engagement on key challenges facing the sector.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Hildegarde Naughton:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2395\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2395&amp;amp;pid=HildegardeNaughton&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=26\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->In that context, I look forward to the opportunity in the near future to consult with this group and to consider how best the industry might emerge from the current crisis, following improvement in the epidemiological situation.  <\/p><p>Given how difficult the past year has been for this sector, I wish to acknowledge how the aviation industry has responded to the challenges of Covid-19.  Throughout the pandemic the industry has continued to implement the suite of measures set out in the air travel protocol to address the public health safety of passengers and staff.  Air carriers continue to play their part in implementing Government Covid-19 measures and to promote Ireland&rsquo;s public health information on websites which are available to passengers at booking and check-in.  Under the polymerase chain reaction, PCR, test regulation, carriers will deny boarding to passengers without a negative PCR test result and will inform passengers of their obligations not to travel without proof of essential travel.  <\/p><p>My Department will continue to engage with airports and airlines over the coming months.  The pandemic has had an unprecedented impact on the aviation sector.  We are an island nation and are heavily reliant on international connectivity.  I am fully committed to protect and support the industry and will continue to work with my Department and the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, to ensure that the sector is at the forefront of our recovery plans.

Her contribution underlines the difficulties that the aviation and airline sector feels and is experiencing at present.  We were on the precipice of Covid-19 this time last year.  Prior to that, Ireland was renowned as a hub for the aviation industry with 50% of leased aircraft connected to Ireland.  Our economic considerations, allied to political and social considerations, were favourable.  That is why this debate is critical because it is about people and jobs, be they in the hospitality, aviation or airline sectors.  In her contribution, the Minister of State recognised the profound and gargantuan sacrifice made by those who work in this industry.  Some 250,000 jobs have been lost in a compendium of both hospitality and the airlines.  Aviation and associated businesses tell us that Covid-19 has hit the aviation industry more than any other sector.  When we start back again to travel, we will be starting from zero.  If we look at the passenger numbers and tourism figures into Ireland, they have, as the Minister of State has rightly said, fallen off the cliff.  Our airports are central and critical to the recovery of our country.  If we look at Cork Airport, for example, it had 2.6 million passengers in and out in 2019.  Today it is a fraction of that figure.<\/p> <p>We must look beyond 2022 and I understand the approach of the Government and of the aviation task force.  I contend we need to plan by having a reconvening of that task force, with a timeline and action points that can be developed to ensure the rescue of the biggest indigenous employer in our country.  <\/p> <p>People must fly into our country and by and large they do.  I ask that the Government meets representatives of the airports, airlines and travel agents to create and protect new jobs.  This week, I was given a virtual briefing by Cork Airport and it was completely sobering.  I acknowledge and pay tribute to the staff of all of the airports and airlines for the sacrifice that they have made and endured.  We must invest in our airports, which is why I commend the Minister of State's speech on mentioning the Cork Airport significant runway overlay project.  I hope that the Government will approve it and that it can begin quickly.<\/p> <p>The travel agents of Ireland are a forgotten group of people.  They are critical for us as a country, have been generally supportive of what the Government has been doing and have received some financial supports.  There must be a link between Government support and advice and restrictions on travel.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Jerry Buttimer:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;MemberID=2225\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=26\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Travel agents want to see their sector being mentioned in a positive way similar to the hospitality sector - the pubs and restaurants.  The Government should not forget our travel agents.  They are the human interface for so many people.  As we heard yesterday, it is very easy to register a <i>.ie<\/i>domain name and trade from outside the country.  Our travel agents are a significant business.  They turned over &euro;1.4 billion in 2019.  They are regulated by the Commission for Aviation Regulation.  They are Irish owned and Irish based small and medium enterprises employing more than 3,500 people.  In normal times the sector is profitable as consumers book with travel agents and they benefit from that enhanced consumer protection, which could be lost if many of them go.  We need a further debate about the protections for consumers in the travel industry in the context of Covid-19.  We need to protect Irish travel agents because if we do not, the market will move overseas, which is not good for us as a nation.  The inbound market brings in approximately 11 million passengers every year, which accounts for 75% of our tourism product spend.  All of us, in the context of Covid-19, should stop demonising our travel industry and instead support it to manage the risk with a balanced approach to how we can safely resume travel, including international travel, which we need to try to do.<br\/><br\/>The issue of Aer Lingus and the staff of airlines has been raised with us by the Irish Air Line Pilots Association, IALPA.  The Minister of State knows the figures that have been invested by the British Government in the likes of Lufthansa, British Airways, Air Portugal and even in the loan to Ryanair.  It is imperative that we do not let Aer Lingus fail.  We have a collective duty to ensure it survives because as the Minister of State said in her contribution, connectivity for us as an island nation is critical.<br\/><br\/>I commend the Minister of State on her work.  We must plan for the resumption of international travel, whether in quarter 4 of this year or next year, with all of us having been vaccinated.  I hope that we, as a Government, can do that in the context of this country being an island nation.  It will take years for the industry to come back.  The Minister of State might consider the reintroduction of The Gathering and other tourism incentives to attract more travellers to Ireland.  I thank her for her engagement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021022600002#KKK00300","speaker":"1637","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1614335400,"counter":158,"content":"<p>If everybody follows that type of timing we will get to hear from every Member, which would be great.

It is good to see a fellow county woman here.  She will be aware that there are 143,000 people involved in the airline industry here.  As my colleague, Senator Buttimer, said and as the Minister of State pointed out, the industry is now on its knees.  Not unlike Senator Buttimer and, I am sure, others in the House, I have been contacted by everybody from suppliers, technicians, ground staff, airline pilots and travel agents with respect to the industry and where it is going.  As we speak, more than 1,200 pilots are grounded with nowhere to go.  The remainder of the pilots who are in the air are being paid between 25% and 30% of the normal salary they would expect.  To say that they are in serious trouble would be an understatement.<\/p> <p>We are now coming into the second summer with travel restrictions.  Airline staff and their families are facing continued hardship well into 2022 if we are to look at the timeframe that has been set out by the Government.  Every airline pilot who contacted me mentioned Aer Lingus.  It is a known fact going back to the good old advertisement from Aer Lingus that when one saw the shamrock in an airport one knew one was home.  We simply cannot allow that airline to suffer any more than it is suffering already.  As Senator Buttimer said, we have to start working to save that airline.  I was speaking to some people last night and the Leader, Senator Doherty, has been more than facilitating in working with members of the pilots' association.  I compliment her on that.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Gerard P. Craughwell:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2402\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2402&amp;amp;pid=GerardPCraughwell&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=26\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> As the Minister of State knows, for pilots to remain flying, they must have their licence up to date, and because so many are grounded, keeping their licence up to date is going to be a challenge for the future.  I ask the Department to consider a scheme whereby pilots who are currently not flying are given time in simulators in order to maintain their licences.  Once the industry opens up again, we want these people to be able to fly safely.  A figure was quoted to me yesterday that it could cost up to &euro;30,000 for pilots to become re-licensed if they lose their licence as a result of not having flying hours.  We have to find a way to ensure all of our pilots are ready to fly.<\/p><p>This does not take away from the fact that being a pilot in the airline industry is without doubt the worst job in Ireland with respect to terms and conditions of employment.  There is no permanency, from what I can see, for the majority of pilots flying out of Ireland and, indeed, many Irish pilots are not flying into Ireland at all and, while licensed here in Ireland, they are in bogus self-employment.  They are contracted on an individual basis, which is outrageous during a pandemic because it impacts everything, including their pandemic unemployment payment.  In addition, pilots have no pensions.  This bogus self-employment particularly hits female pilots, who have no maternity leave and no guarantee that once they have had a child, they will get back into the air again, because there are no guaranteed flying hours at the other side of maternity leave.  At a time like this, these anomalies are shown up very quickly.  It is vital that the Minister of State and the Department look at how people are employed within the airline industry.<\/p><p>In addition to pilots, cabin crew are the key people when it comes to safety on board an aircraft.  Again, we have to find some way of bringing cabin crew back in to keep them trained and up to speed because we will, without doubt, start flying again in the very near future.  I ask the Minister of State to consider a training scheme that will keep cabin crew up to speed.<\/p><p>The State will have to invest in this because, as Senator Buttimer said, the only way in and out of this country is through aircraft.  We have to ensure that cabin crew and pilots, the moment they get the green light, are ready to get back in the air.  I ask the Minister of State to consider that.<\/p><p>Everybody who speaks about the vaccine programme has a special reason why certain people should be vaccinated.  Pilots are bringing everything into this country and they are bringing many of our exports out.  Aidan Flynn of the Freight Transport Association Ireland has made a very strong case to me, which I will forward to the Minister of State, for the vaccination of those pilots who are entering and leaving the State.<\/p><p>As I promised the Leas-Chathaoirleach I would stick to time, I will leave it at that.

She does not need me to tell her the state of the aviation sector.  It is absolutely on its knees, and she knows that through the work she does every day.  It is not just the aviation sector, as all the ancillary businesses that have other customers but which were predominantly serving the aviation sector are also in a state of free fall.  I have first-hand experience of this because there is an international airport located in the constituency I come from, namely, Shannon Airport.  It is a microcosm of international aviation activity the world over at the moment.  There are airlines, aviation companies and companies that provide care and maintenance of aircraft, and they too have lost contracts and are struggling to survive.<\/p> <p>To look at the core of the aviation sector in the first instance, others have talked about the length of time it will take the sector to get back to normal or get back to what were 2019 levels.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Timmy Dooley:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2015\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2015&amp;amp;pid=TimDooley&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=26\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->That is estimated at being close to 2024 and it is dependent on when we get some level of activity back in the aviation sector.  Maybe that will be later this year; maybe it will be next year.  The critical thing the State is trying to do, through the supports the Minister of State talked about and with which I think it will have to go further, is to ensure those companies survive.  When I talk about companies surviving, I am talking about their ability to retain staff, pay them and give them some level of income to get them through the difficult period.  I am in contact on a daily basis with workers and small business owners who provide services at the airport.  While they expected last autumn that there would be some chance of opening up around now or midsummer, that unfortunately has evaporated and its likelihood, as we all recognise from a public health perspective, is limited.<\/p><p>The next phase is to try to shore up the balance sheets of these companies and to protect them.  Let us look at the biggest operators in the first instance: the two main airlines that serve the State.  We need that competitive tension to ensure there will be an appropriate marketplace on the other side of this.  I have advocated for quite some time that the Government should engage with both Ryanair and Aer Lingus and look to see how they can assist these companies through this period.  No company can sustain continued losses the way they have.  I think it would be appropriate for the State to look to take a shareholding, not necessarily a passive shareholding but one that guarantees the protection of strategic connectivity during the recreation phase of the aviation sector. I am not talking about nationalising.  It is not like that.  It is playing a role similar to what we did with our pillar banks.  We identified that the two main banks and Permanent TSB at the time required State investment to protect the banking system and the economy.  I would argue that Aer Lingus and Ryanair are two pillar airlines that provide connectivity to this island nation and we should give serious consideration to taking a stake or an interest and a shareholding that could be dispensed with and sold on in due course when these companies recover.<\/p><p>There is enormous pressure and anxiety in the minds of people who have not been working for the last year.  They are barely able to make ends meet.  In many cases, they are living on very significantly reduced income.  Some are out of work and on the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP.  We are not seeing support from our pillar banks to assist them with continued moratoriums recognising that these people want to work and would be working in any other sector if they were trained in it.  They are holding on and hoping this sector will recover.  We need greater engagement from the banks.<\/p><p>Allied and directly connected to the aviation sector is our tourism and hospitality sector.  Somewhere between 150,000 and 250,000 people work in that sector, depending on the time of the year.  We will have to do more for some of the operators in that sector who cannot take any more.  They have reached an end point.  I am talking about hotels, restaurants and that whole allied business. The State will have to provide greater supports or force the banks to show a greater level of forbearance in relation to outstanding loans.<\/p><p>We all talk about the planes and aircraft but other businesses are affected.  There are people involved in leasing and car hire at the airports, ground-handling staff, people who load and unload baggage and people who work in refuelling.  All of these people are effectively out of work and in a dire and desperate state.  Even if there was some recovery in the short term, we would still be looking at a prolonged period where the State will have to stand behind and beside this sector.  It is the right thing to do for the people and businesses that are there and it is the right thing to do for the economy.  Some of the bigger airlines will choose not to serve Ireland for, perhaps, the next two or three years until it is financially viable for them.  That is why it is important to protect what we see as the indigenous sector so we are in control to some extent and we protect to the greatest extent possible the companies that serve and operate within our State.  I look forward to proposals the Minister of State may bring forward in due course.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021022600002#MMM00300","speaker":"1655","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1614335400,"counter":164,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator.

There is no doubt that all public representatives in the Oireachtas have been hearing from workers in the aviation industry.  Their communications to us have all been about their deep concern about their industry and jobs and the knock-on effect on their families and loved ones.<\/p> <p>The aviation sector has been one of the sectors hardest hit by Covid, and all supports for the industry need to be kept in place.  There is no doubt that we need to protect air routes during the pandemic but it is vital that we protect the many thousands of jobs in the industry.  Thousands of workers in the aviation sector, from pilots, cabin crew and airport staff to those involved in leasing, ground crew and cleaning staff, are utterly dependent on the State at this time.  While supports have been given to workers through the temporary wage subsidy scheme and the employment wage subsidy scheme, and while some structural supports have been given to the aviation industry, the industry requires a survival package.  There is no other way to describe this.  The industry is, of course, an innocent victim of what has happened as a result of Covid-19.  There are thousands of families looking for leadership and protections.  They are not, in the opinion of many, seeing enough of an effort from the Government at this time to save the industry &ndash; an important industry that connects our island with the rest of the world and, by extension, our economy with every other economy.  The industry can ensure that when our recovery begins, it will be much faster because of the connections it has built up over a long period.  We all hope the recovery will be as soon as possible, but when it comes the industry may not be in a position to offer us many of the connections and routes that so many have worked so hard on.<\/p> <p>The question so many of those families and homes so dependent on aviation are asking is whether the aeroplanes currently on the ground and in airport hangars in Dublin Airport, Ireland West Airport, Shannon Airport and Cork Airport will be there in a month or six months or whether they will all be sold off.  Every aircraft sold in this way represents potential job losses for this country.<\/p> <p>I want to ask the Minister of State another question relevant to this debate.  I continue to receive many representations from constituents who continue to have difficulty acquiring refunds for flights that have not taken off or that have been cancelled owing to Government regulations and current health advice.  I would appreciate it if the Minister of State would let us know the current position on such refunds.  With the forthcoming holiday abroad season likely to be adversely affected, it is important that those seeking refunds get answers to their queries as quickly as possible.  The delays they have experienced are not good enough.  A response by the Minister of State here today would be appreciated by many.<\/p> <p>We all listened yesterday to the proceedings on the Health (Amendment) Bill 2021.  There is no doubt it will have implications for the aviation industry.  However, there is also no doubt the quicker we vaccinate our own population and keep out any further variants of the dreadful disease, the quicker the recovery time for the industry will be.  The Labour Party proposed an amendment yesterday that would have resulted in mandatory hotel quarantine for people from all other states not including Northern Ireland.  We tabled it again for the Seanad debate on Monday.  Over recent months, we proposed a national aggressive suppression strategy.  I, for one, would be very interested in hearing what the Minister of State responsible for transport thinks about why it is felt that mandatory hotel quarantine is currently essential for people from only 20 countries.  As our party leader, Deputy Kelly, said yesterday in the D&aacute;il, this virus is on tour.  It does not know it can only board a plane from one of the 20 countries to come to Ireland.  It could quite easily board a plane from a country that is not on the list because it travelled from its home country to that country and then booked its flight to Ireland.<\/p> <p>Deputy Kelly asked why we are not doing everything we can for a given period to protect our people and why the equation is against the Irish people?  On the one hand, the Government is limiting everybody's travel to a distance of 5 km; on the other, it is allowing people in from all over the world and, even though self-quarantine is a legal requirement, it is trusting them to quarantine at home for 14 days.  If we do not introduce mandatory hotel quarantine for people from all countries outside this island, we are, in my opinion and that of many others, only delaying the reopening of the aviation industry.  If we do not introduce mandatory hotel quarantine, we are not being serious about the thousands of jobs that each passing month threatens, nor are we trying to protect an industry that can and will play such an important part in the recovery in post-Covid Ireland.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Mark Wall:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MarkWall&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=26\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->As the Labour Party's transport spokesperson, Deputy Duncan Smith, said in the D&aacute;il on Wednesday:<\/p><blockquote>\tThe aviation sector is again being told that it will be at the end of the queue.

There is nothing to protect the companies to ensure that when we beat this virus, we will have a sector that will help to drive economic recovery. <\/blockquote><p>What the industry needs is a survival package but also a Government that will introduce mandatory hotel quarantine for travellers from all other states for all non-essential travel.  Yes, there will be short-term implications for the industry but if we continue to carry on as we have done with level 5 restrictions, followed by a reduced lockdown and then, possibly,  a further lockdown then we more than likely will lose an industry that employs thousands and contributes so much to the economy of this island.<br\/><br\/>Finally, I thank the Minister of State and, indeed, the Minister for Transport for the recent announcement that the Athy distributor road project will go ahead.  It is very important, as I discussed with the Minister for Transport, that this project goes ahead.

It is vital that we support the workers and all of the people who have been affected.  Regional rebalance is an issue that existed pre-Covid and we want it sorted when things re-open after Covid.  We need to get more flights into Shannon Airport.  We need transatlantic and European routes and Shannon Airport is as deserving an airport as Dublin for such flights.  As Shannon Airport has a longer runway, transatlantic flights can land with lower carbon emissions, which is an issue the Government is also examining due to the climate emergency.  If we are trying to do our best in every sector then emissions will have to be taken into account as well.  I hope that the Minister of State, as a fellow west coast woman, will consider the importance of having regional rebalance as we look at reopening the airports once we get through this very tough time.

She will not be surprised that I want to discuss Shannon Airport.  We have had a number of conversations on the topic and I know she is well aware of the impact this crisis is having across all of the sectors.  I want to acknowledge, in fairness, that supports have been put in place to date although, clearly, we will need to go further.<\/p> <p>The situation in Shannon Airport is more intense because of a deeply flawed structure that has operated for the past eight years whereby Shannon was deemed to be an independent airport.  The good news, since the last conversation, is that we now have all-party agreement on that fact because the report produced by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport and Communications Networks reads, \"Recognising the very significant shock to the aviation sector, the Committee recommends the re-establishment of a State Airports Authority, encompassing Dublin, Shannon and Cork airports, to lead the recovery in a balanced way\".  That report has been signed up to by every political party in this Chamber, which I welcome.  I ask the Minister of State to act on that.<\/p> <p>The idea that an airport can recover on its own after such a pandemic does not make sense.  The idea that we still pit Shannon Airport in competition against Cork Airport or Dublin Airport is absolutely ludicrous and we know it will end in failure.  We know that it has been failing long before the Covid crisis.  We only have to speak to the staff in Shannon who are now paid broadly about 30% less than their counterparts in Cork because of the ongoing financial crisis in Shannon.  Clearly, to expect Shannon Airport to continue to compete against other regional airports is the equivalent of free market fundamentalism that I do not believe anyone across this Chamber could subscribe to.  I hope that the Minister of State will reassure me that she will act on this recommendation.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Paul Gavan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2469\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2469&amp;amp;pid=PaulGavan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=26\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We know the whole industry is in crisis.  However, we also know now is the time to take these fundamental actions to change the framework to make sure that we achieve the regional balance everyone wants.  It will not be achieved by pitting Shannon as an independent airport against Dublin or Cork.  We know who wins in that case.  We also know that, when the airlines want to come back into Ireland, they will have no interest in talking to Shannon or Cork.  They will only be interested in coming back into Dublin Airport.  If a new national State authority specifies that an airline that wants to come into Dublin Airport will need to allocate X amount of flights to Shannon Airport and X amount of flights to Cork Airport, that will be how we achieve regional balance.  It is in fact the only way to achieve regional balance.<\/p><p>Although I hope she will reassure me otherwise on this point, my fear is that the Minister of State will duck the issue.  Running Shannon as an independent airport has not worked and it certainly will not work now.  More importantly, every political party, through the transport committee, has signed up to that point and have asked the Minister of State to re-establish a State airport authority and reintegrate Shannon into it.  I would welcome the Minister of State's response to that.  Hopefully, we can work collectively to achieve the best outcome.<\/p><p>It is frustrating that I am the only representative who ever brings up the issue of US military troops in Shannon Airport, particularly in terms of the Covid issue.  From information today, we know that, despite the US telling us that it would not breach our Covid regulations, as it did on 28 January, it did so again.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, confirmed to Deputy John Brady earlier today that the US breached regulations several times.<\/p><p>On 11 January, 59 US military personnel arrived at the airport but did not complete passenger locator forms.  Again, on 23 January, 54 personnel who landed at Shannon did not present negative PCR tests or complete passenger location forms.  That is in addition to the 48 US military personnel who stayed in Limerick overnight in hotels and went out for food.<\/p><p>This does not count the other two examples cited by Shannonwatch regarding 8 February and 28 January.  On 28 January, 226 trips from an Omni Air International plane stayed overnight in a number of Limerick hotels.  The events of 8 February are a really curious one.  It involved a really small plane with seven people on board.  According to the US, they were all crew, a completely ludicrous suggestion.  One would not have seven crew on a plane that small.<\/p><p>There have been five breaches in the space of five weeks.  It is completely unacceptable.  US troops should not be in Shannon.  I want to see our civilian airport grow.  I do not want to see US military troops using the airport to wage wars of terror across the Middle East.  We can park that for a second, however.  The Covid issues are outrageous at this point.  The US response of apologising and that it will not do it again has been blown out of the water five times in five weeks.  What is the Minister of State going to do about it?  Those troops are putting all of us at risk to Covid across the mid-west.  The Covid infection figures in Limerick are not good right now and are much higher than those in other parts of the country.  We cannot have this happening again.  What steps will the Government take to make sure it does not happen again?<\/p><p>The debate on Monday regrettably will be curtailed to two and a half hours for all Stages.  It puzzles me why we do not incorporate mandatory quarantine across a much wider range of countries.  It also worries me.  We know from listening to scientists that these variants are a particular threat to the progress we are making in getting the numbers down and, hopefully, to opening up society.  It is not going to work if we are not serious about mandatory quarantine, however.  One cannot be serious if one is picking just some countries.  There is no rationale to how some countries are not excluded, including some of the most prevalent countries in terms of Covid.  I would welcome the Minister of State's comments on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021022600002#PPP00300","speaker":"1660","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1614335400,"counter":171,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for being here to engage on this important topic.<\/p> <p>While level 5 restrictions have caused all sorts of issues and challenges for our economy, it has been particularly difficult in the aviation sector and for those employed in it.  Many years ago, a job with an airline was always thought to be the best one could get.  My aunt was one of the first Aer Lingus air hostesses.  As a child growing up, it was the most glamorous job anyone could have.  There was always excitement when one knew somebody who was going to be a pilot.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Fiona O'Loughlin:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2441\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2441&amp;amp;pid=FionaOLoughlin&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=26\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->When we look at where we are now, it certainly is a very different type of career.  We know that the number of people passing through our airports in Ireland fell, understandably, by more than 80% in 2020.  Dublin Airport had 23.5 million fewer passengers in the 11 months to the end of November 2020 than during the same period in 2019.<\/p><p>We rely heavily on air travel in Ireland.  I was surprised to learn that the industry is responsible for as many as 140,000 direct jobs.  That is very significant.  The national secretary of F&oacute;rsa, Ashley Connolly, told the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications Networks recently that thousands of aviation jobs remain at risk unless immediate supports are given to the sector.  I am aware that she referred to an aviation income support scheme in Germany, which enables employers to reduce hours rather than laying off staff, with government income support being provided for the time that employees cannot work.  It seems to make sense.  Such support has also been called for by the SIPTU aviation sector organiser, Neil McGowan.  <\/p><p>According to some media reports, it is estimated that even considering the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, Aer Lingus alone has been losing approximately &euro;1 million a day since April 2020.  That is a very significant loss for one of our airlines.  We are all aware that Irish airlines rely on summer bookings to make enough money to tide them over the winter season, which is loss-making.  Obviously, there will be no air travel this summer again, so it is most urgent that we support airlines that are facing dwindling cash reserves.  According to the president of IALPA, Captain Evan Cullen, the &euro;80 million support package for the aviation sector, which was announced in November 2020, was welcome but was essentially a grant for Ireland's airports, the majority of which are owned by the State.  The funds left over for the airlines may, at best, have covered a few days' worth of losses.  Therefore, we must really look at the airlines as being separate to the airports.  <\/p><p>When Captain Cullen spoke, he pointed to the role played by airlines in supplying economic lifeblood to the country by bringing foreign direct investment and an estimated &euro;10 billion into our economy annually.  Every aircraft that leaves Ireland represents lost jobs and lost GDP.  It is an economic fact that if our airlines are allowed to go out of business, the consequences for the Irish economy will be devastating, taking into account the amount of exports that we have.  Looking around the world, it is clear that most governments have recognised such dangers, and have accepted that if they are to intervene to prevent airline operations for the sake of virus suppression, they must ensure those airlines do not go out of business as a result.<\/p><p>The window remaining for decisive action is closing fast.  Airlines plan and budget for their vitally important summer schedules at this time of the year, and they will soon have to make hard decisions - indeed, many of them already have - based on the expected market conditions.  A number of people working in the airline industry have contacted me.  I have no doubt that they have also contacted all of my colleagues.  For example, a letter that I received from an Aer Lingus pilot outlined how his own life had been affected by the events of the last year.  He wrote that his pay and working hours were reduced by 50% from 1 April 2020.  During that time, his pay was subsidised by the temporary wage subsidy scheme, TWSS, and subsequently, by the EWSS after 1 September 2020.  He stated that has not gone above the 50% threshold since, and will not do so for the foreseeable future.  The pilot also outlined the very difficult times that he has been through.  He mentioned that he and his colleagues work on a variable roster with a fixed pattern, but on different days and hours each week, which is obviously very difficult.<\/p><p>Therefore, much clarification is needed.  We must look at the extra supports that can be put in place.  I know that next week we will have an opportunity to debate the Health (Amendment) Bill 2021.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Fiona O'Loughlin:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2441\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2441&amp;amp;pid=FionaOLoughlin&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=26\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It provides for the introduction of mandatory quarantine at designated facilities for all passengers arriving from countries where there are variants of the Covid virus that represent a particularly high risk.

To state the obvious, Ireland, as an island nation, is heavily reliant on quality connections internationally.  The connectivity pre-Covid was second to none, but it took years to build and establish it.  While we kept our borders open to maintain critical supply chains over the last 12 months, we have also allowed for essential travel.  That is the right thing to do but, if we are not careful and do not take immediate action, I do not believe we will have an aviation sector left standing to help Ireland recover when the sector will be needed most.<\/p> <p>I wish to refer specifically to our airlines.  The parent company of Aer Lingus this morning announced losses of &euro;6 billion.  Aer Lingus is one of our largest employers, with over 6,000 direct employees.  There are tens of thousands indirectly employed.  It has a fleet of 60 aeroplanes servicing 93 international destinations.  That took years to build up.  Ryanair is probably the envy of the world.  The company has made Ireland one of the most competitive travel markets, ensuring that our consumers get the best value.  It has a fleet of 271 aeroplanes.  While the Government loaned money and the Minister of State referred to the &euro;280 million which went to the airport authorities and the airlines through the SBCI, none of it comes close enough to ensure the survival of this industry.<\/p> <p>Both the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste are on record as saying that Aer Lingus will not be allowed to fail.  It is time for the Government to make a direct intervention, as many other EU governments have done to ensure the sustainability of their airlines.  Germany gave Lufthansa &euro;10 billion, Air France got &euro;7 billion, KLM got &euro;3.5 billion and Spain provided &euro;1 billion.  Alitalia was nationalised.  All of this was done to secure the jobs of employees, to exclude redundancies and to ensure the companies remained viable, so they literally can take off when the skies are reopened.  It is time for Ireland to show loyalty to the shamrock because, God knows, the loss adjusters in International Airlines Group, IAG, will not give much thought to it.<\/p> <p>We know that travel brings responsibility.  The reason we have employed antigen testing for the more than 4,000 hauliers who are leaving and coming into Ireland each day is to ensure we keep that area of travel safe and continuous.  At the same time, we are allowing other travellers to be demonised and even ridiculed, to the point of farce to be honest.  It is on our national broadcaster.  It is just not good enough.  We currently have inbound PCR testing and quarantining.  We must introduce antigen testing on landing to ensure that these essential travellers are safe and that we can build confidence in this sector again.  Otherwise, I fear the demonising of the travel industry will have the same impact as when we demonised the building industry ten years ago, and we can see the ramifications of that both on building and employment in that sector.  We should not make the same mistakes with flying and travel.<\/p> <p>The time for the Government to invest is now.  The industry is begging us.  I do not believe that is how we should be doing our business.  It is time for State intervention now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021022600002#SSS00200","speaker":"1653"},{"type":"speech","time":1614335400,"counter":175,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton.  She has a difficult and challenging job, as have many in the Government.  The aviation industry is critical given the fact that this is an island nation.  We are behind the curve of other European countries in terms of putting cash into the airline industry.  Many other areas of aviation have been affected aside from just the direct airline industry.

Among these we have seen world leading aviation companies, particularly in the area of aviation leasing.  We are number one in the world as a gold standard aviation leasing industry.  Thousands of people work not just in the mid-west but in companies that developed in the mid-west and have spread throughout the country, including Dublin.  These companies lease aircraft and do deals the length and breadth of the world.  These companies are now finding it extremely difficult.  Unfortunately, because of the world crash in aviation they are in a perilous situation.  Many of the employees are very concerned about their jobs.  We need a master plan not just for the airline industry but for aviation in general.  There is absolutely no reason for Ireland not just to maintain but to develop as a leader in aviation associated companies and industries, not only in leasing but in pilot training and aircraft engineering.  I want to see a blueprint and plan for the aviation industry to get it through the pandemic and then grow it into what it has been and what it potentially can be.<\/p><p>The notion of one airport in the country competing against another has to go.  I support the proposals of the Oireachtas transport committee that we establish a single airport authority.  I was always sceptical about the proposal to break up the airports, as happened when Shannon Airport was made independent of Dublin and Cork.  The industry and business sectors in the region supported it at the time.  It probably needed to be tried but we need to bring Shannon Airport into one entity with Dublin Airport and Cork Airport.  That entity should be properly funded so all three airports can prosper.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021022600002#SSS00300","speaker":"1644","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1614335400,"counter":177,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.

We do not want to see a situation where it is introduced in Northern Ireland and then it has tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of people visiting while our industry is closed.<\/p> <p>Recently, I met the Irish Travel Agents Association, ITAA.  We need to protect our travel agents and support jobs in Ireland.  I do not mean agents registered here and based abroad.

I would like to know where we stand with regard to Ryanair and refunds.<\/p> <p>Yesterday, I met the Irish Air Line Pilots Association.

They have had an incredibly difficult period over the past year, as everybody understands, but in 2021 and post-Brexit, the ITAA members - the Irish travel agents based in Ireland, employing Irish people and regulated by Irish and European law - are competing with British travel agents who are members of ABTA, the corresponding organisation in the United Kingdom.  There is no difficulty with that.<\/p><p>The difficulty arises insofar as many ABTA travel agents working here in Ireland are trading under EU domain names.  Although they are regulated by British law and no longer subject to important European consumer legislation like the package holidays directive, they trade here under what is essentially an Irish moniker.  It is not clear to me, and I am not sure it is clear to many consumers, that those travel agents are not as well bonded as the ITAA travel agents and they are not regulated by European directives.  As we hope to return some time late this year to more normalised aviation and travel conditions, we should look at the possibility of mounting a public information campaign to ensure Irish consumers know when they are booking a travel agent whether it is an Irish travel agent bonded by ITAA, which has extremely high protection for consumers and is subject to European legislation with the package holidays directive.  Again, it provides a fine layer of protection for consumers in this jurisdiction.  Consumers should know if they are dealing with that kind of travel agent or one outside the European Union, albeit with an Irish Internet address or an office in Dublin.  Who is regulating them?  We must mount a public information campaign to ensure consumers know what they are getting when they buy a package.  That is a bit away from us now.  I wish to be associated with the comments of my colleagues, particularly with respect to the airline industry as a whole and the difficulties it faces.<\/p><p>In the time I have left I will raise a matter that is also pertinent to the Minister of State's portfolio.  Driver licences have been mentioned and I have been contacted by a young man in Goatstown who has not yet sat his driving test and clearly cannot do so.  More important, he has not finished the driving lessons he is required to take before being entitled to sit his driving test.  His father works and his mother is unable to drive because of disability but he is an essential worker.  He must get the bus to work and he has told me he is very uncomfortable getting the bus in current circumstances.  Is there anything we can do for people like him or in that type of position?  We can use taxis and taxi drivers have put in place screens for protection, etc.  Could that also be done for driving instructors?  If that is not possible, I presume there are people in the house who could teach this man to drive, so could we forgo the requirement for new drivers to go through lessons?  If people pass the driving test, they must have achieved a certain level of skill.<\/p><p>I have always supported the regime that requires a certain number of driving lessons as it is a good idea.  It is progress.  However, in the current environment we have an essential worker who is uncomfortable taking public transport and who does not have other options but is ready to sit his test.  Could we do something to facilitate him or others in the same position?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021022600002#TTT00300","speaker":"1685","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1614335400,"counter":180,"content":"<p>I am glad to have a few minutes to say a few words on this important topic.

The funding given to the airport over the past number of months is very welcome and very much appreciated by those people.<\/p> <p>Suffice it to say that airports are no good without airlines and we need to look seriously at the airline industry to see what is happening.  We have met pilots and other representatives in the airline industry over the past number of days and it is horrifying to see this entire industry could fragment in front of our eyes.  There is a necessity to keep airlines moving, not just to keep routes open but for pilots as well, as they need to keep their licences current.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Paddy Burke:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=1866\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1866&amp;amp;pid=PaddyBurke&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=26\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->One cannot do that with airlines if they are on the ground.<\/p><p>Senator Doherty raised a very important point with regard to people travelling in and out of the State, especially in the context of EU citizens and free movement of people.  There is a PCR test that people must take before they fly into a country, which is very important, and it is being adhered to.  When people land in Ireland, however, antigen testing should be used more frequently, or all of the time, at airports.  This was pointed out to us by pilots yesterday.  If a passenger comes in with a negative PCR test and also does an antigen test before he or she leaves the airport, it would give great security to the citizens who travel and to the friends to whom they travel.  This is not being used.  I cannot understand this.  The people who are involved in the airline industry cannot understand this.  Health staff use antigen testing and yet it is not allowed to be used on the people coming in, who might bring in any number of the variants of the pandemic disease with them.  It is very short-sighted and I blame NPHET for this.  NPHET seems to be running the show at the moment.  People are afraid to make any decisions other than what NPHET says, because of what happened prior to Christmas.  The Minister of State must look at the area of antigen testing and the free movement of people.  If we do not keep these routes open we will be at a huge disadvantage as an island nation going forward.<\/p><p>The aviation industry in Ireland is worth millions of euro.  It is not just about our connectivity around the world and our tourism trade.  It is also about many other aspects such as aircraft maintenance and the dismantling of aircraft, which is a new industry.  Aircraft leasing is a huge industry in Ireland.  There are more than 50 aircraft leasing companies based in Ireland, with 14 of the top 15 leasing companies in the world based in and working out of Ireland.  More than 60% of all leased aircraft worldwide are managed by Irish leasing companies.  Aviation is a relatively young industry, being only 100 years old or so.  Ireland has made great strides in this area and we must keep it going.  It is a huge industry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021022600002#UUU00200","speaker":"1636","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1614335400,"counter":182,"content":"<p>I thank all the Senators who made a contribution here today on this critical issue.

All travellers arriving into Ireland who have been in the designated countries within the previous 14 days will be required to quarantine.  This requirement will include those who enter Ireland via Northern Ireland.  This measure is a necessary part of protecting our public health against the importation of new variants of Covid.  It will clearly have an impact on further suppressing international travel to Ireland and will, therefore, have a negative impact on an already struggling sector.  It will be challenging to balance requirements such as these, which are needed now to protect public health, with supporting our critical connectivity with the world.  I am determined that our connectivity must be protected as much as possible, even when passenger numbers are currently low.
