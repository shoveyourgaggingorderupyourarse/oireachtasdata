He is joined by Ms Josephine Mooney, deputy director of audit.  Apologies have been received from Deputy Pat Deering.  We will hold over the minutes until the next meeting and matters arising.<\/p> <p>  The next item on the agenda is correspondence received since the last meeting.  There are three categories of correspondence.  The first category, category A, deals with the opening statements and briefing documents from today's meeting.  No. 1648 A and No. 1660 comprise correspondence received from Mr. Robert Watt, Secretary General, Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, dated 15 October and 17 October 2018, providing briefing information and an opening statement for today's meeting.  We will note and publish that.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  No. 1655 A is correspondence received from Dr. Graham Love, CEO of the Higher Education Authority, dated 16 October, providing an opening statement for today's meeting.  We will note and publish that and deal with it in the afternoon.  No. 1656 A is correspondence received from Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;, Secretary General, Department of Education and Skills, dated 16 October 2018, providing an opening statement for today's meeting.

We have agreed to publish it.  We have not come to it but we will in a moment.  It is in the correspondence list.  I do not think that was the one list.  We will deal with it in a moment.<\/p> <p>  The next category is B - correspondence from Accounting Officers and-or Ministers and follow-up to Committee of Public Accounts meetings and other items for publishing.  A number of items were held over from last week's meeting.  We will continue to hold them over until we get an opportunity to read them.  When we have read them all in detail, we will be able to move through them very quickly when the time comes.  I am holding over all the items of correspondence previously held over.  I read it out on a second occasion the last time so I will move on to the newer items of correspondence.<\/p> <p>  No. 1620 B is correspondence received from Mr. Derek Moran, Secretary General, Department of Finance, dated 8 October 2018, providing the following information requested by the committee: additional information relating to cash holdings in NAMA, the impact of negative interest rates, and an update relating to the case before the courts regarding the IBRC liquidation.  In respect of the special liquidation of IBRC, the Department is defending the proceedings and confirms that a comprehensive defence to these proceedings will be filed within two weeks.  We want to verify that this happens when the time comes.  The other item concerned negative interest rates.  The Department did not specifically deal with it.  It spoke about early access to dividends but the point is covered.  We will note and publish that.<\/p> <p>  No. 1622 B is correspondence received from Mr Ciar&aacute;n Breen, director of the State Claims Agency, dated 9 October 2018, providing information requested by the committee regarding Thalidomide litigation and the number of outstanding cases.  We can note and publish this.  We should also note that at the meeting of 12 July 2018, correspondence from the Irish Thalidomide Association was considered and there may have been a suggestion that Mr Breen's evidence was not accurate.  In his letter, Mr. Breen states that his evidence was accurate.  If further clarification is required, we will be able to deal with it when we engage with the State Claims Agency at our meeting on 8 November.  I note that in the letter he sent to us, he did not receive a copy of the letter we received from the Irish Thalidomide Association and, essentially, was replying in the dark, so we want to send it on to the agency.<\/p><p>I am informed that due to the wonderful data protection legislation and so on because that correspondence was marked &quot;Private and Confidential&quot;, we need to get permission from the Irish Thalidomide Association to forward it to the State Claims Agency.  I presume that was their assumption when they sent it to us but it seems we must verify that consent.  That letter was dated 12 July.  We need to get it to the State Claims Agency as urgently as possible if they give consent and if they do not, we can do no more about it.  I expect that they will but I make the point that we must follow the process.<br\/><br\/>The next correspondence is No. 1630 from Ms Mary Lawlor, NAMA, dated 10 October 2018, providing the information requested by the committee at a previous meeting.  One was a breakdown of the 8,000 units directly funded by NAMA categorised according to occupancy status, social-affordable and private housing developments.  That relates to 8,113 houses.  We asked for a note on the sale of houses to Cerberus that were then sold back to the Housing Agency.  They have given a comprehensive reply saying that it was done on market valuations; there is a note on the meeting between NAMA and officials from the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government held in May 2018 in relation to the development of a new housing project, which we note; and a note on the 7,000 units offered to local authorities including a breakdown by local authority and the reasons given for taking up the units available.  That is a matter that has been ventilated on many occasions.  <br\/><br\/>Two items in the letter are of particular interest.  The most important question we asked related to note 5.  We asked for the &euro;24 billion sale of underlying asset with a geographic breakdown of where the purchasers were located, namely what country they are from.  They said they were not in a position to answer and would reply in due course.  We must mark that as &quot;Urgent&quot; and follow it up.  The next item we must follow up is one of the primary items for which we wrote to NAMA, namely Project Nantes.  Was it an off-market loan sale?  NAMA says: <\/p><blockquote>The loan sale was one constituent part of the board-approved higher refinancing target which was set for the debtor connection.<br \/><br \/>Having set the target, NAMA did not specify how it was to be achieved.  Therefore, provided Avestus met or exceeded the board approved target, it was free to adopt a variety of monetisation strategies, including the sale of the secured properties and\/or a refinancing of the loans.<\/blockquote><p>We asked why was there no publicity following the loan sale, from either Avestus or Clairvue-Nantes.<\/p><blockquote>The refinancing target and exit strategy agreed with Avestus was a confidential arrangement between the debtor and NAMA.<\/blockquote><p>We asked whether NAMA could confirm the portfolio was sold for &euro;26.6 million, with a par value of &euro;352 million.  This was one of the fundamental questions asked at that meeting.  The response is: <\/p><blockquote>NAMA confirms that the residual portfolio was sold for &euro;26.6 million, with a par value of &euro;352 million.  The cash realised by the loan sale was only one constituent part of the overall cash amount received from the acquired Avestus loan and security realisations.  The total amount of cash received by NAMA from the overall debtors&rsquo; acquired loans was a multiple of the residual loan sale.<\/blockquote><p>NAMA has not given the answer to the question we asked, full stop.  We must go back.  The main issue is that we asked about that specifically and are none the wiser about the par value of the &euro;352 million and the total realisation that was achieved on that.  More worrying, we asked for a note on review of section 172 declaration, which relates to there being no conflict of interest between the people involved, in respect of Project Nantes.  The letter states: &quot;NAMA is undertaking a legal review and will revert to the Committee in due course.&quot;  We found it extraordinary that it had never done a detailed examination on that.  It is something that the Comptroller and Auditor General highlighted in the past.  All those items must be sent back to NAMA.  There may be further correspondence on this but we want all those items to be followed up.  The last ones to which we did not get a reply are very significant.  Some are on their way but we need comprehensive replies.  NAMA is nearly approaching the end of its work and we, as the Committee of Public Accounts, want to do our job by ensuring all those questions as answered and followed up.  <br\/><br\/>No. 1631 B is from Mr. Michael Nolan, CEO, Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, dated 10 October 2018 providing information requested by the committee in respect of excess toll payments.  We will note and publish this.  <br\/><br\/>No. 1633 B is from Mr. Mick Long, director of corporate services, Office of Public Works, dated 11 October 2018 providing information requested by the committee for our meeting last week.  We discussed this at the meeting of 11 October and we are formally noting it today.  <br\/><br\/>No. 1634 is from Mr. Aidan O'Driscoll, Secretary General, Department of Justice and Equality, dated 10 October 2018 providing the note requested by the committee regarding implementation of change in the Irish Prison Service, which we will note and publish this.  Much of that might be relevant to the justice committee.  <br\/><br\/>No. 1635 B is also from Mr Aidan O'Driscoll, Secretary General, Department of Justice and Equality, dated 10 October 2018 in relation to the site acquisition for three new Garda stations in Clonmel, County Tipperary, Sligo and Cork, which we note and publish.<br\/><br\/>No.1636 B is from Mr. Derek Moran, Secretary General, Department of Finance, dated 11 October 2018 providing the review requested by the Committee on the resourcing of the Tax Appeals Commission.  There has been some progress on that and the Minister referred to it in his budget speech.  It is out there and there has been an agreement in relation to resourcing of that organisation.  We note and publish that. <br\/><br\/>No.1637 B from Ms Ann-Marie Walsh, Office of Public Works, dated 11 October 2018 providing the managing valuer's report on five historic cases on foot of a preceding submission to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  We discussed this at the meeting of 10 October and we are formally noting it today.  We are only noting it and have not agreed to publish this yet.  We may well do so but cannot give parliamentary privilege to something which we have not taken a few minutes to look at.  I have no objection in principle but there is quite a lot in it and we can agree to publish it the next day, if members wish.  However, as Chairman, I must glance through it and other members have not read it in case there is an issue about which we should be concerned.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018101800002#A00500","speaker":"1216","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1539849600,"counter":10,"content":"<p>Will it be dealt with in the next correspondence?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018101800002#B00200","speaker":"1346"},{"type":"speech","time":1539849600,"counter":11,"content":"<p>We will hold it over for discussion at the next meeting.

We discussed this at the meeting last week and we are formally noting it today.  <\/p> <p>  No. 1640 B is from Mr. Timothy Owens, chief executive, Cork ETB, who is replying to our further request for information regarding their employment policies and whether they have a policy preventing people with whom they have reached a legal settlement.

There were three cases listed in a document that we got the last time with the Tax Appeals Commission with amounts totalling &euro;361 million that were in dispute and we asked for a note on each of the three cases.  The first case has an amount of &euro;138 million under appeal.  The commission says that it is on hold for the next few months as parties are currently in discussions with a view to settling that issue.  There is another case involving &euro;119 million and the commission is saying that it is ready to be scheduled for a hearing shortly.  There is a third case with a value of over &euro;100 million which the commission says is proceeding through the appeals system.  There are three cases adding up to &euro;361 million.  Before we come to our periodic report we will need an update on those three cases.  We cannot have a situation of &euro;361 million from three organisations hanging out there without the Committee of Public Accounts taking action.  We deal with expenditure but we also want to make sure that taxes are collected properly and we want to make sure that is done as expeditiously as possible.<\/p> <p>  Then we asked for figures for the cases where the amount is between &euro;10 million and &euro;100 million and there are 14 of those.  One case is proceeding with a value of &euro;68 million.  Four more are on hold as the parties are in discussions and they have a combined value of &euro;100 million.  There are six other cases scheduled for hearings with a collective value of &euro;140 million.  There is a case on hold pending a linked appeal worth &euro;20 million, another case with determination expected to be completed by the end of this year worth &euro;12 million and a case that has been settled for &euro;11 million.  I do not know the outcome of that as the commission just says that it was settled.<\/p> <p>  It was horrific for me to see that there are 17 cases there involving well over &euro;700 million, only one of them has been settled since we raised it and one of them is expected to be completed this year.

That is the responsibility of Revenue as much as the Tax Appeals Commission because it is a sizable amount and anyone who has worked in accounts will know that if tax is not presented, then there is an ongoing dialogue with Revenue.  That astonishes me but we may be losing sight of some of the cases that in the overall context seem fairly small but in most of our experiences they amount to quite large amounts of money also.  Anything that is in the region of &euro;1 million for example is quite a large bill to be outstanding.  I have not gone through this in the kind of detail I want to and I know that money was allocated in the budget in response to the inadequacy in the commission's staffing and IT systems etc. and some time will be needed for that to settle in.  The timing in terms of the value we get in having the commission back in again will be important.  We must allow it to get its systems in place.  It will probably be the beginning of next year before we are likely to have the commission here in any kind of fruitful way but we should have the Revenue Commissioners in at the same time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018101800002#C01900","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speech","time":1539849600,"counter":41,"content":"<p>That is fine and our job is to keep public pressure on this and to keep the Tax Appeals Commission hopping because these things can just rumble on for years.

I hear what the Chair is saying about getting a bimonthly update on whether the cases have been settled because it is essentially a dispute on the amount but I want to get under the bonnet of this to see what is the substance of it and what is the nature of these disputes.  One side is obviously saying it does not believe it is liable for the amount of tax in question and Revenue is saying it is but it is a question of what type of issues lead to this scenario.  The reality is, especially when this amount of money is at stake, that these are individuals who have the ability to employ tax specialists and other people who can get the type of write-downs that most individuals could not get.  While it might all be legal and carried out in terms of tax avoidance there could still be consequences for the taxpayer in it and if there are loopholes there that we need to be aware of, that would also be important.  I appreciate the point on staffing because it is important for the commission to do its work but I am more concerned about the number of individuals in question and the amount of money under dispute and whether this is an example of very wealthy individuals simply looking for every possibility to avoid paying their taxes.

The organisation went into liquidation shortly afterwards.<br \/><br \/>Following legal advice, the Arts Council has undertaken to honour all payments due.  The Arts Council has estimated that a total of &euro;196,000 is due to intended beneficiaries including some amounts in relation to previous years.  The 2017 financial statements recognise a provision for the full amount due.  The Arts Council has no realistic prospect of recovering these amounts from the grant funded entity, now in liquidation.<br \/><br \/>In general, the Arts Council prefunds organisations in advance of expenditure being incurred, and has the sanction of the Department of Culture Heritage and the Gaeltacht and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to do so.  The Arts Council&rsquo;s control processes include advancing of funding to organisations in tranches and verification processes to obtain assurance that conditions have been met before the next tranche is advanced.  However, the full amount of funding for the arts programme was advanced to this organisation in one tranche in January 2017, and before the 2016 financial statements were received.  The Arts Council plans to review its controls over funding to outside organisations in particular where funding is provided in one tranche.

We will also be dealing with the Comptroller and Auditor General's 2017 report, specifically chapter 2, collection of pension contributions due to the Exchequer; chapter 3, control of funding for voted public services; and chapter 5, vote accounting and budget management.  We will also be dealing with the Comptroller and Auditor General's 2016 report, specifically chapter 6, on budget management, and his special reports 95, 99 and 100 on financial reporting in the public service for the years 2014 to 2016.  We have been dealing with these reports on an ongoing basis and there is nothing particularly new in them but we have not formally discussed them with the Department.  On that point, the Committee of Public Accounts, as a result of those earlier reports, decided towards the end of last year to write individually to each of the 300 or so organisations that are audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General to ask them to meet their timelines.  We have brought representatives of the education sector before the committee at length.  Of the 17 ETBs, only one was meeting reasonable timelines for producing financial statements, whereas on this occasion every single one of the 17 has done so, so there has been a significant improvement in the preparation of accounts by public bodies over the past year or two with the help of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the Comptroller and Auditor General and ourselves.  Perhaps we will ask Mr. Watt to give a short overview at the end of his comments on the issue that while it is fine getting the accounts to the Comptroller and Auditor General and getting them audited, there is then regularly what would appear to be another delay before they are laid before the Oireachtas.  I think they have to go to Ministers and so on.  The next thing we will want is a mechanism to see whether that end of the process can be speeded up.  It is the next chapter, but Mr. Watt understands the question I am raising.<\/p><p>As today's schedule is very busy, dealing with all these accounts, and there is so much to be covered, the opening statement will understandably be that little bit longer than normal.

However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members of the committee are reminded of Standing Order 186, which provides that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of a Government or a Minister of the Government or the merits of the objectives of such policies.

This was an increase of &euro;9.8 million, or 23%, on the prior year, due in large part to additional spending of &euro;7.4 million by the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer.  At the end of 2017, the Department had underspent by &euro;2 million relative to its budget.  Unspent capital funding of &euro;685,000 was carried forward to 2018.  The remaining &euro;1.3 million was liable for surrender back to the Exchequer.  The surrender at the end of 2016 was &euro;2.5 million.  I issued clear audit opinions on both the 2017 and 2016 appropriation accounts for Vote 11.<\/p> <p>  Vote 12, superannuation and retired allowances, is used to pay pensions to civil servants and prison officers.<\/p><p>Pension payments for other public servants are charged, directly or indirectly, to other Votes, including those for education, health, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Army pensions.  The gross spend on Vote 12 in 2017 amounted to &euro;535.5 million.  This represented an increase of 7% from 2016.  Appropriations-in-aid, mainly comprising employee pension contributions, amounted to &euro;202.5 million in 2017, which was up 28% from 2016.  The increase was mainly due to increased employee contributions in respect of the single public service pension scheme.  The net result was a surrender at the year end of &euro;33.5 million in respect of 2017, and of &euro;50.8 million in respect of 2016.  I issued clear audit opinions in relation to the 2017 and 2016 appropriation accounts for Vote 12.<\/p><p> Chapter 2 of my annual report deals with the collection of pension contributions due to the Exchequer.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform issued a circular in December 2016 requiring certain State bodies to make employer pension contributions to the Exchequer in respect of public sector employees pensionable under the single public service pension scheme, which commenced on 1 January 2013.  As of 14 September 2018, only 14 bodies had made employer contributions, totalling &euro;4.35 million.  The Department had not yet completed the work required to identify all the bodies that will be required to make contributions.  Because the contributions are payable with effect from 1 January 2013, at least five years&rsquo; contributions will become payable.  This may impact on the cash flow of each entity concerned and on charges for the services they provide.<\/p><p> Members will be aware that the Constitution and legislation set out the framework underpinning the manner in which funds are appropriated for voted public services.  The appropriation system in Ireland differs from that in other jurisdictions in that the passing of appropriation legislation is generally taken very late in the year, usually in December.  As a result, an unexpected dissolution of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann later in the year could have two serious outcomes, unless agreement can be reached on the emergency passing of an Appropriation Bill.  First, appropriations in the financial year would not legally be in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution.  Second, spending on supply services in the following year could not proceed, creating a risk to the continuity of voted services.  In my function as controller of issues of funding from the Central Fund, I want formally to draw the attention of the Oireachtas to this risk.<\/p><p> Vote accounting and budget management is a standard report that consolidates and summarises expenditure across all of the Votes.  It highlights key variances relative to estimates and demonstrates medium to long-term trends in key Vote issues.  The 2017 chapter also outlines the limited guidance provided by the current financial reporting framework regarding the accounting for capital assets in the appropriation accounts.  These weaknesses are expected to be addressed in the comprehensive review of the accounting framework being undertaken in the context of developing the financial shared services model for Departments and offices.<\/p><p> I refer to the special reports on financial reporting in the public sector.  As members are aware, timely preparation and presentation of audited financial statements is a key element of public accountability and in providing effective oversight.  The three special reports before the committee today reflect a strategic focus by my office to drive greater timeliness of public sector financial reporting.  I will focus my opening remarks on the most recent report, special report No. 100, which deals primarily with financial statements for periods ending in 2016.  For that year of account, I had responsibility for the audit of the financial statements of 287 bodies and funds with an aggregate turnover of &euro;218 billion.<\/p><p> Most public bodies should be able to prepare financial statements for audit within two to three months of the end of the relevant accounting period.  All Government Departments and offices produce their appropriation accounts by the end of March, as required by law.  Half of the other public bodies produced their 2016 financial statements within three months of the year end.  This represents a progressive improvement since the 2014 year of account.  Significant progress has been made in completing audits early.  My office gives priority to higher value accounts and this is reflected in the graphic provided, which shows that 97% of the turnover subject to audit had been completed by the end of September 2017.  This represents two thirds of the number of 2016 financial statements.  Government Departments are generally required to present the audited financial statements of the public sector bodies for which they are responsible to the Oireachtas within three months of audit certification.  Of the 2016 financial statements that had been certified and were due for presentation as of April 2018, some 80% had been presented on time.  Arising from a recommendation in special report No. 95, Government Departments are now required to report in their appropriation accounts on the presentation to the Oireachtas of audited financial statements of the bodies and funds for which they are responsible.  An example of this can be seen at the back of Vote 11 for 2017.  This should increase the monitoring by Government Departments of the production of audited financial statements by the bodies under their aegis.<\/p><p> At the end of 2017, there were 13 sets of financial statements that had not yet been certified, representing a significant improvement since the end of 2015 when there were 25 sets of financial statements in arrears.  All but two of the 13 arrears at the end of 2017 have now been certified.  The university sector, which previously had a high incidence of arrears, has shown significant improvements in timeliness of financial reporting.  The significant organisational change that the education and training board, ETB, sector underwent from July 2013 was a contributory factor to delays in the presentation of audited financial statements.  However, as the Chairman has mentioned, much progress has been made in relation to the timely presentation of ETB accounts for audit, and achieving earlier completion of audits of ETBs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018101800002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1539849600,"counter":184,"content":"<p>Mr. McCarthy has given us the figure for 2016 and I will not ask exactly what has happened since but has there been an improvement in 2018 versus the 2017 financial statements?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018101800002#J00200","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1539849600,"counter":185,"content":"<p>In the presentation?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018101800002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1539849600,"counter":186,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018101800002#J00400","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1539849600,"counter":187,"content":"<p>Yes there has been an improvement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018101800002#J00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1539849600,"counter":188,"content":"<p>Give us your observations quickly.

In respect of 2016, gross voted current expenditure amounted to &euro;51.8 billion.  This was &euro;100 million, or 0.2%, under profile and &euro;900 million, or 1.8%, up on the 2015 figure.  Gross voted capital expenditure was &euro;4.2 billion and this was &euro;200 million, or 6.2%, ahead of profile and &euro;500 million, or 12.9%, up on the 2015 figure.  The higher level of capital expenditure - the outturn figure for that year - was signalled in the mid-year expenditure report and related mainly to road repairs in response to the 2016 floods which members will remember and faster than expected progress on the schools building programme, so those related to conscious Government decisions to increase spending during the year.<\/p> <p>  In respect of 2017, gross voted expenditure was &euro;58.5 billion.  This was &euro;480 million, or 0.8%, higher than the gross expenditure allocation set out in the 2017 revised estimates volume.  This increase was expected as it was accommodated within the further Revised Estimates and Supplementary Estimates agreed by the Oireachtas in December.<\/p><p>The additional expenditure arose mainly from policy decisions relating to the provision of domestic water services.<\/p><p> The Revised Estimates for 2018 provided for total gross voted expenditure of &euro;61.8 billion, a further increase of 5.5% on the 2017 outturn.  On budget day last week, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, announced additional allocations for 2018 mainly relating to health, housing, education and justice.  If we take these adjustments into account, along with the provision of a 100% Christmas bonus for social welfare recipients, the revised allocation for 2018 amounts to &euro;62.8 billion.  Of this, some &euro;56.9 billion relates to current expenditure and the balance of &euro;5.9 billion relates to capital expenditure.<\/p><p> We can see the progress this year.  Total gross voted expenditure at end-September is &euro;44.9 billion.  Of this, &euro;41.6 billion relates to current expenditure.  This is ahead of profile by &euro;265 million and is up &euro;2.5 billion or 6.3% on the same period in 2017.  Capital expenditure to the end of the third quarter amounts to &euro;3.3 billion, which is &euro;253 million or 7.2% below profile and &euro;756 million or 30% above the same period in 2017.  This reflects the significant increase in the allocations for capital spending in 2018, a trend we have seen since 2015.<\/p><p> The second item on the agenda concerns Vote 11 relating to the Office of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform in 2016.  I will address the Department's 2017 Vote as well.  The Estimate for 2016 was &euro;43.7 million, a 7.7% increase on 2015.  As has been mentioned already, this was driven mainly by the need for additional resources for the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer, Structural Funds technical support and assistance for regional assemblies and the Special EU Programmes Body.  The increase was also due to the creation of new subheads for the funding of pensions of bodies under the aegis of the Department, Civil Service learning and development and support for the implementation of the Protected Disclosures Act.  There has been an increase in spending above average under Vote 11 reflecting the consolidation of functions that were previously undertaken by other Departments and that are now undertaken centrally.  This reflects Civil Service renewal and public sector reform in the area of information technology.  The Comptroller and Auditor General mentioned the significant resources that are going to the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer.  One of those projects is SharePoint, which involves the implementation of a suite of electronic systems, including electronic parliamentary questions, e-submissions and e-records.  This will apply by the end of next year to 36,000 civil servants across all the Departments and bodies.  In effect it is being delivered centrally by the office.  It involves considerable developmental software work that previously would have been undertaken by Departments but has now been consolidated centrally.  It reflects our view that it is better to have the expertise and capacity centrally based.  It is more effective, in particular in respect of smaller offices and Departments that would not have well-developed information technology systems.  One theme in the Vote over the years has been this consolidation.  The same argument applies to learning and development.  More and more learning and development is being done centrally though shared services because of the belief that we get better value for money and better quality services if we do it centrally.  The audited surplus to surrender for 2016 was &euro;2.5 million and arose for a number of reasons, as set out in the briefing supplied.<\/p><p> The Estimate for 2017 was &euro;53.1 million.  This increase was driven mainly by the need for additional resources for the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer and administrative pay.  The increase was also due to the creation of new subheads for the Public Service Pay Commission, the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service and the Single Public Service Pension Scheme.  The work of the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service involves the recruitment of economists at different levels who come to the service but who spend an initial period with our Department and are subject to a specific training programme.  The paybill and training costs during the earlier period of their careers is drawn from the Vote of our Department.  Then, people within the service are sent out to other Departments to do their work across the system.  Again, that explains a large element of the increase in spending.  The audited surplus to surrender in respect of 2017 was &euro;1.3 million and arose for a number of reasons, as set out in the briefing supplied.<\/p><p> Vote 12 relates to superannuation and retired allowances.  The net outturn for 2016 was &euro;341.1 million, compared to an estimate of &euro;391.9 million.  This gives a surplus to surrender of &euro;50.8 million.  This arose mainly because of underspending on established lump sums and greater-than-expected receipts from the Single Public Service Pension Scheme.  As we have debated at this committee previously, estimating the lump sums for any given year is difficult and problematic.  It fluctuates significantly and thus is a challenge for us to estimate.  The large variability in the Vote relates to the lump sum element.  Hopefully, we will have a better handle in respect of the receipts in future.<\/p><p> In 2017, the net outturn was &euro;332.9 million, compared to an estimate of &euro;366.4 million.  This gives a surplus to surrender to the Exchequer of &euro;33 .5 million, which arose for similar reasons to those I outlined for 2016.<\/p><p> Chapter 2 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's 2017 report deals with the collection of pension contributions due to the Exchequer.  The 2012 legislation underpinning the new Single Public Service Pension Scheme provides that certain self-financing public bodies may be required to make employer contributions for their staff members who are in the single scheme.  A review and engagement with the bodies to which this is likely to apply is ongoing in my Department and will be completed by the end of this year.  On foot of the review I expect that 25 to 30 mainly self-financing bodies will be deemed eligible for employer contributions.  Since the Comptroller and Auditor General completed the analysis set out in this chapter, two additional bodies have remitted employer contributions.  The current position is that 16 bodies are submitting employer contributions, with &euro;5. 7 million remitted to date.  Any back-money or money that is owing will be remitted to the Exchequer in due course when we establish the exact position.  Any bodies that did not make the full remittance in time will make good to the Exchequer in due course.<\/p><p> Chapter 3 of the 2017 report deals with the control of funding for voted public services.  Given that the legal appropriation of funds for supply services generally occurs late in the year, the chapter highlights the potential risks to the approval of the estimates arising from a failure to enact the appropriations legislation by year end.  In considering this matter, it is important to note the constitutional requirement that legislation to give effect to the financial resolutions of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann must be enacted within the same year.  The Constitution also requires that the Appropriation Bill schedule is based on the timing of approval by the D&aacute;il of Supplementary Estimates for the year, thus ensuring that all Estimates voted by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann are reflected in the relevant Appropriation Bill.  Mindful of the risk, as identified, relating to the enactment of Appropriation Bill at the end of the year, officials in my Department ensure that there is clear and constant communication with the Whip's Office on the timeline for publication of the Bill.  They provide all relevant briefing in a timely manner, including for the Business Committee.  This is a risk we are very much aware of.  It has never happened that we did not enact the Appropriation Bill, and for good reason because we would not then be in a position to spend any money from 1 January, including the salaries and so on of everyone who has to vote on the Bill.  We know that when it comes to it, D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann always finds the time.  In effect, the State would fail to function because we would not be able to invoke the 80% rule.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018101800002#J01900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Robert Watt","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1539849600,"counter":203,"content":"<p>That is a new point and I have seen it raised recently.

The reports review the timeliness of public sector financial reporting for those years, identify bodies where delays occurred and summarise the issues brought to attention in the audit reports.  The general trend in the timeliness of the financial reports for audit has been positive, as has been stated.  For 2016, all appropriation accounts were produced by the required deadline of three months.  For other accounts, 50% of bodies submitted their 2016 financial statements for audit within three months of the end of their accounting period, compared with 40% of bodies in 2015 and only one third of public sector bodies in 2014.  There has been a significant improvement in the timeliness of presentation of audited financial statements to the Oireachtas.  Over 80% of 2016 financial statements were presented on time, compared with 70% for 2015 and less than 60% for 2014.  As Mr. McCarthy mentioned, we hope there will be an improvement this year.  Furthermore, the number of accounts in arrears, which are accounts not certified by the end of the year following the year of account, at the end of 2017 was almost halved compared with the end of 2015.<\/p> <p>  Special Report 95 recommends that my Department consider requiring Departments to include an annexe in their appropriation accounts reporting on the presentation of audited financial statements to the Oireachtas by bodies under their aegis.  I informed the committee last year that I accepted this recommendation, and it was included as a requirement for the 2017 appropriation accounts.  That requirement, along with the issue being highlighted by the Comptroller and Auditor General, the committee and the Department following on from the recommendations has led to some improvement.  However, as always with this type of issue, we must remain vigilant.  It does not apply to Departments, which produce their accounts after quarter 1 and are audited appropriately and so forth.  Rather, it relates to bodies outside of central government and that is where the issues have arisen in the past.  We must be vigilant to ensure that Accounting Officers understand their responsibilities and continue to deliver.  The key issue for us is to keep the pressure on and keep reminding those responsible that they have obligations relating to accounts being prepared, audited and presented in a timely fashion.<\/p> <p>  Certain issues relating to the presentation of accounts should be considered.  Some accounts have to be approved by a Minister or go to the Government and we should consider whether that is necessary.  That is something at which we must look because sometimes it is not an issue for the Government, which just notes the annual report and the accounts, but there may be a backlog in terms of Government business.  We should seek to streamline that to ensure that the percentage gets above the 80% for which we are aiming.<\/p> <p>  I wish to highlight some key recent outputs that testify to the impact and breadth of the Department's activities some of which I have mentioned.  Since we established the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service, which is a key part of the work of the Department, we have published over 200 papers in order to better inform Government decision making on how public money is spent.  Since its launch in September 2017 the new learning and development centre, OneLearning, has had over 10,500 attendances at training courses across 44 Civil Service organisations and 23 counties.  Over 500 candidates have completed the graduate development programme since 2015 and an additional 200 candidates recently commenced the current programme.  Since March 2017, almost 13,000 Civil Service managers have attended the managing people and performance training programmes.  Over 2.75 million elements of data were collected from 21,000 civil servants during the 2017 employee engagement survey, the results of which were published by the Department last March.  The high-speed government cloud network has been rolled out to almost 500 locations nationwide.  Seventeen Departments and seven agencies are now connected to OGCIO's build to share applications platform which I mentioned and 35,000 staff have access to the platform.  Over 8,200 high-quality data sets are now available via Ireland's open data portal.  We are among the top administrations in Europe in terms of the availability of open data.  I set out these highlights to try to put in context the amount of money spent within the Vote because sometimes we do not focus enough on the outputs.  Ultimately, we provide services across the large Civil Service system , encompassing many Departments and offices.<\/p> <p>  I wish to pay tribute to the staff of the Department for their hard work and the contribution they have made to what we have achieved.  Delivering on the wide remit of our mission requires our employees to have a broad range of skills and perspectives.  I am personally invested in ensuring that our people are equipped with the necessary aptitude and expertise to meet the Department's objectives and to fulfil their own career potential.  In this regard, I am pleased to say that earlier this year the Department won best learning and development organisation in the medium category at the Irish Institute of Training and Development's 2018 awards.

Many of the underspends relate to IT.  We have ramped up the spend and that involves the recruitment of people and the use of expertise in order to deliver on the build to share programme.  However, we were not able to get people on board as quickly as we had hoped, particularly in regard to the OGCIO and the learning and development shared services project which I mentioned.  We may have been overly optimistic in regard to delivery of these programmes.

More and more services are in the cloud which Mr. Lowry and his team support.  They provide the service on behalf of the entire public service.  The one development that always springs to mind is the \"build to share\" application, the application of the common e-platforms across the Civil Service.  These are massive IT transformation projects.  In the past - colleagues on this side of the table will certainly recall this - we could have had 50,000 to 60,000 parliamentary questions in a year.  People used to run around carrying pink folders and changes to replies to parliamentary questions would have been made on the hard copy.  For instance, the administrative officer would have written a draft reply which would have been changed by the assistant principal officer and then the principal officer.  It would eventually have reached the Minister.  It is now all done in an e-system, where changes can be tracked.  It is done efficiently and quickly.  Replies are emailed to the Minister's office and copied to me.  That is one example where we use e-submissions and e-records systems.  In effect, the amount of paper kept within Departments is collapsing as more and more things are being filed electronically, apart from legal documents, deeds and so forth.  It will lead to significant improvement in retrieval costs.  When there is an inquiry, an investigation or a review, when the retrieval of documents is always an issue and a challenge, particularly where there are manual systems, the process will be greatly facilitated when, by the end of next year, the vast majority of Departments have this e-records system.

At that time, my crude valuation was probably within a couple of million of the valuation done by Savills, the existence of which we were informed of at that meeting, yet the State paid &euro;23 million for the site.  I described that at the time as \"kiting\", which is paying one overdraft off with another.

Since 2012, when we commenced the development of the Civil Service renewal programme, a significant focus has been on professionalisation of the Civil Service.  It is a fair critique of the service that over the previous 15 or 20 years it has moved from a professional service to a generalist service.  We need generalist civil servants because they have a professional capacity as administrators but alongside this we need professionals in the area of accountancy, economics, auditing, tax and actuaries.  There are many staff in the Department with specialised capacity but we need to continue to build up this expertise.  <\/p> <p>  On human resources, professional HR is critical.  I find astounding the notion that one could run an organisation of scale that involves people without people with professional qualifications in human resources.  The same applies in regard to audit, accountancy and financial and economic services.  If one wants to build a bridge one employs an engineer to do it because an engineer would do the best job.  This philosophy needs to be within our system.  We are professionalising very significantly.  Increasingly, the recruitment we do is for specific tasks and activities.  Any agency, particularly agencies that are involved in delivering for citizens, for example, IT projects or buildings, must have the expertise because it is a specific function.<\/p> <p>  On the Harold's Cross site - I am aware that the Secretary General of the Department of Education and Skills will be before the committee this afternoon - it would not be acceptable for any transaction to be organised in a way to bail out another body.  The valuation should be the valuation.  What the Department of Education and Skills pays has to be based on a valuation that is provided by the relevant body or authority.  It cannot be that one part of the State - I am sure the Secretary General will confirm this - decides to buy a site, the implication of which is to reduce the debts of another.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018101800002#O00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Robert Watt"},{"type":"speech","time":1539849600,"counter":348,"content":"<p>From Mr. Watt's perspective, what is the relevant authority in respect of that valuation?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018101800002#O00300","speaker":"1346"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1539849600,"counter":349,"content":"<p>The Valuation Office would have provided the valuation to the Department and the Department would have-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018101800002#O00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Robert Watt"},{"type":"speech","time":1539849600,"counter":350,"content":"<p>Could that office be asked to retro-engineer a valuation to facilitate?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018101800002#O00500","speaker":"1346"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1539849600,"counter":351,"content":"<p>No.  The Valuation Office would be given a mandate and remit.

It states that there are a number of areas worthy of further research and refers to \"an assessment of the balance between capital and current expenditure (long term value for money of construction\/acquisition ... versus leased options)\".  This is crucial in the context of the astronomical rents people are paying and the fact that the Government is i l&aacute;r an aonaigh.

Wherever an organisation has capital assets, in particular buildings, on its statement of financial position, it is left to each Accounting Officer to determine how the building will be valued.

However, there are a number of questions I want to put, along with making a number of observations.  Some of these may have been asked.  I was doing some media interviews and was not here for all of the contributions.  If there is any repetition, Mr. Watt might say so.<\/p> <p>  My first point is a bit repetitious but I wanted to make an observation as well as to put a question.  In his summary in the report, the Comptroller and Auditor General said two thirds of bodies produced their audited accounts and that those accounts covered 97% of the value of the turnover audited.  Obviously, 97% is high on the face of it and is very good.  The difficulty is when one looks at the amount of money.  My calculation is that 100% would be &euro;218 billion.  If 3% is not audited, that is &euro;6 billion which is not audited as it should be.  Does Mr. Watt accept that it is a great deal of money?

There does not seem to be much stick, as far as I can see, in cases of non-compliance with procurement rules by any public bodies.

I will give the numbers in terms of non-compliance under Circular 40\/2002.  This relates to non-competitive procurement.  I have figures from the OGP.  For 2016, excluding the HSE, the total amount of non-compliance was &euro;94 million.  Several of these relate to defence.  I do not have the full details but one case involved the purchase of a ship and the extension of a contract.  Another related to an armoured cars upgrade and was probably because there was only one supplier in a position to do the upgrade.  It amounted to &euro;55 million.  Another involved the replacement of an aircraft, which I presume was replaced by the same kind of aircraft.  There was then an issue in relation to RT&Eacute; providing a service to do with the commemorations in 2016.  The most significant cases are clear.<\/p> <p>  I accept that it is an issue in the HSE.  I would love to see more evidence.  Maybe the Comptroller and Auditor General could update the work his office has done previously.  I am not discounting any concerns about any individual case for one moment, but I do not think that there is a general non-compliance problem, with the caveat I just gave.  That is my sense.  The last review that the Comptroller and Auditor General did was not material, in my view.  When one examines the reasons for non-competitive procurement and strips out the genuine reasons, there was a very small number of cases where there was a problem.  I do not disagree with what the Deputy said in relation to the HSE.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018101800002#U01500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Robert Watt"},{"type":"speech","time":1539849600,"counter":603,"content":"<p>I will conclude with two questions on the same theme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018101800002#U01600","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1539849600,"counter":604,"content":"<p>The Deputy has two minutes left.

On chapter 3, I ask Mr. Watt to refer to table 3.7.  The Budget Statement is announced before 15 October every year in accordance with EU rules but it takes six months for the Estimates to be dealt with.  The Estimates are considered by the relevant committees in March or close thereto and voted upon by the D&aacute;il in April.  As Accounting Officer and Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts, I wish to state that that is no way to do business.  Most draft Estimates for next year have been published.  Six months are being lost.  The budget used to be in December but was brought forward to October under EU guidelines.  That gave the Oireachtas the opportunity to pass the Estimates for 2019 before the end of 2018.  I do not know of any organisation worth its salt that approves its budget four or five months into the year.  Such a company would go bust.  No business should be run in that way.  The fact that this concerns Departments is not a reason to say the State guarantees everything and it does not matter anyway.  It is bad practice.  As budget day has been brought forward by two months, the approval of the Estimates should be brought forward by at least the same period.  At one stage, Estimates were coming through just before the summer recess.  During committee discussion of an Estimate, members were told that two thirds of the allocation had been spent.  Four twelfths of the Estimates will have been spent by April in any event.  Mr. Watt, as the Accounting Officer for the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, which oversees this side of the budgetary process, should be making an effort to get those Estimates through the Oireachtas by Christmas.  That would be the correct time for it to be done.  It would be better to have them completed in January than maintain the current situation but it would still be too late.  It should be done by Christmas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018101800002#W02800","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1539849600,"counter":725,"content":"<p>We will do it next week.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018101800002#W02900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Robert Watt"},{"type":"speech","time":1539849600,"counter":726,"content":"<p>Please do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018101800002#W03000","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1539849600,"counter":727,"content":"<p>I am not responsible for how the House does its business.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018101800002#W03100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Robert Watt"},{"type":"speech","time":1539849600,"counter":728,"content":"<p>The matter is being raised by the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018101800002#W03200","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1539849600,"counter":729,"content":"<p>I do not disagree with the point made by the Chair.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018101800002#W03300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Robert Watt"},{"type":"speech","time":1539849600,"counter":730,"content":"<p>We are debating an issue that needs to be discussed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018101800002#W03400","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1539849600,"counter":731,"content":"<p>That was one of the intentions behind moving to the calendar year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018101800002#W03500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Robert Watt"},{"type":"speech","time":1539849600,"counter":732,"content":"<p>I am backing up Mr. Watt.

It is an ongoing topic on our agenda.  Recently, we were sent the official minutes of the response to our earlier periodic report.  We have not yet had the opportunity to examine those.  Depending on the content of those reports, we may have to respond on some matters.  We will deal with those matters as they arise.  I am alerting the witnesses that some matters cutting across their Department will be discussed in the time ahead.  I thank all the witnesses for their attendance.  In the afternoon we will meet representatives of the Department of Education and Skills and the Higher Education Authority.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018101800002#Y04700","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1539849600,"counter":893,"content":"<p>The witnesses withdrew.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1539849600,"counter":894,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 1 p.m. and resumed at 2 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"HEA Financial Statements 2017","time":1539849600,"counter":895,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018101800002#FF00050"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1539849600,"counter":896,"content":"<p>Dr. Graham Love (Chief Executive, Higher Education Authority) and Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; (Secretary General, Department of Education and Skills) called and examined.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1539849600,"counter":897,"content":"<p>We are joined again by the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, who is a permanent witness to the committee and Ms Colette Drinan, deputy director of audit at the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  We are meeting representatives from the Department of Education and Skills and the Higher Education Authority, HEA, to discuss the Higher Education Authority's financial statements for 2017 and governance arrangements in the Department of Education and Skills and the HEA for the third level sector.  The committee has been giving much consideration to matters in the third level sector in the past two years and in July last year published its report on the examination of financial statements in the sector.  A key recommendation made in the report was that the committee was of the view that the balance between the Department and the HEA in the financial and governance oversight of the third level sector might need to be reviewed and updated.  The committee is of the opinion that the HEA has a key role to play in ensuring the important issues raised in the report will be addressed by each institution.<\/p><p>The committee is also of the opinion that the HEA needs to be empowered and resourced to carry out a greater oversight role effectively.  <br\/><br\/>Dr. Graham Love has been chief executive of the HEA for the past two years and is due to leave the organisation this month.  The committee felt it was important to engage with him and the Department prior to his stepping down from the role.  While there have been newspapers reports on his resignation and the committee did receive a copy of his resignation letter, our engagement today is not about the personal circumstances of his resignation but, rather, about ascertaining, as per the committee's recommendations on its work, the level of progress made towards the empowerment and resourcing of the HEA to ensure it will have greater oversight of the third level sector.  Accordingly, I ask members to keep the focus on the changes to the HEA and the Department's oversight of third level institutions.  <br\/><br\/>We are joined from the Department of Education and Skills by Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;, Secretary General; Mr. William Beausang, assistant secretary; Mr. Tom Gaynor, principal officer, and Ms Stephanie Good, assistant principal officer; and from the Higher Education Authority by Mr. Michael Horgan, chairman; Dr. Graham Love, chief executive; Mr. Neil McDermott, assistant principal officer; Ms Sheena Duffy, assistant principal officer; and Mr. Stewart Roche, management accountant.<br\/><br\/>I remind members, witnesses and those in the Visitors Gallery to turn off all mobile phones or switch them to airplane mode.  Switching them to silent mode is not sufficient because they can still interfere with the broadcasting and recording systems.<br\/><br\/>By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l<\/i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  If witnesses are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity, by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  <br\/><br\/>Members are reminded of the provisions within Standing Order 186 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government or the merits of the objectives of such policy or policies.  <br\/><br\/>While we expect witnesses to answer questions put to them by the committee clearly and with candour, they can and should expect to be treated fairly and with respect and consideration at all times in accordance with the witness protocol.  <br\/><br\/>I invite the Comptroller and Auditor General to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018101800002#FF00100","speaker":"1216","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1539849600,"counter":899,"content":"<p>The Higher Education Authority is the statutory planning and policy development body for higher education and research in Ireland.

It had gross expenditure of &euro;1.17 billion in 2017.

They were certified by the Comptroller and Auditor General at the end of June.  I am pleased to note that once again they have been certified, with no issues arising.  <\/p> <p>  In 2017 the HEA allocated over &euro;1 billion in funding to the higher education sector.  The funding covers the traditional core grant to institutions but also targeted initiatives such as Springboard which provides free places on courses for the unemployed and people returning to education and the Irish Research Council that acts as the key national funder of basic research across all disciplines.  This allocation of funding is a significant responsibility for the HEA but one that it performs effectively. <\/p> <p>  I would like to update the committee on other developments since we last appeared before it in May.  In May I briefed it on the status of the report arising from the independent review of the spin-out and sale of companies from Telecommunications Software and Systems Group, TSSG, at Waterford Institute of Technology and the reasons it had not been published.  I assure the committee that the HEA and the Department of Education and Skills are working together to progress the matter as soon as possible and I am happy to brief it in further detail today. <\/p> <p>  In November 2017 the HEA published Dr. Richard Thorn&rsquo;s report on the University of Limerick.  The report made 36 findings and ten recommendations to be implemented by the university.  The HEA continues its monitoring of the university's implementation of the recommendations arising from the report.  Eight of the ten recommendations have been implemented and the remaining two are on course for completion by the end of the year.<\/p> <p>  At the meeting in May I also briefed the committee on the HEA's rolling governance reviews.  Our first such review dealt with procurement and our second, intellectual property policies.  This year's rolling review will focus on employee remuneration and other benefits.  Like previous reviews, the rolling review is based on a sample range of universities, institutes of technology and other colleges.  The institutions to be examined as part of the review have been notified and fieldwork will commence shortly.<\/p> <p>  Procurement, rightly, remains an area of focus for the committee.  Our first rolling review in 2016 focused on procurement and led in part to the HEA's annual higher education procurement summit.  This year's summit, held in April, saw the launch of a corporate procurement plan template to help higher education institutions to better plan their procurement requirements and ensure better compliance with national procurement guidelines.  The plan has generated a lot of interest and there is a commitment by institutions to adopt the templates and complete the work to ensure and improve compliance in this area. <\/p> <p>  Earlier this year the Comptroller and Auditor General published his annual report on public sector financial reporting.  I am pleased to note that there continues to be improvement in the timeliness of the production of financial statements for higher education institutions, particularly universities.<\/p> <p>  This year has seen not only the passing of the technological universities legislation but also our first technological university designation.  In July the Government announced that the application for such status from the TU4Dublin consortium would be granted and it is on course to officially become a university next January.  Other technological university consortia continue to make progress with their respective applications. <\/p> <p>  Next week the HEA will commence its annual round of strategic dialogue meetings with higher education institutions.  At the meetings institutions will receive feedback from the HEA and a panel of external advisers on their mission-based performance compacts.  The compacts set out each institution&rsquo;s strategic priorities and contribution to overall system objectives. <\/p> <p>  As I finish up my role as chief executive, I acknowledge the work of HEA staff and their contribution in supporting and overseeing the development and growth of the higher education sector.  I wish my successor, Mr. Paul O&rsquo;Toole, the very best in taking up the role of interim chief executive.  I am confident that he will bring a valuable insight and experience from his time in SOLAS. <\/p> <p>  My colleagues and I will be happy to answer queries from the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018101800002#GG00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Graham Love"},{"type":"speech","time":1539849600,"counter":902,"content":"<p>Is Mr. O'Toole moving from SOLAS to the HEA?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018101800002#GG00500","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1539849600,"counter":903,"content":"<p>Correct.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018101800002#GG00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Graham Love"},{"type":"speech","time":1539849600,"counter":904,"content":"<p>I now invite Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018101800002#GG00700","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1539849600,"counter":905,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the invitation to appear before it.  To assist me in the discussion, I am joined by my colleagues, Mr. William Beausang and Mr Tony Gaynor.<\/p> <p>  The HEA&rsquo;s 2017 financial statements were certified by the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General on 29 June 2018 with a clear audit opinion.  The HEA is the statutory funding body for the higher education sector.  One of its core functions is the allocation of moneys provided by the Oireachtas for universities, institutes of technology and other designated institutions.  In 2017 the HEA allocated over &euro;1 billion of Exchequer funding to the higher education sector in the form of recurrent grants, access grants, capital grants and research grants.  <\/p> <p>  The importance of good governance is a theme which can be clearly identified within the HEA's financial statements.  In addition to the high standards of corporate governance within the authority, as evidenced by the financial statements, the HEA has also introduced a number of measures in recent years to further enhance its role in the governance and accountability of the higher education institutions within its remit.  Measures that have been taken include the following: the introduction of a new governance framework for the higher education system in 2015, the purpose of which is to provide assurance of compliance with legislative and other requirements and more timely and responsive interventions to address issues arising.<\/p><p>The new governance framework also makes clear the central oversight role of the HEA in monitoring governance practice across the system.<\/p><p> A further measure that has been introduced is the reduced timelines for the submission of draft accounts for certification by the Comptroller and Auditor General and the submission of annual governance statements to the HEA.  The HEA also meets quarterly with the Comptroller and Auditor General to discuss the status of his audits of the financial statements of higher education institutions and the identification of issues or difficulties arising.<\/p><p> In 2016 the HEA commenced the introduction of a programme of rolling reviews of governance matters.  The first rolling review focused on procurement, which was followed by a review of intellectual property in higher education institutions.  A further rolling review has commenced in 2018, focusing on staff remuneration and benefits in higher education institutions.<\/p><p> Another measure undertaken was the review of the allocation model for funding higher education institutions, undertaken by the HEA, which was published in January 2018.  The review proposes a reformed funding model that would provide for greater transparency in how State investment in higher education is allocated.  It would also provide for stronger and clearer links between national strategic priorities and the types of programme delivered in higher education institutions.  In addition, the HEA ensures codes of practice are in place in respect of the institutes of technology and the universities.  The updated code of governance for institutes of technology was published by the Technological Higher Education Association, THEA, in January 2018 and it is anticipated that the universities' code of practice will be completed shortly.<\/p><p> The Department of Education and Skills works closely with the HEA to strengthen governance arrangements and ensure a robust system of accountability in the sector.  The HEA, as a body that acts under the aegis of the Department, is required to comply with the 2016 code of practice for governance of State bodies.  The annual allocation letters from the Department to the HEA highlight the code&rsquo;s requirements.  Compliance with the code is one of the terms and conditions under which the Department funds the HEA.  In accordance with the provisions of the 2016 code of practice for governance of State bodies, the Department has a performance delivery agreement with the HEA.  It sets out the purpose and scope of the agreement and defines the roles of both organisations.  The core activities and key services to be provided by the HEA are agreed and set out, together with how each service commitment is to be measured.  The current agreement covers the period 1 January to 31 December 2018.  The 2018 performance delivery agreement supports specific high level goals and objectives of the Department and the HEA and sets targets in line with the HEA's statement of strategy and work plan for 2018.  It also defines the output and outcome indicators, on which the performance of the HEA will be measured.  A number of review meetings are set out within the agreement to allow the Department to formally review the HEA&rsquo;s progress towards the agreed key deliverables.<\/p><p> In addition to these meetings, the Department and the HEA meet more regularly than is provided for in the performance delivery agreement.  There are regular meetings on specific issues and general themes such as funding or governance across the sector.  As well as ensuring open channels of communication are maintained, these regular dialogues between the Department and the HEA facilitate a collaborative approach to managing issues presenting across the sector.<\/p><p> Another important element of the relationship between the HEA and the Department is the annual system performance report which sets out progress across the higher education sector against the agreed national policy objectives identified by the Minister.  In addition, the financial accountability framework is an agreement to provide for proper and effective use of public funding, effective control audit and accountability measures and cost effective and efficient delivery of services.  A corporate governance risk register and an early warning reporting system are also in place to enable the HEA to identify to the Department potential risks and allow for early intervention to address them.<\/p><p> During his time as chief executive of the HEA the Department has worked very closely and effectively with Dr. Love on a range of issues that include very significant reforms to the funding model for higher education, the institutional landscape and the governance framework between the HEA and the Department and between the HEA and higher education institutions.  I publicly acknowledge the contribution Dr. Love and his colleagues in the HEA have made in the past 18 months in delivering these important reforms.  I also wish him every success for the future.<\/p><p> I am conscious that the Department has been in correspondence in recent times with the Committee of Public Accounts on a number of issues particular to higher education.  I assure the committee that the issues raised in the sector are taken very seriously by the Department.  We are working with the institutions, through the HEA, to seek to have the issues dealt with appropriately and as efficiently as possible.  I will be happy to provide an update for the committee on any of the issues raised.<\/p><p> Before concluding, I would like to highlight one issue, in particular.  I understand the committee has inquired about the current position on the independent review of the spin-out and sale of companies from the Telecommunications Software and Systems Group at Waterford Institute of Technology.  As members are aware, I am precluded from involvement in the matter and will defer to my departmental colleagues present to answer questions members may have in this regard.  I will be happy to answer any other question for the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018101800002#GG00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1539849600,"counter":907,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;.

Because it is his last appearance before the Committee of Public Accounts, I thank Dr. Love for his service with the HEA and engagement with the committee.  He has been a very helpful witness on the number of occasions he has appeared before us.  He has also been a staunch defender of the higher education sector.  I commend him for the work he has done in that regard.  I have some questions about his statement of resignation, to which I will come shortly.<\/p> <p>  I have some questions about the independent review of the spin-out companies at Waterford Institute of Technology.  I hope Dr. Love shares or at least understands the frustration other members and I feel about this issue, given that we were due to receive a report last September or October.  I met a lot of people who had engaged with Mr. Michael McLoone as part of the process.  I also met him at his request and know that a lot of people came forward.  I believe in due process and know that we cannot draw conclusions and must wait until the report is published.  The committee has received a letter from the Teachers Union of Ireland, TUI, which was debated at our last hearing and in which it expressed concerns on behalf of its members who, in good faith, had engaged in the process.  They feel aggrieved that one year on there is still no report, be it good, bad or indifferent.<\/p> <p>  Dr. Love briefed the committee in private session on some of the challenges.  I do not want to put him in a position where it might be more difficult to publish the report, but does he understand the frustration of members and WIT staff?  Perhaps he might outline for the committee - if he has the numbers - how many staff at WIT engaged with Mr. McLoone as part of the process.  Was it dozens?  When are we likely to see the report?  One way or another, we need a resolution of the issue today.  If Dr. Love is not in a position to answer the question, the Department needs to answer it.  I am very anxious to ensure absolute clarity for everybody  involved, including the management and staff at WIT.  Everybody would benefit from having the report published as soon as possible.  If Dr. Love is not in a position to answer the question, I will put it to the departmental officials.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018101800002#HH00500","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1539849600,"counter":909,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

I make it clear that there has been a spotlight on it and the frustration is palpable on our side of the table also.  It is our intention that a report will be published.  This is a statement of principle and objective.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked how many people had engaged in the review process with Mr. McLoone.  More than 50 came forward, more than we had expected at the time.  We were surprised at the number.<\/p> <p>  The third question - probably the more important - was about the status of the report.  It is almost one year on, which is intolerable and deeply frustrating for us.  As I said in my earlier update, I must be careful in what I say, but I must give enough information to satisfy the committee.  We have run into very significant legal challenges or problems with the report, including a very considered statement that, effectively, I would be exposing the HEA to a significant risk of litigation and damages.<\/p><p>We went further than that where we produced a modified version where major risks were considered to be present.  We got a senior counsel opinion on this, who went as far as to say that we were not necessarily empowered to be doing this.

It is with the Department and it is trying to figure out what to do and is getting advice from the Attorney General.  How did we end up in that situation?

The Deputy was briefed by the CEO of the HEA at the committee's May meeting in private session on where things stood.  Subsequent to that briefing we met with the HEA, the CEO  and his team, to discuss the draft review and the legal advice that they had got on the submissions that they had received, of the CEO that Dr. Love had outlined.  We responded to the CEO with our view of that legal assessment, back in June.  The meeting was on 5 June and we met with the CEO and his team on 11 June.  This was not a legal response but one from the officials in the Department to the legal advice that the HEA advised the committee of at their May private session.  That letter was considered by a subcommittee of the board of the HEA and culminated in the HEA requesting senior counsel's advice.<\/p> <p>  The senior counsel's advice is a much broader piece of work relating, as Dr. Love has already said, to the powers that the HEA has to carry out reviews and investigations.

The HEA is good at allocating funding; it is good at policy advice and the gathering statistics and data analytics etc on policy advice; it is good, to a degree, at advocacy for the system; but it struggles significantly with the fourth function - the one that was conferred on the HEA after the Hunt report and the national strategy published in 2013 - which is the oversight and regulatory piece.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018101800002#JJ02100","nonspeaker":"Dr. Graham Love"},{"type":"speech","time":1539849600,"counter":931,"content":"<p>Why is that Dr. Love?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018101800002#JJ02200","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1539849600,"counter":932,"content":"<p>Our legislation simply does not enable the HEA properly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018101800002#JJ02300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Graham Love"},{"type":"speech","time":1539849600,"counter":933,"content":"<p>Is it the legislation solely or is it the dynamic, the relationship between the Department and the HEA?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018101800002#JJ02400","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1539849600,"counter":934,"content":"<p>It is significantly the legislation and that is what Mr. Beausang was alluding to earlier.

It is quite obvious to all members of the committee, who have experience of the issues concerning the HEA, that there is a serious breakdown when it comes to roles and responsibilities between the Department and HEA.  We have had a number of reports and interim reports on third level issues.  If there is a significant, difficult issue, what is the position on the various roles?  I refer to the Accounting Officers in the individual institutions, HEA and Department.  The questions of who is responsible and who takes responsibility for dealing with issues are all over the place.  It is not fully known internally within the three tiers, and it is certainly not fully known to people who work in them or to us, the members of the Committee of Public Accounts.  We know the heads of the institutions are the accountable officers but it is almost as if there is a pipeline of responsibility, through the HEA, through the Department, etc.  Where one takes responsibility in its own right is not very clear.  That is a real issue.  Following on from the questions of the last speaker, I would like Dr. Love to give us specific examples, if he can, of where he feels, from a governance point of view, responsibly is falling between the cracks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018101800002#LL00700","speaker":"1349"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1539849600,"counter":966,"content":"<p>I will give a few but I have to be careful about processes that are under way.

It is in this regard that one finds who has the power or the role to go in, or the legislative basis to do so.

The HEA's role is changing significantly.  The allocation of funding role is staying the same.  The organisation has been doing this for 30 years very well.  The gathering of statistics and producing of intelligence about the system for policy advice are being done very well, in the main, but, since the Colin Hunt report of 2011, which turned into the national strategy for higher education, a significant regulatory oversight role has been given to the HEA.  The policy has developed quite a bit over the past few years but the legislation underpinning it has not matched that.  That is where we have run into trouble.

The matter dates back to June.  I will refer to the transcript of that day.  On three occasions, December 2015, on which date I would not have been here, June 2017 and June 2018, the Committee of Public Accounts was informed by the president and vice president of CIT that they never received a disclosure before the Act.  Dr. Love was alluding to this with Deputy Kelly but I want to go into a bit more detail.  On three occasions, they said that.  There was reference to an unnamed whistleblower in the context of a letter that came to the vice president.  That was eventually admitted.<\/p><p>We know this is nonsense because I have an email from the vice president which was referred to in a Topical Issue debate on this issue by Deputy Kelly, Deputy Cullinane and me.  I will read it into the record: &quot;Just to confirm that I have a copy of the letter you gave to [X, who was a head of faculty in the college] dated the 9<sup>th<\/sup>of October [This email is dated 12 October 2012] and that I will deal with it.&quot;  This is from the vice president, the person who told us on three occasions, along with colleagues, that there was no disclosure.  It goes on:<\/p><blockquote>I have attached copies of two policies that will guide us in terms of developing an approach when we meet on Tuesday at 6.  Please note that the disclosure policy is only in draft currently but I would suggest that we will apply it in this case.<\/blockquote> <p>That is the email of 12 October 2012.  It would seem to my untrained interpretation to be a clear example of what we would now describe as a disclosure, considering that use of the disclosure policy, albeit in draft format, was suggested by that self-same individual, then vice president, who was responsible for a wide variety of areas and who suggested that no such disclosure took place.

In those circumstances I would have very significant legal rights in terms of compensation, for example.  Those are the circumstances in which the issue is ever only answered.  Outside of that, it is around this process of making an assessment of whether it is likely and whether people believe it falls under the categories in the Protected Disclosures Act.  It is an important distinction and we can never be absolute.  There are clearly circumstances in which one might look at a report or disclosure and be quite convinced that it falls into the category of protected disclosure and should be treated as such, but one cannot say it definitively.

We have had a very good hearing for a number of reasons.  The meeting has given us a glimpse into where improvements need to be made, and we, as legislators, must do our part.  I fully concur with Dr. Love that we need to get this right at local level in the institutes.  Governance boards in institutes and universities are extremely important.  If one gets governance right in the first instance, the HEA would not spend 60% or 70% of its time engaged in firefighting.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018101800002#SS01600","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1539849600,"counter":1314,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018101800002#SS01700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Graham Love"},{"type":"speech","time":1539849600,"counter":1315,"content":"<p>Essentially, it is engaged in firefighting rather than proactively considering the necessary strategic changes and development.  I hear that message loud and clear.  There are real lessons to be learned.  I hope the Department will also accept that because it is very important for all us that that is the case.<\/p> <p>  We are also very mindful of the huge amount of talent in the third level sector.  I will discuss Waterford Institute of Technology in a moment.  I have visited Telecommunications Software and Systems Group, TSSG, in Waterford a number of times.  I have also visited ArcLabs.  I was blown away by the incredible cutting edge research and development and technology in those centres.  Such talent should not be lost and it is not lost on me.  Sometimes it is portrayed as that by those who seem to have an issue with people asking genuine questions.  The work that is being done is amazing and I share Dr. Love's enthusiasm and respect for the huge level of talent we have in the third level sector. <\/p> <p>  I will return to the Waterford issue because it is important but I will first quickly contextualise it.  The matter first appeared on the radar of the Committee of Public Accounts when the accountable person, the head of the institute, made what seemed to be genuine mistake when, in answer to a question at a meeting of the committee in 2015, as to whether he was a director of the FeedHenry company, he said \"No\".  Subsequently, he wrote to the committee stating he had made a mistake and confirmed that he was a director.  However, he did not disclose that he was also a shareholder but we subsequently got that information.  He then asked the governing body to do a report and examine whether he had acted appropriately.  It then did a review and the individual in question then asked the HEA to validate this internal review.  Then, coincidentally or not, protected disclosures were made to me and information came to light that people had broader concerns connected with research and development in spinout companies.  This led to the deeper dive, as described by Dr. Love, that resulted in the HEA review.  Mr. McLoone was appointed to be the person to conduct the review.  He met many more people than Dr. Love may have expected. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018101800002#SS01800","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1539849600,"counter":1316,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018101800002#SS01900","nonspeaker":"Dr. Graham Love"},{"type":"speech","time":1539849600,"counter":1317,"content":"<p>A large number of people came forward.

This person said that the member, referring to me, was trying to deconstruct 20 years of work done by the institute; that he was trying to damage Waterford city and county; that he was not acting in the best interests of the staff; and that he was acting on the basis of ulterior motivations which he has never put on the record.

That is actually quite serious for our work.  It could call into question previous reviews and whether they have protections.  Perhaps some of those were done outside the scope of the HEA.  To me, this has very profound implications beyond WIT.<\/p><p>We cannot pre-empt and one has to extrapolate from the advice of the Attorney General, but if it is the case that the report has to be shelved, then we are in very dangerous territory, as to future reviews, who does them and what exactly the role of the HEA in all of that might be?  We raised concerns about some of this, about these independent reports that were being done and their nature and powers.  The Cathaoirleach may remember that there was a lot of them and we had these concerns.  In fact we raised concern about legalities on the Waterford one.<\/p><p> We are where we are with it, in many respects.

As we sit here today, however, we have 50 people who engaged with a process who are left without answers to questions that they put.  That is the outworking of it.  They deserve the answers.  Those 50 people who engaged with the process, many of whom still work within the institute, deserve answers.<\/p><p> In a point to Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;, individuals have to account for their own behaviour.  Given how I was treated by senior people in WIT, if I was one of those 50 people who came forward, I would be thinking if that is the way they treat a member of the Committee of Public Accounts and a TD in the constituency, it raises very serious questions.  I am uncomfortable about that because it is not fair or right.  Those people who work in that organisation who engaged with the process deserve a report and answers to questions that they put, be they good, bad or indifferent.

Wherever he is headed, the best of luck.  A number of things arise from our last engagement that I want to put on record.  <\/p> <p>  On that specific disclosure, in June 2018, the vice-president said that the person did not engage.  In October 2012, the discloser requested a meeting with the president, the vice-president and the head of faculty.  The meeting took place but only with the vice-president.  In November 2012, the whistleblower-discloser asked for an investigator.  The vice-president did not set terms of reference and was told that that would not happen.  In 2013,  the discloser wrote - I have seen evidence of all of this - to the chair of the audit committee, to the president, to the chair of the Cork Institute of Technology, CIT board, requesting a dispute resolution committee, which was turned down.  In 2013 also, the whistleblower went to the office and met with each of the vice-president and registrar - now the president, vice-president of strategy, head of faculty and head of school.  In 2016, the whistleblower's legal firm asked twice if the CIT board was made aware of the case.  There was no response to that.  In 2017, the discloser wrote directly to each board member without response and in 2017 also wrote to the then and current president without response.<\/p> <p>  It is important that that account was defined as not engaging last June by the vice-president.  The reason I am bringing this up is that the HEA requested a report, which will come back and feed into its own conclusions.  Many people are in the same positions now, or maybe have moved up a little, as was the position as far back as 2012, most notably the chair of the board and the vice-president, who are one and the same, and the president is a former vice-president.  I hope, and I am putting it to the chairman of the HEA - Dr. Love is obviously moving on but hopefully the chairman will still be with us - that when this report emerges, that the HEA's consideration of it, without prejudice to what is going to be in it, will be is tempered by the fact that many of the participants in drawing up the report may well have been associated with the subject matter of the original disclosure in 2012, and indeed that of 2017.  There is the X plus one that the chairman mentioned - a disclosure could be made against me, yet I am the party that this disclosure comes to; in the context of CIT, this does not exist.  It is the Department or the HEA or the HEA or the Department.  This should be borne in mind, also.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018101800002#UU00300","speaker":"1346"},{"type":"speech","time":1539849600,"counter":1366,"content":"<p>I must interrupt for a moment to say that I have to leave.

It is, however, important to note the role of the Department in terms of enterprise policy and to note that as part of all of our strategic work and our policies we are involved in recognising the role of enterprise and the need for sustainable development.  We know that the development of low-carbon, bio and circular economies presents commercial opportunities to companies across many sectors in Ireland, and we work on that basis.<\/p> <p>  In my statement I have touched on the importance we are placing on the Future Jobs for Ireland initiative, which will be launched next year.  This very much takes into account environmental issues, international agreements and industry responses around the global economy and the technology sector.<\/p> <p>  Regional development is a particular concern of Government and we have focused very strongly on the need for balanced regional development and job creation.  My statement includes some data on the work the Department has done in that area, which is all focused within the development of the national planning framework.  This is also focused on sustainable enterprise.<\/p> <p>  We are particularly involved in innovation policy, which is very strong with regard to our strategy for research development.  Again, this has a strong focus on Ireland being a global innovation leader while being very focused on sustainable resource management.  This brings us into many of the areas this committee is looking at with regard to climate change and decarbonisation.  The Department has completed a major refresh of our research priority areas, which includes energy, climate action and sustainability; advanced and smart manufacturing; and sustainable food production and processing.<\/p> <p>  Disruptive technology is another initiative of the Department where we have highlighted and put out a major call.  We have had a very successful response to that and it will be coming through at the end of the year.<\/p> <p>  The Department is represented on a wide number of committees across Government.  We contribute from our research perspective and from the corporate perspective.  Corporate responsibility is something on which we lead and we are taking a very strong approach and we are working with companies to develop it.  All of this is around mitigation efforts.  We are involved in adapting and mitigating and we have reviewed all of our policies from the climate perspective.<\/p> <p>  The Department also recognises that there are many opportunities for Irish business.  The whole development of the bio-economy and the circular economy provides opportunities for Irish companies to get involved.  We have reflected that.<\/p> <p>  I have given the committee some details of the schemes in the mitigation sector.  I have touched on the role of our enterprise agencies IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland, and on the strong partnerships working with industry in this area, and in particular Science Foundation Ireland.  I am delighted that Professor Ferguson can be with us today.

Professor Ferguson might comment on the science in terms of the research centres.<\/p> <p>  From the Department's perspective, our main contribution to reducing emissions is through the European Union ETS.  That involves approximately 100 of Ireland's largest energy users who account for 25% of emissions.  All Irish industrial installations with installed energy generating capacity of more than 30% are included in the ETS.  For the larger energy users, they are there.  Is it achieving its aims?  It is true that we are not on course to meet our climate change targets.  The projections are that we will fall short of both our emissions and our renewable energy targets.  We have a target set and we are working to achieve that.  It is estimated that we will reach approximately 80% of the target.<\/p> <p>  What I have heard is that as the 2013 to 2020 requirements from the EU in particular run out, the sectors covered must reduce emissions by 43%, so there are areas on which we have to work.  Our job is to help companies move towards those targets.  We have a number of schemes in place.  Enterprise Ireland, EI, and IDA Ireland can talk about their specific schemes.  In particular, we work closely with our colleagues in the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  <\/p> <p>  It is the case that as enterprises, and particularly smaller enterprises, move to reduce emissions there will be costs involved and, over time, there will be areas that we will need to help and incentivise to do that.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Sherlock mentioned the food companies.  Some of the bigger food companies are in that sector.  Many of them are already in the 100 companies, so they are working already to reduce their emissions.  There is a huge amount of work going on in that area.  Those of us in the Department are very much involved in the research aspects.  Professor Ferguson can speak on the research institutes.  I will ask Ms Bourke to contribute on the ETS.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018101800002#F00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Orlaigh Quinn"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1539865800,"counter":1428,"content":"<p>The emissions trading scheme is the key scheme for getting the large energy users into energy efficiency.  We are now moving into phase 4 post-2021 and each iteration of the scheme is more stringent, with less auctioning of allowances.  Surplus allowances will be withdrawn through a market stability reserve.  That will increase the price of allowances within the ETS and lead to the more efficient operation of the scheme.  That scheme has just been negotiated.  The Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment will be going out to consultation shortly on some of the options within that scheme and looking for applications on it.  Each phase of the scheme is leading to an increased price of carbon, which will incentivise emissions reduction.  That is our main focus for companies in the beverages, pharmaceuticals, healthcare and ICT areas, the dairy co-operatives and food companies.<\/p> <p>  In parallel, there is the large energy user scheme run by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI.  Two hundred of the large energy users are engaged in that scheme.  They account for 50% of total industrial use and 20% of primary energy use.<\/p> <p>  There is a series of other schemes for the smaller users to try to improve energy efficiency with mentoring programmes, access to technology experts and management training in the area of energy reduction.  There are a number of agency client companies and businesses and the key objectives of those is to reduce their energy consumption.<\/p> <p>  As Dr. Quinn referred to earlier, we have worked with companies on corporate social responsibility and shown how businesses can improve their business activity by showing they are energy efficient and sustainable.

Competitiveness and innovation are the areas where the environmental supports for companies are most relevant.  As has been mentioned, there is the ETS for larger companies.  For smaller companies, in particular, we have a significant number of competitiveness supports under the Lean programme.  The programme aims to make companies aware of the dividend available by improving their resource efficiency.  That will increase their competitiveness and, in many cases these days, their access to the customer base.  We know that consumer demand is driving behavioural change in companies.  Our competitiveness supports for companies in this area range from straightforward guide books on resource efficiency for smaller companies - many of our client companies are quite small - through to funding feasibility projects to examine improving production design to make it more environmentally sustainable.<\/p> <p>  On the innovation side, there are a number of initiatives co-funded by us and IDA Ireland and in close co-operation with SFI.  Our technology centres, for example, are industry-led, collaborative research entities that look at where industries together can achieve a competitive advantage through research.  In a number of the technology centres there is a strong focus on energy efficiency and improving environmental outcomes.  A good example is the dairy processing technology centre based in the University of Limerick, in which all of the major dairy players are involved.  As well as looking at their cost competitiveness, one of the pillars is energy efficiency and environmental research.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018101800002#G01100","nonspeaker":"Ms Rowena Dwyer"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1539865800,"counter":1442,"content":"<p>The environment has been a major feature of the way in which IDA Ireland has gone about executing its mandate for more than ten years.

The second initiative was we established new forms of FDI teams in 2015 and tasked them with going to the marketplace to identify potential investment opportunities aligned with a pro-environment, positive climate action agenda.

By way of showing the committee that some of this research is coming through, a company called Silicon Kingdom Holdings, which is all of two weeks old, is carrying out active CO2 capture in Ireland and will build a small pilot CO2 farm over the course of 2019-2020, with one or two clusters of CO2 collectors, each capable of capturing approximately 1 tonne of CO2 a day.

As a result, our ambition in this area cannot be great enough.  I have a number of questions about just transition.  In her report, Dr. Quinn rightly recognises the economic opportunities which come from the transition to low-carbon and circular economies.  However, she fails to refer to the impacts on employees and communities which have come to depend on this fossil fuel economy.  These impacts are significant and we must address them out of concern for the welfare of the citizens and communities involved.  In addition, failing to ensure a just transition makes making the transition even more difficult.  What is the Department's understanding of the just transition process and what are its plans for the coming years?  We have a just transition commission, and SIPTU, ICTU, F&oacute;rsa and IMPACT have all been working on this issue for some time.  What is the Department doing to help the trade unions support their employees?  Could the witnesses give an indication of specific things it is doing in this regard?<\/p> <p>  Health, the arts, education and community work are low-carbon job areas in Ireland, which is great.  What supports is the Department giving to these industries to grow in the context of climate?  Is it refusing to support the expansion of fossil fuel-based economic activity?  From an enterprise perspective, has it set a line in the sand and said, \"That is it.  It is over.  No more support for the fossil fuel-based industry.\"?<\/p> <p>  Regarding renewable jobs, at least 7,200 jobs in solar are waiting in the pipeline.  David Connolly's Green Plan Ireland and the Northern Ireland Green New Deal Group have both outlined how there are opportunities for 100,000 new jobs if Government takes action now.  I do not see any mention of this kind of ambition in Dr. Quinn's report.  Why is that?  As Professor Ferguson outlined, an opportunity exists.  Why are we not unleashing this opportunity?  We do not see it in Dr. Quinn's report.<\/p> <p>  Regarding FDI, Microsoft, for example, is looking for 100% renewable energy to run its offices and IDA Ireland is not providing this.  Why is that the case?  Ireland is the second windiest country in Europe after Scotland.  In Scotland, 50% of renewables are owned by community co-operatives.  Why are we not doing the same here?  What measures could be put in place to support the community co-operative system?  What is the Department doing to provide good-quality jobs in cheap energy for rural Ireland?<\/p> <p>  What is its definition of \"sustainability\" in the context of climate change?  What is the analytical approach used by the Department in assessing the sustainability of business in Ireland?  Does the Department carry out carbon footprint analysis?  Does it measure material flows?  Does it have a unit with the necessary expertise to analyse the sustainability and climate impact of policies which affect business?

That plan is the responsibility of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment but we obviously have a very strong interest in it and have played our part as a stakeholder.  We must acknowledge that there are implications for employment in any transition, including, as Deputy Corcoran Kennedy mentioned, in terms of peat extraction, power generation and other environmental services.  We are very conscious of the transition period that some enterprises need in order to move from their current state to a low-carbon state.  The bioeconomy policy statement, for example, identified the opportunities to grow rural and regional businesses and jobs, and we see this as a major opportunity.  In fact, I think when the Minister published her most recent budget statement, her focus was very much on Brexit, regional development and innovation, which are the three themes on which we are working with her to deliver.  There is huge potential to grow rural business.  We accept that for some enterprises the opportunities are not there and it will take time.  We also recognise that our current employment figures are extremely successful and we now face a very different set of problems from those we faced seven years ago when we had 16% unemployment.  We now have 5.4% unemployment.  Again, part of the model we are working on will flow from the research that Professor Ferguson outlined regarding the pilot bioeconomy centre at Lisheen.<\/p><p> We are aware of the new employment opportunities from a circular economy.

However, we are in a different phase of economic development now so we are working on identifying the following: quality jobs; pressure points; and areas where Ireland can innovate and add value.

I am talking here in terms of the national development plan or the national planning framework.

Let us say that a super company wants to locate operations here.  It is a massive FDI opportunity and there is massive job potential but, depending on the nature of the business, it does not tick all of the boxes when it comes to policies on CO2 or other greenhouse gas emissions.  Where would our guests draw the line?  Would climate change take precedence?  Where would they draw the line and say, \"Sorry, we are not interested.  We suggest you go somewhere else\"?  Let us say afterwards it becomes public knowledge that the organisations our guests represent turned away a company that wanted to create 1,000 jobs.  In that instance, how would they justify turning down such an opportunity?  Would they say that the company in question was going to have an enormous impact in the context of the greenhouse gas emissions of this nation?  Where would they draw the line?

We can exert influence on things like plastic packaging and we support our colleagues in the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, which has overall responsibility in that area.  Retailers have announced initiatives to reduce the amount of plastic packaging they use.  Again, we can support such initiatives and we can bring companies together.  I know that Enterprise Ireland will convene an industry-led conference on the matter in early 2019.  My Department has what I call a soft influence in those areas and we work collectively with colleagues across other Departments.

The Senator makes valid points.  Our approach to this is that we must try to match the right locations with the profile of the investor.  It is important we take the investors' needs into account.  One must consider that an increasing number are in the services sector and they emphasise the importance of locations either in or near cities.  That does not prevent us, however, from showcasing other locations.  We take a hierarchical approach, from cities and city regions to large towns and rural areas, as appropriate.  Manufacturers, for example, do not want to locate in a city or city region.  Rather, they want their own dedicated site in a more rural location.  We showcase a variety of locations, therefore, to our clients.  In Mayo, specifically, we have taken the step of putting an advance office building in Castlebar, and the Government has given us &euro;150 million specifically for a regional property development programme to put some of the enabling infrastructure in place in advance of an investment decision, with a view to raising the overall attractiveness of a variety of locations including rural areas.<\/p> <p>  On data centres, there are approximately 45 in the country.  We look at their development in two phases.  They first appeared in the 1990s and the vast majority of them were attracted to the eastern seaboard and the region near Dublin for two reasons.  They needed high-capacity, high-speed broadband and they needed access to the high-capacity points in the electricity grid.  There was an automatic bias, therefore, towards the eastern seaboard, which was understandable from their perspective to enable their businesses to operate.  Following EirGrid's reinforcement and investment in the national grid on a national basis, and following investment in fibre-optic cables, we anticipate a second phase of growth where the data centres will take a more active look at regional locations, potentially including the Senator's region.  We have completed a report looking at a variety of locations in a regional context that could potentially accommodate the next phase of data centre development.  We now see the data centre industry potentially becoming an instrument or a vehicle for regional development.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018101800002#L00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kieran Donoghue"},{"type":"speech","time":1539865800,"counter":1488,"content":"<p>What are the additional costs of doing business?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018101800002#L00600","speaker":"1425"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1539865800,"counter":1489,"content":"<p>With carbon taxes and the public service obligation, PSO, levy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018101800002#L00700","nonspeaker":"Chairman"},{"type":"speech","time":1539865800,"counter":1490,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018101800002#L00800","speaker":"1425"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1539865800,"counter":1491,"content":"<p>We have not done a formal assessment of what the costs would be for the enterprise sector if there was an increase in the carbon tax or the PSO levy.

I will be brief.  The committee's discussions, appropriately, are focused around mitigation, reducing emissions, trying to insulate and do things better and that is terrific but there is new science coming on stream around how to actively cut emissions without necessarily cutting activity.  I will send the committee the report of the Royal Society and Royal Academy of Engineering entitled, Greenhouse Gas Removal, from which I will comment on two or three issues relevant to Ireland.  <\/p> <p>  I have spoken a little about the rehydration of peatlands and carbon capture.  I ask that the committee not necessarily demonise oil and gas because we are getting close to low carbon gas.  There is a lot of gas extraction going on offshore in Mayo and Cork.  Once gas has been extracted from a particular area one then concentrates on pumping back down carbon dioxide.  These fossil fuels will be required in any transition to a low carbon economy.  The trick is to lower the carbon footprint of the gas extraction.  There is a big business opportunity in terms of reusing the vast amount of empty space available once the gas has been taken out.<\/p> <p>  I would like now to focus on an issue I have not spoken about before, particularly for the benefit of members from rural Ireland.  Five per cent of the world's global emissions are from concrete manufacture.  Concrete is used in buildings.  When silica is heated it gives off carbon dioxide and this leaves one with a carbonate which makes concrete.  There is an alternative way of doing this.  Basalt, of which there is a lot in Donegal and in the North of Ireland, can be crushed into a powder and spread over the ground.  It then absorbs carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.  This is one way of trapping carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere.  This can be used as a fertiliser but interestingly it can also be used for making concrete.  If concrete is made in the way I have just described not only is the carbon footprint reduced, the concrete is stronger and throughout the life of the building it absorbs CO2 .  In terms of visionary thinking, grinding up basalt would lead to a whole new industry in rural Ireland.  This is a really interesting strategy, which is at research stage and also at the early implementation stage.  There is a very exciting and active research pathway but it would be wrong to say that any of those is immediately commercialisable.  <\/p> <p>  Senator Mulherin asked about marine renewable energy, which is definitely an active research area.  Currently, it is expensive and inefficient, which is being examined in the research.  Wind and so on is much more efficient at the present time but this does not mean that wave energy cannot improve.  There are active research groups around the world, including Marine and Renewable Energy Ireland, MaREI, SFI's research centre in Cork.  I encourage the committee to visit the centre, where members will see test wave plants and so on.  Wave energy has potential for the future.  All of these areas for potential for the future.  <\/p> <p>  As a scientist I am optimistic.  Climate change is a big problem and a big issue but I remind the committee that no crisis that was ever predicted in human history has come to pass.  Many times we have predicted that we were going to run out of food but it has never happened.  Why?  It is because science innovation has moved faster than the crisis, through either mechanisation of forms, the fertilisation of ground, genetic engineering of crops and so on.  I believe the opportunity in climate change will be for the science and innovation to move faster than the problem.  This means doing what we do better in terms of mitigation and so on and focusing on new industries.  I ask the committee not to lose sight of this and that we have to transition from existing fossil fuels into an new era, part of which is low carbon gas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018101800002#N00600","nonspeaker":"Professor Mark Ferguson"},{"type":"speech","time":1539865800,"counter":1521,"content":"<p>If we are going to look to new technologies and new ways of doing things, then what is most important is that we do it for the common good.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018101800002#N00700","speaker":"1385"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1539865800,"counter":1522,"content":"<p>Correct.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018101800002#N00800","nonspeaker":"Professor Mark Ferguson"},{"type":"speech","time":1539865800,"counter":1523,"content":"<p>It is important that in moving to clean energy and renewable energies we do things right but as a nation we are not doing it right.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018101800002#N00900","speaker":"1385"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1539865800,"counter":1524,"content":"<p>As a senior civil servant, we work for the common good .
