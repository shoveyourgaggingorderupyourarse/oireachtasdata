Members of the committee are attending remotely from within the precincts of Leinster House due to the constitutional requirement that in order to participate in meetings, members must be physically present within the confines of the place where the Parliament has chosen to sit, which is Leinster House or the Dublin Convention Centre.

I also members to use the raise-your-hand function on Teams when they wish to contribute and take it down again when they are finished.  I ask them to keep their mobile phones on silent or switched off.  Members are reminded of the provision within  Standing Order 218 that a committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy of Government or a Minister of the Government or the merits of the objective of such policies.  Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make a charges against a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<\/p> <p>  We have five items of business.

The first No. R0665 from Mr. Denis Egan, chief executive of the Irish Horseracing Regulatory Board, IHRB, dated 14 June and providing information requested by the committee relating to the cost and timeline for the installation of CCTV at racecourses.  At our meeting of 29 June, we agreed to note and publish this item and hold it over for consideration at today's meeting.  It is an issue I wish to raise.

In all honesty, the correspondence is a bit petty and it is a poor response, almost childlike in its manner.  However, I welcome the clarification of a few details that the committee had picked up incorrectly.  The fact is that the IHRB had for years been talking about CCTV cameras, at least since 2017.  It is true that it diverted funds for that away to the online integrity portal.  I understand the matter is coming before the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine in the next few days.  That committee also had concerns around items in the media.  The matter will be discussed at that meeting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021070600002#A01100","speaker":"1497"},{"type":"speech","time":1625560200,"counter":15,"content":"<p>The key issue here is that we had all read the same information the same way.

The important thing is that the CCTV be installed in the stables at every racecourse to protect the industry and the individuals who work within it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021070600002#A01200","speaker":"1489"},{"type":"speech","time":1625560200,"counter":16,"content":"<p>Both Deputies mentioned the importance of the industry.  It gets in the region of &euro;70 million a year from the public purse.  There has been a long and winding road with this issue.  I looked through my notes last night.  Some &euro;18 million was awarded for the integrity fund back in 2018.  Twenty-five racetracks in the State were to start a programme of installing CCTV.  An amount of &euro;60,000 was allocated for CCTV systems at four tracks in 2018.  Some &euro;80,000 was then allocated in 2019.  We were told in correspondence that the &euro;60,000 was not spent and lapsed.  The &euro;80,000 was transferred and reallocated for licensing.  The &euro;80,000 comes back into play in 2018.  That money was provided to install CCTV at four tracks.  At this point, only one of the 25 tracks, Leopardstown, has CCTV.  Members can tell me otherwise if I have that wrong.<\/p> <p>  On 4 May 2021, invitations were eventually published for tenders after we followed up on all of this earlier in the year.<\/p><p>The question is why did it take three years to get this far.  Why were the four tracks not done in 2019?  I do not know what the answer to that question is.  When the &euro;80,000 was first allocated in 2018, what happened there?  Why was the original &euro;60,000 in 2018 not used?  It is a really long and twisty road the board has travelled with it.  I ask that the clerk write back to it.  I welcome that the agriculture committee is taking this issue up as well.  Its members will pursue this vigorously.  We should ask the IHRB to inform us of progress because it said in its last letter that the invitation for tenders was only published on 4 May.  The closing date for submissions of tenders was 21 May.  That has been extended, according to the letter, and the conclusion of the contract is August 2021.  The IHRB goes on to say: \"However, the number of tenders and the complexities of the submissions may impact on the above timelines.\"  That indicates we may have further delays, so we should ask the board to be informed after that date on what progress has been made and has that process has been concluded.  Is that agreed by the committee?  Agreed.  I thank members.<\/p><p> The next item is No. 667B from Mr. Maurice Buckley, chairperson of the Office of Public Works, OPW, dated 18 June 2021, providing information requested by the committee on the ongoing discussion between the OPW and the landlord of Miesian Plaza, now the headquarters of the Department of Health.  It concerns the OPW's mismeasurement, or I suppose we could call it under-measuring, of the floor space which was flagged by the Comptroller and Auditor General and is expected to cost the taxpayer about &euro;10 million during the lifetime of the lease.  We addressed the matter in our report on our engagement on the OPW which we published in May.  The OPW has been in negotiations with the landlord since 2018.  According to this correspondence, a meeting took place on 3 June but no further information is supplied other than to say that both parties are committed to continuing the process.  At our meeting on 29 June we agreed to hold over this item for consideration at today&rsquo;s public meeting.  We also agreed to request the agenda of the meeting referred to in the correspondence, the minutes and details of the matters discussed, including the outcome of the meeting, and the agenda for the next meeting and when it is scheduled to take place.  Deputy Catherine Murphy flagged the Miesian Plaza item for discussion.

It is fair to say that given they have been meeting since 2018, the OPW is, from what we have seen so far, not in a very strong position legally.

I understand the landlord may have other properties rented out to the State.<\/p> <p>  No. 668 is correspondence from Ms Vivienne Flood, head of public affairs at RT&Eacute;, dated 18 June.  It provides information requested by the committee regarding the audit being conducted by Revenue, which relates to RT&Eacute;&rsquo;s engagement of contractors.  At our meeting on 29 June we agreed to note and publish this item of correspondence, and to hold it over for consideration in public session today.  We have an ongoing exchange of correspondence arising from our engagement with RT&Eacute;, representatives of which were before us on 27 April.  We requested further information arising from that meeting and have sought clarification and additional information on a number of areas.  The correspondence before us today is a response to our letter of 8 June.  Arising from our meetings on 15 and 22 June, we issued another letter to RT&Eacute; on 28 June, to which we await a response.  We also sent a letter to the Minister expressing the committee&rsquo;s concerns about the lack of information RT&Eacute; has provided to the committee.

When we asked RT&Eacute; it cited the confidentiality agreement with Revenue.  It is clear from Revenue's correspondence there is no restriction on its part.  I therefore propose we write to RT&Eacute; again asking it, in the public interest and considering it is substantially funded through a compulsory charge on each household, to publish the full details of that settlement with Revenue in order for us to have a better picture of the work on bogus self-employment and other issues this committee has been actively engaged on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021070600002#B00600","speaker":"1451"},{"type":"speech","time":1625560200,"counter":23,"content":"<p>Obviously Revenue cannot disclose it but RT&Eacute; can voluntarily disclose it to us and it should do so.

I would also invite RT&Eacute; management informally to take it upon themselves to write to the committee and disclose what we have asked.  Revenue has made it as clear as black and white that there is nothing whatsoever precluding RT&Eacute; from doing that.  It is vital it does that in the interests of transparency.  Let us just wait and see if RT&Eacute; comes clean and furnishes us with that information.  No. 668 was the comparative review of the remuneration of Irish-speaking workers I raised with RT&Eacute; when they were in.  I asked a review of the time.

One is that a letter go to the Department, as outlined by Deputy Murphy.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.

Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  The next item of correspondence is No. 661 and I propose we take it with No. 710.  No. 661 is from the European Anti-Fraud Office, dated 17 June 2021, responding to our request regarding publication of the office&rsquo;s previous correspondence to the committee.  The proposed action is to note this item.  It relates to our requests for information on the ongoing investigation into the so-called Cabra Accounts.  We have a related item of correspondence from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, No. 685, as well as correspondence from Deputy Marc MacSharry, No. 710, so I propose we take these together?  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  The response from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na acknowledges the ongoing investigation by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, and states that any comment on that investigation could be prejudicial to a possible criminal investigation.  Correspondence No. 710C is from Deputy Marc MacSharry, dated 5 July 2021, enclosing correspondence from an individual, and it was forwarded to the clerk to the committee yesterday.  It requests that the committee &ldquo;consider and endorse&rdquo; 23 questions and send them to GSOC.  The correspondence concerns the aforementioned GSOC investigation, which GSOC has stated is a criminal investigation undertaken in the public interest.<\/p> <p>  While the previous Committee of Public Accounts published a report in 2017 on its examination of matters related to financial procedures at the Garda College in Templemore, and while GSOC is accountable to this committee in terms of its annual accounts, it is not clear how attempting to direct the GSOC investigation would assist our work or whether it would be in order for the committee to proceed as suggested in the correspondence.  The committee only received the correspondence yesterday and it runs to 33 pages.  The secretariat received the correspondence items at lunchtime yesterday, they were circulated around 4 p.m. yesterday afternoon, and the first sight I had of them was this morning - all 33 pages.  I propose that the correspondence be considered by the committee next week.  This will allow me, as Cathaoirleach, and other members of the committee time to consider its content.<\/p> <p>  Deputies MacSharry, Murphy and Carthy have flagged this issue for discussion.

I am concerned that it is almost four years to the day, or just in excess of that, since we first dealt with this matter.  I support the Chairman's call that we would be able to consider these questions over the course of the week and discuss them next week.  The reason I was rushing to get them in was because I thought today was the last day we could discuss anything and I did not want to lose the summer before having us consider these very detailed questions.  Obviously, GSOC may well come back to us, if the committee agrees to submit them, and say it will not be answering them and it is continuing with its work, or whatever.  In any event, the detail of these questions can usefully be put by the committee and, perhaps, if they are published by the committee as questions of the committee, it might focus minds elsewhere to inject a little pace into a process that seems to have lacked it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021070600002#D00600","speaker":"1606"},{"type":"speech","time":1625560200,"counter":44,"content":"<p>I note that GSOC advised the committee in correspondence on 21 April that its investigation was in its final stages and would conclude shortly.

I also think, given it is a time-sensitive issue, that we should advise the correspondent to forward any information he has at this point to GSOC.  If GSOC is in the final stages of its criminal investigation and if the correspondent has information that may be pertinent to that, he should forward it to GSOC immediately.  Obviously, GSOC has to make judgments on these matters, and the more information it has, the better.

It is a very important issue.  I am concerned about it.  Deputy Murphy and other committee members are also concerned about it.  There are serious matters involved.  I am also mindful that a criminal investigation is being carried out.  Matters have also been raised in the correspondence that are relevant to a court hearing on 5 October this year.  We are to be mindful of that also.  These are two reasons in doing our work we do not want to impair or impact negatively on the work of GSOC or the work of the courts on a different matter on 5 October.  I respectfully suggest the committee scrutinises the correspondence over the next day or two and then comes back to it.  Is that agreed? Agreed.<\/p> <p>  No. 663B, from Mr. Niall Cody, chairman, Office of the Revenue Commissioners, dated 17 June 2021, provides information requested by the committee on the disclosure of details of settlements made with Revenue.  This is correspondence we referred to earlier.  We had more or less dealt with this.  We had asked Revenue if, from its point of view, there was any impediment to RT&Eacute; providing the committee with details of its settlement with Revenue.  Mr. Cody says &ldquo;it is wholly a matter for the person or body who entered into a tax settlement with Revenue to decide whether it is appropriate to disclose the details of any settlement subject to any legislative constraints&rdquo;.  The proposed action is to note and publish.  We have dealt with that, and if Deputies Murphy and Munster are happy with that, we will move on from it.  The point made in the letter is that Mr. Cody clearly outlines there is no issue from Revenue's point of view with RT&Eacute; disclosing to the Committee of Public Accounts how much was involved in that settlement.  Is the committee happy enough with that?  Yes.<\/p> <p>  No. 681B, from Mr. Graham Doyle, Secretary General, Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, dated 23 June 2021, provides information requested by the committee regarding cost rental schemes.  This arises from our engagement with the Department on 3 June.  I understand the committee secretariat has also received the rest of the information that was requested at that meeting and it will be circulated in due course.  This information has just come in.  The proposed action is to note and publish. Deputy Carroll MacNeill had particular questions around that.  Deputy Murphy has also flagged this issue for discussion.

Deputy Carroll MacNeill's question was around the ownership, which is outlined in the correspondence that says it is one of the first cost rental homes projects in Ireland.  The project is 50 two-bedroom cost rental apartments on Enniskerry Road in Stepaside by D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council.  These will be completed and tenanted by Tuath Housing and Respond, both approved housing bodies, in the third quarter of 2021.  There are also 105 social homes.  Deputy Murphy's point is they are still costing &euro;1,200 a month, which still a high enough rent considering there is Government and Exchequer subvention.

I completely acknowledge that &euro;1,200 per month is very significantly less than &euro;2,000 per month, but my understanding of cost rental is it would be a mix of people, including individuals on the housing lists.  If it is going to include both, it would require quite a bit of subsidy from the public side, probably through the housing assistance payment, HAP.  I question whether, if people had a real choice, they would take on a 25-year-long lease at &euro;1,200 per month.  When they end up as a pensioner, where do they go from there?  There is some thinking out to be done on this with regard to value for money.  It is more from the policy aspect rather than the point of view of the Committee of Public Accounts.  I am not at all sure this aspect has been considered.  The particular housing association has done as well as it could do, but it shows how expensive housing will be and how precarious it will be later on for people when they get to pension age.

The legislation is before us in the House this week.  We can discuss it in that context also.  The current scheme does not allow subvention through HAP.  There is not a long- term subsidy to provide it through HAP.<\/p><p>The second issue is there is an allowance for people in order that they can continue to live in their current home at a reduced rent or with an income support when they reach retirement age.

We cannot look at it closely enough to make sure both the public and private providers, which are going to provide this model, do so in a way that is efficient.

I was surprised to learn recently, when I raised this matter with the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Ossian Smyth, that only 4,000 connections have been done so far this year.  That would show we are barely chipping away at it and taking a small chip out of what needs to be done.  We know from replies to parliamentary questions that the contract had a target of 115,000 connections in 2021, so 4,000 so far is not what you would call good progress.  You could say that Covid-19 could hold up communications works.  Communication workers were out on the ground.  It is one of the areas that was not held up by Covid-19.  I note from the correspondence that there will be a remedial plan.  We need to see that plan.<\/p><p>In my interaction with the Minister of State, which was only a couple of weeks ago, he confirmed to me, which came as a surprise, that no penalties are included in the contract despite me, when I was spokesperson on this matter, and indeed other people in the House being assured there were going to be stringent penalties.  We have now been told that only 4,000 have been connected up to a couple of weeks ago and that the target falls a long way short of the 115,000 connections to premises and households in 2021.  For members' attention, I have a transcript of the Minister of State, Deputy Smyth's, reply to me in the D&aacute;il:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThe Deputy asked whether there were penalty clauses. As I understand it, there are none in the current contract.<br \/><br \/>The Deputy also asked about the Minister's representative on NBI.  I might defer to the Minister, Deputy Ryan, if he has an answer. <\/blockquote> <p>The point I am making is we have only one representative on the board.  My real areas of concern from the point of view of public money are that only 4,000 connections were done at that stage, according to the Minister of State, and he was not aware of any penalties.<\/p><p>I ask that we correspond with the Secretary General of the Department to express our concern about this reply from the Minister of State in the D&aacute;il and ask the Department to confirm the current position.  We should ask it to clarify exactly what the current position is regarding the number of connections but also whether we are in a situation where there is no penalty in terms of missed targets for the broadband contract.  If the contractors do not meet the targets, then so be it.  There are no penalties for them.  I was assured, as were other Deputies in the D&aacute;il Chamber on a number of occasions, as far as I can recall, including by the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment in the previous Government, Deputy Bruton, that there would be penalties.  We could ask for that to be clarified.<\/p><p>It is worth mentioning that, in his reply, the Minister of State said the number of homes that have been passed and are ready for connection to broadband is 4,000.

I would be agreeable to that suggestion.  This was quite controversial at the time.  There was only one bid at the end and there were question marks, first of all, about who would own the asset at the end.  The second issue was the ability of the entity actually to deliver because its experience had been more on the financial side than delivery on the telecommunications side.  We always understood this was about the number of houses and businesses that were passed.<\/p> <p>  One of the reasons we would have been concerned is that the cost of broadband may not be sufficiently attractive for people to take up the opportunity to connect to broadband.  There has never been a greater need, which I believe we all appreciate.  The previous year has certainly demonstrated that broadband is an essential service.<\/p> <p>  We are right to interrogate what exactly this tender guaranteed.  What they are doing now is largely overlaying on existing infrastructure.  The entity that originally considered pitching for the broadband plan then withdrew.  Some of its apparatus is being used, for instance, telephone poles and so on.

It includes information on a range of issues, including driver theory tests, the DART interconnector project, the Coast Guard, the process for appointing new members to agency boards, and roads improvement and maintenance.  The proposed action is to note and publish this correspondence.<\/p> <p>  I wish to raise a few points about this, as does Deputy Catherine Murphy.  A detailed amount of information came with the correspondence.  The information of particular interest to me relates to the suspension of driver theory tests.  The Department points out that work is progressing on ensuring that the Road Safety Authority, RSA, has sufficient facilities for temporary testers and that the current plan is to have these in place by July.  The Department mentions that the current facilities are being expanded, where possible, to accommodated new testers.  The intention is to add six new driver test centres, which is welcome news.  A centre will open in Birr in my constituency at the County Arms Hotel.  The Department says that, in line with the further easing of restrictions, the gradual reopening of in-person driver theory tests commenced on 8 June.  The RSA will reopen its network of test centres and will be permitted to conduct 25,000 theory tests per month.<\/p> <p>  Having read all of this, I am still baffled as to why the theory test was not continued during the pandemic, given that it is carried out in cubicles and does not involved large gatherings of people in rooms.  I understand that the test is carried out in a specially designed kiosk.  I fail to see why the tests were suspended.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021070600002#G01500","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speech","time":1625560200,"counter":81,"content":"<p>It is useful correspondence.  It is comprehensive and contains some good information, including on the issue of test centres and the strategy in that regard.<\/p> <p>  I have picked out two matters in particular, the first of which is the DART interconnector.  In 2015 or thereabouts, it was brought to railway order level, which meant that all of the detailed work had been done.  A significant amount of money had been spent, certainly tens of millions of euro, on the investigations into the route the tunnel would take, the environmental considerations and the civil engineering issues.  I was trying to find out how much of that work could be reused.  Obviously, a new study is ongoing because the reply reads: \"As the study is ongoing, the amount of useable information in progressing a preferred route, leading to a corridor for protection, can only be determined following the study's outcome.\"  Some of the same areas are being studied again.  I imagine that there are not many additional routes that can be considered.  Maybe we should ask the Department how much was spent getting the project to that stage.  I would like us to do that.  The Department is saying that a full reassessment of the route has to be obtained, but we do not want a duplication of costs.  That is my concern.<\/p> <p>  I believe the whole country will benefit from this project.  Someone will possibly be able to travel seamlessly from one end of the country to the other by virtue of that interconnector.  Certainly, the counties surrounding Dublin would benefit from it considerably.  A great deal of money is being spent on the expansion of DART, and this project is a part of that.  Might we ask the Department what had been spent on it by the time it reached railway order level so that we have something to match it against when this review happens?  We need to reuse information and the work that was done previously as much as possible.<\/p> <p>  I also wish to raise the issue of the Coast Guard.  At the meeting, we were told that the State did not own the helicopters.  What seems clear from this correspondence, though, is that this does not meant that we did not invest in helicopters.  We provided a grant for helicopters that we do not own.  Might we ask plainly how much capital the State invested in helicopters that we do not own?<\/p><p>It seems clear from the reply that this was a one-off, major purchase.  It is implied that we invested in helicopters but they are not owned by the State.  The amount of the total investment would be useful information to have.

This issue was referred to in previous correspondence from the Department, No. R0551, dated 29 April.  The Secretary General reiterates in the latest correspondence that &quot;the Department of Health did not gather sensitive medical and educational information on children involved in court cases in the manner portrayed&quot; in a television programme broadcast on 25 March.<\/p><p>Mr. Watt also provides a report, published in April, that sought to establish the facts regarding special education litigation in the light of certain allegations made in that programme.  It states:<\/p> <blockquote> \tGiven the complexities of the &quot;SENS&quot; litigation, the time necessary to either settle or defend these cases, and in recognition that the plaintiffs require coordinated responses in education and health, it was agreed a number of years ago between senior management in the Department of Education, the Department of Health, and the HSE, that valuable and limited State resources should be concentrated on resolving the cases, where it possible to do so. <\/blockquote> <p>The report goes on to say:<\/p> <blockquote> \tShould the State parties not act in coordination, it would not be possible to either provide a resolution to the plaintiff that is appropriate and complete, or otherwise, where necessary, to defend proceedings in a proper fashion.  This also ensures a consistent approach and that applicants in similar positions are treated in similar fashion and limits the possibility of some plaintiffs being treated more favourably than others, due to lack of knowledge as to how other plaintiffs in similar circumstances have had their cases dealt with. <\/blockquote> <p>The proposed action is to note and publish this correspondence.  Deputy Carthy has flagged it but he has not yet returned from the meeting of the agriculture committee.  I propose that we note and publish the correspondence.<\/p><p>The next category is C, which is correspondence from, and related to, private individuals, and any other correspondence.  Item No. R0669, dated 23 June 2021, is correspondence from an individual in regard to a protected disclosure made to Tusla.  The correspondent made the disclosure but his correspondence is more concerned with the process involved, which the correspondent feels is deeply flawed.  He states that, like many others, he was forced into a settlement agreement as a consequence of having no available legal representation afforded to him by the State.  We have received a significant number of requests for assistance from individuals who have made disclosures and been unhappy with the process.  We have sought information on protected disclosures from all Departments recently.<\/p><p>The proposed action in regard to this item of correspondence is to request the correspondent to consent to forward it to the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach, which is currently undertaking pre-legislative scrutiny of the  protected disclosures (amendment) Bill 2021.  The joint committee will have the opportunity to make recommendations on the draft legislation.  In that regard, the secretariat of this committee has circulated a draft submission from us to the joint committee highlighting some of the concerns raised by members in regard to protected disclosures.

There is a difficulty in that the Free Legal Advice Centres, FLAC, have responsibility only for providing free legal aid in family law cases.  There is no provision for legal aid in the case of people taking cases to bodies like the WRC.  Last year, there was a significant increase in the number of people who sought legal aid, mainly because there were issues to do with redundancy and a range of other issues that arose in the context of Covid.  The pandemic really exposed a weakness in the system.  It is fine when somebody has union representation, for example, but there are occasions where people do not have that representation.  In fact, the more precarious their employment, the less likely they are to be represented.  There is a gap there that is not necessarily around the issue of Tusla and the nature of this particular complaint.  There is a wider issue in regard to the WRC and the availability of free legal aid where people require it.  There is no provision in that regard.

All members must join remotely from elsewhere in the parliamentary precincts.  The secretariat can issue invitations to join the meeting on MS Teams.  Members may not participate in the meeting from outside of the parliamentary precincts.

Please note that messages sent to the meeting chat are visible to all participants.

I welcome Mr. John Neenan, chair of GMI, Mr. Kieran Dunne, Kildare Growers Group, Mr. Mel O'Rourke, Commercial Mushroom Producers, and Ms Anna Kavanagh, independent horticulture consultant, who are all appearing remotely.  We have received their opening statement, which has been circulated to members.  As we are limited in time due to Covid-19 safety restrictions, the committee has agreed that the opening statement will be taken as read so that we can use the full session for questions and answers.  All opening statements are published on the Oireachtas website and are publicly available.<\/p> <p>  I must give an important notice regarding parliamentary privilege.  Witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence relating to a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Participants in the committee meeting who are in locations outside the parliamentary precincts are asked to note that the constitutional protections afforded to those participating from within the parliamentary precincts do not extend to them.  No clear guidance can be given on whether or the extent to which participation is covered by the absolute privilege of a statutory nature.<\/p> <p>  This is a very important topic.  We discussed it earlier in the year and had a committee meeting on it.  We were given assurances at that meeting that there would be an interim report which would be provided to us in early April.  The indication was that it would allow home-grown peat to be harvested for the horticulture industry.  That has not happened.  Members of the committee fully understand the witnesses' anxiety and the financial pressure they must be experiencing.  I and the members of the committee are very interested to hear what they have to say this morning.  The idea of importing peat into this country is not only financial madness but also environmental madness.  Banning peat cutting in this country makes a nonsense of what we are trying to achieve.  The witnesses will have the opportunity this morning to make their presentation and answer questions from members.  Then the committee will decide what political pressure it can apply to try to help their industry.<\/p> <p>  I will open the meeting to the floor.

I do not intend to take up too much time because I spent a lot of yesterday being mushroomed out with talking about it.  The national newspapers today have covered this issue quite extensively.  I am very supportive of the horticulture sector and particularly the witnesses' sector.  It is grossly unfair and hypocrisy at its best to talk about bringing in peat or substitute peat from the Baltic states, such as vermiculite, cocoa shells and so forth.  We know they simply do not work.  We know from the Teagasc representatives who appeared before the committee that there is really no alternative.  I have focused on mushrooms but there is also the general horticulture sector.  Peat and milled peat are also used in forestry, particularly forestry nursery stock, and also in horticulture stock, including ornamental stock, and salad and vegetable production.<\/p> <p>  There is a very mixed message from the Government.  I am not in government or in a Government party and I am not here to criticise any member of the committee who is in a Government party because every member of the committee is fully committed to agriculture and horticulture.  How have the witnesses engaged with the Department?  What was the response of the Department to the case they made?  I would advocate strongly that there should be a ten-year exemption period.  Yes, we all recognise that we must find alternatives, but there are no real alternatives.  I realise I am preaching to the converted here but I am very conscious of the jobs in Monaghan, Louth, Wexford and the midlands.  We talk about sustainability and we discussed the climate action Bill, but this does not make sense.  Basically, we have carbon leakage by importing peat substitutes.  I thank the witnesses for attending the meeting and I urge them to keep advocating on behalf of their industry.  There are huge implications.  I have no doubt that we will see aspects of this issue in the courts; I am quite confident we will.  I thank the witnesses for persisting in pursuing this.  They should mobilise their industry and mobilise their elected representatives to put pressure on the Government.  The reality is that the Green Party is part of the Government.  It is part of the problem.  It might think it is part of the solution but I do not believe it is at this time.  We need to shift and apply political pressure and the industry's pressure on politicians so we can have some sort of practical alternative arrangement to support the horticulture industry in the months and years ahead.<\/p> <p>  Finally, the witnesses have a great ally in Bord Bia.  Bord Bia has done a tremendous amount of work in promoting mushrooms.  As I said yesterday in the Seanad, I went to a few supermarkets at the weekend and picked up mushrooms from refrigerators in different stores.  I could clearly see the proud Irish brand, Bord Bia, on the food products.  That is a very strong link and a strong synergy.  It is something the witnesses have to capitalise on in this case because I believe Bord Bia will be their ally.  It certainly has vast budgets for promoting organics and particularly for promoting mushrooms across the world.  I thank the witnesses for taking the time to engage with the committee on this very important issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021070600002#A00300","speaker":"1634"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1625526000,"counter":102,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for inviting us to the meeting at such short notice.

That will certainly cause major upheaval, with potentially up to 17,000 people made unemployed.  It will also affect the sector and nurseries that have been in business for two and three generations in rural Ireland, which will be devastating in certain areas.  We highlighted the situation previously and we are very disappointed that the Department has not taken the opportunity to appear before the committee to explain its actions.  Growing Media Ireland and the other representatives with me today have engaged fully with the working group.  We had six meetings and we produced an interim report.

Like Senator Boyhan, I condole with them on their plight.<\/p><p>I see the pure ridiculousness and stupidity of it.  I know hauliers who are hauling peat from Drogheda down to the south of the country.  We have this climate change and climate action debate in these Houses on a regular basis.  The one key message is the bringing of people with us and having buy-in from the community.  However, people are watching such ridiculous nonsensical activities as the importation of peat from eastern Europe.  Harvesting it out there is having the same effect on the environment and climate as doing it here but then the diesel-burning ships and lorries taking it to and from the port must be taken into account.  It just does not make sense.  We have been putting on political pressure and we will continue to do so.  As GMI said in its submission, it seems to have fallen between the cracks by virtue of there being numerous different Departments, which are able to push the blame, for want of a better word, onto each other.  Somebody must step up to the plate and make a decision.  I have a couple of quick questions.<br\/><br\/>I am thinking about how we get a resolution to this going forward.  The GMI submission is prescriptive on the alternatives being examined or developed at the moment.  In this situation, as in others, just transition has gone out the window and we have put the cart before the horse.  We have stopped the peat and now we are talking about scientific experiments and the development of alternatives.  However, of the ones GMI has listed, aside from composting and green waste, none of them seem to be Irish.  It would be an import scenario for all of them even if they were up to scratch.<br\/><br\/>Will the witnesses elaborate a little on green waste?  When I saw the heading I thought this was the solution but there are issues and problems with it that GMI has identified.  I would like to hear how we might be able to tweak some of them because it seems to be the only real alternative mentioned, from an Irish perspective.<br\/><br\/>I would also like to know about a mixture of one or other of the alternatives and peat.  If we were going to table saying that going forward, we will only need a percentage of what we did in the past, it might be easier to get a green light.  Is there the possibility of using mixtures of any or all of the alternatives GMI has mentioned?<br\/><br\/>This might be a stupid question but we are here to ask the questions.  Is there any possibility of recycling peat between different sector of the industry?  Maybe peat that has been used in horticulture could then go to the mushroom industry or <i>vice versa<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>I am trying to come up with a strengthened case for minimising the volume of peat that would need to be harvested to keep the sector viable, going forward.  As things stand at the moment what percentage of peat is the industry getting from Bord na M&oacute;na, from the private sector, or both, when it comes to harvesting?  To conclude, it is now July, so even if there was a solution to this issue and the green light was given for peat harvesting by the close of business today, have we missed a harvesting season?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021070600002#A00500","speaker":"1651","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1625526000,"counter":105,"content":"<p>There are a number of very pertinent questions there.

I hope I get to all of them.  Peat is the best growing medium and that is why we have been using it for decades.  Irish peat is the best in the world.  We have seen that over the decades because people have wanted it.  It is medium-decomposed peat and has the best air and water properties.  It has a high lignin content so it is very useful for long-term crops.  The other thing about peat is that it is a relatively light material with a low pH and low nutrient.  The beauty of that is lime and fertilisers can be added to suit any crop.  The other thing is peat is not just one product.  Peat is brought in, graded and then blended.  Even in my days in Bord na M&oacute;na there could be up to 1,000 different recipes for growers in Ireland, so the number of recipes worldwide is much higher than that.<\/p> <p>  Peat will be needed in the phasing out of peat in favour of alternatives in Ireland.  The Senator mentioned the alternatives and asked us to say a bit about green waste.  Again, from my experience in Bord na M&oacute;na, we had a state-of-the-art facility in Kilberry and green waste was produced to a good quality.  The important point is that a very good quality is needed for retail products and is even more important for professional products.  I illustrate this by saying that if you go out and by a bag of compost and grow your plants, you probably will not mind if they are different sizes and if one dies you blame yourself before anyone else.  On the professional side of the business, if I sent a load of compost to Mr. Dunne and he had variance in his plants and lost plants it is all off the bottom line as they are grown to tight specifications.  Thus the need for quality on that side is critical.  Green waste is also a very heavy material.  It is about 500 g per litre.  At the moment, green compost could only be used at about 10% to 15% in a mix because of the weight and everything else.  It also has a high conductivity, which is the salts in there.  There are concerns with green compost, depending on the source, about contamination by glass or plastic and it can even have needles in it.  There is also a concern about whether pesticides have been used on the crops, grass cuttings, hedge cuttings or anything else that goes in there.  There are a lot of issues really.  On top of that human pathogens must also be considered.<\/p> <p>  Going forward and looking at alternatives we must take a more holistic approach where we look at the entire system of production of stuff.  With, say, the green waste we can ask if there is anything else we can do to it to eliminate some of these issues.  Bord na M&oacute;na has successfully used green compost in the hobby market for number of years now, going back to 2005, probably.  Bord na M&oacute;na was the leader in peat reduction in the hobby market in the UK, so it is not as if Ireland has no experience in this area.  However, on the professional side of the business it is an entirely different matter.  There plant production is in a critical situation and things must be very closely monitored.  To use green compost in professional mixes there would need to be a very high standard.<\/p> <p>  The Senator inquired about other products.  Wood fibre is a good product and is seen worldwide as probably one of the leading products that can be used in peat reduction.  Wood fibre can be used, although it has issues with possible nitrogen lock-up.  It is a light material and has been used successfully up to approximately 35% in mixes.  The big problem with wood fibre is the competition from fuel and other wood industries.  It is difficult and the price can be sensitive.  It may be possible to have schemes going forward - and this should form part of our research and development - where there would be incentives, subsidies or land put aside to grow crops specifically to produce growing media.  That would be one option.<\/p> <p>  Coir is another product that has been mentioned but it comes predominantly from Sri Lanka.  Coir is the outer husk of the coconut.  We are talking about taking a product like that and transporting it all the way from Sri Lanka, India or somewhere around there.  We are talking about taking it from a country where water resources are valuable, even for people's own use, and asking them to use that water to clean the coir, because it contains certain salts and so on, to give us a product for growing media.<\/p><p>It is also used locally in those countries as soil conditioner and as a fuel.<\/p><p> The Senator mentioned pearlite and vermiculite.  Many other products are used as additives.  There are other products such as anaerobic digestate and waste materials that should be looked at.  Any alternative needs to be fit for purpose and sustainable.  What criteria are we using to say that it is sustainable?  I feel that we should find out what products are locally available in Ireland in sufficient quantities that we could use in future and rate those products on a scale.  In the UK, there was a calculator which looked at energy use, water use, social compliance, renewability, habitat biodiversity and other criteria.  It scores each material based on those criteria and comes up with a total score.  Peat should also be on that because it will be needed for a long time yet.<\/p><p> Another issue that the Senator mentioned was mixtures.  Mixtures can be used.  It is unlikely that there will be one material that will be used in future.  Peat has been a great product.  It is foreseen that we will use mixtures of products.  When you start research and development on mixtures of products, it is not a matter of adding A, B and C, and adding 1 and 1 to get 2, or 2 and 2 to get 4.  When these products are added, their properties need to be categorised and assessed, then you have to look at how they are put together and assess that product all over again.  It is not as simple as putting two products together then making it available.  That is where much of the research and development work will happen.  All of those combinations and their physical, chemical and microbial characteristics need to be assessed.<\/p><p> The Senator asked about the possibility of recycling peat.  That has been done a bit in the past.  It is a possibility.  With the new technologies, those things are all possible.  It is a good recommendation.  To my knowledge, Bord na M&oacute;na has ceased supply of peat for horticulture at this point, so whatever is available is coming from other producers or from abroad.  I agree with the Senator and I cannot believe that we would talk about importing peat.  If we are really concerned about climate action, kicking the ball down the road is not the answer.  If we are talking about global climate action, then buying peat from abroad is only adding to our environmental issues and it is not helping in any way.  As I said earlier, that peat is not even of the same quality as the peat in our own country.  It will decompose faster, which would contribute more to carbon dioxide emissions.<\/p><p> The Senator said that it is now July.  I agree and have raised this several times in our working group.  The main peat harvesting season is from May until September.  We have missed May and June and we do not know what the weather will bring in the next couple of months.  We need immediate action.  The working group and its industry members have been patient.  We have contributed and worked hard in six meetings over four months.  There has been much behind the scenes work to contribute to those meetings.  We need an answer for the industry at this stage.  It is at crisis point, as the Senator pointed out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021070600002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Anna Kavanagh","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1625526000,"counter":108,"content":"<p>Those were comprehensive answers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021070600002#C00200","speaker":"1611"},{"type":"speech","time":1625526000,"counter":109,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for coming in.

The mushroom industry is based on having a high-quality compost and a thin layer of peat on top of that compost to grow the mushrooms.  The industry has been successful.  People talk about the horticulture industry in general when it should be divided into subsectors.  The mushroom industry is a subsector which exports &euro;120 million worth of product to the UK.  We depend on high quality casing material, which is a blend of peat and sugar beet lime or ground limestone.  It is different from what is used in the amenity sector in that it is deep black peat that never dries out until it goes onto the bed to grow the mushrooms.  The mushrooms absorb moisture from that peat.  The peat requirement is only 20% of the growing substrate.  For each cubic metre, which is equivalent to a tonne of meat, we grow about 5 tonnes of mushrooms.  In a nutshell, the mushroom industry depends on deep-dug peat.  There is no alternative in the short or medium term.<\/p><p>Research has been carried out in Israel, South Africa and Holland to find alternatives because they have to import peat.  We are a net producer of peat and an exporter to most of those countries.  In the short to medium term there is no alternative.  To return to the point made by Senator Daly, the growing medium that we use in mushroom production can be taken out and used as a growing medium in another area of horticulture or it can be spread on the land for cereal production.  It is widely accepted that it is a valuable product for the cereal growing industry, where it is spread on the land.  We get a double use from that material.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021070600002#C00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mel O'Rourke","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1625526000,"counter":112,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. O'Rourke and I call Deputy Michael Collins.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021070600002#D00200","speaker":"1611"},{"type":"speech","time":1625526000,"counter":113,"content":"<p>I am-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021070600002#D00300","speaker":"1461"},{"type":"speech","time":1625526000,"counter":114,"content":"<p>I did not get answers to my questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021070600002#D00400","speaker":"1508"},{"type":"speech","time":1625526000,"counter":115,"content":"<p>I will come back to the witnesses in a moment and they can answer them then.

The horticulture industry, in particular the nursery stock industry, is in crisis, with raw material prices having increased by more than &euro;1,000 per load.

Is there a plan for transition for the replacement of peat for the horticulture industry in this country?  What about the peat in the bogs that can never be rewetted and returned to habitat?

That was the view across the working group from Friends of the Irish Environment to An Taisce and from the experienced horticulturists around the table.  The short-term solution is agreed.  There is general consensus that sub 30 ha. would be possible as a short-term solution and that it would be sufficient to supply the Irish horticultural industry until the medium and long-term solution is put in place.<\/p> <p>  The experience of the working group was very valuable.  A great deal of work has been done since our last meeting with the committee on 16 February.  Behind the scenes, the working group and the industry have put in a huge amount of effort to try to resolve this issue.  Up to seven months ago, we stated that by June we would be in a crisis situation.  We waited months for the working group to be put in place.  We submitted the interim report in sufficient time to allow for a resolution of the situation.  That was two months ago.  We have received little by way of solid reaction from the Government.

We are extremely hardworking and provide good paying quality jobs in rural communities throughout the country.  This can be turned into a good news story.  Instead, we are in crisis.  We have survived -18oC frost.  We have worked our way through Brexit and survived it with the help of the Departments.  Throughout the pandemic, we have remained open and kept all of our people employed.  We have put our shoulder to the wheel and put on the green jersey.  We cannot be asked to do more.  We survived the recession, which was not easy in terms of the banks, overdrafts and loans.  We survived all of this.  We are very proud of what we do.  We are hardworking people throughout rural communities in Ireland.  <\/p> <p>  Bord Bia was mentioned earlier.

By next September, we could be out of peat, which would have an impact on many parts of the horticulture industry.<\/p> <p>  We have spoken about the working group and the long-term goal of moving the industry in a slightly different direction, but I am lost as to what is happening in respect of ministerial involvement.  This is probably one of the main issues I wish to raise.  There was an interdepartmental meeting of three or four senior officials.  Is there any knowledge of what happened at that meeting and where the game stands in trying to find a solution?  Three Departments have a role in solving this issue.  Due to that interdepartmental mix, though, there seems to be little movement.  My understanding is that the remaining number of weeks are crucial.  It is unfortunate that we do not have officials from all three Departments before us so that we might try to get movement on this.  We have to reconsider doing so if possible.  I am at a loss as to why the three Departments are not present and why we have not received answers to key questions about the timeline for delivering a suitable short-term plan.  From speaking to officials and others over the past 48 hours, the next six weeks will be crucial.  There will be a major confidence issue within the industry, due to which the amazing number of people involved in it could be affected.  Given that it accounts for 17,000 jobs and more than &euro;500 million, this is a significant issue.<\/p> <p>  My understanding is that 90% of our peat imports are of water-based materials, so we are effectively paying to import water.  Is there a more effective way of importing peat from the Balkans or Poland?<\/p> <p>  I have more questions than answers, but I hope that we can get some movement in a short time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021070600002#E00500","speaker":"1666"},{"type":"speech","time":1625526000,"counter":128,"content":"<p>Regarding the officials, this meeting was called at short notice at the request of the horticulture industry and no officials were available to us this morning.

According to GMI's submission to us, the working group was still awaiting a detailed response to the report.  Has there been progress towards the urgent action required?  Had the Minister of State any light to shed on the report's contents or was his just a letter of acknowledgement?

We have.  The working group had an interim report, but it was not unanimous.  NGOs such as Friends of the Irish Environment, An Taisce and one or two more basically wrote their own report.  The interim report effectively recommended that peat harvesting continue throughout 2021 under emergency legislation and that legislation on a single system from 2022 onwards be introduced.  I am not a legal eagle, but our legal people have advised us that, in the short term, an Act of the Oireachtas could exempt large-scale harvesting for a limited period, facilitate screening for an environmental impact assessment, EIA, or an appropriate assessment, AA, instead of a full EIA, and release the industry from the requirement of a licence for a limited time, that is, 2021.  That is a short-term solution.  Primary legislation would facilitate a long-term solution exempting large-scale peat harvesting from planning requirements once a licence had been granted or an EIA report had been submitted.  The Minister could then amend the Environmental Protection Agency Act to deal explicitly with a retrospective use of peatlands and to cover any planning element that was not included in the Act.  We submitted to the working group, which submitted to the Departments, the heads of a Bill that would probably sort out this issue.  We had previously submitted them to the Departments last March.  We have heard nothing back through the working group.<\/p> <p>  Senator Lombard asked about the three Departments and the meeting of senior officials.  Officially, we have not heard anything about that.  Unofficially, we have.  Obviously, however, we have received no response.<\/p> <p>  Regarding Deputy Browne's question on whether all of the Departments were acting the same, it was felt by officials at the initial working group meeting and the previous meeting of the Oireachtas committee that some action could be taken in the short term and that legislation could be passed within two or three months.  By the second meeting of the working group meeting, though, that view had changed completely and we were back to three to four years.  Even if we had a single system, it was stated that legislation on it could take three years.<\/p> <p>  Members have asked what this committee can do.<\/p><p>Our feeling is that Government Departments do not accept that there is an emergency.  They believe there are sufficient alternatives available.  That is clearly not the case.  The Departments do not appear to understand this.  They do not understand what it is like to have a nursery and try to get supplies.  What do we tell our employees?  It is the same in the mushroom industry.  Those Departments and the Ministers concerned do not understand that there is a real crisis just around the corner at the end of September.  Mr. Dunne mentioned this, but I believe it is even worse than he has said.  One of the companies that have supplies and bought some from Bord na M&oacute;na has now been threatened with legal action that it cannot take those supplies from stockpiles, which were purchased previously.  That is ongoing also.  This is a disaster for the horticultural industry, an industry that we need to build up.<\/p><p> Last week I attended a webinar about plants, the health of plants, and the dangers involved in importing plants and peat into Ireland.  That does not seem to be taken into account either.  The situation is that the Departments do not understand or want to accept that there is an emergency going to happen.  For some unknown reason they believe that there are alternatives.<\/p><p> At the working group it was mentioned by one of the NGOs that in the short-term coir is almost essential.  I respectfully suggest that anybody who advocates for this has read absolutely nothing about coir.  As Ms Kavanagh mentioned, we do need to get a life cycle analysis of all the materials that are being used.  It certainly appears to be a case of anything but peat.  What has happened is unbelievable, that this is not understood.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021070600002#E01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Neenan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1625526000,"counter":134,"content":"<p>I have remarks to make rather than questions.  First, I must compliment the industry on the way they have approached this over the past number of months.  I am aware that the Chairman has stated that the officials were not available.  I was a Minister of State for more than nine years and no matter how short the notice the Department had of a meeting, some officials in the Department were found to come in to bring some sort of clarity to the situation.  I will not say that our meeting today is a worthless exercise but the people we need in front of us today are the Department officials.  I know exactly what our representatives from the industry are going through.   Last Thursday I spoke with a Minister - it would be wrong of me to put names on who I spoke with - and I was told, and the contributors were told, that Department officials and Ministers were meeting last Thursday.  I looked for an update on that meeting on Thursday evening and I was told yesterday that a solution would be found.  If a solution is to be found I believe it is right and proper that Department officials would come before the committee and tell us exactly how they are going to approach the issue.<\/p> <p>  My background is in the horticultural sector and I studied it in college, so I understand the industry fairly well.  It is an absolutely ludicrous situation.  We talk about climate change and greenhouse gases but when the witnesses before us today bring a solution to climate change and greenhouse gases the Department and the Ministers say to them \"You are doing a great job\" while at the same time giving them a kick up the behind.  Normally I am very slow to criticise officials because they are the pillar heads in any Department, but they should be coming before the committee here no matter how short the notice.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Neenan referred to Klasmann, which was mentioned to me also by somebody in my constituency.  I want to be very careful on this because I do not want to complicate any legal case but is it true that legal action could now be taken or is being taken whereby Klasmann has stockpiles that will bring the industry through over the next 12 months or even longer, but they are not allowed to travel across the bog to draw in these stockpiles?<\/p> <p>  Reference was also made to the importance of Bloom.  I would like to see Bord Bia taking a more proactive approach on this, in talking to the Departments of agriculture and the environment, on the importance of the sector.  Bloom is not only European renowned; it is a world renowned showcase that occurs in the Phoenix Park annually.  It attracts thousands of overseas visitors, trade stands and so on.  I am sure they are laughing at us when we talk about some people who are trying to stop the industry in its tracks in doing what it does best.<\/p> <p>  Perhaps the witnesses could let the committee know about the Klasmann issue.  I am not sure if they can say too much about it.  I compliment Mr. Dunne on his approach to this.  I have spoken with people who were on that group over the past months and I am aware that they have approached this in a very professional manner.  It is up to the Ministers of State, Senator Hackett and Deputy Noonan, and the Department officials, to step up to the plate and to bring some clarity to this issue.  I am in government and I will do whatever I can, as I have been doing over the last months, to bring some solution here.  I understand there are environmental issues but I really do believe that a solution can be found here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021070600002#F00200","speaker":"1619"},{"type":"speech","time":1625526000,"counter":135,"content":"<p>Deputy Kehoe asked a very specific question about a particular company and a legal case.

We as a group, and I personally, have been in touch the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, and the horticulture sections within that Department, and with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage on a daily and weekly basis.  We started out on this issue four or five months ago and we have been fair, experienced, understanding and professional.  I must say that all of the Departments have been equal to that.  They have not ignored us.  The situation is so difficult.  They have not ignored us, but we have not made progress.  We have not made one ounce of progress moving forward.  To be fair, it is not easy to resolve this situation.  We have resolved so many other difficult issues that it is not impossible to resolve it.  It was mentioned earlier that where there is a will there is a way.  All we want is the will.<\/p><p>We as an industry have bought into all aspects of government by way of policy, support and working on all aspects of growing our industry, both locally and on the export market, so there is a will on the part of our industry to work together.  I work very closely with the Department, and as of 8.40 a.m. - we were on our test call at 8.45 a.m. - there was no further update from the three different Departments, or will we call them the three musketeers?  At this point in time there is no progress.  I think someone mentioned earlier urgency.  There was urgency five months ago, so this is certainly urgent at this point in time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021070600002#F00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kieran Dunne","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1625526000,"counter":142,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. O'Rourke, Mr. Dunne, Ms Kavanagh and Mr. Neenan for an informative and pragmatic overview of the situation in which they find themselves.  As a Government representative on the committee, I am both disappointed and somewhat embarrassed that there has been no progress.  When we last met the witnesses, we met departmental officials as well, and maybe I was naive at the time but I felt the working group would arrive at a solution.  I thank the Chairman for allowing the witnesses to come before the committee at short notice.  Everyone on the committee will agree it is imperative that we get these three Departments in before the committee as a matter of urgency.  We will discuss this later, but our work schedule for the remaining days of this D&aacute;il session needs to be set aside until we deal with this issue.  As was rightly said, two months of the sector's harvest have been lost, and unless we get a breakthrough in a matter of days or weeks, the sector will not get any significant harvest this year.  Mr. Neenan set out that the sector has put forward its own solution.  It sounds workable and pragmatic.  I am still not sure whether the working group has fact-checked that proposal or whether it has an opinion on it.  We will have to get that from the Departments when we get them in before us because, in the absence of the Departments coming with another viable plan, that seems to be the only plan open to us at the moment.<\/p> <p>  As for replacements for peat for the horticultural sector, we talk about all the various options but there is no proven option out there.  It seems ludicrous, given the strong horticultural sector we have, to suddenly stop supplying peat in the hope that something will magically appear overnight to replace it.  There is simply nothing out there, and no business or PLC would make such a decision.  For three Departments to procrastinate on this issue in the hope that somehow a replacement product will magically appear seems nonsensical.<\/p> <p>  I have one question for Mr. Dunne.  His view is that Bord na M&oacute;na has stopped producing peat.  I am based in Longford, and over the past four to five days, I have had numerous calls about Bord na M&oacute;na stockpiling large quantities of peat.  I am just looking back on my notes on this.  Tonnes of peat are being stockpiled in embankments of 100 m to 150 m at Clooneeny bog on the outskirts of Killashee.  The plan is to continue stockpiling it, and over time it will be moved by lorries and sold on.  However, it will take months to move the peat that is there and Bord na M&oacute;na continues to stockpile it.  Clearly, therefore, the company is continuing to operate regardless of what has been said, and that is worrying.  It is also worrying that the horticulture industry is basically being held to ransom while Bord na M&oacute;na, it would appear, continues to operate.  If Mr. Dunne could shed any light on that, I would appreciate it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021070600002#G00200","speaker":"1597"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1625526000,"counter":143,"content":"<p>I certainly can.  It is not my view that Bord na M&oacute;na is not moving any peat.  That statement came from Bord na M&oacute;na at an IFA meeting.  The only peat Bord na M&oacute;na has at the moment is for briquettes.  It is fuel peat, not horticultural-grade peat.  I know this from walking the bogs and from the officials in Bord na M&oacute;na.  Horticultural peat can be stockpiled for a maximum of 18 months or it is not usable.  Ms Kavanagh might like to come in on this, but that is what I know from being on the ground.  I have hundreds of acres of Bord na M&oacute;na bog pretty close to me with same stockpiles but I could not use it.  It is purely fuel peat and is not suitable for horticulture.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021070600002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kieran Dunne"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1625526000,"counter":144,"content":"<p>I agree with Mr. Dunne.  Even the bog he mentioned would not be used for horticulture.  I am pretty confident that Bord na M&oacute;na has finished the supply of horticultural peat.<br\/><br\/>Deputy Fitzmaurice asked about research and development and whether it would take five to ten years or whatever else.  It is difficult to answer that question.  Going on my experience in the UK, where I spent 20 years, it was at the forefront of not using peat and examining peat alternatives and has been doing so since the early 1990s but it has not come up with alternatives to peat.  The UK is using a lot of alternatives along with peat in both the retail and the professional market but it has not replaced its more than 5 million cu. m of peat used with alternatives, so there is not a quick fix and we need to see what sustainable, responsibly resourced materials we have.  As Mr. Neenan and I said earlier, we need to do life cycle analyses on those materials and need to know whether any of them seem to be as bad as people perceive peat to be, which is not necessarily our view, to judge it from there and then to test and research those products.  It is difficult to put an exact year on it.  Furthermore, going back to the properties of alternatives, there is no better diluent for those alternatives than Irish peat because Irish peat has the best buffering capacity.  It will kind of buffer the inadequacies of some of those alternatives.  It is crazy that we are importing peat.<br\/><br\/>I wish to refer briefly to an article published in the <i>Baltic Business Quarterly<\/i>magazine on 29 June.  It states that Latvia has reported a 35% increase in exports of its peat in the past four years.  It is giving Latvia its highest export potential, and 31% of what is used in the EU comes from Latvia.  It is also stated in the article that 1 cu. m of peat grows 6,000 young trees, enough to cover 3 ha of land and grow 7,000 seedling plants.  That is enough to grow 16 tonnes of cucumbers or 32 tonnes of tomatoes.  Latvia produces 2 million tonnes, which is 10 million cu. m to 12 million cu. m, of peat.  Estonia and Lithuania produce the same amount.  The distinction is made between use for power, energy and fuel and use for horticulture.  That has been missed here, and I would like to point out that the use of horticultural peat in Ireland represents only 0.12% of Irish peatlands.  That contributes to food production and plant production, which is for the well-being of our citizens.  There can be an inaccurate accounting of greenhouse gases as well.  Peat is part of a circular economy.  It does not go to waste when it is finished.  The peat that is used to grow plants eventually probably ends up in the soil so it is used in that way.  Mr. O'Rourke also pointed out that in the mushroom industry it is used on land to condition soil for cereal growing.  We should appreciate that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021070600002#G00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Anna Kavanagh"},{"type":"speech","time":1625526000,"counter":145,"content":"<p>I have others who want to come in.

People have been talking about relevant Ministers.  It is time the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine takes a hands-on approach to this issue because this is an agricultural issue.  It deals with farms and farms that need our support.  The sector I am most familiar with is mushrooms because it is a key component of agriculture in my own county, Monaghan.  It is important that people recognise where it came from.  The mushroom farmers of Monaghan generally come from small holdings, historically unprofitable, who did what they were asked and diversified.  They found an alternative product which meant they moved from being unsustainable and unprofitable holdings to being key economic drivers for a whole region.  Now they are telling us and the Minister that they face an existential crisis.<\/p> <p>  I do not take any industry verbatim when it comes to outline the issues it faces; one always has to balance that with alternative facts that are available.  The difficulty the Government has here is that no alternative facts have been presented.  There are only those presented by Growing Media and the others here before us.  No one has disputed what they have said to the degree that when the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Ryan, was challenged by me and others in the D&aacute;il on the solution, he volunteered that it was the importation of peat from third countries.  That is a lunatic position.  It is lunacy in economic terms for the operation of the farms I mentioned but even from an environmental perspective, if environmental and climate action concerns were your driving motivator, why would you not take the opportunity to ensure that we have robust environmental rules around the extraction of horticultural peat and ensure that those rules are enforced and monitored in a way that you simply cannot do when a product is imported?<\/p> <p>  I will reiterate a point that was just made.  This goes to the lack of understanding among Ministers in Departments which conflate the use of peat extraction for the use of fuel and energy with that of horticultural peat.  We are talking about horticultural peat mass being 0.1% of the overall peat mass in this country.  The position that has been adopted is tokenism at its worst.  It is doing a huge disservice to those of us who are ambitious and who want to see a robust climate action agenda adopted by the State.  It is setting out that our Government's priority is tokenistic measures that do nothing for the environment but put people out of jobs and farms and companies out of business.  <\/p> <p>  I think emergency legislation is necessary to allow peat extraction to take place this year and next year.  What would the timeframe need to be for that to happen?  There has been some discussion on alternatives.  As well as the Minister's much-lauded importation of peat, we have heard of composted green waste as an alternative.  Coir, the extract from coconuts, and also products such as perlite and vermiculite which are sourced from open cast mines.

Whether peat is got in Latvia or any other country, does it make any difference?  Why should we import a product that we have in plentiful supply in this country?  I have listened to this debate and I listened to other debates.  The guests are welcome.  Their industry has been attacked, like a lot of other industries around this country, because of decisions being made by politicians.  Deputy Kehoe spoke earlier about officials and the Chairman mentioned officials coming in at short notice.  The reason the officials do not want to come in today is because there is no political leadership in this.  The political leadership in this is that they do not want peat to be produced in this country.  We have a daft situation where we are bringing in peat from Latvia.  I fell over a bale of briquettes the other day that came in from another country, and us with more peat in this country than any place else in the world.  If it is going to be taken out of some place else in the world, would we not be well to take it out in Ireland?  We will have to make political decisions today when this meeting is over.  We are going to have to talk.  This is a political issue that needs to be dealt with because we will have more problems down the line if this continues.  I am getting sick and tired of the direction we are going in.  I was not that in favour of voting for the Bill last week.  It was either do that or get out of the party and that may have to come at that stage as well.<\/p><p>The detail in that has not yet been produced but when it is, it will hurt the Chairman and many other Members.  There may come a time when we have to say enough is enough.  Enough is enough with peat.  Peat should be harvested in Ireland, sold in Ireland and produced in Ireland.

Some of my questions have been answered but for the most urgent one, I do not think there has been a clear answer.  It concerns what legislation would need to be amended or what new legislation might be needed.  I acknowledge Mr. Dunne 's point that this is not an easy fix, although it is nonetheless urgent.<\/p> <p>  This was signalled perhaps two years ago, when Bord na M&oacute;na, for commercial reasons, ended horticultural peat extract.  Might more have been done then in order that we would not find ourselves in this position now?  I am open to being educated by the witnesses.  Is it simply the case that the industry and the operators within would need to apply for planning permission and go through the formal processes of appropriate environmental impact assessment reports and so on?  Was that not done and are we now in a situation where that would take too long, given that planning permission cannot be granted quickly?<\/p> <p>  I might make a point in response to Deputy Ring.  I do not think the climate Bill has any bearing whatsoever on this and we should not leave anyone watching proceedings with the impression it has.<\/p> <p>  Finally, what proportion of harvested horticultural peat was exported in 2019?  Can our guests confirm that we are looking for a solution purely for domestic horticultural peat and that we are not seeking to open up export potential as well?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021070600002#J00300","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1625526000,"counter":159,"content":"<p>A number of questions have been raised.  Deputy Flaherty asked whether the legislation that GMI submitted to the Government was fact-checked.  The working group submitted it to each of the Departments, namely, the Departments of the Environment, Climate and Communications and Housing, Local Government and Heritage, in order that their legal representatives could check it.  That was probably at the end of April or early May and there has been no response to that.<\/p> <p>   Deputy Carthy and the Chairman asked about a timeframe for primary or secondary legislation.  Emergency legislation can be prepared in a very short period by way of secondary legislation., although ideally, the longer-term solution should be by way of primary legislation.  Our legal advisers have submitted heads of those two Bills to both Departments, and we have no difficulty submitting them to the committee after this meeting as well, if members wish.<\/p> <p>  To respond to Deputy Leddin, the situation has been ongoing since 2012 or 2013.  It came to a head in February 2018, when operators first learned of a difficulty with the long-standing exemption from planning.  GMI and many others believe it was an unintended consequence of an Act of 2011.  In December 2018, operators learned that this difficulty would not be resolved by an appeal to the Court of Appeal.  In January 2019, they learned the State had resolved the difficulty by removing peat harvesting from planning control and transferring the responsibility to the Environmental Protection Agency.  In October 2019, the court ruled that the legislation was not correct and that there were issues with it and in July 2020, operators learned they could not lawfully resolve the issue within the substitute consent process, which was another problem.  In December 2020, operators learned the State had passed a law to remedy the public participation defect in the process.  One of our members has had an application in with An Bord Plean&aacute;la for more than 14 months, seeking leave to apply for substitute consent, and that has not been dealt with.  Another member got leave to apply but that is likely to be challenged in the courts.<\/p> <p>  I listen to these issues as a member of the working group.  The company I work for, Klasmann-Deilmann, was offered grant aid by the State to develop the bogs in Rathowen, County Westmeath.  Part of the grant aid was given on the basis that the company could not sell its product in Ireland or the UK but rather in Europe.  Questions are now being asked as to why the State fulfilled that.  It was the same with Bord na M&oacute;na.  People do not know the history of these issues.  The board was set up to develop the boglands and create much-needed employment in those rural areas, and to supply energy peat as well.  Things move on, and we seem to forget all those aspects and they need to be pointed out.  There was nothing wrong with companies exporting peat.  As I said, they were encouraged by the State to do so.  Klasmann-Deilmann was funded to improve our facilities and our training for all our employees, which we availed of.  Now, some companies have commitments to supplying peat, having entered into contracts with some of the multiples.  They have to continue with that but it will finish soon.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Fitzmaurice knows more about the sub-30 ha provision than I do.  My understanding is that the point about the sub-30 ha provision was raised in the context of moving some turf cutters from one bog to another and they were brought to areas of under 30 ha.  The sub-30 ha provision, as Mr. Dunne said, will be a very short-term solution.  Imagine the dairy farmers of Ireland were told they could operate with their dairy herd only on 30 ha or less.  Would Avonmore, Kerry Group, Lakeland or whatever remain in Ireland doing that?  It is crazy when we consider that just over one tenth of 1% of boglands in Ireland are for horticulture.<\/p> <p>  I am not a legal expert but we are happy enough with the legislation.  I would respectfully suggest that it is not Growing Media Ireland that should be providing to the State the solution for a problem.  However, we have offered a solution, as well as outlining it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021070600002#J00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Neenan"},{"type":"speech","time":1625526000,"counter":160,"content":"<p>I call Senator Gallagher.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021070600002#K00100","speaker":"1611"},{"type":"speech","time":1625526000,"counter":161,"content":"<p>If I may-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021070600002#K00200","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speech","time":1625526000,"counter":162,"content":"<p>I will call Deputy Leddin again in a minute.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021070600002#K00300","speaker":"1611"},{"type":"speech","time":1625526000,"counter":163,"content":"<p>I will be very quick.

Many families and communities are totally dependent on the mushroom industry.  The word \"crisis\" has been used regarding this situation; I would use the word \"emergency\".  It is unforgivable that we are a matter of weeks away from a doomsday cliff-edge situation where the economy of County Monaghan will be severely damaged as a result of this.<\/p> <p>  I have listened to the contributions of the witnesses and the members of the committee which I have found very informative.  I would use the term \"environmental showmanship\", not just on this issue but in respect of food production in this country, because we do not mind moving the problem so that it is anywhere but here.  We are turning a blind eye to carbon footprints and carbon emissions in other countries at the expense of production there and in the context of the issue in question in this country.

This is a serious issue.<\/p> <p>  I will confine the remainder of my contribution to questions.

Mr. Neenan said that no Department or office of the State has come back to him with their consideration of his submission on the heads of the Bill to counteract the court decision made in 2019.  I ask him to provide more detail about the application for leave for substitute consent which spent 14 months with An Bord Plean&aacute;la awaiting decision.  Again, we see impact of the lack of a statutory time limit for An Bord Plean&aacute;la to make decisions.  We see this in the context of housing, in the commercial sector and now in this sector, which is under immense pressure.  Even with the limited options that remain open for application, it is not good enough that an arm of the State has been dealing with this application for 14 months.  The Government has committed to a planning reform Bill in the autumn.  I call on this committee and others to offer their support to ensure that An Bord Plean&aacute;la will be subject to a statutory time period in which to make decisions on planning applications.<\/p> <p>  I refer to the working group and its consideration of the just transition.

Committee members will know that we commissioned reports from Grant Thornton on three different topics.  One of those was to outline the position around competition law in Ireland.  The second report related to the market requirements for beef.  The third report related to the price points in the supply chain.  Included in the reports we got from Grant Thornton was an attempt to calculate the average price that farmers got for cattle over a two-year period and the price at other points of the chain.  It was not possible to get representative data in respect of the price outside Ireland because of the difficulty in getting data from operators outside this country.  In respect of Ireland, it was possible for Grant Thornton to state the price farmers received and the price factories received, on average, for the product that was exported.  Included in that calculation was a figure for the value of the fifth quarter.  Grant Thornton has, effectively, come back with an overall figure for the value of beef at the processing stage and its value at the farming stage.  One can be compared to the other.

Department officials, through the Irish Embassy in Beijing, continue to engage positively with their Chinese counterparts with a view to regaining market access for Irish beef.  There has also been engagement at political and diplomatic levels.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy McConalogue, and the Minister of State, Deputy Heydon, had a virtual meeting with the Chinese ambassador to Ireland, H.E. He Xiangdong, in March 2021 at which a number of market access and trade issues were raised.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, raised the issue with his counterpart in the Chinese foreign Ministry in May of this year.  Most recently, the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, has written to the relevant Minister in China, informing him of the revised BSE status awarded to Ireland.  The Minister, Deputy McConalogue, noted the strong trade links with China that have emerged in several areas.  He also stressed his desire to see beef exports resume and offered the engagement of his officials, as relevant, to try to resolve this issue.  We very much hope for and continue to work towards the imminent resumption of trade but we must recognise that the timing of this decision lies with the Chinese authorities.<\/p> <p>  In the meantime, the Department continues to work to try to gain access to as many new markets as possible.  It is also carrying out equally challenging work to enhance and retain access to existing international markets.  Each part is crucial to our mission to expand our global footprint while maintaining our position as a quality food producer and supplier.<\/p> <p>  Another of our priority markets for beef is Korea.  A public consultation on our beef access recently concluded in Korea, following which Ireland's beef market access is now with the National Assembly for deliberation.  It passed to the National Assembly in May.

In the veterinary certificates report, 33% of countries said they would accept product from 48 months and even up to 72 months.  Were those countries prepared to pay premium price, although they were accepting the older beef?  Did the Beef Taskforce question that if they were paying premium, why then would the factories not pay premium to the farmer for the post 30-month carcass, when, based on that report, they evidently had 33% of the countries surveyed as a market?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021070600002#S00800","speaker":"1651"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1625526000,"counter":226,"content":"<p>These are the health certificates and the conditions we negotiate with the third-country markets, so they are the bottom line and we cannot export anything that does not fit those requirements.

In April, members of the committee expressed disappointment at the market transparency studies, and the reports failed to identify the division of price among those in the supply chain.  In June, at the next meeting of the task force, there was dissatisfaction with the contribution of the meat processing industry, particularly in regard to the sudden drop in base prices in February of this year.<\/p> <p>  It is precisely because of inconsistencies such as this and the lack of transparency that our farmers want this task force to work properly.  Is it not true to say that when it comes to the level of transparency that farmers want, we are not much further along the line?  In the Grant Thornton conclusions on the demand for in-spec bonuses, it pointed out that several customers referenced developing market requirements and the fact demands may change over time.  When something is being reviewed, we have to look at the weakest point, which may be the most problematic.  What is Mr. Dowling's view on this level of ambiguity about the market demand?  Does it indicate to him that there are shortcomings in regard to the demands that are placed on farmers by the processors in regard to in-spec bonuses?<\/p> <p>  Is there not a fundamental problem with the fact the price paid by the end consumer is not within the scope of the report, and neither were processor-to-processor sales?<\/p><p>Why was that excluded?  Does Mr. Dowling believe that omissions such as these serve the best interests of small family farmers?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021070600002#S01900","speaker":"1613","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1625526000,"counter":238,"content":"<p>I have referred to the in-spec bonuses and in-spec criteria.  I understand people are from time to time disappointed with the price.  In terms of transparency, we asked Grant Thornton to go the whole way along the chain.  It was not possible to do so because it was not possible for the company to get sufficient information from operators outside of Ireland to do the final bit.  It did, however, get significant, comprehensive and representative information in respect of the Irish market and beef that is exported.<\/p> <p>  It also could not get sufficient information from operators outside of Ireland to get the final bit on what the retailer of food service operator or manufacturer was paying.  That is not all that is surprising.  There is no compunction on people who are buying Irish beef from Irish processors outside of Ireland to supply information, which effectively means supplying information on their margins.  They would normally regard that as confidential and would probably be slow enough to provide it, even in their own markets.  That is, therefore, a problem.  It is not a problem manufactured by the task force, however.  It is a problem of people not wanting to give information they do not necessarily have to give.  That is one issue.<\/p> <p>  Through Bord Bia, we got significant additional indices comparing Irish prices with prices across Europe.  In particular, Bord Bia has produced an index providing a composite price based on the internal producer prices in the main markets to which we supply beef.  That shows, over a long period, a reasonable correlation between the price being paid in Ireland and the price that would be paid across all the markets we mainly supply in respect of their own beef.  Sometimes the exports composite price is above our price and sometimes our price is above theirs.  The difference is not all that significant at any stage, however.  That provides some degree of greater transparency than was there before the task force came into operation.  Ms McPhillips wants to add something to that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021070600002#T00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Dowling"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1625526000,"counter":239,"content":"<p>The issue of price transparency is not confined to Ireland.

Those issues can be considered in respect of the primary legislation attached to that office.  Establishing the cost of production, which can vary from farmer to farmer, would be a significant challenge.  The second thing that distinguishes Ireland from France and Spain is that in those countries, farmers are largely selling into their own domestic market.  Primary producers therefore have much greater sway in discussions with retailers and final trade customers, whereas in Ireland, 90% of the beef we produce is exported, so the final customers are far away and are much less subject to influence by producers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021070600002#X00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Sin&eacute;ad McPhillips"},{"type":"speech","time":1625526000,"counter":306,"content":"<p>I accept that point.

Our view would be that producer organisations present a significant opportunity to strengthen the position of the beef farmer in the supply chain.  There are currently three Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine recognised beef producer organisations that received recognition from the Department in September 2019, October 2019 and May of this year, respectively.  The Department is engaged extensively, through the task force and separately, with stakeholders in promoting the establishment of beef producer organisations which are exempt from competition law requirements and allow for producer organisations to bargain on behalf of their members.

In fairness, some people outside the country co-operated with Grant Thornton.  However, on the value of an animal, the fact is there are now people around the world who are looking for many parts of an animal, including gallstones.  We talked about the fifth quarter, offal and all the different parts but we have no genuine figure for what an animal is worth.  We do not know, even though we have gone through three reports because we could not get co-operation.  In my view, that report is not finished.<\/p> <p>  The officials talked about specifications.  The person who actually does the survey should be in the shop or outside the door or wherever, in the same way surveys are done to see who votes for whom.  Until we do that we are going nowhere because, as has been pointed by Deputy Carthy and others, nothing is written down stating that a certain animal was 36 months old and it was moved five times.  At the moment, and I am reiterating this, you can get top dollar for any animal, no matter what it is, because of supply and demand.  I am concerned that we have two reports from Grant Thornton that do not seem to be finalised because it said it could not get the information for one and the second, in my view, did not include the people it needed to.  If I was sent to Dublin in a lorry to collect 100 cattle and I came home with 70 or 80, there would be queer looking.  Grant Thornton should finish compiling those reports in a different way.<\/p> <p>  Any information can be found out nowadays.  It is easy to look at the price of products on the shelf.  I will give a very simple analogy.  If I am selling to five different companies in five different countries, I know who they are.  They are well known and their products are on the shelf.  We can walk along the shelf, look at the price of the stuff and see how much it is per kilo.  Did the factories give all the information about what they are getting for what they are exporting from Ireland?  Would it be fair to say you would not need to be mathematician to find that out?  Did the Department get information from factories in Ireland about what they get from retailers in the different countries they are selling to?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021070600002#Z00800","speaker":"1508"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1625526000,"counter":342,"content":"<p>That was not the problem.  The problem was what the retailers or food service operators were getting for beef.  That information could not be got.  The information on what factories get is compiled.  That is how Grant Thornton was able to get the figure for the total value of the product exported from, or sold within, Ireland.  That was not the difficulty.  It is not as simple as going along, if I understand what the Deputy said, and saying we can find out what the retailer is getting because we can look at the price he or she is charging.  First, it is nearly impossible to do that on any sort of representative basis but, second, a big proportion of what we sell goes into food service.  Food service product comes out as a beefburger or some other sort of product, which is mixed up with other agricultural products on the plate people buy.  It is not an issue that is very easily solved by doing a spot-check of what is on a retail shelf.<\/p> <p>  Grant Thornton had expertise and it did its best.  It could not get the final price but it got the prices in between and that was, at least, beneficial in understanding what sort of gaps there are between farmer price and the price that beef is sold to the final customer, although not the final consumer.  To do a survey of consumers to ask them what they think about specifications etc., would not necessarily give any information other than the fact that consumers probably do not know an awful lot about the matter.  Producers are not selling directly to the consumer; they are selling directly to people who are either manufacturing, cooking or retailing the beef themselves.  They are the people who create and who are the demand for Irish beef.  They are the people Grant Thornton had to try to deal with.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021070600002#Z00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Dowling"},{"type":"speech","time":1625526000,"counter":343,"content":"<p>That is grand.

I am the chairperson of the CRU and am joined by my fellow commissioners, Mr. Paul McGowan and Mr. Jim Gannon.  The CRU is Ireland&rsquo;s independent water and energy regulator.  Our mission is to protect the public interest in water, energy, and energy safety.  Our vision is for energy supplied safely; a sustainable and efficient future for energy and water; empowered and protected customers paying reasonable prices; and a secure low-carbon future.<br\/><br\/>We use the tools of economic and safety regulation to protect customers and the public, to facilitate the delivery of critical infrastructure and to ensure that competitive markets work for the benefit of customers and society.  We are fully committed to delivering the least-cost decarbonisation of the energy sector, while ensuring security of supply in line with our national policy goals.  We have included with our submission the CRU strategic plan and our recently published strategy paper for the gas price review project.  Similar papers for our electricity price review are available on our website: <i>cru.ie<\/i>.  <br\/><br\/>With regard to energy&rsquo;s contribution to our 2030 carbon reduction targets, the CRU is already working towards the delivery of an electricity sector with world-leading levels of intermittent renewable generation, including significantly increased contributions from solar and onshore and offshore wind.  This will be facilitated by flexible, efficient gas generation, of a similar scale to that which we have today, but used less frequently, which will provide back-up during those sometimes extended periods of very little sunshine or wind.  The system will also be balanced by increased storage, interconnection and demand-side contribution.  In line with European and national policy goals, we are also working to facilitate active customers and communities, who will be given the opportunity to contribute to the transition while also benefiting by reducing their energy bills. <br\/><br\/>The CRU is also committed to meeting the twin challenge of transforming our electricity system while meeting rapidly increasing demand, including from new data centres and the electrification of heat and transport.  Natural gas, which will be decarbonised over time, will provide an essential underpinning for the security of energy supply, ensuring we can meet this demand as we transition to a net zero carbon economy. <br\/><br\/>It is important to emphasise that this transition will not be costless.  New system services and the delivery of significant new generation and network infrastructure will be required.  Our focus will be to ensure the least-cost delivery of new services and infrastructure, to enable customers and communities to contribute and to seek equity in the transition in order that customers who have the means and opportunity to invest in low-carbon options are not cross-subsidised by those who do not. <br\/><br\/>In order to facilitate this transition, it is also essential that our planning and consent processes are fit for purpose and well resourced to support the delivery of this critical infrastructure.  Policy and political support for key projects, alongside best-in-class community and societal engagement, will also be vital in ensuring community acceptance of these.<i><\/i><\/p><p>We will now outline some of the initiatives that the CRU will undertake to support the sectoral targets.  I will start with the networks that underpin a secure, low-carbon future.  We are investing in upgrading and expanding our electricity networks, including in operational capacity and innovation.  Through our periodic price review process, the CRU has increased allowed capital expenditure for EirGrid and ESB Networks by &euro;1.3 billion to a total of more than &euro;4 billion over the coming five-year period, with a recognition that more investment will be required in the second half of the decade to 2030.  This funding package enables the delivery of new generation connections, transmission and distribution infrastructure, interconnection, and smart meters and smart technology that will facilitate our low-carbon transition and unlock value for energy consumers.  The investment framework that we have developed is agile to enable new Government policy on offshore grids, while also providing strong incentives and ambitious targets for the companies to develop and adopt innovative and least-cost solutions to support the net zero targets. <\/p><p> We are currently working on the regulatory framework for two new interconnectors, the Celtic interconnector with France and the Greenlink interconnector with Great Britain.  Along with the delivery of the crucial North-South interconnector, more interconnection capacity will be needed over time.  We will also continue to work with the Department and key stakeholders on the development of the regulatory framework for offshore grid infrastructure, in line with new Government policy.<\/p><p> I will turn to consider markets delivering least-cost solutions.  To meet our renewable electricity targets, we will need significant investment to develop the onshore and offshore wind and solar capacity required to meet our targets.  We are working to support the Department in the renewable electricity support scheme, RESS, auction process to secure this capacity competitively and at least cost for customers.<\/p><p> The all-island single electricity market provides a competitive market for the delivery of electricity, new generation capacity and system services at least cost.  The DS3 system services programme has underpinned Ireland&rsquo;s world-leading status for the level of intermittent renewable generation that can be accommodated on the system at any one time, which is currently being tested to 75%.  We are already consulting on the successor programme to deliver up to 95% instantaneous renewable penetration, which will require us to competitively procure a wider range and higher volume of system services. This is a crucial underpinning for our renewable targets.<\/p><p> The single electricity market committee is also running capacity auctions to secure the additional generation capacity required.  The twin challenges of replacing a large part of our existing generation fleet, while meeting rapidly growing demand, means that a minimum of 2 GW of new gas-fired plant will be needed in the next few years.  This flexible capacity is required to support increased renewables, enable us to retire older carbon intensive plant and ensure security of supply.  This capacity is in addition to the increased storage and interconnection which must also be delivered at pace.<\/p><p> I will turn to active energy customers and communities.  As the transition will not be costless, it is critical that we engage and empower customers to participate in new energy activities.  While the overall price of electricity may increase during the transition, customers will have options to lower their own bills by switching their demand to off-peak times, providing demand-side services such as switching off non-essential electricity usage, selling back electricity from electric vehicle, EV, batteries at peak times, or generating their own renewable electricity and selling any excess to the grid.<\/p><p> The smart metering programme, which is well under way, will provide active customers with better information and smarter options such as time-of-use tariffs as well as measuring microgeneration exports. We expect that new third parties will enter the market to enable customers to easily participate through new home energy technologies and aggregation services.  We will also work to ensure that our electricity markets can facilitate citizen and renewable energy communities to generate and sell or share renewable energy within communities.<\/p><p> With the transposition of the new clean energy package of legislation, we expect the CRU to be given new functions to create regulatory frameworks for active customers, energy communities and third parties such as aggregators.  This will be a key focus for us in the coming years.  We will also support the implementation of the microgeneration scheme, once it has been decided, with a view to facilitating customers and ensuring equity between customer groups.  In particular, we will need to protect vulnerable customers who are not in a position to participate actively.  <\/p><p> I will turn to secure, decarbonised gas.  As we embark on a period of unprecedented transformation in the energy sector, with significantly increasing electricity demand, it is vital to ensure security of energy supply to support our economy and society.  Gas is an essential transition fuel for Ireland as we move to a fully decarbonised energy system.  Gas-fired generation will play a pivotal role in underpinning electricity security of supply and the secure electrification of heating and transport.  As Corrib gas is in decline and in the absence of new indigenous production, we will be increasingly dependent on imports from the UK via our existing interconnectors.  Implementing a strategy to decarbonise gas and ensuring secure and diverse supplies and supply routes for gas will be a key priority, noting that an increasing proportion of this could be indigenous biomethane and, in time, green hydrogen.<\/p><p> These are the key priorities to underpin decarbonisation in the energy sector, which are core to the CRU&rsquo;s strategy.  We previously had the benefit of this committee&rsquo;s input in drafting our strategic plan and would welcome any feedback from the committee for the next strategic plan for 2022 to 2024, which is currently being developed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021070600002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Aoife MacEvilly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1625526000,"counter":353,"content":"<p>I thank Ms MacEvilly for her opening statement.

I am interested in the opinion of our guests.  Data centres will be responsible for 30% of Ireland's electricity demand within nine years.  If all the applications relating to data centres go through, that amount could rise to 70%.  Is there a risk of that pushing up prices for individual residential users?  Our guests might let me know their thoughts on that issue.  Ms MacEvilly spoke about the need to make sure there is not cross-subsidisation of costs.

EirGrid's forecasts in the generation capacity statement recognised some time ago that data centres will form a large part of the electricity demand in the country for a number of years to come.  The first exercise in looking at how we could mitigate some of the risks associated with data centres and the challenges they pose was a new connection policy that EirGrid brought into being in 2019.  That policy was to examine data centres and see how flexible they could be.  More recently, in the past month and a half, in dialogue with EirGrid, we brought out a further consultation with a draft direction that challenges data centres to be better energy citizens and to bring solutions to the table.  It proposes to grade data centres that can bring their own generation to the table and support security of supply.  Moving down that grading system, it calls on data centres that can respond to signals in the marketplace to turn down their demand at different stages.<\/p> <p>  In parallel to that, we and our colleagues in the utility regulator of Northern Ireland, our partners in the single electricity market, have started looking at what is called scarcity pricing but is really additional pricing where demand and supply are getting a little thinner, and examining how can that be felt by industrial and commercial customers.<\/p> <p>  A final piece that is important to note is that EirGrid has, for a number of years, engaged in securing demand-side units.

I am particularly interested to hear from the CRU how the public service obligation, PSO, charge is levied.  At present, it is levied on residential consumers, commercial consumers and large industrial consumers according to their contribution to peak demand.  The more the sector contributes to peak demand, the higher the portion of PSO they pay.  This is letting data centres off the hook because they have a massive steady demand that does not contribute to peak demand.  Would the CRU be open to looking at alternatives that help prevent households subsidising data centres?  As I said, the ESRI has outlined a scenario if various PSO groups were levied according to their average demand.  Each sector would be responsible for paying for only that proportion of renewable electricity to which they give rise and there would be no cross-subsidisation.  Alternatively, the PSO could be recouped on a charge for each unit.  Is the CRU looking at how the PSO is levied at present?  It is quite regressive and is not fair.<\/p> <p>  I also seek clarification on how much of the demand is accounted for by data centres.  We hear mixed messages on this.  We have heard from EirGrid that 100% of the demand will come from data centres and not from heat and transport.  It is important for us to get clarity on this.  Is this the case?  Or is it what the CRU is saying, which is that it is a mix of data centres, heat and transport?<\/p> <p>  As for the microgeneration scheme,  the witnesses said in their statement the CRU wants to ensure equity between consumer groups.  We know the preferred model chosen by the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, which was put out to public consultation, scored zero out of five on equity.  This is according to the analysis commissioned by the Minister.  It seems the chosen model already has built-in structural inequity.  I am interested to hear from the CRU how it would ensure equity and protect vulnerable customers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021070600002#C00600","speaker":"1635"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1625526000,"counter":363,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Boylan.  I will start with the PSO.  The Senator outlined perfectly the manner in which the PSO levy costs are allocated between the various consumer groups.  This is set out in legislation.  It is not something we designed or chose.  It is on foot of state aid applications to and decisions by the European Commission that this methodology was deemed to be the best approach.  It is set out in legislation.  I would not say it necessarily lets data centres off the hook.  They will be paying PSO levies.  What the ESRI research has suggested is that a different approach might levy a higher proportion on data centres if we were to go down that road.<\/p> <p>  I know much has been written about the manner in which a PSO levy is distributed between various customer groups and household customers.  Any change is likely to create winners and losers, even in the domestic sector.  For example, moving to a per usage or per kilowatt hour usage approach in the household sector might benefit people who have been able to invest in energy efficiency or microgeneration.  It might be more difficult to accommodate households that cannot afford to do this.  It is an area in which we have to tread very carefully.  At present, a review of this approach is not in the CRU's work plan.  If we do find over time the methodology creates a level of inequity beyond what we anticipate or what can be seen at present it is something we could look at.  We must bear in mind that at present it is based on state aid and the legislation.  It is not an area in which we have an immediate ability to change.<\/p> <p>  Looking at data centre demand, we have spoken about the electrification of heat and transport.  At present, this does not drive a significant increase but we expect this to change over time.  We were looking out to 2030.  It has to be said that while we see increasing demand from the electrification of heating and transport, the very large driver of the rapid increase in demand we see is with regard to data centres.  This is the case.<\/p> <p>  With regard to microgeneration, the Minister has consulted on a scheme and we have been engaging to the extent that we can to support the Department on it.  No decision has been taken as yet.  I cannot comment on the final decision or the approach the Department and Minister will ultimately take.  From our perspective, what we would like to do is address the twin inequity.  At present, it feels very unfair to customers who have solar panels on their roofs who export electricity to the grid but are not getting any compensation or value for that contribution.  We believe it is important that a market-based price is given to these customers.  It is then a matter of policy for the Minister to determine whether an additional contribution should be made.  From our perspective, the challenge is also about providing options to customers who do not have this ability to invest.  They may be renting.  They are not in a position to make multi-year investments.  Through our smart metering programme, we want to give those customers options in order that they can do things such as demand-side management, time-of-use tariffs or other contributions so they also have options to lower their bills.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021070600002#C00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Aoife MacEvilly"},{"type":"speech","time":1625526000,"counter":364,"content":"<p>I am aware Senator Boylan probably wants to go canvassing and I invite her to come back in now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021070600002#C00800","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speech","time":1625526000,"counter":365,"content":"<p>I have a brief question and I apologise because I will then have to leave the meeting.

Much of the media coverage in the last number of weeks has flagged concern about the prospect of blackouts and the number of system alerts, with six in the last 12 months compared to 11 in the past ten years.  It is reported, and I am not sure if it was scheduled, that Huntstown in Dublin and Whitegate in Cork are down.  I am not sure if the witnesses know when they might be back online or the reason they are down.  The move away from fossil fuels to renewables is the direction in which we need to go, but in the past 12 months there has been an increasing dependence on Moneypoint.  We also read in the newspapers last week about a plan for emergency power generation in Dublin.  On the one hand, we have this pressure on the grid in terms of demand and the supply and, on the other hand, there is the massive increase in demand from data centres.  It is not only data centres.  A major plant in County Kildare will have an electricity demand that is equivalent to that of the city of Galway.<\/p> <p>  From my perspective, there appears to be a major challenge there, but there is almost an incoherence in terms of policy.  The risk to the system appears to be very real.  Do the witnesses share that perspective?  Are people in the CRU losing sleep at night over these issues?  It strikes me, and we do not have sight of the numbers, that this is a real and potentially existential crisis in the system.  Do the witnesses have concerns?  Do they have a view on particular policies that are in place at present?  I live in County Meath, which has many data centres.  There are some people in the county who would like to see many more for various reasons.  However, real challenges come with that.  How did we end up in this position where there are system alerts?

Then I will cover the emergency temporary generation.  If he will bear with me for a few minutes, I will get to that crux of his question.<\/p> <p>  It was known for some time that as we transition from an older, more fossil-intensive fleet, comprising units including oil, coal and peat, to a decarbonised world which will involve, in the medium term, significant proportions of wind, backed up by natural gas, we would be faced with a period of investment and a period of increased risk.  This is as large parts of our existing portfolio are retired and we replace them with, as noted in our introductory statement, more flexible, predominantly gas, fossil fired plant, which will enable that transition.  It is something of the scale we have now, but also which will be used significantly less and when needed.  This capacity is procured on an all-island basis through the single electricity market.  That is in partnership with the Utility Regulator of Northern Ireland.  It relies on industry taking the appropriate market signal in an auction and also on delivering the pipeline of generators when it has won an auction and signed a contract to deliver.<\/p> <p>  In the medium term, we have outlined in our statement that we will be looking at a combination of new generation, storage and, critically, the three interconnectors to provide us with the generation we require.  In the longer term, we envisage technologies such as green hydrogen, carbon capture and storage and greater and different types of storage and interconnection coming into play, alongside a decarbonisation of that gas which allows us to move beyond natural gas to different molecules and truly meet the net zero challenge.  In the medium to long term, the capacity remuneration mechanism, CRM, in the single electricity market is how we will deliver that new capacity.<\/p> <p>  We are left with this short-term challenge or risk, however.  Underpinning all the provision of interconnection, capacity and storage is demand side response.  The critical points in time where we see scarcity are in the winter, when we can have periods of low wind, low sunshine and it peaks between 4 p.m. and 7 p.m.  Where we need responses is quite specific.  If we can send the signals, both positive and negative, to industry and to consumers to take advantage of these times and to turn down and be rewarded for same, we will need to do that in combination with providing the supply side.  Coming into the past winter, winter 2020-21, we had our seasonal update with EirGrid.  We have a winter outlook and a summer outlook.  That involves EirGrid, ourselves and the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications.  In this we identify short-term challenges.  These included an uptick and increase in demand from a range of sectors, which would have included data centres and the economy recovering or starting to recover post Covid.  Separately, we noticed a reduction in the reliability of the existing fleet.  Some of those pieces of the fleet that are of medium to older age are being asked to turn up and turn down more frequently as they balance the wind.  They are being asked to do things they were not designed for, so the reliability of some of the existing fleet has decreased a little.<\/p> <p>  These were on our radar and we noted that they were more short-term challenges that might last over the course of this winter, next winter and the winter afterwards as we move from the older generation fleet to the new fleet.  It was in November, December, January and particularly February and March that we had two outages in Whitegate and Huntstown, which were noted in the press.  They were identified initially at that critical mid-point of winter, but then extended to long-term outages covering this winter.  These were of the order of 800 MW, but they were 800 MW of the more dependable generation facilities we have to date.  That is more than 10% of the thermal fleet we have, so that was significant in terms of increasing risk coming into this winter.  At that point, where that crystallised a significant challenge and, indeed, an emergency for this winter coming, we began engaging further with EirGrid and the Department, not just on the medium-term challenge but this winter challenge.  This is where, along with a number of measures, including working with the demand side, we began trying to secure or directing EirGrid to secure the emergency generation for the coming winter.<\/p> <p>  Emergency generation is one of a number of measures that will contribute to reducing risk this winter.  We are hopeful, but not certain, that the units in Whitegate and Huntstown will return in sufficient time to cover all of this winter.  We are also conscious that winter changes from year to year.  We could have a winter of high winds or, as we experienced in January and February of this year, we could have a period of eight to ten days of very low winds.  Again, the risk can increase or decrease in an unpredictable way from winter to winter, and the emergency generation is one measure to decrease some of that risk.<\/p> <p>  On the medium-term and long-term challenge, there are efforts to secure the new type of capacity we will need during our transition in a cost-effective way.<\/p><p>In the short term, there are a couple of building risks that were tightening that supply-demand balance but the trigger would have been around the realisation of this risk in Huntstown and Whitegate, as the Deputy has noted himself, and trying to ensure that should there be any delay in those units coming back that we would have sufficient capacity to supply ourselves.  That additional capacity is around mitigation of that risk.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021070600002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Gannon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1625526000,"counter":370,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Gannon.

I wish to turn to the longer-term opportunity that exists in renewable energy, particularly offshore, which suggests Ireland can become a significant net exporter of energy over time.  I wish to explore the issue of how a platform for offshore renewable energy is funded and how that should happen.  As I understand it, there is a belief now that the State should provide some platform services so new suppliers can plug into a State network instead of building many separate ones for each of them.  How is that funded?  Does that go back to PSO funding, such that there is a short-term pressure on prices to achieve a longer-term efficiency?  How does that impact?  If we do have an opportunity in the long term to become renewable exporters, are our consumers going to have to go through a short-term period where they are being squeezed because of this longer-term opportunity that will be uncertain until it is realised?  I just want to explore that.  As I understand it we are in the emissions trading scheme, ETS, and it is designed to encourage the most carbon-efficient generation and we could be very efficient in the long term with our renewable capacity, but that could be undermined if we are trying to fund it through short-term pressure on our own consumers.<\/p> <p>  The second issue I would like to explore is creating a platform for consumers more generally to manage their demand.  Even though meters have been rolling out for quite some time the offer of actual services to allow people manage their demand more efficiently seems very slow in coming.<\/p> <p>   We are on the brink of a big switch in say, mobility, to shared mobility.  Should the CRU be more active in putting out platforms that can create new markets such as shared mobility, which require fewer cars on the road, fewer parking spaces, less building of apartments with loads of underground car parking spaces and so on?  Where is the commission on that?  For consumers to be able to more actively manage their needs, this is an exciting prospect.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021070600002#E00500","speaker":"1549"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1625526000,"counter":374,"content":"<p>I am happy to take the first question and I might hand over to my colleague, Ms MacEvilly, for the second, if that is all right.<\/p> <p>  We are at the beginning of a transition from a developer-led offshore regime to a centrally-led one.  We see that trend in many of the other European countries, which are also trying to access the offshore opportunity.  Separately, we also see a new policy statement from the Department on offshore grid investment and we have a transition articulated there on the way to 2030.  On the opportunity for Ireland, it is inevitable there will be investment in offshore grid and offshore grid connections.  For the first couple of phases of that we will have a market domestically that can absorb that generated electricity.  As we move beyond that initial investment phase of, say, the 5 GW in the programme for Government to 2030, we will seek to export this commodity, be that through further interconnection or in the longer term, through molecules, perhaps in the form of green hydrogen.<\/p> <p>  As to how that is paid for, in the first instance, in a developer-led opportunity, typically the developer would finance and invest in that.  It is possible that their dealing with that cost and risk would increase bids into a RESS, which would find its way into the PSO.  However, again they will treating that risk, they will be designing to and constructing that risk and that offshore infrastructure.  In the longer term it is an anticipated it will be an offshore transmission asset owner, in the form of EirGrid, which will centrally plan, design and develop that grid.  Through central planning, designing and development, especially as we move beyond that initial scale of 5 GW, it is anticipated that will result in ultimate savings for the consumer.  Again, that is a design model used in a number of different countries, certainly in the EU.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021070600002#E00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Gannon"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1625526000,"counter":375,"content":"<p>I will come in on the question about smart meters and smart services if that is all right.  Like Deputy Bruton, we think this is an exciting area.  As of the end of May, 320,000 smart meters have been rolled out to homes in Ireland.   ESB Networks is continuing to deploy in various locations across Ireland and is ramping up to 40,000 installations per month so the installation process is gathering pace and scale.  Smart services go-live occurred on 26 February.  It was the point at which systems were available for suppliers to start getting information from the smart meters and offering services to customers.  That is quite recent but we have seen suppliers going out offering new types of tariffs to customers.  Again, by the end of May, approximately 7,000 customers had switched to tariffs.  Interestingly the vast majority of them switched to more innovative tariff offerings, rather than the standard time of use, which we had sort of designed as the regulatory backstop.  There seems to be an appetite to different types of product and services and that will only grow.<\/p> <p>  We have done a bit of research with the ESRI on how to tell the story of these tariffs and the value customers may derive from them with Dr. Pete Lunn and his team.  On foot of that, we are requiring suppliers to send out what we are calling a time of use primer to all customers.  That will start landing in customers' homes this month.  This is to socialise the concept of time of use more widely and to help customers understand it can lower their costs and make a real difference in decarbonisation.  We are also looking to bring on board some communications support, and I think we have already done so.  It is to help us in the CRU tell that story more effectively to customers, as the neutral regulator that is on their side, rather than maybe a supplier that is selling a particular product, and to outline what we think the opportunities are for customers.  There are also areas where customers might want to be careful.  If they are vulnerable customers critically dependent on assistive technology that is electrically powered then some of these options may not be suitable for them and we want somebody telling that story of protection as well.<\/p> <p>  As we see the clean energy package transposed, we will have those new functions around regulatory frameworks for active customers for third-party aggregators that will start to leverage that.  Thus for an individual customer selling, say, demand-side services, if a household does not have much clout but if we have an aggregator bringing together the value of thousands or hundreds of thousands of customers, or indeed a community coming together to sell that into its local area, then there is a power and value to that.  That is the direction of travel we see and we have embarked on that now with the smart metering and smart services go-live but I agree it is the tip of the iceberg.  We see significant growth potential in that area and think it is important for the hearts and minds of customers, who want to participate and may not necessarily be sure what their options are.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021070600002#E00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Aoife MacEvilly"},{"type":"speech","time":1625526000,"counter":376,"content":"<p>Was there a question for Mr. McGowan?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021070600002#F00100","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speech","time":1625526000,"counter":377,"content":"<p>I was unsure from Mr. Gannon's reply.

I am happy to go into it in further detail.  What I was trying to articulate was that, in the shorter term, where there has not been centralised planning in place, to imagine the infrastructure that will be required for a portfolio of wind farms and perhaps hybrid connections to other jurisdictions, it is appropriate to look at a project-by-project investment basis.  That is probably the best way of securing what is in the programme for Government, which is 5 GW.  We tackle project by project to ensure we have the appropriate investment for each project.<\/p> <p>  In the longer term, where it is centrally planned and we have a better idea of what that portfolio will look like, there should be a significant jump to further investment.  We can show we are open for business by planning in a central way.  In that way we can then access the most cost-effective investment options for the infrastructure we require.  What I am trying to describe is how there are in effect two parallel approaches.  We deliver on a project-by-project basis now.  This is what industry is used to in Ireland and what the infrastructure is used to in Ireland in terms of the soft and hard infrastructure.  However, as we look to the second jump, we want to ensure it is planned centrally and accessed as an investment cost-effectively.  I am not saying there would not be any anticipatory investment but I believe central planning allows us to look at that.  That includes the question of how that cost would be amortised in terms of the regulatory framework, which will underpin the policy framework.  Would it be through transmission use-of-system charges or would it be through other means?  That part of the regulatory framework would follow.  It is a consideration.<\/p> <p>  What sort of investment platform in terms of soft infrastructure or hard infrastructure do we need to put in place to show our ambition?  We need to ensure those costs are attributable, attributed and amortised appropriately.  That is part of centralised planning while we continue to deliver to ensure we meet the 2030 ambitions we have set.  What I am saying is it has not been determined yet but I believe a clear pathway has been set out in terms of moving towards a centralised model.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021070600002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Gannon"},{"type":"speech","time":1625526000,"counter":379,"content":"<p>This is a very interesting discussion.  Fair play to my fellow committee members for some excellent questions.  It is thought provoking, especially around data centres and security of supply.<\/p> <p>  I might touch on the issue of security of supply.  Mr. Gannon mentioned the capacity we have now in carbonised energy forms.  He said we do not need extra capacity and what we have now can be tweaked and turned up and down - I realise that is a simplistic explanation - to cater for those lulls in wind or solar energy.  That is encouraging.<\/p> <p>  The next question is almost like asking how long is a piece of string.  How long would we have to rely on that source of carbonised energy and the interconnectors to the UK to compensate for those lull periods?  I understand that might be a difficult question to answer but it would be nice to have a picture.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Gannon referenced the lulls in wind and continued days of low wind when the energy production is greatly reduced and how that impacts on fossil fuel energy.  Does a good offshore wind programme and set-up mitigate that issue?  If a wind farm is out in the Atlantic, does it mitigate against the losses or drops and lulls in wind?  Is that a significant part of the solution?<\/p> <p>  The programme for Government commits to an end to issuing new licences for offshore oil and gas exploration and ending liquified natural gas terminals.  This is something we all welcome.  Most of the people in this committee are 100% behind it.  However, there are existing licences.  Will the commission representatives comment on those existing licences?  Do they potentially form part of the short term solution to interim security?  Is it something we should be going away from altogether?  That could be a difficult question to answer but it is something we have to discuss because those licences are in place and there are companies looking at them.<\/p> <p>  I wish to ask about grid connection and grid capacity.  This may not be something under the remit of the commission but I would not mind hearing a comment on it.  One of the main points of issue of the renewable energy companies is that the existing grid connection needs serious upgrading.  They maintain the set-up to the grid is not happening fast enough and the grid connection process is long, laborious and bureaucratic.  It takes far too long.

I call them generators.  There are longer periods where the wind can decline for several days on end and when we do not have too much sunshine between 4 p.m. and 7 p.m. in particular.  It is referred to as <i>kalte Dunkelflauten<\/i>- I am careful in my pronunciation - in some of the studies that have taken place.  We felt one this winter in January and February, so it is something that happens.<br\/><br\/>What is important to combat that?  Interconnectors are important to combat that because we can count on them for more than a six-hour or 12-hour period.  We have the existing east-west interconnector and the Moyle interconnector between Northern Ireland and Scotland.  The North-South interconnector helps us on the island and contributes to security of supply.  There is also the Greenlink interconnector and the Celtic Interconnector to France.  This is all important infrastructure.  Even when we transition away, natural gas will support us in ensuring security of supply and in exporting excess energy to create national wealth from this natural resource.<br\/><br\/>Offshore wind has a better capacity factor than onshore wind.  In effect, this means that where we might expect onshore turbines to turn for between 30% and 40% of the year, the rate for offshore is far greater than that.  It can be in excess of 50%.  What is their contribution to security of supply?  They tend to blow more and blow more frequently in times of tight wind, if I can put it that way.  The fact they are offshore also means that there is a greater spread geographically.  This could help us where we see some of the onshore fleet of wind turbines being becalmed at different stages.  Offshore can help to mitigate that because it has a greater capacity factor.  Again, interconnectors and, increasingly, longer term storage, some of which may be batteries, will certainly help and are important.  I would not underestimate the role of the demand side.  This is because if demand can reduce between the peak hours of 4 p.m. to 7 p.m., it can allow the batteries to recharge and come back on when we need them the next day.<\/p><p>There is a contribution from there with regard to security of supply.  I have covered the issue of offshore contribution.<\/p><p> On the final point about the grid and grid connections, industry has responded very well to what we call the ECP process which is the enduring connections policy.  This put a new system in place to allow people to apply for connections and for grid connections to be delivered.  In parallel to that, the price review process, which sets the revenues for EirGrid and ESB Networks, particular and increased moneys were given to them to facilitate better delivery of the physical infrastructure for these generators and for demand side.  Separately, incentives were put in place within those to accelerate the delivery within that process.  There is a challenge there and industry will always be impatient for grid connections, but in economic terms and with the system and the process that we can set, we have put that in place.<\/p><p> On our need for gas and a gas diverse supply, I am happy to pass over to my colleague, Dr. Paul McGowan, in the first instance and then perhaps over to Ms Aoife MacEvilly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021070600002#F00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Gannon","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1625526000,"counter":385,"content":"<p>Deputy O'Sullivan has raised very interesting points in his questions around LNG and other offshore licences.

When we have our security of supply hat on we must consider how to ensure security of supply over that period.  One important element to consider is diversity of supply.  At the moment we have gas from indigenous production through Corrib.  The Kinsale field has now ceased production.  As the Corrib field declines in the future, and without any further indigenous gas production, essentially our diversity of gas supply comes down to one source of supply.  Over the next few decades as we are looking at transitioning to net-zero carbon, we must consider what sort of diversity of supply we require in order to ensure security of supply.  It is worth noting that the Department is in the process of undertaking a security of supply review.  The commission will input into that review.

If we bring somebody in to invest today we hope that we only needed it for the next ten to 15 years, but with the kind of investment that is needed for a facility like that, they are captured, and ultimately it will be used for far longer than is necessary.  This goes back to the question I wanted to ask originally, which is about the concern that we are looking at mothballing some existing infrastructure such as Moneypoint.  It is being wound down ahead of schedule and yet it is clear there is potential for blackouts.  I do not know if potential for blackouts is because we underestimated electricity demand some time ago when we made these decisions, or whether the demand has increased greater than expected.  Perhaps we have not been able to bring on as many renewables or we have not been able to extend that.  Maybe it is the complex market situation we use that is not delivering.  I do not know.  I am trying to understand from Dr. McGowan if the complex market system that we operate, which is the all-island system, is fit for purpose at the moment in light of the developing situation where there is potential for blackouts.  Dr. McGowan rightly identified the narrowing gap between demand and supply, and the amount of supply of renewable electricity with an ageing infrastructure.  What sort of clarity can the commission give us in the short term on the avoidance of blackouts?  Nobody knows when the wind is going to park and for how long, and I do not expect Dr. McGowan to turn into a weather forecaster for us, but can he give us some idea about the risk?  What risk analysis has the commission done by looking at patterns in weather events that existed in the past?  We do this all of the time with regard to flooding, looking at 100-year events and so on.  Is there a person within the commission or within EirGrid who is plotting, to some extent, the potential for a blackout, the length of time a blackout might be, and the impact it would have on our economy let alone on our reputation?

Although designed for natural gas, with an appropriate risk assessment they would be quite comfortable carrying substituted hydrogen or quite a bit of hydrogen.  It is not beyond the bounds of commercial or technical possibility that gas terminals that would help us to supply security and diversity of supply could not also be designed to be converted over time to using hydrogen or other molecules and not just straight up natural gas.  Again, the investment signal could perhaps precipitate something like that.  It is worth keeping that in mind.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the different powers and the options open to us, it is core to our mandate and explicitly called out in legislation that the commission has significant powers to secure a security of supply within Ireland.  That is a national competency.<\/p> <p>  I will now turn to the types of measures we are considering in the short to medium term.<\/p><p>For reasons I have outlined previously, trying to secure emergency generation is a quite reflexive and responsive measure that, along with other measures, will contribute to reducing a security and supply risk this winter.  In the medium term, we will move from a short-term response, such as the one we have outlined, to a longer-term response.  On the longer-term response, over the next six months and into January and February of next year, we will execute three capacity auction rounds in the single electricity market with the utility regulator.  These are the T-1, which looks to get generation in place and invested in for next winter, 2022-23, and the T-3 and T-4, which will look for investment in three and four years' time.  Within that sort of window, contracts can be executed that bring new generation to the table or that retain and get investment in existing generation to provide the type of capacity that is needed.  That is one of the measures.<\/p><p> On existing capacity, we do not just tempt in new capacity with the capacity mechanism.  We also provide exit signals for plant that might be at the end of its useful life and might find it harder to put in place the type of investment to compete on the open market.  At the single electricity market level, we not only consider bringing new plant in but also what plant may exit.  A key piece for us is to look at the generation capacity statement, GCS, which is the core piece that EirGrid and the System Operator for Northern Ireland, SONI, supply to the single electricity market.  This outlines what demand and supply will look like over the course of the next ten years, how much we will need and that we will need to secure it.  The capacity mechanism can look at that in the medium term.<\/p><p> We also have different out-of-market options available to us should they be needed to keep facilities online but we are not there yet.  That does not mean we are not preparing options to execute should they be needed.  The capacity remuneration mechanism is there for the medium to long term.  We can set signals to bring more people in but also to have more confidence in them delivering that pipeline. There are out-of-market options in the shorter term, one of which we are looking to exercise in securing winter capacity for this winter.  We believe that we have the power and, working collectively with EirGrid under its security of supply obligations and with the Department, there are sufficient options to mitigate risk.

Does Mr. Gannon agree that given the scares we had recently about the national grid and supply, what he said about significant portions of our energy going to data centres - I do not know whether this was unforeseen or not - and the predictable increase in the number of data centres that will be planned and built throughout the country, an out-of-market or publicly-run renewable energy company would be the best option?  It would make the commission's life easier and would guarantee supply, not just to industry and the economy, but to ordinary people who need to turn on the lights, to heat their homes and to have street lighting when they go out during the winter, and for hospitals and schools to run efficiently.  Would he agree that some kind of a publicly-run utility that absolutely controls the production and supply of energy is what we need, like the old Electricity Supply Board, ESB?<\/p> <p>  I noted the submission stated that the cost of our domestic electricity was the highest in the EU.  We used to have the lowest.  We had the lowest prices when the ESB was in charge and before it was all salamied away to various companies.  There is a problem with the model that states supply and demand will ensure efficiency.  It is essential, particularly in critical infrastructure like the production and distribution of power to run society, that the State should be the main renewable energy company.  The commission's representatives talked earlier about a developer-led offshore model, which would involve planning, design and development but they did not go on to say who would own and gain from it.  There was a time when ESB International returned a significant amount of revenue to the State from the operations of its production abroad.

The Deputy raised a very wide range of issues.  It should not be thought that I said or wrote at any point that we had the highest domestic electricity prices.  That is not the case.  We do not and the CRU would not say that.  Our electricity prices for domestic customers have tended to be in or around the euro area average over a number of years but that can go through cycles and we are on the higher end at the moment.  We have monopoly network companies that are State-owned and State-run.  We support that because in that instance there is a shareholder who is interested in making long-term investments for the benefit of consumers and society on the island.  We have that in place in terms of ESB Networks and EirGrid and the roles that they play on the island.<\/p> <p>  We also believe that competitive markets have a genuine role and are a real opportunity to add value for Irish customers.  Competition can deliver on value, choice and innovation in a way that monopoly companies struggle to.  People might look back to the days when prices were cheaper but, in reality, at that time in terms of our network we probably had one of the most challenging situations we ever experienced in that it had not been invested in for many decades.  That was why prices were kept low.  That is not good value for customers in the short or long term.  Our approach is to enable network investments that are critical for current and future customers, and their children, as we decarbonise the economy.  We will take those costs to pay for investments over time and to ensure that we continue to invest in our networks.  That has caused prices to increase over the last number of decades but for the right reasons and in the right ways so that we are supporting customers. <\/p> <p>  On gas as a transition fuel, and I agree gas is a fossil fuel and is not low carbon or renewable, we have the opportunity to decarbonise the gas system.  That is something we should be looking to do, especially as we are talking to the committee today about the importance of gas as a transition fuel and the importance of investing in new gas fire generation or potential new gas entry points or supply routes.  We are doing that with the opportunity of decarbonising that gas infrastructure in mind and continuing to add to the net-zero ambition we have for Ireland.  We think there is a real opportunity there.<\/p><p>That will be more in the medium to longer term, it is not there right now.  <br\/><br\/>On prepaid meters, on a day in March 2020 that was our last day in the office with our teams, we introduced two measures to support customers where we thought there might be real challenges.  We did not know what we were facing into or how long it would take to come out of the Covid situation.  We introduced a moratorium on disconnections and we also increased the gas prepay emergency credit from &euro;10 to &euro;100.  We did it on gas rather than electricity because the gas infrastructure is older.  The meters do not have a lot of flexibility and you cannot top up remotely, whereas with electricity you can.  That is why we took that special measure on gas.  We did so knowing it would be a lot harder to step out of it than it was to step into it but we thought it was the right thing to do because the idea of leaving customers, possibly unwell, in their homes, running out of gas with no ability to top up was just unconscionable so that is where we landed.  Yes, it has been harder for gas customers, particularly for some customers to top up.  We are really cognisant of that.  We are working with industry, with suppliers, on that.  They are genuinely trying to help their customers to build back up.  An upgrade in the gas systems has gone live, or will do so shortly, which will enable a little bit more flexibility, when you top up on your gas meter, on the division between new gas and repaying debt or building back up your emergency credit.  That is something we have been acutely aware of and are working on, not only with industry but also with our customer stakeholder group.  It includes the likes of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and the Money Advice &amp;amp; Budgeting Service, MABS, which really have their fingers on the pulse of the challenges customers face and we have listened very carefully to their input.  We recognise that is an important issue and we are working on it.  Hopefully we can continue to do better for customers in the future as we learn about that. <br\/><br\/>I will pass over to Mr. Gannon as part of the question related to &quot;out of market&quot; and markets versus the delivery of infrastructure in other ways<b>:<\/b><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021070600002#H00800","nonspeaker":"Ms Aoife MacEvilly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1625526000,"counter":401,"content":"<p>If I may interject, I am mindful of time.

First, we are an independent regulator but we work within the policy framework set nationally and by the EU.  Therefore, we do not set targets.  We see ourselves as implementing the targets that exist.  Equally, regarding property-proofing, we are not developing the policies and we are not looking at that aspect.  However, we try to be cognisant of the impact on customers and of trying to deliver those policies at least cost.  We have outlined that element in respect of competitive markets and incentives for networks to devise and deliver the best options.  As was mentioned, we focus particularly on customer choice and on ensuring that everybody has choices.  We try to ensure that it is not just a few people who can afford to make certain investments or have homes where decisions can be made concerning retrofitting or installing microgeneration equipment.<\/p> <p>  For those reasons, we felt that the smart metering project provided an opportunity for everyone across the island to have options to lower their bills, regardless of where they live or whether they own or rent their homes.  It is important to us that everybody has those choices.  Every household will be different in making those choices and in what will be regarded as tolerable, beneficial and useful.  The key theme for us, though, is to give customers choice and there are many choices they can make.  People can switch suppliers, renegotiate, switch to time-of-use tariffs, and there will be an increasing number of such choices over time.

Several areas of interest have been discussed.  I look forward as well to reading the written submissions on data centres.  I also welcome the invitation to provide input to the next strategic plan.  That is something our committee will do.<\/p> <p>  Turning to my questions, one concerns data centres.  It is alarming to think that one quarter of our national energy supply will go to one source of demand in ten years.  There was a discussion concerning whether energy could be sold back by those data centres at peak times.  Nonetheless, in respect of our capacity to create and deliver renewable energy in Ireland, even if these data centres run on renewable energy, it is still renewable energy and renewable energy infrastructure being directed into or through these data centres rather than towards changing and making the transition needed in our other national energy usage.  I am conscious there has been a great deal of discussion on energy and the intersection between the use of energy in households and data centres.<\/p> <p>  I turn to the issue of water, however.  I am conscious that the CRU is also the economic regulator of Irish Water and of water as a resource.  I ask the witnesses to comment on issues concerning water usage and regulation of the commercial extraction of water.  The CRU intersects with the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, which is the environmental regulator.  Therefore, how does the CRU engage in that endeavour, given the concerns around water usage?  How is the regulator seeking to ensure that policy choices made in respect of energy do not compromise water quality and water availability?  That relates to the offshore infrastructural aspect and water quality, but especially to data centres.  Is a review needed of commercial extraction?  Cooling is a major part of the operation of data centres and involves a great deal of water consumption.<\/p> <p>  I would also like the witnesses to comment on the centrality of natural gas in modelling future energy use, because I am concerned about that.  Has the CRU modelled a scenario whereby the exit from the use of fossil fuels including gas, and blue and brown hydrogen, will occur much sooner than we might think?  I ask the witnesses to comment specifically on the other forms of renewable gas such as clean hydrogen.  How can we adapt to a differentiated policy in that regard?  I refer to a situation where we may be willing to use clean hydrogen but not brown or blue hydrogen.  That nuance is going to be important.  I am referring to national supply in this area.  The interconnector is its own thing. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021070600002#K00600","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speech","time":1625526000,"counter":417,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021070600002#K00700","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speech","time":1625526000,"counter":418,"content":"<p>My final questions concern energy poverty.

Therefore, I would like the witnesses to comment on energy poverty-proofing in respect of measures such as time usage.  Turning to landlords, should there be a stick in respect of measures such as requiring higher building energy ratings, instead of just the carrots that are offered to industry?  Finally, the moratorium on electricity bills ended just last week.  As a result, many people have received extraordinarily high bills.  Prior to this, bills were based on estimated usage.  Now, however, the meters have been read and many customers are getting immensely costly bills at a time they are still under pressure.

We are the economic regulator for water.  Essentially, therefore, we regulate Irish Water and its activities.  Most importantly in that regard, we regulate how the company deals with its customers and the investment programme that it undertakes.  I refer to ensuring that investment programme represents value for money for all customers, in recognition of the fact that only approximately 25% of the revenues of Irish Water come from the non-domestic sector while most of its funding comes, in essence, from the Exchequer.  We do not, however, have a direct role concerning the commercial extraction of water.  It is not within our remit, though, the experience internationally is that water utilities have a substantial role to play in the energy transition.  Many of the facilities that water companies run have the potential to produce energy as a by-product from some of their processes.<\/p><p>In addition, because of the intensity of water production and wastewater treatment, water utilities potentially have a role to play on the demand side - for example, not using electricity at certain times if that is feasible.  These are things we will be looking to Irish Water to initiate and develop over time.  For the moment, it is probably fair to state that the real focus in terms of our economic regulation of water is bringing wastewater standards, the level of leakage and other matters up to what we would consider to be international norms from what is a relatively low base in the context of performance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021070600002#K01000","nonspeaker":"Dr. Paul McGowan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1625526000,"counter":422,"content":"<p>I will step in.  I thank the committee for the offer to contribute to our strategic plan.  We would genuinely welcome that.  It is very important for us to hear members' voices.<\/p> <p>  On the energy consumption side, a core element of our smart metering programme is that this is a customer-led transition.  It is around choice in bringing customers to, let us say for the sake of argument, time-of-use tariffs.  Over time, particularly for customers who have EVs, it will be really important to move them to time-of-use tariffs because the ability to use smart charging would be a critical element of demand-side management and avoiding peak load.  We also clearly recognise this is a choice and that certain customers, particularly those who are vulnerable, need to be protected in order that they have options.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the current situation, as members can imagine, meter-reading activities were halted for a period as a result of Covid-19 restrictions.  This meant that many customers faced estimated bills at a time when, if they were home with their families, working, living and engaging in educational activities, their electricity consumption may have increased.  We are aware, therefore, that many customers are receiving higher bills now catching up on that usage.  We are working very closely with the industry and our customer stakeholder group.<\/p> <p>  One key message relates to the energy engage code.  Customers who are engaging with their electricity suppliers will not be disconnected.  That is the key point.  If they are interested or willing to step into a payment plan in order that they have time to pay the cost over a period, that is absolutely encouraged.  In fact, we monitor and report on the number of payment plans that are entered into over time in our biannual reports.  We also offer prepay solutions for customers who are facing difficulty paying back.  There are many options for customers.  The critical thing is that they engage with their suppliers and find the option that works best for them.<\/p> <p>  The journey to decarbonised gas and the potential for green hydrogen is something that will be very interesting to watch, particularly, in the first instance, in the context of the new legislation that will be coming from the EU towards the end of this year.  That legislation will identify, from the EU perspective, the role of hydrogen in decarbonising not just our gas network but also industry and a range of other energy sectors throughout the Union.  That will help Ireland find its pathway.  It is absolutely the case because Great Britain has a hydrogen strategy.  We will be importing blue hydrogen for a period.  We will learn a huge amount from that.  That will be part of our safety activity in the context of the blending of gas quality and safety.  We will then have the opportunity to learn from that as to how we might move over time to green hydrogen and the opportunity that presents.  All that will be developed in the coming period.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021070600002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Aoife MacEvilly"},{"type":"speech","time":1625526000,"counter":423,"content":"<p>I was hoping for something much more specific.

I will ask some questions first, however.  I echo Senator Higgins's concern regarding the path to decarbonisation.  I am quite concerned that we are talking about decarbonising gas and not decarbonising energy.  It seems that we are stuck with a narrative that gas is a transition fuel.  Things are changing, however, and perhaps we are not changing our thinking quickly enough.  There is possibly an opportunity to see gas not so much as a transition fuel but as a means to decarbonise energy.  I am referring to the potential of offshore generation and the west coast.<\/p> <p>  It probably took everybody by surprise when the ESB announced its project, in conjunction with Equinor, for Moneypoint, which is due to come on stream in 2028.  I am concerned that the regulator is not carrying out the scenario analysis or modelling that would show how we can get to a quicker decarbonisation of our energy and that it might perhaps be too focused on the idea of gas as a transition fuel.  The fear we all have is that we will build new infrastructure for gas that will ultimately lead us to burning fossil fuels for the decades to come.  Perhaps our guests will comment on that.  Is a level of modelling that would reflect greater ambition and, perhaps, greater possibilities, given the significant moves that are happening internationally and within Ireland, being done?<\/p> <p>  I have a few quick questions relating to the role of the CRU.  The witnesses might confirm that the CRU is, under the relevant legislation, responsible for the security of electricity supply.  They might also confirm what is driving electricity price increases.  Is it gas or is it renewables?  They might speak to the legislation again and outline who the CRU is accountable to under the legislation.  This committee has an oversight role but is it the case that it can give the CRU some direction?  The witnesses might also speak to that matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021070600002#L00700","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1625526000,"counter":427,"content":"<p>I will kick off briefly on that.  First, we are accountable to this committee and to the relevant committee with responsibility for matters relating to water.  We are statutorily independent in the conduct of our functions and decision-making.  As a result, we do not seek or take directions from any entity or person.  We very much take on board, and have done in the past, the input, feedback and views of the committee.  That is why we have invited its feedback on this.  As I said, we work within an overarching policy framework.  We do not set policy but we are independent in our decision-making.<\/p> <p>  As Mr. Gannon outlined, we have specific statutory functions to ensure security of supply.  Again, we work within an overarching national and EU policy and legislative framework on that.  We also work closely with Eirgrid, which also has specific functions in this regard, particularly in our monitoring and reporting.<\/p> <p>  Regarding electricity prices, we have seen some underlying increases in wholesale costs, which Mr. Gannon may come in on.  In terms of the role of gas, I reiterate to the committee the statement we have made.  Natural gas is essential to security of supply and to the secure decarbonisation of the energy sector to 2030 and beyond.  We completely appreciate the view that we should not be investing in infrastructure and generation capacity that does not have a longevity beyond that point.  This is why we see the decarbonising of gas as supporting that.  We are already working on it.  We have not mentioned biomethane, for example.  We have the first inputs of renewable gas onto the system at the moment.<\/p><p>That is an option which has great potential in Ireland.  We will see some of that in the climate action plan.  We are also looking to the role of hydrogen.  The reality is that it is not a cheap alternative at the moment.  The price will come down over time but we are not in a position to say we can instantly switch to hydrogen or green hydrogen overnight.  From a safety and quality perspective, we must work through the extent to which we can blend green hydrogen or other colours of hydrogen, if you like, with our gas network in a manner that is safe, as well as ensuring a least-cost outcome.  I will hand over to Mr. Gannon who will pick up on some of the points I have made.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021070600002#L00800","nonspeaker":"Ms Aoife MacEvilly","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1625526000,"counter":429,"content":"<p>I will reinforce a point made by Ms MacEvilly.

We invite the committee to contribute to that new strategy.<\/p> <p>  As Ms MacEvilly has said, we speak to the decarbonisation of gas because we need to ensure security of supply through the transition.  The models we see in the industry, including the explorations of EirGrid and MaREI, based in University College Cork, and others, indicate that natural gas will frame part of that transition.  It will give us security of supply during the transition.  When we speak about the greening of that natural gas, it is to make sure that our pathway away from those more carbon-intensive molecules to less carbon-intensive molecules is accelerated.  Carbon capture and storage, CCS, and green hydrogen are only now at the stage when pilot projects at scale are taking place.  We will be able to look at the empirical evidence of those projects to say those are safe and cost-effective for the Irish consumer.

That technology is evolving more quickly than any of us expected.

We have a few minutes available now because I expected Senator Dooley to come back in and I will ask a few more questions in that time.  In her opening statement, Ms MacEvilly stated that the commission has allowed capital expenditure for EirGrid and ESB Networks to increase by &euro;1.3 billion to a total of over &euro;4 billion over the coming five-year period.  Perhaps she will speak more about that.  I do not know how much those companies asked for and perhaps they got everything they asked for, but perhaps they did not.  I invite Ms MacEvilly to speak more about that.<\/p> <p>  The programme for Government commitment on renewable electricity is a step up from the 2019 climate action commitment.  The 2019 plan referred to a target of 70% renewable electricity by 2030 whereas the programme for Government refers to \"at least 70%\".  What kind of flexibility exists in the regulator's planning if there is a possibility that we might push for 75%, 80% or 85%, which is possible because this is moving playing field?<\/p> <p>  My final question relates to microgeneration.  Perhaps Ms MacEvilly has already answered this question because the consultation has happened but we do not have a decision.  She might tell us her thoughts about the spillover price that small generators should receive.  What does she think is the appropriate price so that we will stimulate significant microgeneration across the grid?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021070600002#M00700","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1625526000,"counter":435,"content":"<p>I will round up the previous question by saying that I do not think what we were talking about was at odds with what the Chairman has said or that these matters are mutually exclusive.  We can combine ensuring security of supply with huge ambition for decarbonisation.  We truly believe that and I underline that point.<\/p> <p>  On the price review, we certainly did not give EirGrid and ESB Networks everything for which they asked.  They asked for a lot and they asked for it all up front.  On both operational and capital expenditure, we either cut what they were looking for, imposed efficiencies or implemented an agile investment framework.  Investments that are less clear at the outset are allowed to be brought in later if they proceed at pace, rather than paying for it all up front.  What we have done is a good balance.<\/p> <p>  The scale of what the network companies now have to deliver under that price control is enormous and it runs across the board, including putting smart metres into people's homes, the technology involved, building out the grid to enable and support electrification and some transport vehicles.  That is a real issue at the distribution level because we are going to be using electricity in different ways and at different times compared with what has been done before.  We are asking them to deliver significant additional network infrastructure.  It is important for people to understand that means transmission lines that will support both renewables and security of supply.  There is considerable ambition in that five-year price control.  We always knew it was a stepping stone to the next five years because it will step up again in the period to 2030.  We will continue to impose those efficiencies and incentives for the companies to deliver more, faster and with better value.  We also expect them to introduce innovation in the way they do it because they are going to need new technologies to deliver on some of the performance indicators.<\/p> <p>  The Chairman also asked about microgeneration.  I note again that the policy decision has not yet been taken by the Minister and the Department.  Our view is that the export guarantee should be around a market-based price.  We have not set a range of prices or made any analysis of that as yet.  We are awaiting the outcome of the decision but that is our view.<\/p><p>The economic driver and incentive to invest should not be from exports.  At least two thirds of a household microgeneration installation should deliver energy to that household so that it is getting cheap renewable electricity.  That is the key driver and incentive for investing in microgeneration.  The ability to export is a small additional payment that recognises the benefit of that microgeneration.  In fact, in many cases, we may also encourage customers to think about battery storage to power their microgeneration.  That electricity might be of greater benefit to them at peak times when it is being exported.  There would be different options around incentivisation for customers.  I will hand over to Mr. Gannon on the issue of targets.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021070600002#M00800","nonspeaker":"Ms Aoife MacEvilly","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1625526000,"counter":437,"content":"<p>Again, we share the ambition of the committee.

Going above that would be a further challenge but it is one that we would accept and take on board.  We would work with our markets, network companies and, on the demand side, consumers, to execute and put in place options around that.

We used to rely on thermal plant but we are now creating a market that allows us to rely on different technologies, such as batteries and static compensators, STATCOMs, which will give us a green alternative to the old thermal generations.

Its publication follows a five-year process of engagement with childminders and other stakeholders, and it commits to the extension of supports to and opportunities for childminders over the years ahead.  For the first time, it puts childminding at the heart of Government policy. <\/p> <p>  The national action plan sets out an incremental and supportive pathway to Government support and regulation for childminders, in line with commitments made in First 5, a whole-of-government strategy for babies, young children and their families.  A phased approach will provide a significant lead-in time for new requirements that will be introduced, while access to the national childcare scheme will be opened to childminders at the earliest possible opportunity to support parental choice.  Phase 1, which will last two to three years, is a preparatory phase that will include developing childminder-specific regulations and bespoke training for childminders, re-examining financial supports available for childminders, and further research and cost estimates.  Phase 1 will also involve further engagement and  consultation with childminders on the detailed planned reform measures, including regulations, as well as ensuring that childminders and parents are well informed about the reforms at the right time.  Phase 2, which will be a transitional phase, will last between three and five years.  Phase 3 will involve full implementation. <\/p> <p>  The phased approach acknowledges that the large majority of the estimated 15,000 childminders in Ireland today have had no experience of regulation or of State supports for their work.  The timeframe for the national action plan of more than eight years, the preparation and transition phases within the plan, and the flexibility in the timelines for moving between the three phases of the plan all recognise the need to move incrementally and ensure childminders are prepared for any reforms and supported in going through those reforms.  The phased approach is also intended to ensure there is time to develop and put in place the supports childminders will need. <\/p> <p>  Preparation of the national action plan has from the start involved childminders and the organisations that work closely with them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2021070600002#A00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Anne-Marie Brooks"},{"type":"speech","time":1625526000,"counter":445,"content":"<p>We seem to be experiencing some technical difficulties with Dr. Brooks's connection.

We recognise the importance of involving childminders if we are to ensure that measures undertaken are proportionate and appropriate for childminders, are achievable, and retain childminders&rsquo; support and participation throughout this process of reform.  To this end, the national action plan includes a commitment to include childminders on the steering group and advisory groups for the plan.  Furthermore, one of those advisory groups will focus specifically on consultation and communications, and consultation with childminders will continue during development of the regulations.  The steering group for the national action plan is in the process of being established and will hold its first meeting next week. <\/p> <p>  The approach we are taking recognises the many benefits of quality childminding but also recognises the challenges ahead.  A central challenge will be ensuring regulations for childminders are proportionate.  Care will be needed in ensuring regulations are appropriate to the home and family context in which childminders work while at the same time providing safeguards to protect children and to provide assurance for parents of the quality of the care their children will receive.  It will take time to get this right. <\/p> <p>  One regulatory issue that was unresolved in the 2018 working group report was the appropriate training requirement for childminders to register with Tusla, the statutory regulator.<\/p><p>The national action plan commits to a balanced and phased approach, with foundation-level training as a prerequirement for registration and delivery of training in formats that are suited to childminders.  Once the new regulations are in place and the Child Care Act 1991 is amended to allow childminders to register with Tusla, childminders will be able to take part in the national childcare scheme and other supports.<\/p><p> The approach proposed in the national action plan will bring Ireland in line with approaches to childminding across Europe.  Childminding is already successfully regulated in three quarters of European countries.  In many, childminders have to undertake specific training, though at a foundation level.  In some countries, such as France, Denmark and the Netherlands, childminding makes up a large proportion of regulated provision of early learning and care, especially for children under three years of age.  Our steering group will include representation from other jurisdictions that have successfully achieved what we want to achieve.  Drawing on international experience, research evidence on outcomes for children and extensive consultation, the national action plan aims to improve quality, affordability and access to early learning and care, and school-age childcare, through childminding.

From both the perspective of a provider and a regulator, we welcome the opportunity to discuss this policy.<\/p> <p>  There is little doubt that an increasing body of research demonstrates the value to children and families of the provision of quality, accessible, flexible and supported childcare options.  This has been matched over the past decade with an enormous change in the landscape of provision for early years' care.  Some 4,184 providers were registered with Tusla at the end of April this year.  The majority of these are now operating within, and inspected under, the regulatory provisions established in 2016.  There is little doubt that this is a sector that has transformed in a decade and our evidence, supported by research, continues to demonstrate an increasingly compliant sector working to very high standards.<\/p> <p>  There is also no doubt that with regulation comes challenges.  When I last addressed this subject matter at this committee's predecessor in late 2019, shortly after taking up the post of Tusla chief executive officer, CEO, the sector had again come through a period of intense commentary and focus.  This centred on what regulation could and could not achieve with the resulting challenges for all of society but, most notably, parents, for whom choice of day care for their children can feature among the most significant decisions they make.  It is important to recognise from that period that regulation, while driving improvement, can never guarantee absolute compliance or fail-safe services.  We have, and are likely to see in future, failings, poor standards and shortcomings in a small number of situations.<\/p> <p>  At that time, I committed to undertaking changes to improve our engagement and support for parents.  Since that time, we have introduced a parental feedback process to enable parents to provide us with information related to the service their children attend.  They can now give us this information at inspection time or at any time.  We now also publish the date inspection was undertaken, even before the reports are published, so parents are aware that an inspection of their child's service has taken place.  We also committed to undertake research to learn more about how we are doing and have published and shared across differing forums the following three reports in February of this year: Tusla Early Years Inspections-Parents Consultation; Report of Early Years Inspection Reports 2018-2019: Analysis and Trends; and Report of the Early Years Regulatory Enforcement Process-Outcomes.<\/p> <p>  At the end of 2019, most providers were coming to the end of their first three-year registration cycle under the 2016 regulations and, in the main, were successfully re-registered as the year closed.  The challenges experienced by the sector, for parents and public confidence, led to a narrative at the time of re-registration of a sector that was over-regulated, when four months earlier the suggestion was that it was under-regulated.  This is an important context as we now face the next seven years of the plan for childminding.<\/p> <p>  Childminding, mainly provided by a person in his or her own home to children coming to him or her, is the last remaining modality of early years' care required to be addressed in detailed policy, not just regulation.  The plan is welcome for this reason in that it brings to life an incremental approach to policy in action.  With some estimating that 15,000 non-relative childminding arrangements are in place today, as referenced in the policy document, the option clearly is meeting a need.  Tusla fully supports the plan, which aims to strengthen recognition of these minders, support the choice of parents who use childminding, make it affordable, increase access and enhance quality of provision.  Parents, communities and society as a whole benefit from these improvements, but particularly children.  Childminding and formal early years' settings, such as cr&egrave;ches and preschools, do not need to be a stark either-or contrast but simply more of a mix and range of options, all supported and encouraged to improve in a sensible and regulated context.<\/p> <p>  Childminding, regardless of the setting, relies on the skill and dedication of the people doing the minding.  Whether trained childcare workers in formal early years' settings or childminders in the home, recognition of the importance of the work, reflected in terms, conditions, opportunities and training, must also be at the fore of any policy approach to this sector.  While not the primary concern of Tusla as a regulator, it is of concern to all that the importance of this work is not underestimated.  <\/p> <p>  We are very conscious that childminding environments have several important elements that set them apart from other types of early years' provision.  Childminders usually operate from family homes and cater for much smaller numbers of children compared with other settings.  It is important that a homely environment is maintained and that the fabric of the home is not fundamentally altered.  We welcome the development and implementation of regulations, which will acknowledge the unique circumstances in which childminding services operate and at the same time ensure that those services provide consistently high-quality and safe environments for the children who attend them. <\/p> <p>  There are currently 84 registered childminders and we look forward to building this number through engagement over the coming years as we prepare for the future regulation of the service.  We believe this will be of benefit to parents and children and that there are many benefits that registration can provide.  The reality is that with 84 registered out of a much larger number, there is clear need for this overall plan not only to recognise this sector but to ensure the greatest possible benefit to children. <\/p> <p>  Prior to the publication of our quality regulatory framework for childminders in 2018, we engaged with Childminding Ireland, childminders and parents in its development.  This resource clearly sets out how Tusla assesses childminders for compliance with current regulation.  Our annual and inspection analysis reports published on our website show that childminders are found compliant with most regulations.  This, we hope, is an encouragement to the many childminders who will come within the scope of regulation over the life of this plan.  In 2020 we introduced an e-learning programme on the quality regulatory framework for providers, stakeholders and students.  To date, out of 8,674 who have undertaken the online training, 8,000 are staff working in services of whom 74 are childminders.<\/p><p>This approach is one that Tusla is committed to pursuing where we are a regulator clearly focused on enabling continuous improvement.<\/p><p> In 2020 we undertook a review of the registration, regulation, inspection and enforcement of the childminding sector in six international jurisdictions.  The findings from the review identified that there is a range of approaches to the regulation of childminding and differing requirements, for example, in qualifications and training.  These findings, combined with our understanding of the Irish childminding context, will support us to ensure that the registration and inspection of childminders in Ireland is proportionate, effective and consistent in assessing the care and safety of children in a childminder's home.  Home-based care, as distinct from centre-based care, will be possible to regulate and inspect.  However, we need to have a conversation about what we expect from regulation.  If it is based on an absolute guarantee with no faults - a complete risk averse approach - then it will likely fail and remove the very aspiration of the policy, which is care in a relationship-based home-from-home family life environment.  If, however, it is based on reasonable measurable standards, recognising the home environment and focused on the care and well-being of the child, it is likely to lead to a high quality, strong and sustainable option for parents and children into the future.  Tusla, as an agency with a direct interest in child welfare and family support and as an early years regulator, welcomes the action plan being advanced by the Minister and we will play an active part in its development and implementation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2021070600002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Bernard Gloster","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1625526000,"counter":456,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Gloster.

I will start with the first question around resources for childminders working in the parent's home.  The Senator is correct that the main focus of the national action plan is on self-employed childminders working in the childminder's home but it commits to develop information and training resources for those who are working in the parent's home.<\/p> <p>  The Senator asked for the details.  I suppose the details of this and of many aspects of the plan are still to be worked out during phase 1 and there will be consultation during phase 1.<\/p> <p>  The focus is primarily on childminders working in the childminder's home.  I suppose we are cautious about placing too many restrictions on parents' freedom to make private arrangements and, in particular, there would be significant challenges in regulating childminding in the child's home.  If the childminder is working from the childminder's home, the childminder is typically self-employed and offers a service, and it is accessed effectively on a public basis.  Someone caring for a child in the child's home is an employee of the child's parents and may carry out a range of duties, not only childminding but cleaning or other domestic duties, and, because the childminder works in the parents' home rather than the childminder's home, the childminder cannot be held responsible for the safety or suitability of that home for the purpose of early learning or childcare.  It is an area where we have to move cautiously.  We have not ruled out the possibility of further future supports in that area but the next step is the regulation and support of self-employed childminders.  We acknowledge there is a big challenge ahead in doing what we are setting out to do in the national action plan and I suppose that is the next few years of activity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2021070600002#C00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Toby Wolfe"},{"type":"speech","time":1625526000,"counter":462,"content":"<p>We await the regulations on that and what supports, if any, will be outlined.

In the course of that working group and the report that it developed, there was quite significant engagement in surveys with parents and with Childminding Ireland members, discussion days with childminders and consultation with children themselves.<\/p> <p>  In the process of developing the draft national action plan, there was also a considerable range of public consultation activities, including an open call for submissions, online surveys with childminders and surveys with parents.  There were focus groups undertaken in every city and county childcare committee, CCC, area throughout the country.  There were 32 focus groups in total in which 205 childminders attended and there was an open policy debate.  All of that culminated in the finalisation of the national action plan for childminding.  There is a commitment in the action plan to continue that level of engagement and consultation with childminders and we have already commenced that process of continued engagement and consultation.<\/p> <p>  What the consultation findings told us in preparing the plan is that there was broad strong support for the direction of travel.  There was broad support for the introduction of regulations to childminders.  There was broad support for the extension of State-funded supports to childminders.  There was support for the commitments to develop staff local networks for childminders and very strong support in opening up the national childcare scheme to all childminders who meet requirements making childcare more affordable to parents who use this form of childcare.<\/p> <p>  Clearly, with the scale of reform that is planned over the duration of this plan, there are concerns among childminders.

I wish to make a few comments.  I have read the opening statement and briefing note.  I have a query regarding the foundation training and the threshold at which one becomes subject to regulation.  I know that there are various legislative measures dating back to 1991 and there has been an overhauling of things.  At what point does one become a childminder officially subject to regulation and officially required to undertake foundation training?  In every village there are people who are doing this work on an industrial scale.  Some of them have gone the whole hog and have opened a full cr&egrave;che.  There are also other childminders who take on six or seven children.  I understand what category they fall into.  There is usually someone two or three doors down from your home who is excellent with children who they have minded for many years.  Subjecting them to foundation training or whatever type of regulation may be coming down the line may have the unintended effect of causing some of them to exit the sector.  Is there a threshold at which one is or is not a childminder in the eyes of the State?  I ask Mr. Wolfe to respond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2021070600002#D00800","speaker":"1519"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1625526000,"counter":472,"content":"<p>I am happy to answer that question.  I wish to clarify, at the outset, that some childminders are already subject to regulation if they look after four or more preschool children or seven or more children of any age.  As Mr. Gloster pointed out, it is on that basis that there are a number of childminders who are already registered and regulated.<\/p> <p>  What is proposed in the action plan is to extend regulation to all paid non-relative childminders who are working in the childminder's home, which will require the amendment of primary legislation, that is, the Child Care Act 1991, as well as the introduction of childminder-specific regulations.  The detail of what the regulations will look like and the exact wording of any proposed amendment to the Child Care Act is still to be worked out.  In terms of the threshold of who will meet the definition of childminder subject to regulation, the intention is that it will be all childminders who work in the childminder's home, are non-relatives and are paid.  It is a similar basis to the threshold used in other jurisdictions that have already gone down the road of regulating childiminding.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2021070600002#D00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Toby Wolfe"},{"type":"speech","time":1625526000,"counter":473,"content":"<p>I get that there is a need for a structure and regulation.  However, the worry I have is that women in villages who have minded children all their lives very adeptly, and with love and care, may look at this and decide that it is time for them to leave the stage.  That is a major concern for me.<\/p><p>To move things on a small bit, the discussion we are having here aligns to the home help sector.  I ask the members to allow me to elaborate.  There is a shortage of childminders and home helpers.  I am not being sexist when I say it, but it is a fact that the vast majority of individuals providing childcare and home help services are female.  I know many of who have gone into the home help profession in County Clare.  Many of them, particularly in the home help sector, find the taxation regime prohibitive.  The same could be the case in the childcare sector if childminders are required to be registered.  It has often suited people to take on childminding work at a certain time of day to enable them to be free in the afternoon when their own children may be coming home from school or secondary school.  The taxation regime, however, means that they go unregulated.  They will continue to fall outside the net because the taxation regime simply offers no incentive for them to go on the books.<\/p><p>The other point I wish to make concerns the early childhood care and education, ECCE, scheme.  The ECCE scheme is a major function in child education and for many families it is almost a kind of childminding.  Currently, to qualify for the scheme, the child must be aged two years and eight months in the September of the qualifying year.  That is prohibitive.  I am helping a family at the moment with their case.  The child is two weeks outside of that threshold.  It stymies all of their plans to get that child into early childhood education and on to school.  <\/p><p>Finally, there should be some discussion relating to morning clubs and after-school childcare.  I was a primary school teacher until I was elected to the D&aacute;il.  The provision of such childcare happens in many schools on an<i>ad hoc<\/i>basis.  Some have hugely embraced it and others have not.  It is a major type of childcare in most villages and towns.  Parents know that their children will be with their buddies before and after school, the environment is safe and controlled, homework will be done and the children will probably get a snack.  The provision of these clubs is very <i>ad hoc<\/i>and hit and miss.  Some parents are taking their children out of one school and moving them to another because that facility is there.  I want to pick the witnesses' brains.  Has there been any high-level discussion on the provision of such facilities becoming more uniform across the country?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2021070600002#D01000","speaker":"1519"},{"type":"speech","time":1625526000,"counter":474,"content":"<p>Before the witnesses respond, I must point out that the engagement concerns childminding.

That is clearly something we want to avoid.  The incremental and phased approach set out in the plan is intended to keep childminders in the sector and bring them with us on the journey.  As part of that, there is a commitment in the action plan to review and reform the financial supports that are available to childminders.  A range of supports is already in place.  Tax relief is available in certain circumstances for some childminders.  The Department has also run some grant schemes.  We will be reviewing those.  <\/p> <p>  What the national plan opens up as a significant change in terms of the financial supports for childminders is the possibility of accessing the national childcare scheme.  Up to this point, because the scheme requires that a provider is registered with Tusla, the large majority of childminders and the parents who use those childminders have been precluded from accessing the national childcare scheme.  The action plan changes that.  It will mean that when childminders have done the foundation training and meet the initial requirements for registration, they can register with Tusla and will then be able to enter the national childcare scheme at the earliest opportunity.  The parents will be able to avail of subsidies.  We think that is a positive incentive for childminders.  If we do not do it now, there is a risk that those childminders will lose out over time.  Parents may vote with their feet and move away from childminding towards centre-based provision that is in the national childcare scheme.  It is essential that the action plan opens up that up to ensure that there is an equal opportunity for childminders to take part in the national childcare scheme.

During the pandemic things have been extremely hard.  We have to appreciate the way our childcare providers and childminders have stepped up to the mark.  They have played an essential role during the Covid-19 pandemic.  We must recognise that.  For young families to succeed, childcare must be affordable and accessible.  I welcome how the witnesses are committed to the ongoing learning and are listening to providers, parents and guardians.<\/p><p> I also welcome the establishment of the steering group, although the urgency of this is really important.  It has been mentioned that the steering group will include representation from other jurisdictions.  Could the witnesses tell the committee which jurisdictions these will be?  With that in mind, how helpfully will the national action plan draw on international experience in this field?<\/p><p> This is a vital sector and must be supported fully to provide high-quality childcare with proper regulations and inspections.  According to the Big Start campaign, however, Ireland's early years system is not working for parents.  It is failing the educators, essentially underfunding childcare, and has led to a lack of options for educators who leave the sector, providers who close their doors and parents and guardians who cannot afford childcare.  This is the biggest issue we have to face.  I know there has been a significant increase in funding, and I welcome the ambitious First 5, but Ireland still has one of the most underfunded childcare systems in Europe, failing to meet the EU average in respect of the United Nations Children&rsquo;s Fund, UNICEF, targets for investment.  We have among the highest childcare costs in the OECD, amounting to over half the average wage in Ireland.  Despite qualifications, most early years professionals earn below the living wage of &euro;12.30 per hour.  Funding is a massive issue.  I always welcome steering groups and reports, but we have to be practical too.  We have to make sure that childcare is affordable and that the people who need to access it are able to do so.<\/p><p> We have spoken about Tusla.  When do the witnesses see the issue of training requirements for childminders to register with Tusla being resolved?<\/p><p> Another thing I have always spoken about is State childcare.  I always wonder whether we have looked at it seriously.  With this plan, is there a clear pathway for educators, a clear guide to supports for providers struggling to sustain businesses under significant administration, inspections and regulation demands, increasing commercial rates and insurance costs, and a clear ambition to give families the confidence that we are aiming to get this right?

Opening access to the national childcare scheme is a measure to address affordability and to start to address childcare costs for parents who use childminding options but there is a wider piece of work under way.  Deputy Murnane O'Connor recognises the First 5 strategy.  In First 5 there is a pledge to double investment in early learning and care and school-age childcare by 2028, rising to just under &euro;1 billion by 2028.  A funding model is currently under development.  That will become the vehicle to allocate that additional funding to support the objectives of achieving greater affordability, improving quality and addressing issues such as disadvantage and access for certain groups of children.  An expert group has been in place since October 2019.  That group continues to meet.  It is chaired by a former Secretary General of the Department of Health and the work of the group will come to conclusion at the end of this year.  There has been very significant stakeholder engagement on the new funding model, how we might achieve greater affordability and how we will support quality.  Core to that are the issues the Deputy mentions - the workforce and pay and conditions - and the report of the expert group is due at the end of this year.  It will examine how additional funding should be targeted to achieve those objectives of affordability, accessibility and quality.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2021070600002#E00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Anne-Marie Brooks"},{"type":"speech","time":1625526000,"counter":483,"content":"<p>Deputy Dillon, are you on campus, either in Leinster House or in the convention centre?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2021070600002#E00600","speaker":"1449"},{"type":"speech","time":1625526000,"counter":484,"content":"<p>I am remotely logged in.

There is a second question which I will read out in a moment.<\/p> <p>  My question is about the regulation and how it will be implemented.  I have been an adviser in corporate governance and management to the childcare services for a number of years, and one of the repeated experiences of childcare services is that when they get repeat inspections, something that had been fine in the previous inspection is suddenly not all right in the next inspection.  Even though we are operating out of the same regulations, a matter such as an arrangement of a door can come up in the second inspection as being an issue when it was bypassed in the previous one or found to be fine.  There is an inconsistency in the application of inspection.  Furthermore, what is recorded as a breach by the inspectorate will be a matter that was trivial and rectified or explained there and then when the inspectorate was in the childcare service.  With that as the background, the bringing of an inspection regime into childminding makes me a little nervous.  I take great comfort in Mr. Gloster's words that we cannot be so risk-averse and that there is a lot of engagement and thought on this.  Given, however, that this is minding children in the home, I am fearful of what this will look like.  If Mr. Gloster could discuss where his thinking is on that, I would really appreciate it.<\/p> <p>  I will pull out Deputy Dillon's second question in a moment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2021070600002#E01100","speaker":"1682"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1625526000,"counter":489,"content":"<p>The majority of those questions are probably for Tusla in the first instance.  As for the cyberattack, I do not have all the notes in front of me but it is very live in my head.  Regarding the recovery phase for Tusla, the first thing was to recover basic connectivity for people to be able to operate email and to be able to connect with one another in and out through the system.  We operate across nine HSE platforms or domains, and seven of the nine were successfully restored over two weeks ago with some intermittent challenges.<\/p><p>Two others, in the north west and the north east, took a little longer but are now moving closer to recovery.  Moreover, our devices had to be cleaned, or greened as it is called, and a substantial programme was undertaken.  In the case of Tusla, there are in excess of 5,000 devices, and we are now probably just a couple of hundred short of having certified them as not corrupted in any way.<\/p><p> The main concern for Tusla is one I discussed with the Senator's colleagues, Deputy Whitmore and others, during the course of the attack and when I wrote to committee members.  Our main case management system, namely, the national childcare information system, is back up and running and social workers are able to use it, as of a little over a week ago.  I want to be clear and to reflect the concern of members when I say that system was badly damaged, which is why it took so long to get it back.  When it came back, I was concerned that week as to whether we would be able to retrieve it unsuccessfully.  We rebuilt it from a back-up, and our ICT team, who are expert in it, and the HSE ICT team worked night and day to get it back from the back-up.  The original database we were using was damaged by the encryption attack, the sudden and necessary shutdown of the HSE system and the decryption process, all of which combined to cause damage to the database and render it unusable.  We do not have evidence of exfiltration of any information from it, thankfully, but it certainly challenged us to get it back.<\/p><p> All our smaller systems are, in the main, back up and running, although there are some issues with internal file shares and other systems.  I will go not go through the entire list, but one in particular remains outstanding for us.  It relates to the external portal by which members of the public make referrals to us.  Coincidentally, given that we have been talking about our early years service, our early years service interacts with all the preschool providers through that external portal for registration and other purposes.  Ms McDonnell, who is in attendance today, and her team have worked exceptionally hard to continue to support people manually to work through that.  At the moment, the best advice I have suggests the external portal will probably not be available until the start of August.  It is connected with a dependency on the Internet, which is in turn connected with a security concern for the system, which has to be slowly brought back in steps.  If I can assist members with any other information on the attack, I will be happy to do so.  I have provided a global picture of where we are.  We are still challenged but we have got an awful lot back.<\/p><p> As for how regulation is to be implemented, inconsistency on repeat inspections can happen anywhere.  I have for years worked in every part of the social care system in Ireland, which is regulated now, and I have seen exactly what the Senator was talking about.  I have seen it from the points of view of both the regulated and the regulator.  I might ask Ms McDonnell, who has an established expertise in inspection and manages the service, to address how that inconsistency can happen and why small breaches are recorded, even if they are rectified at the time.  The research we have published this year shows that by the time we come to publish our inspection report, 85% of either breaches or drops below the standard of compliance detected on inspection will have been corrected.  It shows a continuing improvement and that they result from the regulatory environment.<\/p><p> Ms McDonnell might address the issue of inconsistency.  Before I pass to her, so as not to hold up the committee, I will point out that the Senator is quite right and I thank her for picking up the observation.  As I stated, regulation is good and important, but if we are not sensible in how we develop it or sensible and judicious in how we apply it, it can give rise to these types of challenges and problems.  That is why the Department's commitment to tailoring a specific regulatory environment for childminding is important, given that the current regulatory regime is quite difficult to apply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2021070600002#E01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Bernard Gloster","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1625526000,"counter":491,"content":"<p>Tusla is no different from any other regulator in that the main difficulty in regulation always relates to the standardisation of practices.

With the quality regulatory framework we published in 2018 that relates specifically to childminders, we broke down the regulations and were able to state clearly what we were looking for against each regulation.  That is there as a guide for us, parents and providers and it is clear what we are looking for, so it goes some way towards standardisation.

Those who have engaged with Tusla will, in general, have already committed to raising professional standards in childcare and will welcome the appropriate regulation.

Given that childminding works for tens of thousands of families throughout the State, there is a fear that over-regulation could disrupt these ongoing casual arrangements.

We are working hard with the Department to use our knowledge and experience to ensure those regulations are sensible and applicable.  When it comes to the overall mix of how a community and a family and children mix and connect with one another and are cared for, the last thing we want to do is create an environment that drives people away from that.  It is much more about improving the quality.  The officials from the Department might pick up that point.<\/p><p>On the issue of the resources currently available to children's service regulation and what that might look like in the future, were we suddenly to have an explosion in registration of thousands of people, I will ask Dr. Cullen to pick up on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2021070600002#F00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Bernard Gloster","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1625526000,"counter":496,"content":"<p>In response to Deputy Ward's question regarding resources, I want to reassure him by giving him an example of the resourcing we currently have in place within Tusla.

That took place over the period during which Tusla was established from 2014 onwards, which is also the period in which we have seen increased regulation.  I will try to ground that in some figures.  In 2017, which is only four years ago, we had 37 staff in place who had responsibility for inspection and regulation of the early years sector.  Staff numbers have increased by 100 up to 2021.

I want to make it clear that the Department shares the Deputy's concern.  The risk of driving childminders out is one of the main factors that has shaped the approach we have taken in the national action plan.  The approach set out is intended to be supportive and to help to bring childminders with us on what will be a challenging and new journey for them.  The approach is incremental and phased.  The initial training bar is deliberately set very low.  The issue of financial supports to childminders, which has been discussed briefly already, is to be reviewed.  It is important to emphasise that there is a strong focus in the action plan on engagement with childminders, in particular local level engagement.  The national action plan commits to developing an infrastructure of supportive local networks across the country.  We know from experience here and in other jurisdictions that the most effective way of engaging and supporting childminders is to do so at that local level.  In terms of the detail of what exactly the local networks will look like, there is a commitment that during phase 1, we will research, develop and pilot a new model of local support networks, which will then be rolled out.

There are 15,000 childminders in this country, which is a huge number of people involved and very disparate and working individually.  I am pleased to hear that there are plans for local networks.  That will be critical.  Of the 15,000 childminders, to date how many have been engaged with?  I know there are some representative groups, but I am interested in knowing how many of the 15,000 childminders have been engaged with.  I know from my engagement with people that childminders are to become part of a very informal system and that they will be in that system for a few years while their own children and families are at a certain stage in their lives.  I would imagine it will be very difficult to get them engaged in a process that they think will be six or seven years away.  How many childminders have been engaged with?  If the witnesses could elaborate on the plans for that engagement it would be useful.<\/p> <p>  My next question in regard to the national childcare scheme.  Currently, approximately 88,000 children are being cared for by childminders.  In terms of cost, has an analysis been done of the additional cost to the national childcare scheme if those children are brought into the net?  On resourcing, Tusla has had difficulties with its IT system, as outlined to us during a previous meeting with it.  At that time, Tusla was already in a process of redeveloping that system.  Is it proposed to undertake advanced development in regard to bringing childminders into the system?  We do not want to get to the end of the six or seven-year timeframe and find that the IT system needs to be further developed and thus cause further delay.

In relation to work to develop and launch the national action plan, there was engagement with 850 childminders.  Among other stakeholders and representatives, there was engagement with 850 childminders through a range of activities, including focus groups, surveys, calls for submissions and discussion days.  We have engaged with a considerable number of those involved heretofore.  As set out in the plan, we have a strong commitment to senior level engagement and consultation.  As mentioned, a steering group is soon to be established.  The first meeting of that group will take place next week.  The group will include childminding representation.  There will also be four advisory groups established under the steering group structure to work on a range of activities.  One of the advisory groups will look specifically at communication and consultation and assist with the development of an intensive communications and consultation strategy.<\/p> <p>  In the process of us moving forward to convene the steering group and to identify childminders to contribute to that group and also to identify childminders who are in a position to contribute to the advisory groups and other consultation activities that will happen over the course of phase 1 and beyond in the course of implementing the plan we currently have an expression of interest active inviting childminders to register with us to be involved in the various structures that are being established and to signal their interest in continued engagement through focus group activities or other mechanisms that will be set up over the course of the action plan.  We have already received over 50 expressions of interest from childminders nationally.<\/p> <p>  On the national childcare scheme, the national action plan sets out an initial costings for phases 1, 2 and 3 of the implementation of the plan.  Clearly, these are initial costings and in phase 1 we will sit down to re-examine those costs in light of further analysis and data collection.  There are initial costs of extending the national childcare scheme to childminders and an upper and lower cost based on various assumptions of the number of childminders who will be subject to regulation.  The cost ranges from &euro;14 million to &euro;33 million, depending on the numbers of childminders who will be regulated and the number of children accessing supports.  That cost is also based on there being no change in the level of uptake of the national childcare scheme and no increased demand or increased intensity of use.  The current estimate is &euro;14 million to &euro;33 million.

Since 2018 and the implementation in 2019 of the school age registration, we have registered 1,169 of these providers.  This gives us approximately 5,353 providers registered with us.  The majority of these come through the portal.  This requires certain policies, a certain amount of information and Garda vetting.  This happens at the registration office.  What happens at present is we do a fit-for-purpose inspection and register the services.  They are inspected again over a three-year period once or twice depending on need.  The inspections are risk based.  In the plan for childminders we are speaking about three times this number, which is 15,000 providers.  It will be a decision of all of the working groups the Department has spoken about this afternoon as to what will be required to register.  We will advocate that it be simple and clear.  We will also advocate that a certain amount of first aid training is done before childminders register with us.  All of this will be decided through the working groups.  When we did our piece looking at inspection internationally, we found much variety and variation in Europe and throughout the world.  It could be that providers will carry out a self-audit.  There are many options to make inspections more approachable for the providers so it is a home from home.  We are working on all of this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2021070600002#H00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Fiona McDonnell"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1625526000,"counter":511,"content":"<p>To come back to ICT resourcing, the Deputy and I had a long conversation during the cyberattack.

Deputy Dillon would like to know from the departmental officials what are the plans to increase the funding available to national organisations under the Department's remit?  Have the Minister and the Department committed to additional funding pathways?  The coming period will be a time of real change attempting to move tens of thousands of childminders into a regulated system.  Deputy Dillon states childminders must be supported and engaged with at this time.<\/p> <p>  I have a follow-up question to my earlier contribution.  I also want to say thanks for the huge amount of work that has been done.  This is very clear and obvious from the answers of everybody.  When the childminding representative groups came before the committee one in particular spoke about how seven years is too ambitious.  I recoiled in horror because in the context of remote working and everything else, we really need a flexible childminding response.  I see this as being a very clear pathway to this.

Whether with regard to a policy or regulatory framework, seven years is quite a generous time.  I recognise what representatives of the sector would say about the enormous challenge depending on its scale.  What is particularly positive about this policy document is that it is now an articulated action plan that has a lot of sensibility built into it.

With regard to costs and funding, the national action plan sets out indicative costs and initial cost estimates for some of the infrastructural developments that need to be put in place to support the implementation of the plan.  There are some initial estimates on regulation and inspection, training support, quality supports and supports to enhance research and data.  Again, they are all initial estimates.  We are in phase 1 of a process.  We will have to revisit these estimates based on new data and emerging evidence.  We are looking to update these cost estimates to assess the level and the size and scale of funding needed to enhance the infrastructure that must be put in place to support implementation of the national action plan.<\/p> <p>  Separately and in parallel, a review is under way in the Department of the operating model for the early learning care and school childcare sector.  This is being overseen by an oversight group.<\/p><p>We have engaged independent consultants to support us in that work which involves reviewing the current operating model for early learning and care and school-age childcare, having regard to reforms and actions committed to in the First 5 strategy over the next number of years and how the operating model may need to be reformed and enhanced such that we can deliver on those actions and commitments.  The oversight group and the consultants are aware of the national action plan and other reforms that are committed to in the First 5 strategy and will take account of that in the context of their recommendations around enhancements or changes to the operating system for the broader sector.  That work may also identify other supports or functions needed.<\/p><p> On the pace of implementation and whether we are being too ambitious, a balance has been struck in that we are not moving too slowly given the importance of opening up access to the national childcare scheme for parents who choose childminding and addressing their childcare costs, but also not moving too quickly to risk driving childminders out and to give us the time necessary to develop the supports that are needed to make this plan a success.  We believe we have struck a good balance in terms of the time we have set out.  We have left flexibility between phases to allow us to readjust and to revisit the phases and the timing of implementation.  The steering group, which will meet next week, will report progress to the Minister annually.

I am pleased, therefore, to introduce the following draft order to this committee, the Technological Universities Act 2018 (Section 36) (Appointed Day) Order 2021.  Under the Technological Universities Act 2018, an appointed day for the establishment of a technological university and its name in both English and Irish, shall be made by order.  The order must be approved by resolution of each House of the Oireachtas and I thank the committee for this opportunity to discuss the matter.<\/p> <p>  I wish to set 1 October 2021 as the appointed day for the establishment of a new technological university to be known in English as the Technological University of the Shannon: Midlands Midwest and Ollscoil Teicneola&iacute;ochta na Sionainne: L&aacute;r T&iacute;re, An tIarthar L&aacute;ir in the Irish language.  The establishment of a third technological university in the State is another important milestone for higher education in Ireland and, in particular, for the midlands and mid-west.  The merging of Athlone Institute of Technology, AIT, and Limerick Institute of Technology, LIT, creates a new step-change institution of sufficient size, capacity and critical mass to maximise its potential and deliver significant additional benefits to the region. <\/p> <p>  The Government has a clear ambition to create a series of interlinked higher education institutions of greater capacity and reach across all regions of the country to help deliver on our key national strategic objectives.  Technological universities, TUs, are a key component in this strategic approach, providing increased reach, international recognition, greater research capacity, enhanced foreign direct investment, FDI, attraction, skills creation and retention, regional development, enhanced staff and student experiences and opportunities and advanced socio-economic progression.  Uniquely, TUs provide higher education programmes at all levels of the national framework of qualifications, NFQ, from apprenticeships right up to doctoral degrees.  This attribute provides significant additional opportunities for individuals, students and staff and wider stakeholders, to learn, innovate, undertake research and operate to their maximum capabilities in their own region.<\/p> <p>  From October, the new technological university of the shannon: midlands midwest will start its journey and drive the agendas of higher education access, excellence in teaching and learning, regional development, research-informed educational provision and strengthened linkages with industry and the community.  This is a transformational event for the people of the midlands and the mid-west.  The benefits of technological universities are many faceted and we see how they can transform regions elsewhere.  I very much look forward to this new technological university bringing those benefits to counties Clare and Limerick, through County Tipperary, up the Shannon and across the midlands to Athlone and beyond.<\/p> <p>  We all want to ensure prosperity for this generation, which has been so affected by the Covid-19 phenomenon, and for future generations.  We want to ensure that they have the foundational skill sets and qualifications to compete and succeed in a hugely altering and highly competitive world.  I thank all concerned, especially the staff and students of AIT and LIT, the wide variety of stakeholders in the midlands and mid-west, the international advisory panel, the Higher Education Authority, HEA, the Qualifications and Quality Assurance Authority of Ireland, QQI, and the Department, all of which played a key role, statutory and non-statutory, in getting the fledgling new university to this point of establishment.  <\/p> <p>  I thank members of the committee for their kind attention today.

We have provided the committee with a detailed submission so I will confine my remarks to a number of key points.<\/p> <p>  The IUA welcomes this Bill, noting the need to update the half-century old legislation.  In overall terms, it is essential that the Bill clearly differentiates the respective roles of the HEA and the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science.  The legislative reform, while welcome, must be accompanied by the long-awaited decision to address the serious underfunding of the sector.  New laws for the sector without adequate funding would be meaningless.<\/p> <p>  The provisions in the Bill to underpin accountability, as outlined in the heads, are strongly supported by the IUA.  It is important, however, that the agility of individual universities is not unduly constrained.  The principle of maintaining the primacy of the governing authority of each university in their governance, with the HEA providing appropriate oversight, is a sound one but it is essential that the specific provisions of the Bill do not compromise institutional autonomy.  This is defined by UNESCO as \"a degree of self-governance, necessary for effective decision-making by institutes of higher education regarding their academic work standards, management and related activities\".<\/p> <p>  The Bill, particularly head 66 and a number of related heads, provides for a statutory basis for codes of governance and guidelines for the sector.  While this provision is necessary, it is important that the codes themselves continue to be developed in partnership with the sector and that a comply-or-explain approach is maintained in line with best governance practice.<\/p> <p>  There is a range of provisions under heads 67 to 76, inclusive, on regulatory oversight by the HEA, including those relating to intervention with a particular institution or a determination for action.  It is critical that the trigger mechanism for such intervention is clearly defined in the legislation and that there is adequate provision for an independent appeals process in such cases.  We have outlined this in more detail in our submission.<\/p> <p>  While noting the need for consultation on strategic plans, it is important that governing authorities retain ultimate decision authority on university plans.  We welcome the move to competency-based governing authorities in line with best governance practice elsewhere.  We have proposed that consideration be given to providing for a range of sizes of governing authorities in line with the individual needs of universities.  We believe the proposed cap of 70 on the size of academic councils be removed.  Academic councils are effectively the parliaments of our universities and, as such, it is important that size constraints do not impair the representation of the diverse range of interests in our universities.<\/p> <p>  There is a need for the HEA's role in research to be strengthened and we have outlined a number of proposed measures in our submission in this regard under head 53.<\/p> <p>  The committee should be aware that any increase in direct State control of our autonomous universities arising from the Bill could risk the &euro;1 billion borrowings of our members being transferred to the State balance sheet at a time when State borrowings are already severely stretched.<\/p> <p>  We ask the committee to consider advocating change for a number of heads of the Bill as we have outlined in our submission, in particular heads 66 to 76, inclusive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021070600002#B00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Miley"},{"type":"speech","time":1625526000,"counter":536,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Miley.

The colleges I represent have enrolled 27,000 students, or nearly 12% of the student higher education population.  They are also significant contributors to the Irish economy.  Equality, diversity and inclusion are proposed objectives of the reformed Higher Education Authority.  The unequal treatment of students in private higher education institutes from disadvantaged backgrounds who are excluded from State student supports must be addressed.<\/p> <p>  In 2017, students and their parents told the committee of pleading with the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and credit unions for financial help.  The committee strongly supported them and two members of that committee are present.  Senator Fiona O'Loughlin was Chair of that committee.  It issued a special report recommending that disadvantaged students be entitled to grants for QQI accredited courses in whatever college they wish to attend.  The committee's report was never implemented.  We understand this was because of cost fears.  The HECA estimates the cost to the Exchequer would be estimated to be less than &euro;5 million given that the number of eligible students is likely to be in the hundreds.  The argument of a lack of funds does not sit well with the supports to public sector students received over and above the SUSI grant, none of which were given to private students.  This further exacerbates the inequality.  There was &euro;50 million in Covid-19 supports, &euro;6.5 million in additional hardship assistance supports and disability grants, and &euro;4 million for students to study abroad.<\/p><p>Compared to these amounts, &euro;5 million is a paltry sum.  While Covid-19 and hardship support is welcome and disability support is essential, Covid-19, hardship and disability are not visited solely upon students of public sector institutions.<\/p><p> Referring briefly to designated institution status, the Bill should provide for interested institutions to apply for this and give a timeframe within which a decision should be made.  A timeframe is essential to avoid repetition of the inordinate delay in delegating authority to private HEIs to award degrees.  In 2012, QQI was statutorily required to publish procedures and criteria, and the Minister was obliged to make relevant regulations, as soon as practicable after the establishment day of QQI.  Nine years later, there is no sign of either.<\/p><p> The committee should also be aware that learner protection does not exist in the public sector.  Students have had to resort to High Court action against the HEA to ensure course continuance.  Alternatively, students have lost out due to a receivership of a public sector owned HEI in mid-course.  By contrast, HECA learners benefit from action plans in place to ensure course continuance by another HECA college, backed by a &euro;3.6 million protection fund.  Public sector institutions should be part of the proposed national learner protection scheme, as is the case in Australia.<\/p><p> Our proposals on HEA board membership, research, strategic development plans, equality policies and equity of access and participation progress indicators address other concerns.  We need better progress indicators.  Sometimes I fear we are driving the HEA car without a speedometer or a fuel gauge.  HECA colleges have much to contribute to the national HEA agenda.  While busy internationally, we question whether the obstacles to our provision for Irish students are in the national interest.<\/p><p> Finally, the HEA consultation document advises a shared approach.  The legislation has the opportunity to consider a fair, student-centred, State funding model which will enhance equity of participation for disadvantaged students and support the Government's aim for a more inclusive, diverse and equal higher education system.  Nobody should be left behind.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021070600002#B01100","nonspeaker":"Professor Diarmuid Hegarty","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1625526000,"counter":541,"content":"<p>On this signal day for all along the Shannon, I appreciate this opportunity to contribute to what has been an inclusive process to date.<\/p> <p>  A key characteristic of the consultative documentation is the adoption of a collaborative approach as seen in the internal shared governance model, marked by co-regulation between the HEA and the institution.  This recognises the maturity and the critical responsibility that must lie with an institution, while affording the HEA the wherewithal to manage its oversight role.  The recent establishment of a governance forum by the HEA, and including IUA and THEA, is regarded as a positive manifestation of this shared approach.  This raises an interesting question as to whether a regulatory agency can also be a fostering body.  THEA&rsquo;s view is that we live on a small island.  We work to a common goal - facilitating the realisation of personal potential and contributing toward social cohesion and to the growth and sustenance of our economy.  In a mature construct, it is advisable to work collegiately while retaining respect for the statutory functions appropriate to all actors.  The co-regulation advocated in the document is warmly welcomed, as is the risk-based regulatory approach.<\/p> <p>  The HEA also has a role in defending diversity.  Moves that lead to the homogenising of the system, consciously or otherwise, should proactively be resisted, as they will ultimately undermine the clear policy direction set out in recent legislation.<\/p> <p>  The paper sets out a concept of a shared governance model that separates the corporate, executive and academic strands.  While the architecture and distinct roles are generally understood, there can be questions on the margins of what lies within the competence of each.  For example, the role of the governing authority in the academic oversight of an institution, and thus the nature of its relationship with the academic council, deserves particular attention.  The role of the chief officer is also understated in the draft to date.<\/p> <p>  There has been a drive for some time to effect a reduction in the size of governing bodies.  The desire to achieve this in the Technological Universities Act was not fully realised and it pointed again to the cultural challenge of moving from a representative to a competency-based structure.  THEA is in favour of the proposal which states that governing authorities are more effective when the number of members is reduced.  However, this comes with the following caveats.  First, there a risk in constructing governing bodies that are too small.  Given the increasing complexity and responsibilities of these organisations, a cap of members results in practical housekeeping difficulties.  It can be hard to achieve a quorum, to comprehend the range of skill sets that are essential and to lead and populate the principal committees.  Second, section 12 of the Technological Universities Act sets out the membership of a governing body.  There would be a logic in the technological sector in settling on a figure that is within the lower end of that frame for consistency.  Third, essential to this is a shared willingness to embrace a competency-based model of governance.  This is not to deprive anyone or any group of a voice, but a shared governance model as is proposed here would be advised to move to a conception of governance, and especially at the apex, that is grounded in a diverse and informed view of what is best for the institution and those it serves.  Given the connected nature of the technological sector, there is undoubted merit in having a stronger external voice.<\/p> <p>  Legislators will also note the geographical extent of the regions covered by these new universities.  The question of ensuring that all in a given region can identify, and feel an affinity, with the university is itself an argument for a slightly larger governing authority than proposed in the paper.  The terms of office and the staggered appointment to boards are considered good practice.<\/p> <p>  There is the danger of perceiving the HEA as an extension of the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science.  It would be advisable to have that relationship carefully documented within the scheme.  One of the central considerations in the initial discussion about this renewed legislation centred on the independence of the HEA.  It is the view of THEA that the system is best served by a strong and independent authority.<\/p> <p>  Reference was made to the research role of the HEA, which is expressed through the funding through the core grant and dedicated funding to support capacity building in technological universities, in accordance with the Technological Universities Research Network, TURN, report.  The role of the HEA in research also needs to be aligned with the role of the Department in research policy.  It would also be beneficial for the Irish Research Council to have increased autonomy.  This would allow better alignment with its mandate, putting arts, humanities and social sciences research on an equal statutory footing.<\/p> <p>  Concerning equity, diversity and inclusion, the work commenced by the HEA centre of excellence for gender equality might be reflected in the legislation.  As regards the borrowing framework, our institutions have been seeking this for some time.  THEA trusts that the new legislation will reflect this ambition.  On data sharing, as a system we have access to a significant volume of data and there would be merit in the alignment of data sets between defined entities under appropriate controls.<\/p> <p>  In conclusion, I thank the committee for the opportunity to make these points.  The muscle in this general scheme lies in chapter 3 of part 7 dealing with oversight of designated institutions.  Achieving balance between respect for institutional autonomy and a requirement for accountability instruments will be the test of the legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021070600002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Joseph Ryan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1625526000,"counter":542,"content":"<p>I am a member of Galway County Council with more than 20 years' service.  I am speaking as president of the Association of Irish Local Government, AILG, representing 949 city and county councillors from all 31 local authorities and from all parties and from none.  The association made a substantial submission last April to the Department's consultation on the scheme of the Bill before the committee.  This submission has been forwarded to each of the members through the good offices of the clerk to the committee.  I hope the members have had the opportunity to read it, as it sets out our compelling case for retaining councillors on the governing bodies.<\/p> <p>  As an association of councillors, we are deeply committed to education at all levels, but the association has a particular commitment to third-level education.  For more than a century, the association and its predecessor, the General Council of County Councils, has been nominating members to the governing body of University College Dublin.  This statutory nomination has been paralleled by our member councils, which nominate to the governing bodies of the universities in Cork and Galway.  In all, there are 25 nominees of councillors sitting on the governing bodies of universities.<\/p> <p>  The association has no issue with the general thrust of the proposed Bill in strengthening the governance framework for the third level colleges.  However, it is concerned specifically with head 77, which sets out to reform the size and composition of the governing bodies.  We are concerned that such reforms will eliminate the representation by public representatives on the boards of universities.  It is the association&rsquo;s view that there are compelling and constructive reasons for councillors to continue to serve on the governing bodies.  I will highlight just three of many.<\/p><p>Representing the public interest on the university boards, councillors have the legitimacy to speak on behalf of the Irish public.  Through their daily interaction with communities, councillors bring an awareness of the public&rsquo;s views and concerns regarding higher education to the governing process.<\/p><p> Regarding diversity, councillors come from a range of backgrounds - rural, urban and suburban - and from a diversity of vocational backgrounds and professional competences.  Such diversity is a powerful counterbalance to the corporate phenomenon of groupthink and ensures that the governing bodies benefit from diverse and challenging contributors.<\/p><p> Councillors are involved in all levels of the education sector, including as members of boards of primary and secondary schools, as well as being members of the education and training boards countrywide.  They bring this awareness of the challenges faced by primary and secondary education to the tertiary level of education as members of the university bodies.<\/p><p> The short time allocated for the opening statement prevents me from elaborating further on the well-founded justification for retaining councillors on the governing bodies.  There are many problems facing Irish society, including climate change, digitisation and housing, but it is only by closer co-operation, not less co-operation, between local government and the university sector that we can work towards resourcing the communities in which we live and work.<\/p><p> I think the members the opportunity to address the committee today and thank them for their attention.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021070600002#C00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary Hoade","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1625526000,"counter":544,"content":"<p>I call Senator Malcolm Byrne, to be followed by Deputy Conway-Walsh.

What is the appropriate relationship between the HEA and the Department?  Where is the balance under this legislation between the authority's regulatory role and its advocacy and developmental role?  I am conscious of Dr. Ryan's point on this.  Where does the balance come between autonomy and accountability?  Related to this is the question of sanction.  An institution should be allowed autonomy but if there is a problem with how it is spending money or some of its activity, what sanctions should be built into the legislation?  <\/p> <p>  The function, size and purpose of the governing body should follow that of the function and purpose of the university or higher education institution itself.

That is the differentiation I would see.<\/p> <p>  On the balance between the regulatory and advocacy approach, it is important that the HEA retains a strong advocacy role in keeping with other sectors where the sectoral State agency would have that advocacy role, be that on the business side or elsewhere.  It is very important it retains that.  That needs to be upweighted in the sector.<\/p> <p>  On the autonomy and accountability balance, the principle is outlined well in the legislation.  Essentially the decision-making is located as close as possible to the front line - with the governing authority and the relevant institution.  That speaks to what Dr. Ryan referenced as avoiding the homogeneity of the sector with everyone becoming the same.  It is important.

Scrutinising this legislation is an almost impossible task.  There is an enormous responsibility on us to ensure we come out with the best possible legislation that serves to give us a system that is fit for purpose.  The key issue in the legislation is striking the right balance between the Department and the HEA; between the HEA and the institutes of higher education; between the governing authorities and the chief executives; and between the external and internal members of the governing bodies.  In addition, we need to strike the right balance in representation and competency on the boards and the governing authorities, as well as between accountability and institutional autonomy.<\/p> <p>  Accountability is obviously paramount in all areas where we spend public money.  However, this should not come at the expense of institutional autonomy, as was said.  The submissions rightly highlighted that the sector has been starved a funding for more than a decade and that legislative reform alone will not deliver the change that we need in higher education and research.  <\/p> <p>  The submissions from the IUA and the THEA touch on the impact the legislation could have on the ability of the institutes to borrow and how these debts are treated.

Almost &euro;1 billion has been borrowed by seven of our eight members.  That is off the State's balance sheet due to the way it is treated.  It is a complex process in which the Central Statistics Office, CSO, and EUROSTAT are involved, as the Deputy will be aware.  It is related to the level of control that the State has over the sector.  If the State exercises greater control through this legislation, there is a risk that existing loans will be cast onto the State's balance sheet, impairing the sector's capacity to borrow in future.  We need to get the balance right.  It is possible to frame the legislation in a way that does so, but it is important that the line is not overstepped.<\/p> <p>  I will defer to my colleague, but regarding the size of the governing authorities, we have suggested a range.

Under the heading of Dr. Alan Wall's line, \"Our institutions require a balance between autonomy and accountability\", which has been referred to several times, I will discuss governing authorities.  As I understand it, this balance is necessary to the integrity of our system.  The Irish Horseracing Regulatory Board, IHRB, will be before the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine on Thursday.  It gets &euro;9 million or &euro;10 million of taxpayers' money and is accountable to the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Given that autonomy is necessary, how does the public ensure that money is being well and properly spent?  Are representatives from local authorities on governing bodies not part of that process, in that they guarantee a certain visibility of the governance of higher education to the public it is supposed to be serving?<\/p> <p>  Perhaps Councillor Hoade will have a view on my next question.  While I get the importance of competence-based appointments, is there some support that we could give to members of local authorities so that, when they set about discharging their responsibilities, which I hope they will continue to have, as members of governing authorities, they can come to the job with the expertise they need?  Can we have it both ways in terms of competence-based appointments while also recognising the particular competence of local authority members and enhancing that through training as people join the board and so on?<\/p> <p>  I have been raising issues about academic freedom and the safety of students coming from China in particular to participate in higher education in this country, where there are developing relationships between Irish institutions and institutions in other countries, not just China, where our rights and freedoms may not be respected.  If we are speaking about autonomy and academic freedom, we need to recognise that these may be under threat in the developing relationships between our universities and institutions in certain countries.  What does this legislation have to say to that challenge?  The committee may decide to explore this issue.  That is not yet decided, but I am preparing a scoping report on the topic.  What can be done to assist the accountability of our higher education institutions to ensure that we are doing our utmost for the safety and security of staff and students, both ours going abroad and people from other countries coming to Ireland?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021070600002#E00900","speaker":"1673"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1625526000,"counter":561,"content":"<p>Griffith College has been bringing in students from China since 1994.

There may be some repetition, given that Senator Malcolm Byrne, in getting the first bite at the cherry, probably asked the most pertinent questions.  If there is repetition, perhaps we can use the time to expand a little on those discussions.<\/p> <p>  My first question concerns the relationship between the HEA and the Department, and the need to distinguish between the two bodies.  I have a slight nagging concern and I might use the HSE and the Department of Health as an analogy.  My worry is about accountability to the D&aacute;il.  The Department of Health is often used as a distancing device, whereby it is difficult for us to ask politicians to have a line of sight to issues within the HSE that might worry us.  I am concerned that creating that distinction between the HEA and the Department, which I accept is necessary, might make the body less accountable to the D&aacute;il.<\/p> <p>  Turning to the borrowing framework, I am a Deputy who represents Waterford and the south east, so a recurring issue for me relates to the ability of the institutes of technology to access borrowing in the same way as universities.  Will that follow through to the technological university system?<\/p> <p>  The institutes of technology, and I hope the technological universities, will be able to work closely with industry.  This goes to the issue of autonomy we talked about.  The agility and the responsiveness in courses offered at the institutes of technology will, I hope, continue through to the technological universities and be maintained.  There appears to be a tension between Councillor Hoade's position regarding representatives on governing bodies and what Dr. Ryan argued for, that is, a greater emphasis on competencies.  If that tension is there - I do not mean to stoke any problems or anything like that - it is probably best that we name it and speak specifically to that point.  Councillor Hoade strongly put the argument for the representative element, so I would like to hear the counterpoint from the competency point of view in the context of the governing bodies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021070600002#F00500","speaker":"1617"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1625526000,"counter":569,"content":"<p>On the issue of accountability to the D&aacute;il, the comparison the Deputy outlined is interesting.  Nevertheless, we are very much involved in research and innovation and are drivers of economic growth through fostering that.  I see us very much in the developmental space as much as in that of education.  Enterprise Ireland, for example, has a strong fostering role for SMEs and indigenous industry, as well as a direct funding and grant-making role, while there is a similar dynamic at Bord Bia.<\/p> <p>  I would see the HEA in that space.  It has that oversight and funding function but also has that role of advocacy and fostering the benefits of the sector.  I will leave the question on the borrowing framework because I think that was directed more to Dr. Ryan and others.<\/p> <p>  I am glad the Deputy mentioned agility.  We sometimes talk about autonomy as if it is an end in itself, but this is all about agility.  During Covid, all our institutions have responded in a very agile way to the pressures of Covid, not just in translating to an online teaching environment but also through staff being seconded to the health services, research laboratories being transformed into testing centres, contact tracing and all that work.  We have to link that to the individual agility of the institutions to make those decisions and move quickly to do that.

I am conscious of the Chairman's injunction not to name names, but a leading provost of a European university has told me the key to the success of that university involved choosing the most competent people for its governing body, in whom everybody could have faith, rather than going down the route of a representative model, which tends, by its nature, to get larger and larger in any case.

It is very important because of the opportunities we will have to potentially expand campuses and hubs out into the likes of Roscommon, east Galway and other regional areas.

There is a focus on it now because we have such a high number of students going to third level education, which is brilliant and is possibly the highest number in Europe if not worldwide.  It is also about the breadth of programmes they study, how we are to maintain excellence, and building strategies around this.<\/p><p>I thank Mr. Miley for his presentation and for his submission on behalf of the IUA.  My question for Mr. Miley is on performance frameworks. All of our universities know about performance frameworks when it comes to the <i>QS World University Rankings<\/i>and ensuring our universities are there in the top 1,000, top 500, top 250 and top 100.  That is how Ireland shows its excellence across the world.  In Mr. Miley's submission he referred to research.  I was a contract researcher in NUI Galway and I understand the concerns and needs in that regard.  Will Mr. Miley expand on how important is the investment in research and innovation as a driver of economic growth?  How are we going to ensure that by funding research and innovation, we will drive and maintain our position on those <i>QS World University Rankings<\/i>?

Does this Bill further this or contradict it?  I return to the funding model and the CSO categorisation.  In 2018 when EUROSTAT and the CSO revisited the assessment of the control of universities, they came up with the criteria of autonomous institutions under public or private control or market or non-market.  The result was that the universities were seen as autonomous institutions under public control and as a market operator.  I think we can manage everything that needs to be achieved and still remain off the balance sheet.  In 2018 the CSO report clearly states that all fee income, whether that is paid by households or the State on behalf of households, is treated as sales.

It is also really important to look at what it means to be successful in third level education.  I sat on a governing authority as a public representative and we spent a huge amount of time coming up with a strategic plan for the university.  One of the key things was openness.  I will read out for the committee what Professor &Oacute; h&Oacute;gartaigh wrote in the opening statement in that strategic plan:<\/p> <blockquote> \tWe recognise that we cannot achieve our ambitions alone.  We are a university with no gates.  When darkness comes, we don't close.  Openness means we welcome friends and strangers in.  It also means we go out, seeking new and deeper research co-operation, new ideas, new partnerships, new communities, and new ways of engaging. <\/blockquote> <p>That has to be a key part of what governing authorities do.  Competency is absolutely key, but it is not just about ensuring we can wash our faces when it comes to money.  A university is also a social good.  It is not just about the students who are there; in Galway in particular, it also has to encapsulate the entire city in it.  That is why it is key that we do not lose that element of having the public involved in the running of the university.  That may not look like having a certain number of public representatives but it absolutely cannot be based only on what it means to run an institution.  It also has to have that representative element to it.  I would like to hear the witnesses' thoughts on that.  There are problems with it - do not get me wrong.  I got on the governing authority at the flip of a coin and was the only female councillor on it at that time.  That goes to our political system as well.  Councillor Hoade, in her short time as president of the Association of Irish Local Government, AILG, has done a huge amount of work regarding gender balance on local authorities.  We have local authorities on which there might be one woman and the rest are men, and that needs to be addressed.  It spills over when it comes to the kinds of boards councillors are on, and I was on a number of them.  Those are a few of my thoughts on that and about the importance of not just competency but also how the witnesses reflect wider society in the running of their institutions.<\/p><p>There have clearly been some problems, and gender discrimination is one.  Do the witnesses think a Bill of this kind will address some of the issues surrounding the lack of transparency that has existed in the past?  I think all of us who have served on boards, be they boards of management for schools or for universities, know there have been difficulties.  If we are honest and if we look down through the list of the problems with appointments to particular positions within universities, do we think the Bill will address that lack of transparency sufficiently?  We definitely had issues in Galway.  The landscape has changed in that regard, but we need to make sure that these things do not happen again.  That is where accountability comes in.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021070600002#J00200","speaker":"1693"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1625526000,"counter":600,"content":"<p>I can offer, if I may, through the Chair-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021070600002#J00250","nonspeaker":"Dr. Joseph Ryan"},{"type":"speech","time":1625526000,"counter":601,"content":"<p>There is about a minute left in this slot, so whoever is first may respond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021070600002#J00300","speaker":"1619"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1625526000,"counter":602,"content":"<p>Reflecting on what the Senator said, when I went to college - I am going back a bit now - the number of students amounted to approximately 15% to 20% of the age cohort; they now amount to more than 60% of the age cohort.  The question of democratisation and the role of the technological sector in widening access have been a key part of this.  That access and the link to region and community are key to the build of these new technological universities.  The linkage between governance and place and region has been a key theme to which we have been referring all the time.  I do not think there is any disconnect between that connectedness, which is the byline of the TURN report on the build of these technological universities, and that question of linkage back into community.

It has been very interesting to listen to them talk about gender equality.  Councillor Hoade is the first female president of the AILG.  That should be noted and remarked on, and I congratulate her on the difficult year the AILG is having because of Covid.  Councillor Hoade is certainly leading with great strides, which is great to see.<\/p> <p>  Much of the debate and discussion we have had has been about balance, specifically the balance between autonomy and accountability.  In my view, the best way of doing this is through public representation.<\/p><p>The submission from the Association of Irish Local Government has certainly demonstrated the strong contribution elected members have made to governing bodies over the years since 1908.  Anyone would know Liam Kenny was a historian in terms of the links that he has made.  It is interesting to see the links between the foundation of our universities and local government, which was only in place ten years at that point.  That link is important in representing the public interest and not only the diversity of experience but the experience of diversity.  It is important in bringing that all to the fore.<\/p><p> I was fortunate enough to serve on the European Committee of the Regions for five years some ten years ago.  One thing that struck me across Europe was the strong relationship between universities and the regions and their business and political leadership.  My view was this was something we were not strong enough on.  Within my county we have NUI Maynooth.  In the past five years there have been stronger and better connections but to have had the possibility of a public representative from Kildare on the governing body would have been a wonderful thing for the region and for the university.  I know that Sara Moorhead spoke in her report about that absolute connection.<\/p><p> I will put some questions to Councillor Hoade.  Time is short so I will confine my questions to her.  This is key because there is a suggestion that boards might minimise the numbers.  There is a fear that we may lose some of the valuable expertise and insights of our public representatives.<\/p><p> In her submission Councillor Hoade talked about bringing the experience of the wider education sector to the governing bodies.  Will Councillor Hoade develop that point about those connections?  There is a view regarding the competency-based approach to the selection of members, and that is not a bad thing.

Councillors come to the table with this expertise and knowledge.  They have worked in the education sector.

There might be other areas that a university might mention.<\/p> <p>  I will put the question to Mr. Miley.  I will not put a title in front of his name just yet.  I am coming at this from my experience as a contract researcher in universities.  The Higher Education Authority provides a core grant or block grant to the universities and colleges to ensure they have infrastructure and facilities to provide research.  We understand the cost of laboratories.  We know that students in arts cover the costs of many students doing science, technology, engineering and mathematics subjects.  How can we see that additional funding coming through research?<\/p> <p>  I have gone through the elements mentioned in the submission.  We need to increase the Government funding.  I would be in favour of doubling that but, as we can imagine, budgets are tight.  How else can we attract this type of funding?  How can the Higher Education Authority promote this?  What is the role of international students in positioning Irish colleges and universities with the infrastructure and laboratories to compete at world class level for research?<\/p> <p>  I want to consider the agencies that fund universities, including for the arts area and Science Foundation Ireland for the science and technology areas.  There are several partnerships or collaborations, including the US-Ireland research and development partnership programme and the US National Science Foundation and the US National Institutes of Health.  There is the Horizon Europe at the moment.  What ways can we look to support the research path students take from masters to PhD to post-doctorate level?  How do we support people in our research sector in universities?  What can the HEA do to help?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021070600002#K00700","speaker":"1654"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1625526000,"counter":620,"content":"<p>Again, I go back to what I said recently in respect of regional knowledge and local knowledge and our connection with universities and local needs.

They know the needs and local issues in areas.  They are the people who are able to transform and bring forward those ideas.<\/p> <p>  No matter how we look at it communities are a microcosm of the technological need.  Many of our members come from different backgrounds.

Our proposal is not that the State does this in isolation by any means.  As committee members are aware, our universities and institutes of technology have long and detailed partnerships with industry and access money for research through a variety of mechanisms.  One thing we can look at has been striking in recent years.<\/p><p>The Senator is probably aware of the analysis on this issue.  In order to qualify for European Research Council, ERC, grants, one needs State support and to be able to show other sources of funding.  By not giving certain grants to some of our lead researchers, the State is causing other difficulties for them.  It is interesting that some of the people who are featured on television nightly or weekly talking about Covid did not have access to ERC grants in recent years because, in order to qualify, they needed a certain seedbed of State grants to kick them off.  It is very much a matched funding model.<\/p><p> To bring this back to the legislation, it is important that the Higher Education Authority would have a pivotal role in setting the ground rules in this area and developing a framework around them.  The money is one side of it and the framework through which the money is channelled is the other.  It cannot just be about recurrent funding.  The infrastructure funding, which the Senator referenced, is critical.  We have a situation where, in some higher education institutions, students are being educated and researchers are working in laboratories built in the 1980s and 1990s.  That is a real problem when trying to developing industry partnerships.  If a third level institution brings in representatives from the local FDI company, they will not want to take a student into their super-high-tech environment who is coming out of that environment.  There is a real issue in terms of bridging that gap and the funding needs to address it, both in terms of how it is structured and the quantum of funding.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021070600002#K00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Miley","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1625526000,"counter":623,"content":"<p>There was a reference to North-South funding.

We have seen examples during the Covid period of research being developed in the universities and being applied.  Individual professors are doing good work in that regard.  I feel, however, that there are not sufficient connections between the employment and investment incentive, EII, scheme and research within the universities.  There is potential there in terms of funding for applied research if the universities were to develop the skills needed to cultivate Asian investors, for example, and perhaps work more with the Department on developing the EII scheme.  I serve on Dublin Chamber and we made submissions to Government last February on the scheme.  It needs to be broadened significantly and it needs to reward people for risk-taking.  Research can involve total risk and total loss or it can involve substantial gain.  In the case of applied research, there is an opportunity there.

If we were spending similar amounts of money, where might we be at right now?  When does he see us being able to afford to spend the same amounts of money?  That leads into the question of access to third level education, which is a huge concern of mine.  When I go back to my constituency, which is Wexford, one of the main issues people raise with me is access to third level education and the cost of it.  Accommodation costs have gone through the roof and many families are struggling.  The cost of living has gone up but salaries may not have increased.  There are greater expectations on other family members and so on.  We need to invest more in research but we also have to make it affordable for students to go to third level.  We are still going back to the Exchequer and the same pocket of money.  What is more important in terms of prioritising funding?  Should we give 50% to research and 50% to making third level more accessible to students?  It is absolutely fantastic to see people who got their education in Ireland making their name worldwide.  There should be the same accessibility to third level for everybody.  It is a huge concern of mine that we are making it way too expensive for people.  I will be raising this issue with the Minister, Deputy Harris, when he comes before the committee to discuss the reopening of colleges.<\/p> <p>  I will call Mr. Miley first to respond on that point, after which Dr. Ryan and Professor Hegarty may also wish to comment.

It is critically important and it speaks to both the legislation and the upcoming announcements we hope to see on the sustainable funding for the sector that the Minister and Taoiseach have pledged for this year.  It is vital that we have a system that is accessible and fair.  This means doing something, for instance, for the 85% of pupils who are not getting access in the school Professor Hegarty mentioned earlier, which is located not far from where I am sitting.  We must ensure that more of the children in that school who have the ability to go to third level are given the capacity to do so.  There is a more complex issue around this in that the pathway starts in primary school.  It is not something that just happens at the end of the cycle.  There is a larger question to be considered in that regard but I very much share the Chairman's sentiment.<\/p> <p>  The Chairman referred to the high-skills aspect and what is needed in that regard.  In essence, we would say that something in the order of &euro;80 million to &euro;100 million per year in extra funding for research is needed over the next five years.

The reality of the matter is that the Chairman is correct that accommodation costs are out of hand, and education costs and living costs are not getting lower, so students have to borrow.  It is important that they get skills from their years in college that will quickly enable them to earn salaries at a decent level so that they can repay those loans and they are not hanging over them for life.  The loans are not terribly large relative to potential incomes but we have to give them the skills to get into the workplace quickly.  That is imperative.  I would be delighted to contribute to the committee's deliberations on that aspect.  It is vital for both students and for the economy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021070600002#M00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Diarmuid Hegarty"},{"type":"speech","time":1625526000,"counter":632,"content":"<p>I will call Dr. Ryan and then go back to Mr. Miley because I am interested in his view on that.

We did that due to the access issue since we felt that it would exacerbate the challenges for so many people accessing higher education.  I made the point earlier that the sector I have the honour to represent is the access sector.  It has done much for the democratisation of education.  These new technological universities are geographically more dispersed, which will make things easier.  That is not to gainsay the Chair's points.  The challenge is that the student fee is one of the highest in Europe.  Accommodation costs are high.  I used to work as a registrar in the college and one could hear the pips squeak a number of years ago when families came and said that they could not afford to have their next son or daughter go through education.  The funding is a three-legged stool.  Hopefully, we will have a discussion dedicated to funding in time.  That three-legged stool is the student contribution which I propose is effectively maxed out, as it stands.  The second part is the National Training Fund, which is now at 1%, a significant contribution from enterprise.  The third part is central funding.  I fully take the point that has been made here a few times.  We are looking at a potential change in the tax regime.  Our native genius is in the talent of our people.  It is worth investing in the talent of those people because that is what draws people to this small, open, productive economy.

We recognise that a significant proportion of students take out loans to get themselves through college.  That is a reality.  What we do not have is a structured loan scheme, as in Australia and elsewhere.  The political debate on that is probably near to twilight, if I am reading the tea leaves correctly.  In dealing with the substantive funding question, which we understand is coming to the table soon, I would simply come back to the point that the fact of the matter is that a cohort of students is going to college who are stretched and finding it difficult to cope.  We also know that another cohort is not getting access to college due to financial constraints.  In dealing with the funding question, we have to have that front and centre.  We also have to have front and centre that there is a cohort of families and students who can afford to pay.  Many of them are paying &euro;6,000 to &euro;12,000 a year for secondary school and then going on to third level.  The fairness equation needs to apply across the spectrum.

We have a serious bulge coming into the system.  We need to do two things.  Whoever is in the system needs to be funded appropriately.  The worst thing that we could do is pull more people into the system and not fund them adequately.  Second, we need to make sure that alternative channels are provided for them, through apprenticeships or more flexible opportunities.  We would advocate as strongly as anyone else for that.  The worst thing for any 18- or 19-year-olds is to find themselves in a course or an institution which does not suit them.

I thank the committee for the invitation to discuss the views of the next generation of political representatives on the politics and current affairs in the North.  To give the committee an understanding of my views, I will give some insight into my background.  I am currently a member of the Lisburn and Castlereagh City Council, to which I was elected in 2019.  I also ran as a parliamentary candidate in that year for the 2019 Westminster election.  In my professional life, I work in Belfast's growing technology sector as a software engineer and development manager.  Although I am a political representative from south Belfast on Lisburn and Castlereagh City Council, I am originally from Derry city.  I was born and raised in the Bogside area of the city, where I attended the local integrated primary school at the direction of my mother, whose ambition was that my brother and I would grow up engaged in a positive cross-community environment and experiencing friendships with those from different backgrounds and communities from ours.  Many of those friendships last to this day.<\/p> <p>  In January 2020, my son was born in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda.  My partner is from Navan, County Meath and our family relationships, like a growing number of others on this island, naturally extend beyond the artificial boundaries imposed on us.  From Derry to Belfast and from Meath to Lisburn and Castlereagh, we are as Irish as the next family and the fluidity of our lives across the Border give a broadened sense of just how small our island is.  It is my ambition that my son will grow up in an Ireland free from these artificial boundaries, and the divisions they sow, on a unified island and in  a unified community.  However, to realise that reality, we must see the appropriate preparation, planning and civic engagement.<\/p> <p>  Irish unity and the provisions for constitutional change are a cornerstone of the Good Friday Agreement.  It is embedded in the heart of the agreement, which clearly outlines our pathway to the unification of Ireland and dictates that a new constitutional future in Ireland can only be achieved with the democratic consent of the people of Ireland.  It is my belief that members of this generation want their say on that future.  Like me, they are ambitious for change.  They see the unnatural imposition of partition on their lives and aspire to build something better, not just for them but also for their children.  I have always believed in Irish unity.<\/p> <p>  Brexit has caused a paradigm shift in many people's thinking, and there is now a rapidly growing and diverse constituency that recognises the great potential of an all-island economy and a unified nation within the European Union.  These conversations have begun.  They are happening in our offices or via Zoom and in our homes across the country.  I speak daily both with constituents and work colleagues in my profession, many from a unionist background, who are now ready to have that conversation and eager to know what a united Ireland would look like.  Twenty-three years after the signing of the Good Friday Agreement, we must now move to provide them with answers.  It is my view that this conversation is headed in only one direction, and in the coming years there will be referenda on Irish unity, North and South, as outlined in the Belfast Agreement.  The people want their say.  The success or otherwise of those referenda, however, will hinge on the preparation, engagements and dialogues we make today.  I believe that this generation is the one that will finally make our ambitions on Irish unity a reality.  It is ready for that task and comes with a renewed determination and ambition to deliver for all our people as part of a new Ireland.<\/p> <p>  I will be happy to take questions on my opening statement or on general politics in the North.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021070600002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ryan Carlin"},{"type":"speech","time":1625526000,"counter":653,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an bhfinn&eacute; as ucht na h&oacute;r&aacute;ide sin.

I will be brief in my opening remarks because I believe the most beneficial part of this meeting will be the questions many members may have for the group before the committee.  I know some members quite well and I have interacted with them on social media, but for others it is my first time to interact with them so it is appropriate to give them an idea of my background.<\/p> <p>  I am a 29-year-old SDLP city councillor, representing the Lisnasharragh district electoral area in Belfast, which stretches from the east bank of the River Lagan in the Belfast South parliamentary constituency to Connswater in the Belfast East parliamentary constituency.  Our electoral area is politically diverse, with four different partisan traditions represented at the council, the SDLP, the Green Party, the Alliance Party of Northern Ireland and the DUP.  It is the home of Ulster Rugby, the Museum of Orange Heritage and two of the largest and fastest growing GAA clubs on the island, Bredagh and East Belfast GAA.  Like some of the other councillors here this morning, I was first elected in May 2019.  Following the United Kingdom's exit from the EU, I became the only directly elected representative in east Belfast who advocates a position of constitutional change.  Following my election, I proposed the establishment of Belfast City Council's all-party working group on the climate crisis, serving as its first chairperson and as the chairperson of the council's Brexit committee.  In 2019, Belfast City Council became the largest council in the North to back the proposed referendum on presidential voting rights for Irish citizens across the island and, potentially, across the world.  I was glad to propose that motion and received support from across the council, including abstentions from the DUP, allowing it to proceed without opposition.<\/p> <p>  I was born on 5 February 1992 and on the same day Jack Duffin, William McManus, Christy Doherty, Peter Magee and James Kennedy were murdered in the Sean Graham Bookmakers massacre on Lower Ormeau Road in my home community.  My grandmother was the local primary school teacher and knew some of the victims as past pupils and my mother knew them as members of the same south Belfast community that she had always called home.  For as long as I can recall, the Good Friday Agreement was referenced to me and my generation as the reason that we could expect to live free from the threat of violence and free from the type of horror that occurred on 5 February 1992.  That signalled a sense of hope and optimism that my parents' generation had not grown up with and a promise that an end to violence would lead to an end to division and a new and prosperous home place for all of us to share.  I worry that over the past number of years the politics of Brexit, carve-up and division has undermined much of that hope among my generation.  I try my best each day, as do the other elected representatives at this meeting, to try to rebuild some of that sense of hope and optimism, to work the common ground and to identify the places where we can work together on issues on which we agree, despite holding differing views on other issues.<\/p> <p>  I am keen to offer committee members the opportunity to ask as many questions as possible.  I believe we are in a time of flux and change.  There is a great deal to consider about the future of our home place.  This is a good opportunity for representatives from across the island to get a sense of where the next generation of people's representatives see the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021070600002#B00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. S&eacute;amas de Faoite"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1625526000,"counter":655,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the invitation to participate in the meeting.  One of the most profound and truly pivotal moments in our shared history was the signing of the Good Friday Agreement in 1998.  As a young person who had an interest in politics, I watched the countless figures, mostly men, emerge from Castle Buildings in the years preceding the agreement.  Indeed, I often saw them in the streets of my home town, Lisburn.  I often looked at them and wondered if they held the same values that I held and if they wanted to fight for my rights to have my voice heard.<\/p> <p>  Twenty-three years after the Good Friday Agreement, one could be forgiven for thinking that our politics has fallen back to pre-1998 standards, with political parties still selling the politics of a new Ireland or an ever-stronger union.  With both these goals legitimate but eternally incompatible, it can sometimes feel that we are mired in political stalemate, with Brexit causing political instability.  However, the political sands are shifting beneath our feet, with parties that do not designate as unionist or nationalist seeing significant growth and electoral success.  It has sent shock waves throughout the political system.  It has challenged the old assumptions.  Indeed, our election results in Lagan Valley in the 2019 general election are still sending shock waves throughout our politics today.  Radical politics is not about the age-old unity or union binary.  It is about tackling the barriers that divide us, throwing them aside and working together, tearing down the walls of division, brick by brick, identifying as a united community instead of separate or divided communities and stepping forward together as one community to tackle the toxic legacy of years of conflict, paramilitarism, sectarianism and segregation.<\/p><p>People are embracing the politics of united community and we need that to be reflected in the mechanisms of the Agreement.  The Good Friday Agreement was an opportunity to transform our politics.  It provided the foundation to build a better place for us all; a place where everyone was respected, valued and welcomed; historic wrongs would be righted; those who lost their lives would be remembered with reverence; and those hurt, injured and maimed by the conflict would be looked after, not left to fend for themselves or fight their own lonely battles.  Yet, we have not delivered on this.  We laid the foundations of peace, but the peace we have built is a long way from the blueprint drawn up in 1998.  We have peace, but sometimes on a piecemeal basis: justice, for those who are able to get it, served on an individual, not a collective, basis; communities that are still in the throes of ongoing paramilitary coercive control, having to negotiate their small peace with malevolent forces; lives half-lived with young people who have not seen the peace dividend; with the number of people who have died by suicide much greater than the number of the bereaved lost through the conflict since 1998; and still fighting for truth and justice.  <\/p><p> Since the inception of Northern Ireland, it has been taken as read that our politics must be divided in terms of identity, a pattern that has emerged and has stayed with us.  However, in recent years, this has changed, with a growth and significant rise in unaligned parties, including my own, the Alliance Party of Northern Ireland.  Indeed, this has given rise to the question: what happens if Alliance Party of Northern Ireland is the second-biggest party?  As somebody who is neither nationalist nor unionist, my vote should count the same as anyone else's, and it is deeply wrong that in certain circumstances, my vote would not count, if that were the case.  We are making great progress with our integrated education Bill.  Many people and families now have fluid and multifaceted identities.  Indeed, we have welcomed many newcomer families to Lisburn from Syria.  The Northern Ireland in 1998 and the Northern Ireland now, thankfully, are hugely different and changed places.  Every day we are thankful that we do not have to live through what our parents and others lived through.  We have a different, diverse, and vibrant community that has changed in many ways since 1998.  The future we are building is not a binary choice; it is a rainbow of colour, identity and values that respects everyone's place and is working together for a united community and a peace.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021070600002#B00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Sorcha Eastwood","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1625526000,"counter":657,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for this opportunity.  I probably will not get to cover everything I want in the opening statement, but I will do my best.  I am a Green Party councillor for the Botanic district electoral area in south Belfast.  I am the first Green Party councillor to represent that area.  It is a diverse constituency.  I represent a number of inner-city working-class Protestant unionist loyalist communities, as well as a predominately nationalist or republican community.  We also have the Holyland student area and some more affluent areas.  My constituency also has a significant number of newcomer and black and minority ethnic, BAME, communities.  All of this makes us one of the most diverse communities in Northern Ireland.<\/p> <p>  I will be honest.  Issues such as Brexit or the constitutional question do not feature in my day-to-day life.  They did not feature in my election campaign.  I was not asked about them on the doors.  What people do speak to me about is a lack of trust in politicians here; the lack of housing for their families; feeling pushed out of their city; the cruel and inhumane benefit system; or why in 2021 we are still putting women and pregnant people on a boat in the middle of a pandemic.  <\/p> <p>  As a Green Party member, our position on the Good Friday Agreement is clear.  We support the Agreement and its full implementation.  It was, and is, the people&rsquo;s Agreement.  However, what we have seen since 1998 is the altering of its provisions by politicians and for politicians, through the various other agreements that have been made as we have lunged from one political crisis to another.  That has been done without the consent of the people who agreed the Good Friday Agreement in the first place.  That has so often failed to be acknowledged.  I am not saying that we do not need to update the Agreement, but I do not believe it should be done as a result of closed conversations in back rooms by a small number of political elites.  As a party, we do not designate as either nationalist or unionist.  We are \"othered\".  We have seen the rise of the \"other\" in Northern Ireland for some time now yet, in the Assembly, our votes still count for less.  As the rhetoric ramps up, post Brexit, so do the calls to pick a side, as if the only two possible identities in this place are nationalist or unionist.  I take great offence at my identity not being considered valid, as it does not fit the neat binaries that have been entrenched in our political institutions.  It may suit certain parties to continue peddling the myth that there&rsquo;s simply \"them&rsquo;uns\" and \"us&rsquo;uns\", as it keeps them in a job, but I can sit here with confidence and say that I am not a unionist, nor am I a nationalist.  <\/p> <p>  I am a feminist and an eco-socialist.  That is my political identity.  That is what is relevant to me and I believe a growing number of other people in Northern Ireland.  We have a right for that to be respected, just as those who choose their political identity to be nationalist, unionist, or something else entirely.  It is not \"sitting on the fence\", as I have been told.  The constitutional future of Northern Ireland will be dictated by the people and the people alone, as set out in the Good Friday Agreement, and not by political parties.  <\/p> <p>  We are still fumbling our way through an unprecedented global pandemic.  Who knows what impact that is going to have on us going forward?  Brexit is, and will continue to be, one of the most complex socio-political and economic shocks that we are going to have to try and make sense of.  Our world is burning.  We all know John Hume&rsquo;s famous line: \"You can&rsquo;t eat a flag\".  Well, I am going to quote my esteemed colleague, Councillor Brian Smith: \"If you don&rsquo;t deal with climate breakdown now, you&rsquo;ll be arguing about a United Ireland in a canoe in a few years.\"  Climate does not recognise borders.  The issues facing the people in my constituency know no borders.  Working-class people in Belfast, Derry, Dublin, London, Newcastle, Glasgow, and Cardiff all the have same issues.  That is what I want to focus on as a political representative.  I will leave it at that and I am happy to take any questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021070600002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Ms &Aacute;ine Groogan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1625526000,"counter":658,"content":"<p>I thank the Chair and the committee for the invitation.  It is always great to hear some southern voices.  Anyone who has been in Belfast recently will know that is not a particularly new phenomenon.<\/p> <p>  I am not as well known as some of the other councillors in this group, so I will give the committee some of my background.  As the Chair said, I am an Ulster Unionist councillor, elected in May 2019 to Lisburn and Castlereagh City Council, representing Lisburn North.  It is a relatively diverse area.  I am proud that I am the only councillor in the area who still lives in the area.  We have strong working-class unionist areas and more demographically changing class areas.  When one is approaching the age of 30, being referred to as the \"next generation\" is refreshing.  I am sure some of my colleagues will agree with this.  <\/p> <p>  The Ulster Unionist Party is proud of its role in the Good Friday Agreement.  We have never shied away from saying that, and we never will.  We are proud of the three-stranded approach that came out of it.  There will be some people who think that my attendance at a meeting such as this one is somehow a dilution of my own unionism.  To them, I can only say that nothing was ever lost by engagement.  My unionism will not be diluted by anything that is said or heard today.  My unionism is mine.  How I choose to shape it is my decision.  <\/p> <p>  To give the committee some background on what shapes my views, my parents come from different backgrounds.  My father is from a working-class unionist background in Belfast and my mother is from, as I like to remind her frequently, leafy suburbia in east Belfast.  They were quite the mix.  They worked hard to bring us up.  We lived in a comfortable, mixed middle-class area.  I feel fortunate that this is my background.  Unfortunately, the reality is that too many people in Northern Ireland still today live in segregated communities.  That is not just segregation through housing, but through education.  My objective is that Northern Ireland remains within the United Kingdom, but that this happens as a union of people.<\/p><p>We can only do that when we start to share and live together and educate our children together.  Those are some of the priorities I see for the future.<\/p><p> We will delve into several topical issues during questioning.  One point I will emphasise now is that in the past several years we have heard people say how we must dial down the rhetoric.  We may hear the point made during this meeting as well.  Those are usually the people who are then the first to dial up the rhetoric after they have made that statement.  What is required are calm heads and cool conversations.  People need to be confident in their own identity, whether that is British, Irish, Northern Irish or whatever else, as is allowed for by the Good Friday Agreement.  This is the key aspect for the future.  We must allow people to be confident in their identities and we must not be insecure in ours.  Those are some of my initial thoughts and I will be happy to take any questions.  I thank the committee very much for the invitation to contribute.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021070600002#C00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stuart Hughes","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1625526000,"counter":660,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Hughes.

I almost feel as though I should be considered the next generation as well, given that I am the same age as Mr. Hughes.  I am approaching 30 this year.  The work of this committee is concerned with considering the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.  Like many others involved in this meeting, I was only a child when the agreement was signed.  I am part of that generation that has benefited from the peace process.<\/p> <p>  I find it disappointing that we have reached this stage without the full implementation of the agreement.  Many elements of the agreement are still to be realised.  I refer particularly to human rights and to having a bill of rights for the North.  A committee has been established in the Assembly to deal with that aspect.  An integral part of the peace process as a whole, though, is to ensure that we have equality for all citizens.  Unfortunately, there is a rights deficit in the North.  For example, England and Scotland have an Equality Act, whereas the North does not even have that, never mind a bill of rights.  Therefore, there is still a great deal of work to do.  As the next generation of politicians, our work is cut out for us to ensure we see the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.<\/p> <p>  Reference was made to the ongoing constitutional conversation.  Of course, the Agreement provides for a peaceful and democratic pathway through which to hold a referendum.  It is fair to say that, despite the varying opinions in this respect, a legitimate conversation is under way throughout the island of Ireland.  Many people are engaging in the conversation who perhaps might not have done so before.  Ultimately, however, it will be for the people of this island to decide their own future through a potential referendum.  On that point, I would like the views of the witnesses regarding the establishment an all-island citizens' assembly.  That could include not only the constitutional conversation, but also many of the issues mentioned in the contributions.  I refer to climate change, healthcare services and education.  It would be an opportunity for citizens to engage as a whole.<\/p> <p>  I am delighted that Mr. Hughes has attended.  To pose a direct question to him, does he think that an all-island citizen' assembly would help to engage those who may identify as unionists to become involved in the debate concerning future constitutional change?  Those are my questions and Mr. Brady will follow me.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021070600002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Ms &Oacute;rfhlaith Begley"},{"type":"speech","time":1625526000,"counter":663,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Begley.

I am not the new generation, but very much the old generation.  However, I am relatively new to politics.  I was first elected to the Assembly in 2007 and then to Westminster in 2015.  I represent the constituency of Newry and Armagh, which is a Border constituency.  I think we are the second largest constituency in the North.  I am pleased to hear so many diverse views from the witnesses.  It might be worth pointing out that I have never been a councillor, but I do not know if that is a good or bad thing.  In my experience of working with councillors, though, I have found them to be the front line of any political party and often the first port of call for constituents.  Therefore, it is interesting to hear the views of the witnesses on many subjects.<\/p> <p>  Ms Begley made the point that many aspects of the Good Friday Agreement have not yet been implemented.  Human rights and all those types of issues must still be addressed.  We are also dealing to a great extent now with legacy issues.  That element affects my generation much more so than that of the witnesses.  I grew up during the 1950s and there was a campaign from 1956 right through.  I lived through much conflict, therefore, and I am grateful to have seen the advent of the Good Friday Agreement.  Some may view it as an agreement reached in a room by elite politicians, but the reality is that it has brought a great degree of peace to our society.  I suppose other issues are more relevant now such as the protocol.  I would like the views of the witnesses on that aspect, as well as the whole concept of Brexit and its effects.  I ask that because in my constituency we have seen the advantages of the protocol.  For example, one company is now able to export to nine European countries that it did not previously.  The protocol has also been an advantage in respect of local food sources and similar aspects.  Many, if not all, of the witnesses also referred to integrated education.  I would like their views on how that endeavour might be implemented.

Starting with the constitutional question, I have no issue with anyone who aspires to achieving a united Ireland through peaceful and legitimate means.  However, what is frustrating for many unionists is that nationalism still seems to be having that conversation itself and it still needs to work out what exactly it wants to do from its perspective in this regard.<\/p><p>From my perspective, there is much clamour to get unionists involved in these conversations but, ultimately, these are conversations with a predetermined outcome, which is that people want a united Ireland.  Therefore, I am more than happy for people to campaign for a united Ireland and seek whatever meetings they want to have but my focus is on the people of Northern Ireland and how we work for a better future for all of them.<\/p><p> That is where the focus of most unionists is.  I am not against engaging with people and I am here today, but there is a succinct difference between that and being involved in those conversations.  Some people have been engaged in them and the optics may have looked good for some of those pressure groups and think tanks that have had those people at their events.  However, for me, as a unionist politician and as a representative of people in Northern Ireland, my focus will be on them, on ensuring a better future for them and ensuring that happens within the United Kingdom.  If other people want to pursue this peaceful and legitimate constitutional means through whatever body they wish, that is a matter for them.  There are institutions covered by the Good Friday Agreement that we have not been making full use of in recent years and that we should be considering which would help to engage people.  Perhaps that is a matter we could examine in terms of how we can broaden them and broaden the input people have into them.<\/p><p> Regarding Brexit, our view on the protocol is very clear.  I can completely understand why people do not want a hard border or checks on the island of Ireland.  What I cannot understand is why nobody shows that same understanding towards unionist people who do not want checks on goods being moved, which in our view is within our own country, or their pets being subjected to checks to ensure they have been injected against diseases that have not existed on these islands for decades.  That is how unionists people feel.  That is the reality.  It is not only people in working class unionist areas, but it is right across the board.  There is deep anger.  I do not want to go into where the blame lies.  We often are accused of not mentioning the British Government.  Trust me, if members were to go on to the Ulster Unionist Party website and type in Boris Johnson&rsquo;s name around October, November or December 2019, they would see plenty of statements from the Ulster Unionist Party criticising the protocol and the role of the British Government in it.  The reality is we all have a responsibility in Northern Ireland, in the Republic of Ireland, in London and in Brussels to find solutions to the real problems.  People are quite frustrated.  We had a recent issue about sausages but the issue is not about sausages, rather it is the principle of the checks that angers people.  We all understand there are other ways to source goods but it is the principle of the checks that angers people.<\/p><p> Regarding Mr. Brady's final question on integrated education, if I knew the answer to how to get that implemented tomorrow, I probably would not be sitting here; I would be off doing it.  It is a tough one.  There is goodwill from various stakeholders on this, but the question is about how we get there.  My honest answer to that question is that I am not sure how we get there now.  What we see in the Northern Ireland Assembly is goodwill with respect to many issues and then five years pass, we have three consultations, the Assembly takes a break for three years and we have another three consultations, and a decade later, as we have seen with licensing laws, we finally get legislation passed that changes and updates the law.  There is a job of work to be done in the Northern Ireland Assembly to make that chamber more fit for purpose and more productive.  If people in Northern Ireland were asked what is a big issue facing them, that probably would rank high for them because there is frustration in that respect.  I come a private sector background.  I cannot understand the sloth that sometimes occurs in Stormont.  It is not a private versus public issue.  When we note comparable legislatures in Edinburgh, Cardiff, London, Dublin or wherever, more is being delivered.  Certainly, in the UK more is being delivered through devolution.  There is a piece of work to be done on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021070600002#D01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stuart Hughes","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1625526000,"counter":670,"content":"<p>I thank Councillors Carlin and Eastwood for raising their hands to indicate they want to speak.

In terms of the Northern Ireland protocol, and I understand what Councillor Hughes said about it, from my point of view and that of people in Border areas, it has been implemented as the best worst option.  The North voted against Brexit.  If checks ever had to be implemented, we wanted them to be as undisruptive as possible.  As Mr. Brady said, there are many communities located along the Border and people can move freely back and forth across it.  The majority of councillors on the panel today are Belfast centric.  I am probably the only person from a Border constituency.  I come from Derry city.  If there had to be checks, it had to be at the ports.  That was inevitable.  We saw political unionism in Westminster when unionists had a say on what was happening.  They, and Britain as a whole, rejected any sort of deal that would have allowed us to avoid any checks in terms the Single Market and the custom union.  On that angle, I empathise but there are great opportunities within the protocol in that it gives us access to the Single Market.  We have seen from news reports the massive growth in North-South trade in the recent past, which is beneficial to everyone on the island in building a stronger all-island economic unit.<br\/><br\/>In terms of a citizens&rsquo; assembly, on which Ms Begley touched, as a member of Sinn F&eacute;in, I am definitely in favour of creating whatever forums we can to engage on unionism.  In many ways political unionism might not want to engage in conversations around a united Ireland and that is understandable.  People are talking about it.  We saw polls at the start of this year, which, essentially, showed those in favour of Irish unity and those against it were neck and neck.  We have seen other polls that counteract that.  It is my belief we are heading in that direction.  It is important to have such dialogue and conversations now.  Many people, particularly unionists, are worried we will talk ourselves into a united Ireland by having these forums and discussing the issue but it is my belief we should be talking ourselves into having a united Ireland.  That is the means by which we should do it, namely, through dialogue, engagement and conversation.  I would encourage any form of citizens' assembly, civic assembly or political forums that allow us to engage and discuss all these cross-Border and all-Ireland dimensions to make that happen.  I would want to see it done in as inclusive a manner as possible.  Ms Eastwood, Mr. Hughes and myself all work collectively on our council for everyone.  I do not see why that would be any different in a united Ireland context.  <br\/><br\/>In terms of rights, and the implementation of rights under the Good Friday Agreement, there has been much talk about the establishment of a bill of rights, which I would very much like to see.  It would underpin the Good Friday Agreement.  The <i>ad hoc<\/i>committee in Stormont is working on that.  For some reason there is resistance to implementing rights in the North.  We continually see it is almost perceived that rights seem to be for one side, but that is not the case.  Rights are for everyone and they underpin and provide a safety net for all of us, be it cultural rights, social rights or rights to housing and other such issues.  <br\/><br\/>I agree with Mr. Hughes in some respects in that there is a perception that Stormont can be quite slow in terms of delivery.  That is the nature of having a five party executive and people with diametrically opposed views all trying to find consensus, which can be incredibly frustrating for those who are working on it.  It is also rewarding when we can get consensus and bring everyone along in that manner.  Those are my views in response to some of those questions.  I would be happy to take any follow-up questions. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021070600002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ryan Carlin"},{"type":"speech","time":1625526000,"counter":672,"content":"<p>I was talking to the clerk to the committee.

In terms of action on that, my party colleague, Kelly Armstrong, is bringing her Private Members' Bill on integrated education through the Assembly.  This has support so there will be progress on that shortly, which is fantastic.  In respect of the pace of legislative progress within the Assembly, my party leader, Naomi Long, who is the justice minister, has managed to bring forward two Bills relating - Domestic Abuse and Civil Proceedings Bill and, hopefully, shortly a justice Bill.  Although we note that this was not brought forward in its entirety, we managed to get approximately 70% of that through.

On the citizens' assembly, it is important to note that the city council supports the principle of citizens' assemblies on policy subjects around unity, particularly in regard to issues such as health, education and the bread and butter subjects that must be covered in any conversation on constitutional change because, at the end of the day, we must be able to present a plan, vision or idea about what the change we want to achieve looks like.  This position was arrived at by the council following an SDLP amendment to a Sinn F&eacute;in motion so I am glad that this was the direct impact of the SDLP on that conversation to make it the official policy of the council of the second largest city on the island.  An interesting consideration mentioned by Mr. Hughes concerned getting the unity campaign on the same page.  Ultimately, there are significant issues around how we lead this conversation.  As an SDLP councillor, I am glad to see the initiative my party has shown around the New Ireland Commission, which includes some members of this committee.  What is important about that conversation is that it has brought in people from many different backgrounds without any expectation on a landing point or where we expect to be in a year or two or three in respect of constitutional change but rather to sound out as many views and opinions as possible.  They are people who are open to having that conversation.  I am glad to see that.  Although the background on my screen is blurred, one of the pictures behind me in my office is of the former German Chancellor, Willy Brandt, who used to talk about Ostpolitik and the idea that to unify Germany, there needed to be a clear plan about how to make it happen to address regional economic imbalances and cultural differences.  That is a good starting point as a model for us to work towards unity and understanding that we need a plan.  We need something to be able to grow so we can say that this is our vision and this is the future.<\/p> <p>  I know Mr. Hughes has said he does not want to get into the blame game around the protocol but I will be honest in saying this is a consequence of the Brexit the DUP, the Conservative Party and the European Research Group all pushed for.  It is quite unfortunate that this is the position we have ended up in.  Others on this call have advocated for different positions that would have ameliorated some of those issues.  As I said earlier, I was chairperson of Belfast City Council's Brexit committee in my first year on the council.  Some of the warnings we faced regarding the impact on trade, businesses, particularly manufacturers in the city, and quite simply council resources to follow through with required checks were pretty stark.  This is why so many parties and individuals advocated for the softest possible measures relating to Brexit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021070600002#F00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. S&eacute;amas de Faoite"},{"type":"speech","time":1625526000,"counter":679,"content":"<p>I must move on to Ms Groogan but I will give Mr. de Faoite the first option after the next speaking slot.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021070600002#F00700","speaker":"1598"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1625526000,"counter":680,"content":"<p>Most of what I intended to say about the protocol and the citizens' assembly has been covered quite well by Ms Eastwood and Mr. de Faoite.  I agree that there is no harm in having conversations.  The last thing anyone ever wants to have is Brexit part II where we have a vote on something when people have very little understanding of what it means in reality.  With Brexit, we have seen is very much like playing off that.  We have been very supportive of a people's vote on what the final deal would have looked like.  What we are seeing now is the outworkings of unpreparedness and the fact that we were thrown into something where nobody knew what was coming down the line.<\/p> <p>  I will pick up on the point regarding inefficiencies at Stormont made by Mr. Hughes.  This is true.  We are all pretty frustrated with the lack of progress on many issues.  A simple example that is affecting us as councillors is the legislation on meeting remotely.  Legislation was rushed through last year, which was great, but nobody realised that there was a deadline set in that, which meant that come 3 May 2021, under the legislation, we could not longer meet remotely.  We are still waiting for that legislation to finally come into effect.  It was pretty minor.  It seemed to be a case of a copy and paste of what was there last year and change the date yet, we are taking months to get that through.  If this is how it takes to do that, what hope do we have of anything else?  <\/p> <p>  The point about integrated education is a great one.<\/p><p>Nobody is saying that he or she does not want integrated education.  We have seen little coming through in terms of making that a reality in Northern Ireland.  It is up to parents and schools to drive that.  There is no government push to make that happen.  I welcome a Private Members' Bill coming through on that, but this is an executive job.  It should be doing it but it is not.  Serious questions should be asked as to why it is still left to parents to drive this.  There are more and more barriers put in their way.  I pay tribute to the likes of the integrated education fund, which does incredible work to try to support those who do want to make that change.  Many more people want that option.  The Lagan Valley school is just outside my South Belfast constituency.  It is probably the most over-subscribed school in Northern Ireland.  There is serious appetite there, yet government policy fails so many children and parents who want that option.  I will round it up there because time is of the essence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021070600002#F00800","nonspeaker":"Ms &Aacute;ine Groogan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1625526000,"counter":682,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Groogan for co-operating with me.

I know he was going to be late, but he had hoped to make the meeting.  I will start for now.<\/p> <p>  I welcome all contributors today.  It is good to see young faces with such a keen interest in Northern Ireland politics.  They have a diverse range of views.  Sometimes, I feel like I am banging my head off a wall, because we are missing that diverse range of views in our own committee.  It is great to see someone like Councillor Stuart Hughes; we have been lacking that insight to unionism.  He is very welcome today.  All of the presentations were good.  In ways, I would love to see the likes of Councillors Ryan Carlin and Stuart Hughes getting together in a room.  It is smart of me to say that, but I do not mean it from that point of view.<\/p> <p>  It is young people, like our witnesses, in politics who can make a difference.  As many said, down the years, too many have gone down the political lines of identity.  Back in the days of the Good Friday Agreement, political parties were on either side of the divide.  The SDLP was stuck in the middle trying to pull them together.  I wonder who the new leaders are going to be in Northern Ireland.  It will take people stepping up to the parapet.  It will take new leaders and people who have foresight.  Some of our witnesses may be the new, young leaders who we will look towards, hopefully in the not-too-distant future.  The leaders will be those who will go out there with an open mind and put out the hand of friendship.  They will be those who are interested in going into a room and letting down their political guard to sort out issues, a bit like what Ian Paisley and Martin McGuinness did.  I, for one, look forward to seeing who those new leaders in Northern Ireland will be.  That is critical in finding solutions up there.<\/p> <p>  On the idea of a Border poll and this question of unity, I am as much a believer in a united Ireland as anybody at this meeting.  However, I will steer away from talking about it.  For me, it is putting the cart before the horse.<\/p> <p>  Many issues were touched on, such as issues with the Northern Ireland protocol.  A number of speakers alluded to different ways of having conversations.  I find that many political parties in Northern Ireland are not willing to identify with the shared island unit in the Taoiseach's Department.  There is a fantastic amount of work being done within that unit.  There is dialogue ongoing with roughly 150 organisations, community groups, and businesses across Northern Ireland.  These dialogues are about issues existing within Northern Ireland, with a view to working towards a shared future.  Some &euro;40 million was released yesterday to start research on a North-South basis which will be critical research to identify the barriers to our shared future.  It will critical research for institutions, so they can realise what is missing in society, on the Border, or in Northern Ireland.  They will then be able to identify what needs to be put in place to create a better economy, better opportunities within Northern Ireland, and to attract investments to create high-end jobs for the children of the future.  I would like to know the witnesses' views on the shared island unit.  Are they pro the shared island unit and its work or are they against it?  Do they see issues with it?  I would like to get their views.<\/p> <p>  The dialogue today has been good.  I would be interested in working with our young witnesses in the future.  Without picking anybody's presentations, many interesting issues have been raised today.  There is great opportunity to continue this dialogue and not just leave it here today.  We should keep working on this, whether in this group or with a wider one.  A sub-forum could be worth considering.<\/p> <p>  I am interested in hearing the views of those presenting today on the shared island unit and what is happening within it.  I would also be interested in any questions they have in relation to it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021070600002#G00300","speaker":"1633"},{"type":"speech","time":1625526000,"counter":684,"content":"<p>Does Deputy Brendan Smith wish to ask any questions at this stage?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021070600002#G00400","speaker":"1598"},{"type":"speech","time":1625526000,"counter":685,"content":"<p>I welcome the contributions of our guests.  I will add to what Senator Niall Blaney said.  One message came across particularly clearly in the contributions of Ms Groogan, Mr. de Faoite, and Ms Eastwood.  That was the frustration with the lack of progress on some political issues.  We express frustration at times in regard to how slowly policies are implemented.  However, this was clear in the witnesses' messages.<\/p> <p>  On other occasions in this committee, I have referred to a citizen's assembly which was mentioned by witnesses, including the Sinn F&eacute;in councillor from Derry City and Strabane District Council.  Provision was made for a Civic Forum for Northern Ireland in the 1998 Good Friday Agreement.  That was first mooted in the multi-party talks.  It was championed by the then Northern Ireland Women's Coalition, NIWC.  Provision was made for that.  The Civic Forum for Northern Ireland was established in 2000.  It met last in 2002.  In the Stormont House Agreement, provision was made for the establishment of a civic advisory panel.  The purpose of a civic forum or advisory panel is to give a mechanism and means to consult civic society.  Oftentimes, we get a better understanding of social, economic and cultural issues through these.  Throughout the world, civic fora or advisory panels have been a popular feature of political work and the political process.  Again, that has not been established in Stormont.  Do the witnesses, within their own political parties, exert any pressure to have such a panel established?<\/p><p>They have all talked about the merit of an all-Ireland citizens' assembly.  There is a mechanism in place, that, unfortunately, has not been implemented, where wider society could be consulted.  Ms Eastwood said it is good to talk and listen and good for all of us to learn from other viewpoints as well.  It struck me on the day we had Mr. Murphy of Ireland's Future that he agreed with me on that issue.  He said a civic advisory panel or civic form could be a \"tangible and meaningful\" process within Stormont and the existing political architecture.  Is there any momentum or any efforts made within the political parties to implement that aspect of the Stormont House Agreement and, indeed, of its predecessor, the Good Friday Agreement?<\/p><p> I welcome their contributions, as Senator Blaney said.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021070600002#G00500","speaker":"1556","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1625526000,"counter":687,"content":"<p>I do not know who is offering to reply.

We have more shared housing now in Northern Ireland than we have ever had.  We have more people wanting to live together.  However, what we have seen, unfortunately recently, is intimidation, whether that be through people writing messages on walls or erecting symbols that are unwanted.  That is the conversation that we need to have in a way we did not fully realise when the Good Friday Agreement was signed.  People then got into the day and daily.<\/p> <p>  Ms Groogan mentioned carve-up politics.  I might throw in words as well.  \"Clientelism\" sometimes appeared.

I am quite proud of the fact that in my electoral area we have been able to achieve that on a number of different issues.  As I said in my opening statement, four political traditions are represented at council level in Lisnasharragh - SDLP, Green Party, Alliance Party and DUP.  We disagree on many issues, not least constitutional questions.  Even when it gets down to the pure economics of politics, we have very different outlooks but we have an ability to work the common ground on the places and things that we agree on for the benefit of our constituents.<\/p> <p>  Unlike previous occasions where people in elected office may have been cautious about making that kind of work public for fear perhaps of electoral recrimination or response, we have been honest in saying that we work together and we achieve results because of that.  Whether that is on the impetus to try to get more dedicated cycling and walking infrastructure in our constituency, which we have all worked together on, whether it is on the regeneration of the Creggan Road area in Lisnasharragh, which had been a bustling shopping part of east Belfast, or whether it is on local policing issues and trying to support residents in respect of crime and anti-social behaviour, we have all been able to work together on those issues.  That work has been recognised.  Our incoming lord mayor, in her first speech in the role, made it clear that she wanted all of us to try to emulate that kind of partnership approach.  I am quite proud of that and I would encourage others to try and take that approach.  We can still disagree.  We can still have political arguments and discussions where we disagree on issues and hold clear by our principles.  Hume quite often talked about principled disagreement and the need for principled compromise rather than compromised principles.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the shared island unit, the only disappointment is that it came after the passing of former Senator, Maurice Hayes, who would have been very interested in the work of the unit.  I recall his work in the National Forum on Europe on breaking down barriers and looking at ways to include as many people as possible in political debate.<\/p> <p>  I welcome the fact that the shared island unit means money on the ground.  I note Senator McGahon is on the call here.  Mr. Chris Hazzard MP from South Down would recognise the great move forward on Narrow Water Bridge and the welcome progress there - I look forward to seeing more progress on that particular project - and the announcement yesterday on research investment.  The latter will make a big difference in south Belfast in the presence of the two main universities.<\/p> <p>  Finally, on the civic forum, part of the difficulty has been that a huge amount of our time and exertion has been put into keeping the Assembly alive, never mind any other bodies that might be associated with it.  It has taken up a great deal of the political capital, in one instance, to get the political institutions back up and running after three years without government and, on other occasions, to try to keep them running when we have stuttered from crisis to crisis over the past 14 years.  That is, I suppose, a partisan issue.  I would be honest about that.<\/p> <p>  I would like to see a greater form of civic engagement.  The SDLP has previously proposed successful motions in the Assembly calling for the civic forum to be re-established.<\/p> <p>  I share some of Ms Eastwood's concerns on clientelism.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021070600002#H01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. S&eacute;amas de Faoite"},{"type":"speech","time":1625526000,"counter":699,"content":"<p>I must stop Mr. de Faoite there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021070600002#H01400","speaker":"1598"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1625526000,"counter":700,"content":"<p>The model for civic assemblies that worked in the Republic regarding the eighth amendment referendum and the equal marriage referendum was that they brought in individual voices as well as those representing groups and made sure that people-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021070600002#H01500","nonspeaker":"Mr. S&eacute;amas de Faoite"},{"type":"speech","time":1625526000,"counter":701,"content":"<p>I must call Ms Groogan.

Much like what Mr. de Faoite said, the one good example of that in Northern Ireland is councils.  It is often forgotten how well councils in Northern Ireland operate.  We have genuine power-sharing on most councils across Northern Ireland and we get on with the day-to-day work.  There is the odd argument - do not worry about that - but we get on with the day-to-day issues.  That can often get lost.  I work just as well with some of the DUP councillors as I do with the Sinn F&eacute;in, with Alliance, SDLP and People Before Profit.  We all work well together.  One has to.  I am one of four Green Party councillors in Belfast.  If I want anything done, I must work with other parties.  I hope we do so quite successfully.<\/p> <p>  What I would say on the shared island unit is that it is good to see it coming forward.  It had to happen.  As I said in my opening statement, climate knows no borders.<\/p><p>Many other issues know no borders - east, west, north and south.  Anything that helps increase that dialogue and helps us work on common issues is important.  There is an idea that they are focusing firmly on creating a united Ireland.  That is not right, but it is important that we work on those issues and have those conversations - and they are difficult conversations.  Whether we like it, we share Northern Ireland.  The UK and Ireland share an island and a Border.  That is the reality.   We need to start grappling with that more and with the hard issues.  There is not going to be a perfect space here but we have to learn to get on with it and get work done.  There is more that unites us than divides us.  We are often caught up in binaries that are not helpful or conducive to getting work done.  I hope the new political leaders coming through can start to break down those barriers a little more.  We are coming with slightly less baggage than some of the older generation.<\/p><p> We have also been supportive of the civic forum.  We have seen civic society move on that in Northern Ireland with the Building Change Trust starting that model a couple of years ago through a pilot project.  It is necessary.  In my opening statement, I said that the people's agreement has been changed without the consent of the people.  Something like a civic forum would be a useful way to revitalise the political institutions in Northern Ireland.  It is about giving the power back to the people in terms of what they want to see and to move on.  Mr. de Faoite mentioned the examples in the South where people were very much ahead of the politicians.  If it had been left to the D&aacute;il, we would still be in the same position in respect of the eighth amendment.  We saw what happened when the power was given to the people and their voices could shine through.<\/p><p> I will wind it up there.

Off the bat, Sinn F&eacute;in and I work and engage with unionism every day.  Sometimes there is a perception south of the Border that Sinn F&eacute;in and the DUP are constantly at loggerheads.  We are in terms of equality and rights issues.  I know that Ms Groogan touched on the eighth amendment.  Marriage equality was an issue for a long time.  Acht na Gaeilge was another issue.<\/p> <p>  We work, where possible, to find consensus.  We try to work with unionism every day, but at times, it is impossible.  There are parties that are more progressive in their outlook and parties that are not.  It becomes incredibly difficult to deal with those issues.  I sit, as one of two Sinn F&eacute;in representatives, on a majority unionist council in Lisburn and Castlereagh, along with Mr. Hughes.  We work every day to deal with issues.  We have the odd spat, but we engage positively and try to build consensus where we can.  I would like to dispel any myths or beliefs that we do not engage or work together; we do, and try our best to do so.  <\/p> <p>  The shared island unit is a positive step for the Irish Government to take in terms of connectivity across the island in respect of transport.  I believe there has been discussion of the possibility of developing the University of Ulster's Magee campus.  The Narrow Water Bridge project received funding recently to link the North and South better.  I would like the unit to move further and work towards Irish unity.  Sometimes we forget that the North does not exist in isolation.  Many geopolitical factors also come into play, which I believe we need to prepare for.  We only have to look to Scotland, where there is a majority in favour of Scottish independence in the Scottish Parliament.  What would our process or reaction be if Scotland were to obtain independence?  Are we prepared for the political outworkings of that or what might be on offer?  We should look towards greater integration and potentially for a move towards Irish unity.  That is obviously an Irish republican's point of view.  I would like the shared island unit take that step further.  As was previously stated by Professor Colin Harvey, when he appeared before the committee, a united Ireland is a shared Ireland.  That is the message that we need to put across and it is what we want to see.<\/p> <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in is 100% in favour of the civic forum and will continue to push to have it implemented.  It is also important to have an all-island outlook on this.  Sometimes we look at the Six Counties in a small, narrow manner in respect of what we can do to better integrate or connect people.  There are also barriers between the North and South and barriers along the Border.  More broadly, there are barriers between Belfast and Dublin.  We need to move to better align people's thinking and integration both in a North-South capacity as well as within the North.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021070600002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ryan Carlin"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1625526000,"counter":706,"content":"<p>To reassure members, I confirm that Mr. Carlin and I have been in a room together many times, just not often in the past 18 months, unfortunately.  I agree with what he said.  Some members of Belfast City Council are attending the meeting.  They will not thank me for saying it, but one of my biggest frustrations with councils is when councillors try to turn councils into mini-Stormonts and we have to debate every issue under the sun.  It just poisons our politics even more.  What is important at a council level is working together and delivering for people.  Our council is involved in some exciting projects.  Councils were reorganised in Northern Ireland in 2014.  There is still a Lisburn-Castlereagh split on our council and a back and forth as a result.  It requires people to be more geographically aligned than they are party aligned on some issues, which is an interesting development.  That work happens on a daily basis.  There are things being delivered for people.<\/p> <p>  We need to be careful around the three-stranded approach of the agreement.  We must ensure that we go back to first principles.  The concern of any unionist will always be that the strand 1 issues are for the people of Northern Ireland.  The issue we have currently with forums, or whatever it is, is that it is all framed in the narrative around the unity debate.  That is where the danger lies from a unionist perspective.  I would also like to point out that there are bodies that exist, the North-South Ministerial Council, for example, which are not functioning the way they should be.  I also wish to highlight that North-South co-operation has to work both ways.  There has been frustration in Northern Ireland during the pandemic, which was something that none of us ever saw coming, that, frankly, some of that co-operation has not been there at times.  It is the case in respect of the issues around passenger locator forms, the sharing of data and the hoops that had to be jumped through for that to happen.  If some of the measures that were brought in relating to travel restrictions were introduced in Northern Ireland, they would not have been accepted by politicians in the Republic.  <\/p> <p>  I caution that we have work to do.  Politicians have to set the example.  That leadership starts at ministerial level.  If people turn on the television news and see politicians not being able to agree on issues in times when they should 100% be in agreement, that sets the tone for everything else that follows.  I accept that certain people want to frame all things North-South on a constitutional basis.  Bodies that exist can be used for engagement and we need to make more of.  We should do that.  We will not shy away from talking to people.  However, we also have to respect the other relationships within Northern Ireland and east-west, which are under increasing threat currently, according to the views of many unionists.  That is critical for us all moving forward.  We need to get back to the first principles to begin with and move from there.  Now is not the time to make giant leaps.  Relationships are in a fragile state.<\/p><p>We need to get back to basics in that regard.  Part of the reason I am attending this meeting is to speak, listen and get the views of committee members.  That is what we need to do.  I appreciate that significant work was done behind the scenes by Irish Governments over many years and there were many conversations.  As a unionist and looking to the South and to Dublin, I know people who understand Northern Ireland and the fragility of those relationships but there are others who simply do not understand that or, frankly, do not care about it.  If they did, they would not have said or done some of the things they have said or done.  We all have to be careful with the language we use.  There is a lot of focus on unionists at the moment and the rhetoric that some unionists may be using.  That works both ways.  It is about getting back to first principles and having those conversations, which do not need to be publicised or broadcast, because there are opportunities.  People will speak and listen.  Everyone in the unionist community in Northern Ireland to whom I have spoken wants better for the people.  They want better education, better jobs and better housing.  We cannot frame everything simply on a North-South basis within the constitutional-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021070600002#J00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stuart Hughes","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1625526000,"counter":708,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Hughes for his contribution.

Mr. Hughes touched on one of the questions I intended to ask, which is whether there is a disconnect between perceptions in the South and what is happening in the North?  Are we in the South in touch in that regard?  I want the meeting to be about asking questions and listening to responses.  Although there may be a perception in the South that everything in the North is seen through the constitutional lens, all of us do not see everything through it.  It is important to acknowledge that the dynamics are shifting but that we share an island and, whatever constitutional change may bring, we have to commit ourselves to the principles of the Good Friday Agreement, working together and having North-South co-operation.<\/p> <p>  What three things do our guest consider important at the moment that may not have been discussed?  What is coming up for them as important issues?  Is legacy an important issue for their generation of politicians?  Do they consider that we need to find a framework that works to move on?  How significant is the legacy of trauma in their everyday political work?  <\/p> <p>  I refer to \"others\".  I like the move away from binary politics to much more pluralist politics and giving everybody a voice.  When people say they do not wish to go back to the way things were, sometimes that relates to the absence of peace, but it also needs to relate to binary politics.

It is good to have the perspective of people who grew up as part of the Agreement generation.  <\/p> <p> My questions are for all our guests.  One of the biggest aspirations of John Hume was the concept of unity.  How does that concept of unity fit in with the current circumstances, particularly in the context of Brexit?  As Senator Currie stated, it is not a binary conversation any more; it is much more pluralist.  People are having these conversations based on a much wider political identity for Ireland than unionism or nationalism.  In that context, what is currently the biggest barrier in Northern Ireland to a potentially united Ireland?<\/p> <p>  I was struck by the remarks of Ms Groogan in respect of being an \"other\".  What is the best way, in her view or that of our other guests, to stop people of our generation, that is, those under the age of 30, falling into the same nationalist or unionist trope?  What is the best way to suggest there is another path and it is the middle of the road?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021070600002#K00400","speaker":"1670"},{"type":"speech","time":1625526000,"counter":711,"content":"<p>As a member of Fine Gael, I wish to ask a few questions.  The key message from many of those who addressed the committee was the future of the Northern Ireland economy.  The biggest disadvantage it faces is the fact that a significant number of graduates leave Northern Ireland to work elsewhere.  I understand that Northern Ireland has the highest proportion of early school-leavers in Britain and Northern Ireland.  There is a significant deficit as many people who do not have a third-level education stay in Northern Ireland, while those who do have such qualifications leave.   Another issue that was strongly raised is that of infrastructure deficit, particularly as one goes across the North to counties Derry, Donegal, Fermanagh, Tyrone and so on.  If we can address those issues, we can make a much happier community that is more satisfied in terms of employment, has a higher standard of living and, I hope, much more unity of purpose.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021070600002#K00500","speaker":"1598"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1625526000,"counter":712,"content":"<p>There is quite a lot to cover there.  I will try to be as succinct as possible.<\/p> <p>  As regards the question on perceptions, it is always an interesting issue to consider.  It works both ways.  I often think about this as one who lives 100 miles from Dublin.  I visit Dublin three or four times a year and, in traditional middle-class Protestant fashion, usually to attend a rugby or cricket match.  We travel down and have a great time and then get the train home.  I often wonder how often I would visit London if I lived 100 miles from it.  I suspect it would be far more often.  I hope to go to London this weekend.  It relates somewhat to perception.  Culturally and socially, it is not that unionists do not recognise that there is another part of the island on which we live; of course, we do.  I am sure it is the same for some people in the South.<\/p><p>Our backgrounds and the way we were brought up and live means that the rest of the island does not feature as heavily in our psyche.  It is worrying in some ways, and that goes both ways.  However, more people from the Republic of Ireland have probably visited Northern Ireland in the past six weeks than in almost the past six years.  I hope that will help perceptions, especially of Belfast and ensure that it is seen as a modern, vibrant city.  <\/p><p> My gut feeling on this issue is that there is a lack of understanding across the board and that works both ways.  There are exceptions.  I go back to what I said earlier.  We must be careful about what we say and how that is perceived.  We had another instance of that yesterday, and not from somebody in Northern Ireland or the Republic of Ireland.  The chair of the Northern Ireland affairs select committee at Westminster showed appalling judgement for somebody in that role.  If we continue to see people, whether at Westminster, D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann or in Stormont, making statements they know or should know are not going to be accepted by people and are going to inflame tensions, we are not going to get anywhere in changing those perceptions either.  We will just end up getting into this game of saying: &ldquo;There are those unionists giving out again because somebody said something about bonfires&rdquo;.  It might be the case, but in this instance it was because what that chairman said was stupid.  <\/p><p> That is the reality of the situation here and why we must be careful.  We must deal with this issue of perception by engaging with each other and by encouraging people to visit.  It is possible to get a better perception of a place outside of politics.  I am that annoying guy in the bars in Belfast who starts talking to all these southern tourists who have been coming up in recent weeks.  My mates abandon ship, but I love those kinds of conversations because those are normal people behaving as if they were anywhere.  Regarding the biggest barrier to unity, that is not a question for me to address.  I imagine, however, that I am probably a part of that barrier, but it may be a question for others to answer regarding what they see as the barriers.

We are not considered of the same strand.  Often people will ask what can be done to make it easier for unionists and what can be done to engage with unionism.  However, a massive cohort of people who also live in the North do not just consider themselves to be but actually are Irish citizens.  I often think that our voice is misrepresented or left unheard.  Therefore, it would also be great to see more engagement with people of an Irish background.  I do not want to use the terms \"unionist\" or \"nationalist\", and some parties represented here designate themselves as \"other\".  Therefore, we are in a relatively new position where people who have voted for those \"other\" parties do not seem to have an opinion now on whether they are in favour of Irish unification or of the union.  They most certainly do, however, and recent polling in January has shown that only 7% of people said that they did not know whether they wanted Irish unity or to keep the union with Britain.<\/p> <p>  It is also important to recognise that people might not designate themselves as nationalist, and I know plenty of people who have moved away from doing that.  There are obviously negative connotations with the term when we look at English or British nationalism and sometimes people here do not designate now as either nationalist or unionist.  However, they certainly do still believe themselves to be Irish.  Emma de Souza often says that she does not designate.  She is not a nationalist or a unionist, but she strongly considers herself to be Irish and went to the courts to assert that point and reinforce the Good Friday Agreement in that regard.  I wanted to make that point, because sometimes we get caught up in believing that because people may not vote for parties that designate as nationalist or unionist that they may no longer have an opinion on the constitutional question.  <\/p> <p>  Turning to the economy of the North and its integration, as well as educational access, which was also mentioned, those aspects are vitally important.  Many people leave the North and do not seem to ever come back.

I am not nationalist and I am not unionist.  I absolutely am not and I do not take a position on that.  However, I do consider myself to be Irish, and Northern Irish as well.  I will be blunt, though.  I lived in Dublin for four or five years when I was at college.  I lost count of the number of times that I was told I was not Irish.  As someone who considered myself Irish all my life to that point, it blew my mind to go to Dublin and then be told that I was not Irish.  I had many conversations with people there to try to help them to understand the reality of Northern Ireland and what it has gone through over the years and what that experience means now.  Therefore, I believe there is a massive disconnect across the Border, including looking southwards as well.<\/p> <p>  Senator Currie spoke about trauma and that is a massive issue that we often do not deal with.  The leader of my party, Clare Bailey, often says that what we have had in Northern Ireland has been a political process and not a peace process.  She states that because we have failed to confront and deal with the legacy of our past.  Inequity and division are still rife.  I refer to our school and housing, which are still segregated.  We live segregated lives, physically and psychologically.  Of course, we also still have the issue of paramilitaries, who often masquerade as community representatives, continuing to coercively control entire communities.  Intergenerational trauma is threatening another generation coming into its own now.  We have seen it happening.  We have all seen the much-quoted statistic about the number of deaths by suicide in Northern Ireland since 1998 being greater than the total of those who died during the Troubles.  That is a shocking state of affairs and it is something I deal with day in, day out.  I do a great deal of case work as a councillor and in my day job.  I see many people every day who have been left completely traumatised.  It is a trauma that we never deal with and that we have just doubled down on it many times.   <\/p> <p>  I mentioned the benefits system and how it treats people as well.  It is an issue we must grapple with.  We can talk all we want about looking forward and about ideas for a united Ireland or whatever.  However, the reality is that we have not moved far enough from where we were in 1998.  We have not done what we needed to do to move Northern Ireland forward.  Therefore, to try to look ahead is like trying to run before we can walk.  We must not lose sight of the fact that we are still dealing with the legacy of our past.  We must deal with it.  We cannot just pretend it is not there.  However, there has been a complete unwillingness to deal with this issue in Stormont, Westminster and the Oireachtas.  My perspective is that we need to establish an independent and international truth and reconciliation process.  That is the only way we will move forward.  <\/p> <p>  Regarding the best way to stop people falling into the nationalist-unionist divide, I would not frame it like that.  It is within people's rights to have that as part of their political identity and aspirations.  However, one major thing we spoke about earlier is integrated education.  It must be our route out of this current situation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021070600002#L00500","nonspeaker":"Ms &Aacute;ine Groogan"},{"type":"speech","time":1625526000,"counter":718,"content":"<p>I must call Mr. de Faoite.

I reiterate my thanks to Senator McGahon for making this session happen.  I hope this is the start of further engagement that this group can be involved in.<\/p><p> Taking Senator Currie's question first, I have to agree with Ms Groogan about perceptions of the North in the South.  I lived in Clondalkin, which is not far from Dublin West, for ten years and I know the area quite well.  Similarly, I had to deal with mixed and strange perceptions about the North from people in Dublin.  That is a real mindset barrier that has to be challenged.  Like Mr. Hughes, I believe tourism is a major opportunity to try to break down some of the misconceptions, and to allow people from the South to understand that Belfast as a region, in particular, has moved on significantly even in the past 20 years.  We face not insignificant challenges that have to be overcome, but certainly the iterations of violence that we have seen on our streets are not an indication of how the rest of the city is or of the welcome we extend to people who come to visit.<\/p><p> Senator Currie asked about identifying three particular issues that are coming to the fore.  All of us have witnessed challenges with the provision of healthcare over the past year because of the pandemic.  We are particularly aware of them in the North because of the challenges we face with hospital waiting lists and the political failure to deal with these issues.  We are told there is political consensus on reform but, quite frankly, sometimes there has not been the political will to deliver it or to provide the political support to the minister to be able to carry through some of the reforms to deliver the excellent healthcare service we need.  The NHS has been spectacular in how it has responded to, and dealt with, the issues in the pandemic, but fundamentally there are 350,000 people on hospital waiting lists.  Coming out of the worst stages of the pandemic, we have to deal with a serious crisis.<\/p><p> There is also a severe fear of us sliding backwards.  I said in my opening contribution that I was born on the day a massacre occurred in my local community.  I was told throughout my life that I would never have to experience the type of pain and suffering people in my area have been through, but I woke up one morning to find out that my friend had been shot dead on the streets of Derry.  My generation was told we would never have to experience that pain.  There is a sense and fear that with the continued emergence of paramilitary organisations, we are sliding backwards.  Resources and support must be put into tackling paramilitarism and breaking the stranglehold that those organisations have over local communities, so nobody else from our generation of young elected representatives or the generation that follows has to go through that as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021070600002#L00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. S&eacute;amas de Faoite","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1625526000,"counter":721,"content":"<p>I have to call Ms Eastwood now.

In fact, as Mr. Carlin said, many people have moved away from that.  Certain, in the latest council elections in my constituency of Lagan Valley the Alliance Party of Northern Ireland topped the poll in every district.  We then had a historic electoral result in the December 2019 general election.  Basically, one saw there the change in communities across Northern Ireland.  The Alliance Party of Northern Ireland is no longer something that people used to regard decades ago as a wasted vote.  That has not been the case.  Indeed, that move away from unionist or nationalist parties and people going for either our party, the Green Party, People Before Profit or whoever it may be is a good thing.<\/p> <p>  Many people will not recognise the priorities or some of the remarks in the conversation we have had this morning, valuable as it is.  They want to talk about health, jobs and education.  We often talk about rights, but often the rights of children are ignored in terms of extremely long waits for educational statements.  We have the worst waiting lists in the UK.  Our health and social care staff are stretched beyond belief.  We need to do something that incorporates those issues into the mainstream, rather than the traditional shibboleths.  As the old saying goes, people often move a lot faster than politics.  I believe we are seeing that happening now in Northern Ireland, where people are moving away from that.  That is to be welcomed.<\/p> <p>  In terms of some of the thorny issues we have not mentioned, although Ms Groogan and Mr. de Faoite have mentioned tackling paramilitarism, we have tried to bring forward through the justice Department and the minister, Ms Naomi Long MLA, some of the issues around unexplained wealth orders, which seek to tackle the horrible symptoms of paramilitarism within communities, and the issue we still have of paramilitary attacks, one of which unfortunately took place last night in the North Down constituency.  We still have those realities.  We still have people erecting flags and banners and burning emblems.  Those are some of the realities and, while they are not representative of the vast majority of people, they still occur.  The issue of the wall in the mind that I spoke about earlier is evident.  It is great to have these conversations and I believe it was Ms Groogan who said that we need to have some more of these before we start looking to other places, because there is no point in having these conversations if we cannot understand ourselves.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021070600002#M00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Sorcha Eastwood"},{"type":"speech","time":1625526000,"counter":723,"content":"<p>I have to call Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n and we must finish at 11.30 a.m.  I apologise for the shortness of time, but it is not under our control.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021070600002#M00400","speaker":"1598"},{"type":"speech","time":1625526000,"counter":724,"content":"<p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an coiste.  I have a few quick questions.  Regarding what Ms Groogan and Mr. de Faoite said about people in the South often not recognising the Irishness of people in the North of Ireland, sometimes the media on this island are also partitionist and the conversations we have are inward looking within the jurisdictions rather than about the bigger picture of the island as a whole.  That could be a cause sometimes.  Have the witnesses been contacted in their positions as elected representatives about foods, medicines or other products not being available due to the protocol?  The feedback I am getting in the North is that elected representatives are not being contacted in general on that issue.  It would be interesting to hear their experience of that.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of all-Ireland co-operation, regardless of what background we are from, there is no doubt sections of the North are massively economically strapped because of a lack of co-operation and because the Border is, to a certain extent, a man-made barrier to movement, trade and business.  I did a study in the North a number of years ago among people from all the different communities and they said that if we fund, plan and deliver services together, they will be better services, will have a more positive effect on people and will be more efficient as a result.<\/p> <p>  Another contributor spoke earlier about he feels that he should not speak about Irish unity at present.  It is shocking that the T&aacute;naiste was castigated for expressing the view that he felt there would be a united Ireland in his lifetime.  Surely we must get to a situation that if we articulate views on a united Ireland or the union between the North of Ireland and Britain in a respectful fashion, that is perfectly legitimate and welcome.

The idea of pluralism is that we do not necessarily have to wear each other's clothes, but we can be who we are to our full extent.  Everybody in their community or group has the right to reach his or her full potential without fear or favour from the state.  It is not necessarily about blending into a new identity, but that the existing identities are perfectly right and proper and can be what they are to their full extent without any negativity as a result.<\/p> <p>  There are some observations for the witnesses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021070600002#M00500","speaker":"1504"},{"type":"speech","time":1625526000,"counter":725,"content":"<p>If our witnesses wish to respond to the Deputy, they can send a note by email or by letter directly to him.<\/p><p>If you wish to communicate further with any of us you may do so through the clerk of the committee who will make sure we get it.

Beat 102-103 is Ireland's first regional radio station.  We target those aged between 15 and 34 in counties Waterford, Wexford, Carlow, Kilkenny and south Tipperary.  I am joined today by our associate director at Spark Market Research, Megan Reynolds, who will field specific questions on the research carried out, should members have any.  I will begin by reading some of the communication we received directly to the radio station from our listeners: \"My life has become incredibly hard, and I have nowhere to turn, please can you help me\"; \"My mental health hasn&rsquo;t been the best of late ... today I'm struggling but you have made me smile\"; \"I was feeling suicidal a few months back, thanks for helping me get the support I needed\".<\/p> <p>  A total of 3.1 million people in Ireland tune in to radio every day.  It is an important live immediate platform where real stories are heard and responded to by real people every day.  Over the past year, Beat 102-103 has seen an increase in communication from young people verbalising their mental health struggles.  With 42% prime time market share we know they listen to us throughout the day.  We felt it crucial that we understood what they were going through and how to help them.  This is why we commissioned Spark Market Research to conduct a study entitled \"My So Called Covid Life\".  The findings of the BAI-funded research are grim.  A total of 83% of respondents said their mental health has been negatively impacted by the pandemic.  Worryingly, 73% who were affected mentally said they had yet to avail of any support service to help them better cope with their mental health concerns.  This was the big takeaway for us.  If they are feeling like this now how will they feel in six to 12 months if they have not availed of services.  Also, seven out of ten respondents said they believed the Government does not understand their age group.  They feel they are not being heard.  The research indicates a clear disconnect between the Government and this demographic, with a quarter revealing they do not know who the Taoiseach is or believing that it is the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Leo Varadkar.<\/p> <p>  We asked students to describe their experiences in lockdown.  They could have picked any positive or negative word.  The four top words they chose to describe their experiences were \"bored\", \"stressed\", \"depressed\" and \"anxious\".  They need help now more than ever.  Sadly, they do not always know where to go or who to talk to.  I want to share two examples with the committee of how radio stations have helped young people in the past year.  Committee members are familiar with the work of SpunOut.  We have worked with SpunOut to raise awareness of its new free text line 50808.  This has been shared on every radio station in Ireland.  It was great for us to hear that Ian Powers said that radio had directly help the organisation to successfully recruit hundreds of candidates to its volunteer programme.<\/p><p>The Spark research has also shown that young girls are really concerned about their future and have been emotionally impacted by the various lockdowns.  Beat along with the other three leading youth radio stations -  iRadio, Spin and Spin South West - all teamed up with the national social enterprise group The Shona Project in March and presented Shine 2021, which was the first of its kind.  This was a virtual online event that targeted young women by young women.  We had 40,000 registrations over three days with 80 female inspirational speakers from Ireland.  The content was viewed over 1 million times across the three days.  We saw this as a really good example that demonstrated the power of collaboration and joined-up thinking.  <\/p><p> Youth radio is a powerful platform where youngsters are reaching out and letting our presenters know that they are hurting.  We take our responsibility in this regard very seriously.  Our presenters have been trained in HSE Safe Talk-Living Works Start suicide prevention programmes but we know from organisations like the National Youth Council of Ireland and SpunOut that youth services are grossly understaffed.  As CEO of a youth station, if I am encouraging our Beat presenters to direct our valued and often vulnerable listeners to a service, I need to be confident their needs are going to be met when they pick up the phone or text the crisis text line.  Consequently, the station 100% backs the call from the National Youth Council of Ireland for both a youth employment task force and a national lead for youth mental health.<\/p><p> We are sharing this data with the committee today so that the findings can hopefully help inform the Government's approach to further addressing young people's mental health in the future.  The results also provide some external insight into which platforms should be used to communicate key messages to this crucial demographic.  Unsurprisingly, TikTok secured top spot in the survey we conducted with Spark as the fastest growing social media network with 86% of 16-17 year olds highlighting that it is the app they now use the most on a daily basis.  Beat has paid attention to this and now has over 200,000 followers on Tiktok.  We are the leading radio station in Ireland on TikTok and we have used this in an effective way in the past few months where we have worked with county councils across the south east on a road safety awareness programme.  This is just an example of how we can use these platforms to continue to connect with our audience, which is ever-changing and can be fickle at times.  Ireland&rsquo;s youth radio stations collectively target over 1 million listeners weekly and have over 3 million social media followers.  Working collectively, we know early intervention will provide assistance to young people.  For our part, as radio stations, we know we will do all we can to assist the relevant agencies provide a more targeted communications approach with this crucial demographic.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32021070600002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Gabrielle Cummins","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1625526000,"counter":735,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Cummins for a very comprehensive presentation.

CARE&rsquo;s plan has always been to raise awareness of the current situation for early career psychologists in Ireland.  We argue that the current employment practices within this sector are unjust, discriminatory and in need of reform.  Given the current climate in Ireland with incredibly long waiting lists for child and adult mental health services as well as assessments for special needs, we propose that the expertise and experience of our psychology graduate population be utilised to help address this crisis.<\/p> <p>  Unlike in the UK where there are numerous and various paid roles for psychology degree and master's graduates, in Ireland, paid roles are extremely rare and much sought after.  State-run agencies, including the HSE, advertise to fill unpaid assistant psychology roles, requiring years of experience and a minimum master's level education to even apply.  Due to the requirement to often work for free, many psychology graduates are ultimately unable to pursue their chosen career as they cannot fund<\/p> <p>years of such experience leading to elitism within the sector.  In general, assistant psychology roles are temporary, often one to two-year contracts, providing no job security or progression.  Many of our graduates are left with no choice but to move to the UK and further afield to find relevant employment despite our ever-increasing waiting lists for mental health and disability services here in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  In general, in order to follow a career within psychology in Ireland, a person is required to complete a four-year degree, a master's and roughly two years relevant work experience, which is hugely difficult to get and often unpaid, to gain a place on any of the professional psychology doctorate courses, which involve a further three years of study.  Places on these courses are notoriously difficult to attain meaning that most applicants will apply numerous times before being accepted, if ever.  Many, however, after years of investment and sacrifice are left with no choice but to give up on their pursuit of a career in psychology.<\/p> <p>  This trend combined with the high turnover of undergraduate psychology students being accepted into colleges annually nationwide has only served to create a huge bottleneck of highly qualified postgraduate students desperately trying to earn a place on the course.  This is cause for much frustration, angst and disillusionment.  It involves not knowing if there will ever be an end in sight, not knowing how long more you can afford to wait to get on the course and having to put your life and future plans on hold, etc.  Huge sacrifices have to be made and, frankly, are expected.  A Vision for Change recommended the establishment of an assistant psychologist grade within the HSE as a stepping stone to assist with career progression into professional training programmes.  Consequently, in 2017, the Department of Health provided funding for a two-year pilot involving the provision of 114 assistant psychologists in primary care services for children and young people who earn &euro;25,000 per year.  A new panel of assistant psychologists was then formed in April 2019 with data suggesting that the assistant psychologist project is having a positive effect on services.  Despite the clear need for clinical support, the HSE is currently looking for expressions of interests in assistant psychology posts that expire at the end of September 2021 - three months time - which seems completely illogical given that we need them more than ever.  <\/p> <p>  I will now turn my attention to one of the most serious and pressing issues within our profession, namely, the funding inequity among trainee psychologists.  It is time we put an end to the glaring inequalities that exist between professional psychology doctoral training courses in Ireland by funding both the educational and counselling psychology doctoral courses in line with clinical psychology doctorates.  Those interested in pursuing careers in psychology tend to be channelled down the clinical psychology route as they are the only funded courses even if their preference is to become an educational or counselling psychologist.  This should not be the case.  The clinical psychology route is a sponsored programme entailing the payment of a trainee salary, which is &euro;108,000 in total over the three-year programme, and a 60% contribution towards fees along with a signed contract to work for a further three years post-graduation with the sponsoring agency.  In stark contrast, trainee counselling and educational psychologists must work a minimum of 250 days, which is approximately 2,000 plus hours, unpaid and pay fees of up to &euro;45,000 on the doctorate while not receiving any income for the work they provide.  Considering the fact that both clinical, counselling and educational psychologists are entitled to apply for staff grade psychology posts within the HSE post-qualification and are put on the same pay scale in post, it is only right and fair that they are treated equally while in training.  <\/p> <p>  It must also be said that prior to entering a doctoral programme, most of these trainees had been working either in low-income jobs or as volunteers to gain the relevant clinical experience needed to secure a place on a doctoral course and so are already in a very vulnerable financial position.  It is even more of a financial hardship for those trainees with families and mortgages to pay since they are embarking on what are full-time doctoral studies with little free time to earn a salary.  Many of these trainees have to take on additional part-time work in the evenings and weekends to resource themselves.  Given their busy academic and placement timetable, this leads to insufficient time to rest and study thus negatively impacting their mental health.  The possibility of burnout is a real concern.  It must also be stressed that the current situation of no funding restricts applications from minority groups and those from low socioeconomic backgrounds favouring those from middle to upper-income backgrounds instead.  It drives elitism.  <\/p> <p>  To conclude, CARE for Psychologists in Ireland calls for equity of funding for trainee counselling and educational psychologists by setting up the proposed national psychology placement office as a matter of urgency and an increase in the number of places on all psychology doctoral programmes.<\/p><p>We also call for the expansion and extension of the role of assistant psychologist to help address the mental health and waiting list crisis, an end to unpaid, voluntary assistant psychology posts, the provision of clinical placements on all master's psychology courses and practical placements during the final year of accredited undergraduate psychology degrees, and more transparency and consistency in the application process for clinical doctorates.<\/p><p> A core value of psychology is the promotion of well-being and quality of life.  Therefore, it seems like a tragic irony that the profession is not doing that for its own.  Many early career psychologists are working to support individuals suffering with hopelessness and mental health difficulties while the current positions and systems in place give them little to feel hopeful or confident about in their own lives.  Far too many highly competent and compassionate people have had to give up on their dreams of pursuing psychology and left the profession for this very reason.<\/p><p> I thank the committee for taking the time to listen.

Often, when young people say this, that and the other and that the Government does not understand, others dismiss them as just being young.  As such, it is useful to have the evidence base of the witnesses' research.  Not that we should have to have a study in order to believe someone, of course.  Sometimes, a great failing of the political class is that we refuse to believe what people say unless it is presented to us in a paper or study.<\/p> <p>  I was particularly interested in the remark that the top four emotions were bored, stressed, depressed and anxious.  We are members of the Joint Sub-Committee on Mental Health, so we are all obviously concerned about mental health.  Otherwise, we would not be here.  Young people have got a bad rap during the lockdown and there is a collectivist belief that they just need to put up with it.  It would be problematic going forward if there were such an attitude towards young people in employment and social welfare offices and across society at large.  Ms Cummins referred to the role that she believed youth radio stations could play.  Will she elaborate on how they might tackle young people's bad rap?  There is a significant problem coming down the line.  The current young generation is not the first one to have experienced this, but the belief that young people just need to get on with things and pull themselves up by their socks is heightened at the moment.<\/p> <p>  I will make a second point, after which the witnesses might reply.  When I worked in further and higher education - it is my area - we always asked about who was not in the room.  I imagine I already know what the response will be, but the diversity of representation in the psychology sphere is probably not what we would like it to be because of the elitist aspect of people having to take unpaid internships and so on that lock people out of a career.  Will Ms Dillon elaborate on this and what impact it will have?  We cannot have the same people constantly represented in a profession.  It is not good for the profession or the people with whom psychologists work.

It is an important question, as that lack does a great deal of damage.  Clinical psychology has become so competitive that many people have to move location or work for free to get experience.  This penalises the chances of there being any kind of diversity, in particular socio-economic diversity.  It immediately prices out people who are working class or who cannot afford to work for free because of family reasons, their backgrounds, etc.  It penalises people who have mental health difficulties or other health difficulties that mean they cannot drive, for example.  Being able to drive is a major requirement in most assistant psychology posts.  If they cannot drive, they do not get the chance to gain the experience they need.  When a service is self-selecting those who can work for free, we have to wonder how much the gap is widening between the psychologists who are providing services and the people who are receiving those services.<\/p><p>We are not rewarding diversity of experience.  We are not rewarding lived experience of mental health issues and we are making sure that the psychologists who are being trained to treat people have such massively different experiences to those who are coming to be treated.  We have made it very clear that we do not care about lived experience, or diversity in encouraging people from lower socioeconomic status or from people with disabilities or mental health issues.  It is obvious that these people do not belong in clinical psychology because they simply just cannot afford to get to the stage where they would be trained.

It is great to see the two groups here today, both of which I have met with individually in recent times.  My first question is for CARE.  My grandmother used to have a saying when I was growing up: &quot;If you work for nothing, you will never be idle.&quot;  Nothing can be truer from what the witnesses said in their statements and during the meeting.  We recently saw a number of advertisements by the HSE for unpaid positions.  I did a little bit of searching so I will read one out for the record.  The job is for a voluntary assistant psychologist and states:<\/p> <blockquote> \tWe are seeking five voluntary assistant psychologists.  Posts are either in the adult primary care psychology service or the early intervention team in the HSE Dublin North West.  These are non-paid positions.  Successful candidates are required to commit to work a minimum of two days in either service. <\/blockquote> <p>In this day and age, that is absolutely disgraceful.  As was mentioned, 8,500 children are desperately waiting for primary care psychology as we speak.  We need to put something in place that will meet the needs of society but also meet the needs of and value psychologists for the journey they must take to achieve their qualifications.  Nobody comes into the witnesses' line of work without having that care and empathetic background to help society.<\/p><p>I have one question regarding what the NHS does compared with the HSE.  What can we learn in this State to improve and make things better in order for psychologists to get the experience and the paid positions that are needed, but also for society as a whole to get its needs met?  As I said, for example, 8,500 children and another 1,500 adults are waiting for primary care psychology.  That is 10,000 people in the State who are waiting.

I was studying with people who were all employed in the NHS service so it was a good chance to compare how things are done differently.  There are probably a number of things we could learn from how it does things.  One is funded master's degrees.  Obviously, assistant psychologist positions are funded and assistant psychologist are more widely employed.  At the moment, the HSE only uses them in its primary care child and adolescent services.<\/p><p>In the UK, they are employed across a variety of services, including disability and adult services.  That is one issue.<\/p><p> I am not sure if the committee is familiar with Improving Access to Psychological Therapies, IAPT, which is a programme run by the NHS.  It is a mental health service that provides low intensity but high-throughput interventions for anxiety, depression and those kinds of difficulties.  As part of this service, treatment is offered by assistant psychologists, under supervising psychologists, working in communities.  In terms of taxpayer money, it is a very effective utilisation of people at that level of their training.<\/p><p> One other thing we could learn from the UK is to have a centralised application system for doctorates.  In the UK, there is a centralised application system.  A person just applies to one body and all the universities look at the application and decide, whereas in Ireland &euro;50 has to be paid to each university with every application so it is quite expensive. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32021070600002#E01400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mark O'Flaherty","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1625526000,"counter":774,"content":"<p>I apologise for cutting across Mr. O'Flaherty.

I do not know if the Deputy recalls that I sent him a video on a similar system that was set up in Roscommon.  It was a pilot project called access to psychology services Ireland, APSI, and it worked very well for participants.  There were no waiting lists, people were taken in off the street and there was no delay with referrals and all of that.  Someone could walk in off the street and be seen to.  The way it worked was that five assistant psychologists worked under the supervision of one senior psychologist.  Normally, a senior is needed to supervise at that level.  He supervised these five individuals, the flow was great and the feedback from clients was very good.  I sent the committee the video but I do not know if members got to watch it.  It is something that could easily be rolled out nationwide.<\/p> <p>  There is no shortage of assistant psychologists.  However, there may be a shortage at the level of seniors unless there is an agreement on staff grade psychologists supervising assistant psychologists.  That could be a barrier.  To be honest, the lack of seniors is a problem anyhow, even when it comes to supervising trainees.  Not only that, it is not mandatory for a senior to supervise trainees.  It is voluntary.  It could be a case that one year a senior will supervise a trainee but it may not suit him or her the next year or he or she might be unavailable and, therefore, there is no place on a particular site for a trainee.  That is probably worth bearing in mind.<\/p> <p>  There is another role in England called the psychological wellbeing practitioner, PWP.  As far as I understand, it is a permanent role to do with what Mr. O'Flaherty talked about, which is the low-level CBT-based approach.  A PWP deals with the earlier stages of anxiety and depression and, ideally, nips it in the bud or catches it in time so there is less delay.  We need to roll that out in the community so there are less barriers to going in.  To be honest, I am all for working hand-in-hand with the doctor on the ground, which means you either turn left for the GP or right for the psychologist.  That is how it should be done in future but that is for another day because I do not know how long that would take to set up.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32021070600002#F00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Marina Dillon"},{"type":"speech","time":1625526000,"counter":779,"content":"<p>To echo that, the Irish College of General Practitioners, ICGP, has also called for the same thing.

It has been a very interesting discussion.  I will have a question for Beat 102-103 later but I will start with CARE.  The representatives have done a very good job today of outlining the huge challenges to their sector.  Professionalisation of a role and that pathway becoming a barrier to people taking part is something that we see in other sectors too but in health it is particularly onerous on people and very difficult.  It is not only a barrier to diversity but in my previous professional life where unpaid internships became part of the deal and are not available to those of us who do not have someone to pay for us, the research shows you lose an awful lot of women.  I am mindful that we are moving into an era of the implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare and cross-disciplinary teams and, hopefully, a proper model of primary care.  It was interesting to hear about the access to psychology services Ireland, APSI, experiment and there being five assistant psychologists, APs with a senior psychologist.  In a perfect world, is that AP model the right model?  In a perfect world, would the CARE representatives like to see that model progressed or is the version they would like to see in the future more one of in-the-role learning and continuing professional development being recognised as part of the career trajectory so that it could be made more aligned with paid work?  In the UK, there is far greater integration of on-site and in-the-role learning as part of particular qualifications or professional registration.  They seem to be further down that road than we are.  I would generally like to hear more about that APSI model.  Was that a primary care type situation?<\/p> <p>  CARE's opening statement discussed the difference between clinical psychology and the recognition of education and counselling psychology, and different payments or sometimes no payments for particular roles.  In light of the movement into new models and Sl&aacute;intecare, hopefully, it is useful to understand how that came about.  How did  such a divide come about between clinical education and counselling, a different recognition?  Is that something that has evolved from HSE hiring practices?  Sometimes that evolves through university practices or recognition by particular hospitals.  How has it come about that there is such a dichotomy between disciplines when we seem to need them all?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32021070600002#G00400","speaker":"1559"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1625526000,"counter":789,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for those questions, they are very relevant.  Back in the day, say more than 15 years ago, educational psychology and counselling psychology did not require a doctorate, it would have been master's level then.  The standard route everyone was channelled through to work for the HSE was the clinical psychology route.  Clinical psychology route was nearly associated with working for the HSE.  That has changed radically.  If someone wants to become a staff grade psychologist today in the HSE, they have a choice of getting on either a clinical psychology doctorate, a counselling psychology or an educational psychology doctorate.  Any one of those three strands can get you into a staff grade post.  It is the same recognition now.  I applied for the counselling psychology doctorate but I also applied for the clinical psychology doctorate.  I did not apply for the educational psychology doctorate because that was not my niche but I could have done so.  We are coming in with the same qualifications across the board.  It is becoming quite standardised.  That is not ideal.  We do not want that either.  We do not want only to be in a position to work for the HSE.  The way we are trained, we can work in other areas such as the prison services, in an array of private hospitals and all sorts of other areas, as can the others.  <\/p> <p>  There is a lot of flexibility.  The training is in-depth across the board.  It is at a very high level.  The main difference, having explored it, is that apparently a national psychology placement office, the NPPO, should have been set up some years ago.  It is within its remit to fund all doctoral psychology courses.  Ideally, we should be brought up to speed once that opens.  We sent in numerous parliamentary questions over the years but we still do not know the cause of the delay.  We are waiting on that office to be established.  I believe it is under Dr. Colm Henry's remit to set that up.  Perhaps he is the person to talk to on that.  We had it in mind to reach out to him but if the sub-committee can do that for us, so much the better.

It would mean the supervisory role was spread across all those who have three or more years experience in the role of a psychologist and would mean more trainees could be supervised.

I wanted to follow up with it because the work it is doing is really interesting.  I am interested in the methodology of the project that was undertaken because it has come up in other committees and with other issues.  I refer to reaching out to people online during Covid, particularly through social media.  There is a bit of fear around TikTok and that Beat has gone onto that medium and conquered it a bit is very interesting.  On the methodology, did it find there were pitfalls to engaging with people through social media?  Also was there an issue with self-selecting in the particular group who engaged with that?  I ask because some people do not have access to digital technology or even access to a space where they can engage with that technology in private.  That is a big issue where domestic violence is concerned, for example, in that often women do not have a room where they can go to make a call.  I imagine there are plenty of teenagers out there who do not have a private space where they can interact with something around mental health.  Similarly, was there a barrier to young people with disabilities engaging with that kind of a study through online media or social media?  Is that something Beat factored in?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32021070600002#H00400","speaker":"1559"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1625526000,"counter":798,"content":"<p>That is a very interesting question.

They would have signed up previously and said they were interested in opting in to surveys, marketing communications and things like that, so that is where we sourced those particular respondents.  For the qualitative piece, that is, the online community, we went through a professional recruitment agency which was able to find us the right candidates, in that we were looking for people from specific areas, who were of the right age.

The feedback we received was that we were able to be more inclusive and encourage more people to access the content they would not normally be able to access.  One of the people who contributed to the seven-day online video day referenced the fact she found it quite difficult at the start because she was in a rural area and did not have access to Wi-Fi.  That left her struggling to engage.  She really missed socialising and was paying less attention in class because of remote learning.  She was unable to get access to it as her counterparts in urban areas were.

I will be very brief because time is short.  All of us have meetings after meetings for a meeting about a meeting before we go to the meeting to talk about that meeting.  Anyway, much has already been raised but there are some main issues that keep coming up.  I love our guests' frankness about it because I am black and blue in the face from listening to Government parties say over the last few years that we have a problem with recruitment.  We know we have a problem with recruitment because they make it too difficult to qualify.  A while ago Ms Dillon mentioned the assistant psychologists and how around 2017 or 2018, or maybe later, the Government promised to employ 114 assistant psychologists.  From my information at the time, when I was sitting on a different committee, they did not do any psychology.  They did not do any assisting.  The only assistance there was was wetting envelopes to send out appointment consolations.  I know of people who left the service over that and got into the Prison Service and who feel more appreciated there.  I can see Ms Thomas and Mr. O'Flaherty's frustration.  When we get involved with these specific topics, 99% of the time it is because we have had some connection to it be that emotionally, personally or through friends or whatever.  I have been listening and it was mentioned that we do not have a national lead.  Having listened to the statements our guests from CARE have made, no matter how passionate I was, there is not a hope in hell that I would be seriously thinking about going into this as a profession because there are so many barriers.  I have no problem saying it.  I have used this line before but as a penance you would actually have a better chance of emptying the Red Sea with a bucket with no arse in it.  It just cannot be done.  I am being honest here.<\/p> <p>  It is debates like this which need to be aired, and aired publicly.  I am thinking of what Ms Cummins said about things being outside the box.  I can remember that less than ten years ago, if you mentioned mental health you were shut down straight away.   You had something that was contagious and if you spoke about it you were putting ideas into somebody else's head.  Now you can address it through social media, radio and so on.  Our guests are right that we must reach out to the younger generation but we must also listen to them.  That is the problem.  We are not peer-led in this country.  We will tell people what we think is best for them instead of saying we should shut up for a second and ask people what they think would be best.  That is what we have lost in society.  I do not envy our guests.  I am not going to quiz them on anything because a lot of the stuff has been covered.  However, I encourage every one of them to not let this go, even if it means thinking outside the box.  I am absolutely dumbfounded.  I knew it was bad as far as education and trying to qualify for anything like this is concerned but there are so many preventative barriers it is just beyond belief.  I was a member of the Joint Committee on the Future of Mental Health Care a number of years ago.  We have talked about funding but there is also massive wastage of funding.<\/p><p>More than &euro;1 billion was spent on mental health services in 2017 to 2018, but the HSE could not tell us where it had been spent.  We try to balance resources.<\/p><p> Mr. O'Flaherty referred to people going to England or elsewhere.  They are not valued here.  These are services and I am black and blue listening to the HSE talking about problems with recruitment and retention.  It will not train or pay people yet still expects them to stay and then scratches its head wondering where it is going wrong.<\/p><p> I used to be our spokesperson on mental health.  Deputy Ward has taken over, but it is still my passion.  If the committee can assist the witnesses in any way, they should not hesitate to contact us.  When people like them get together, they have a bigger and better voice.  Could they work in collaboration with Ms Cummins, Ms Reynolds and others to push this?  It should be a national issue.  I suspect that, from next March onwards, we will see a tsunami of mental health problems and mental health-related problems due to anxiety, stress and depression.  They are just the little firelighters.  There will be knock-on effects on families, friends and so on.<\/p><p> I do not envy the witnesses.  I thank the Acting Chairman for his patience.  I thank the witnesses, including for their honesty.  We have been at this for a long time.  The most important issue is that we must get the message out that some people cannot qualify in this country.  Let it be written in black and white that people can buzz off if they think others will break their backs.  People are not expected to feed their families for free, so why should they work for free?  We are told that there is a recruitment problem when we are not even backing their training.  People can go across the water to the NHS.  It might not be perfect, but at least it has joined-up thinking, a plan and a bit of openness, empathy and understanding.  It also has a common sense approach.  A major issue in this country is that there is no common sense.  People protect their own patches and do not like others getting on better than them.  Instead, people should work collectively.  The main issue is patient safety.<\/p><p> The greatest reward in life is to help someone, regardless of what with or in which profession, and to be told \"Thanks\".  It cannot be taken to a bank to be cashed, but a person can hold onto it for as long as possible.  It is well worth the effort.  The witnesses should keep going with what they are doing.  If we can assist them in any way, they should not hesitate to contact us.  I wish them well and the best of luck.  I hope that, the next time we are speaking at a meeting of this committee, we will not be giving out about X, Y and Z, something will have moved forward and there will have been more of a positive outcome.  I am not optimistic, though.  I am a realist.  I am angry, although I am toning it down.  I normally raise my voice much more than this.  I am angry for the likes of the witnesses, who are passionate about this matter but who have been pulled and dragged through muck for five or ten years and for whom muck is their thanks.  I would go away to a different profession, write to the relevant Minister and say that I was sorry, I tried, the Minister did not give me help and I was out of here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32021070600002#H00900","speaker":"1452","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1625526000,"counter":804,"content":"<p>I will always acknowledge Deputy Buckley's passion.

What was especially insightful was the engagement knitting social media to radio.  I have often regarded social media as having circumvented radio to some extent, albeit in a pitiful way.  Radio is controlled and managed and can be much more effective than social media.  Marrying the two as our guests have tried to do through TikTok and so on is the way to go.  Have they built up relationships with other radio outlets, in particular community radio?  Community radio stations operate in small communities.

There is a significant job to do, and it will take time, but it needs to be done correctly.  All of CARE's recommendations are important, but do Ms Dillon and her colleagues wish to elaborate on the critical ones?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32021070600002#J00400","speaker":"1644"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1625526000,"counter":807,"content":"<p>I will start by reading out the recommendations, and if those attending with me would then like to contribute, I would be happy to hear from them as well.<\/p> <p>  The critical recommendation relates to equity of funding for trainee counselling and educational psychologists.  For that to happen, my understanding is that the national psychology placement office needs to be established.  It has been in train for the past couple of years, but for whatever reason - it is for Dr. Henry to revert on that - it has not been done.  Apart from dealing with the obvious issue of inequity, this recommendation is critical because I have found that those who would prefer to go into the specialisations of counselling and educational psychology are unable to because they cannot afford to.  Instead, they are applying for clinical psychology.  This is far from ideal and should not be happening, and is part of the reason it is so critical that we attend to the inequity as the first priority.<\/p> <p>  The second priority would be to increase the number of places across all psychology doctoral programmes to meet need.  The level of need is clear; all of us at this meeting are in agreement that the HSE is understaffed.  We need more psychologists, which will only happen if we take more in.  I believe it was Deputy Boyd Barrett who stated that 52 trainees had been taken on board last year.<\/p><p>That is far from enough if we want to cover the 40% plus of vacancies in the HSE.<\/p><p> The third recommendation refers to the expansion and extension of the role of assistant psychologist to help address the mental health and waiting list crisis.  We have highly-qualified people, who are primary care members and beyond, who have master's degree level in psychology and several years of experience having worked for free and gained relevant clinical experience.  All they are waiting for is to get on to the coveted doctoral course.  In the meantime, they are literally twiddling their thumbs or earning the minimum to get by.  Why are we not utilising that huge resource?  Instead, they are coming up against a brick wall.  The APSI is one example of how we could utilise and bring them in.<\/p><p> The fourth recommendation calls for an end to all voluntary assistant psychologist posts.  It goes without saying that in this day and age, and particularly considering the cost of living, no one can afford to work for free.  It should not be happening and particularly within the HSE.<\/p><p> The fifth recommendation calls for provision of clinical placements on all masters psychology courses and the offer of practical placements during the final year of accredited undergraduate psychology degrees.  This was an idea of CARE's.  I spoke about the limbo of bridging the gap between going from an undergraduate degree and gaining a placement.  If a person gains that experience in a placement at undergraduate level, he or she is already coming in with experience and if that person has experience, he or she will have the confidence to start applying for the doctorate.  People will find they do not have such a long-term limbo land.  The same goes for master's degrees.  All master's courses should be providing placements in order that we are better placed to apply for doctorates.<\/p><p> Finally, we call for more transparency and consistency in the application process for clinical doctorates.  The feedback we have received from our members is that it is as if the goals move year-on-year.  There is, for example, quite a complex grading system provided by the top five universities.  We have noticed that early career psychologists who applied, for example, for the clinical psychology doctorate and did not get a place get comprehensive feedback as to why.  There is a breakdown.  They are actually scored, in some cases, based on their leaving certificate results and also how they did at the interview, etc.  They take that on board and then come back another year and apply and they get much different feedback to the point they are wondering what they are doing wrong.  They do not, therefore, really know what they need to do to get better placed.  That seems to be an issue.<\/p><p> We are looking for uniformity, ideally.  That would probably mean collaboration between universities as regards the application process or perhaps that is something that will also be within the remit of the national psychology placement office.  Those were our six key points.  My colleagues may wish to come in on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32021070600002#J00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Marina Dillon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1625526000,"counter":809,"content":"<p>Would anyone like to comment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32021070600002#K00200","speaker":"1644"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1625526000,"counter":810,"content":"<p>I will make one point on the final recommendation Ms Dillon highlighted around the transparency involved in applying for the different doctorates.  The breaking point for me in leaving clinical psychology as a career was learning that colleagues of mine had been graded on their leaving certificate results.  At the time, I was 28 years old.  I had not done my leaving certificate for ten years.  When I heard from a colleague that their leaving certificate results were graded equally to their postgraduate training, I then realised there was no place for me in clinical psychology.  Coming from a background where I was never going to do very well in the leaving certificate anyway, if it meant that my leaving certificate results were graded equally to the effort, hard work and dedication I put in during my undergraduate and postgraduate training, it became obvious to me there was not a place for me in the service and that was the moment I decided to leave.

As much as we have pointed out what is wrong in terms of trying to become a psychologist, serious urgency has to be put on the fact that it is not that we are crying out for ourselves to get qualified and get jobs.  People have been waiting years and years for support.  They are not going to get any better by us telling them to wait for years.  We are here and we want to help, therefore, employ us.  We have this serious bottleneck where we need to really come to terms with the fact that we are making things very difficult for psychology graduates.  We have many people who need support and we really need to start putting these two things together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32021070600002#K00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Adam Chambers"},{"type":"speech","time":1625526000,"counter":813,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Chambers.  At this point, we have had a phenomenal exchange of views.  I thank the witnesses for their clear and concise articulation of the problems.

Hopefully, we will see some progress because I believe there is unanimity in the view that this needs to be dealt with.  The whole idea of unpaid apprenticeships should really be a thing of the past.  That should be the case across the working community, not just in the witnesses' profession.

I wish it every success in the work it will do and thank it very much.<\/p> <p>  This brings to an end this engagement.  As I said earlier, this committee will be drafting a report, which we hope will equip us in lobbying Government but, more important, inform Government.  Hopefully, we will see Government take action.  Funding is required and many step changes are needed.  We have seen some improvements but we are certainly nowhere near where we would like to be by international norms.<\/p> <p>  I again thank witnesses for their time and contributions.  I thank members for their questions and engagement.  I thank Ms Iqra ZainulAbedin, our committee clerk, for her dedication and support.  I also thank our broadcasting unit and technical people.

I am joined by Keith Walsh from the statistics and economic research branch of Revenue.<\/p> <p>  At the outset, I would like to clarify that the Department of Finance has responsibility for the policy and legislation for the LPT, which, as you know, is collected by Revenue.  It is then paid into the Local Government Fund and does not form part of Exchequer receipts.  Distribution of the LPT yield and matters associated with local government funding arise from Government decisions sponsored by the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  I am not in a position to discuss these.  What I can do is provide a brief outline of the LPT and the proposed changes to the tax.  The committee may wish to note that the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, is scheduled to meet the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach for pre-legislative scrutiny of the general scheme of the finance (local property tax) (amendment) Bill 2021 tomorrow, 7 July 2021.<\/p> <p>  The LPT was introduced in 2013 under the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012  to provide a stable funding base for the local authority sector and broaden the base for taxation in a manner that does not directly impact on employment.  The tax has yielded approximately &euro;3.6 billion since 2013.  The LPT is currently based on the property values that obtained on 1 May 2013.  Revaluation of properties has been deferred on three occasions, namely, 2016, 2019 and 2020, which means that the LPT liabilities are still based on 2013 valuations.  This has resulted in a situation whereby it has not been possible to bring new properties into scope.  Properties built since 2013 are excluded from the tax.<\/p> <p>  There have been two reviews of the tax since its introduction: the Thornhill review of the LPT in 2015; and the interdepartmental review of the LPT published in 2019.  The 2019 review was conducted by an interdepartmental working group, chaired by the Department of Finance and consisting of senior officials from this Department, the Departments of the Taoiseach, Public Expenditure and Reform and Housing, Planning and Local Government and the Office of the Revenue Commissioners.  Both of these reports considered, in particular, the effects of changes in property prices since 2013 on LPT liabilities and the impact of these on taxpayers&rsquo; liabilities following revaluation of their properties.  The 2019 review considered a number of methods or scenarios for collecting LPT liabilities with a view to achieving relative stability in LPT liabilities for taxpayers following revaluation of properties.<\/p> <p>  Earlier this year, the Minister asked us to consider options for the reform of the tax in the context of the programme for Government commitment to bring forward legislation in respect of the LPT on the basis of fairness and the fact that most homeowners will face no increase in their LPT liability, and to bring new homes that are currently exempt from the tax into the system.  Our starting point for this work was the scenarios considered under the 2019 review.  These scenario analyses were based on a data set assembled by the Revenue Commissioners from the property price register combined with Central Statistics Office, CSO, and Revenue data and Department of Finance forecasts.<\/p> <p>  I should note that the analyses can provide only a broad picture of the estimated effects on taxpayers.  They are based on economic modelling and the predicted outcomes can offer only indicative rather than guaranteed outcomes.  A key challenge encountered during both the work on the 2019 review and the more recent analysis is the significant variation of property price increases geographically and, in particular, the uneven pace and rate of increases in residential property values throughout the country since the original valuation on 1 May 2013.  Following extensive engagement at both official and political level, the Government agreed on a modified version of scenario 5 of the 2019 LPT report as the basis for the calculation of future LPT liabilities.  A general scheme of a Bill which provides for this approach, as well as other amendments to the tax, was published on 2 June 2021.<\/p> <p>  The original scenario 5 as proposed by the interdepartmental group increases all of the valuation band thresholds by 80%, based on the expected average property price between 2013 and end 2019, as estimated at the time of 2019 review.<\/p><p>The midpoint of each band increases correspondingly and the rate is reduced to leave the liability in each band unchanged.  The widening of bands provides a smoothing effect whereby the probability of a taxpayer moving bands is reduced.<\/p><p> The approach outlined in the general scheme of the finance (local property tax) (amendment) Bill 2021 maintains the number of bands at 20, which are widened by 75%, a lower rate is applied and the current rate structure is maintained.  However, to mitigate the effects of the changes for lower value homes, bands 1 and 2 are fixed.  Band 1 is values up to &euro;200,000 and, band 2, from &euro;200,001 to &euro;262,500, with the LPT charge for these bands fixed at the current rates of &euro;90 and &euro;225, respectively.  This results in the vast majority of properties currently in band 1 remaining in the new band 1 and continuing to pay the same amount.  A higher midpoint rate will be applied to properties above &euro;1.05 million for values which will fall in bands 12-19 and a third higher rate will be introduced for properties valued above &euro;1.75 million.  These fall into band 20.<\/p><p> Other changes proposed to the tax include that all new residential properties built between valuation dates will be brought within the tax and retrospectively valued as if they had existed on the preceding valuation date.  Property valuations will be reviewed every four years rather than every three years as at present.  The income thresholds for LPT deferrals will be increased to &euro;18,000 for a single owner and &euro;30,000 for a couple in line with the recommendation of the 2019 review.  The rate of interest on deferred LPT will be reduced from 4% to 3%.  From inception, the LPT has been underpinned by the principle that keeping the number of exemptions low helps to keep the tax rate low for those who are liable to pay it.  The exemptions for first-time buyers and homes in unfinished estates will be allowed to lapse and the exemption in respect of pyrite-damaged properties will be phased out.  A new exemption is being introduced for homes in Mayo and Donegal damaged through the use of defective concrete blocks in their construction.<\/p><p> The yield for 2022 under the revaluation approach as outlined and set out in the general scheme of the Bill is provisionally estimated to be &euro;560 million, but before any local adjustment factors are applied.  As LPT remains a self-assessment tax, the final actual yield will be determined by the valuations returned by property owners.<\/p><p> Finally, while not a matter directly for the legislation or the Department of Finance, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, and his colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, felt it was important to address the third element of the programme for Government commitment in the Government decision.  This part of the commitment is to discontinue the equalisation contribution from local authorities and allow all local authorities retain 100% of the LPT that is collected in their local authority area.  Local authority allocations are decided in advance of collection, based on estimated yield in individual areas for the following year.  Therefore, as this is a valuation year, this process and the local adjustment factor decisions this year will, of necessity, take place before local authorities receive the up to date information on the expected LPT yield in their areas following the revaluation, as well as the addition of new properties to the LPT system.  In light of this, the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage advises that it is intended to retain the 80-20 model for the 2022 process and to move to the 100% local retention model from 2023.  This will mean that local authorities and the Exchequer will have the benefit of the post-revaluation information to inform these decisions.  I am happy to take any questions that the committee may have on LPT.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021070600002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Anne Marie Walshe","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1625526000,"counter":821,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Walshe.

The Department has undertaken to give us a briefing on this matter and those questions can be added to it.  The first speaker is Deputy McAuliffe.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021070600002#B00400","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speech","time":1625526000,"counter":824,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for being with, particularly so soon after the Government announcement on this issue.  As the Fianna F&aacute;il spokesperson on local government, I have received numerous queries, as, I am sure, have other members, from councillors throughout the country with regard to how this will be implemented.  I am conscious that some of my questions may be relevant to the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage but I will do my best limit them to the witnesses' areas of expertise.  I would appreciate any responses they can offer.<\/p> <p>  The modelling is interesting.  It is the only way of predicting what the changes will be.  Taking the first category of those with properties valued at under &euro;100,000 who pay &euro;90 as an example, what will be the change for them?<\/p> <p>  My second question relates to the collection process.  We are continuing with the self-assessment model.  I dealt with a huge volume of queries in respect of the initial system under which people were required to make suggested valuations.  In many cases, the latter did not match the value of the properties and appeals were required.  The valuation process for the new estates will be a tricky process in that they may contain many properties built at the same time and, as such, there will be no comparator.  I ask the witnesses to elaborate on that process.  The idea of suggested valuations should be avoided.  While it did not mislead people, it led to people paying more than they should have paid.<\/p> <p>  My third question relates to the period of notification for the Revenue.  This poses a real challenge for local authority members in that they must notify Revenue in September, even though local authorities do not have clarity on their budgets until October or November.  This allows councillors a free vote on the LPT and means that they do not have to contemplate the implications this will have for those budgets.  I urge Revenue to look at that again.  There is a political accountability issue here.  Councillors welcome that local authorities will be able to retain 100% of the LPT collected in their area.  That is important.  However, councillors are telling me that they are terrified there will be a repeat of what happened previously, that is, the LPT will replace existing grants.  This will be new money and the Department will have to give new money to local authorities that do not take in LPT funding.  What increase in funding is available as a result of the decision to retain 100% in some counties and to, therefore, top up the local government fund in other counties?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021070600002#B00500","speaker":"1568"},{"type":"speech","time":1625526000,"counter":825,"content":"<p>I invite Ms Walshe to respond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021070600002#B00600","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1625526000,"counter":826,"content":"<p>I will try my best.  Dr. Walsh may wish to come on some of the Revenue points.  In terms of the charges for band 1 properties, as outlined currently band 1 properties are valued between &euro;1 and &euro;100,000.  That band is being expanded to up to &euro;200,000.  We have been working off average property price increases of in the region of 75%.  Properties that have increased by more than 75% in value will remain in band 1 once the value is up to &euro;200,000.  The charge attached to the band remains the same at &euro;90.  For most people in this band the liability will remain at &euro;90.<\/p> <p>  On the collection process, as outlined by the Deputy it is a self-assessment process.  Revenue has proposed suggested valuations because it does not have other data to work on.  It is for the property owner to amend or return what he or she believes an appropriate valuation for his or her property.  That is how the system is designed to work.<\/p> <p>  On the period of notification, I appreciate that it does put councils in a particularly difficult position for this year.

All local authorities are paying LPT on social housing.  The money that is being collected from people who pay LPT is being taken out of local properties.

They mentioned a &euro;100,000 band, which has now been increased to &euro;200,000.  Will they expand on the position regarding bands 2 and 3?  With the supply and demand for houses in towns, cities and rural areas, you cannot get a proper valuation for a house at present.  Since there are such supply-and-demand issues, the prices of houses can fluctuate.  We have seen houses that would have had a value of &euro;200,000 or &euro;250,000 last year, which are going for &euro;400,000 this year.  People are fighting each other to try to get houses.  Auctioneers have been on television saying that there is a lack of supply.  The second a house comes up, many people try to buy it.  Many people try to buy turnkey housing because at least they can go to their mortgage providers and have one payment.  The current prices do not reflect the prices over a period.  We have seen changes as a result of supply-and-demand issues and Covid.  We have also seen an increase in the prices of houses due to the price of materials.

Deputy O'Donoghue made a very good point that in normal times it is fair to say the value of properties that are being bought and sold on the market are probably a reasonable indicator of the overall stock of properties in the country.  However, when we have quite exceptional market conditions, as we have had over the last few months, the properties that are selling are probably less of an indicator of what the underlying value is.  As Ms Walshe said, and as the Deputy may remember from 2013, when we were asking people to value their properties then, Revenue provided a lot of valuation guidance to make it as easy as possible for people to self-assess the value of their home.  This time around we are starting to put in place plans to do the same thing.  We will put a lot of data and as much information as we can out there and make it available to people.  When we are preparing that valuation guidance and trying to look at average prices in any particular area in the country, what we will not be doing is over-relying or relying too heavily on the more recent values because, as the Deputy said, they are not necessarily reflective of the underlying market conditions.  They are reflective of a bidding war for a particular property in a market of very constrained supply.  What we will be trying to do is to make valuation guidance available but that guidance will not be too heavily weighted towards the recent high trend in property sales.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021070600002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Keith Walsh"},{"type":"speech","time":1625526000,"counter":841,"content":"<p>From a rural point of view, we have looked at this recently.

The councils are going to be raising their own revenue which makes it inevitable that councils will be forced to keep the higher rate of property tax.

If there is, would our guests have a regional breakdown of the local authorities concerned?<\/p> <p>  While I welcome the exemption for those affected by pyrite and mica, there are apartment blocks across the State with fire and safety issues and structural problems.

Whether it is the main funding source is more a matter for my colleagues in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  There is a range of other income sources for councils, as the committee is well aware.  I cannot comment any further on that question.<\/p> <p>  As I explained, the difficulty in moving to the 100% local retention earlier than 2023 is that we need clear visibility of the 2022 yield, following the revaluation and the bringing in of new properties into the tax.  Our understanding is that the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and their Departments will work to bring that in as part of the 2023 and 2024 budgetary process.  Any shortfall for local authorities is to be met from Exchequer funding.  As outlined earlier, I cannot comment any further on that matter.<\/p> <p>  We estimate that just over 100,000 additional properties will be brought into the charge for LPT following revaluation.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy also asked about exemptions.

On the issue of valuation, which may be more for Dr. Walsh, what he seems to have said in the course of the meeting is that Revenue will again recommend the fee.  I do not know how it is calculated but, if I remember correctly, it was sort of an average within the electoral district.  My concern in that regard, which I wish to put on the record, is that this led to a significant number of people having incorrect valuations.  It would be better to recommend that people consult the property price register than to recommend a figure.  That would provide a more accurate representation of what valuations are, and they could be directly comparable and verifiable.  The experience I have had is that, in recommending a figure, the Revenue misled many people.  There was no property price register at the time.  For new homes in particular, which will be very difficult for Revenue to estimate, there is a need to refer people to the property price register rather than recommending a rate.<\/p> <p>  My second point is also for Dr. Walsh, although Ms Walshe responded on it previously.  The notification period does not relate to revaluation; it relates to the process each year whereby councils must notify Revenue by a date in September in order that they can operationalise that change or variation in LPT.  That forces councils into having two budget days.  It is like the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform delivering a national budget two months after the Minister for Finance does so or deciding to increase or reduce taxes and then, two months later, deciding how to spend that money.  If at all possible, Revenue needs to consider that because it reduces local authority accountability because the decision to reduce or increase taxes and the decision to spend the income are completely separate.  That is not good for local democracy.  There is no certainty at that point in respect of what the Department will do in the context of its other funding streams.  As such, decisions are being made in a vacuum.<\/p> <p>  I return to the overall budgetary impact.  When the interdepartmental group was meeting and discussing these issues, the decision to retain 100% was described as a cost-neutral one.  It may be cost neutral for the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage but it cannot be cost neutral in the context of the Local Government Fund.  Did the interdepartmental group put a figure on how much that decision to retain 100% would cost the Local Government Fund?  If less funding is going in, that is a known quantity.  How much will it be and by how much will the Local Government Fund need to be topped up?  No matter whether that is done by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage or the Department of Finance as part of an overall budget, we should know the figure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021070600002#F00200","speaker":"1568"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1625526000,"counter":868,"content":"<p>I will try to answer the Deputy's first two questions.  Ms Walshe might then come in on his final question.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of valuations, obviously, Revenue does not know the value of every property in the country.  The person best placed to assess the value of a house is the homeowner, although I fully accept that doing so is particularly challenging in the context of the current timelines.  However, we will be sending out a Revenue estimate with the returns in the coming months.  We have to send it out with the returns because it has a particular function if a person does not file a return and give us a self-assessed estimate of the valuation.  We need a basis on which to engage with the property owner and that is what the Revenue estimate provides.  As well as including the Revenue estimate in the letters, we will be issuing valuation guidance.  We are hoping to make it even easier to use and even more helpful than it was last time.  As the Deputy mentioned, on the previous occasion we provided averages in the context of electoral districts.  This time, we are hoping to provide an average in each property's small area, which is much closer to an average for the neighbourhood.  I accept the Deputy's concern on this issue.  Although the Revenue estimate has to be included in the letters, we will be stressing as much as we can in all of our communications regarding LPT that it is a self-assessment tax and that it is the responsibility of the property owner to value his or her property.  There is no penalty or influence discerned from a Revenue point of view if a person comes back to us with a valuation that is different from that sent to him or her.  It is interesting to consider the example of 2013.  Approximately 40% of people stayed with the estimate provided by Revenue but approximately 60% changed it.  I accept that there is a communications exercise here, and we will be stressing this point again.  The vast majority of people change the valuation estimate, however.  I expect that many of the 40% of people who stayed with the estimate believed it was accurate.  We will be stressing all the way through that this is a self-assessment tax and we will try to provide as much guidance as we can for people to value their home.<\/p> <p>  On the question regarding the notification period for local authorities, we have had a significant amount of engagement with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage on this issue through several years.  Outside the revaluation year, that is, in a normal year in the context of the LPT, we try to give a little more leeway.  However, the timelines are very tight even in a normal year because we have several processes that we need to run through by the end of the year.  These relate to the payment methods people select and such issues and we need to get them in place well in advance of the end of the year which is why we have the notification period that comes in at the end of September or in early October.  We recognise that bringing forward to August that notification period for a revaluation year just adds to the challenge but, unfortunately, on the Revenue side we have to try to administer the tax and prepare and issue returns, whether by post or electronically, and get them back and then put in place all the payment instructions we receive and ensure we are in a position to collect the tax from 1 January onwards as well as getting the revaluation for the property on 1 November.

As Ms Walshe outlined, the valuation bands are all being increased by 75%.  What that means is that if somebody's property has gone up in value, the closer the property is to a 75% increase since 1 May 2013, the less likely the person is to change bands - to increase a band and pay more tax or to decrease a band and pay less tax.  That 75% is calibrated on the overall average property price increase over the past seven or eight years.  As I mentioned earlier, we are trying not to weight it too heavily to reflect some of the bigger increases we have seen because of the restricted supply in the last while.  If somebody is looking for a guide as to whether his or her property is going to face a higher or lower LPT bill or to stay roughly the same, the closer the person is to a 75% increase since 2013 is as good a guide as possible.  One can look at the CSO property price indexes.  The CSO produces about 11 property price indexes for different parts of the country, and those vary between 64% and 93% or 95%.<\/p> <p>  On the second part of the question as to whether the Revenue Commissioners can verify, we do not have a database somewhere in the background of how much everybody's property is worth.  LPT would otherwise have been a much simpler exercise if we had.  If we knew the values of properties, we could just tell people and that would make it much easier.  We do not have that.  However, it is a self-assessment tax.  We have a very strong presumption of honesty on the part of the taxpayer.  We believe the majority of taxpayers are doing their best to be compliant and to value their property as accurately as they can.  On the types of analysis we would do to identify the very small minority of people who may have been non-compliant, there are two main checks we build into that.  One is that we would do some analysis to look at properties around an individual property, looking at particular areas of the country to see if there might be a really big outlier.  If it is a housing estate and most of the properties in that housing estate are valued at between &euro;400,000 and &euro;450,000, but there is one that has come in at &euro;100,000, that is the type of outlier we might look at.  There may well be justified reasons for that type of outlier.  Perhaps it is a smaller property, it might be at the end of the road or whatever.  Our compliance approach in those types of cases is that we engage with the property owner, ask how he or she valued the house, why he or she valued the house at that level and then take it from there.<\/p> <p>  The other check we have in the background is through the stamp duty system.  If a property sells, we will get the value of the property at the time it sells.  Let us say a property is valued for LPT on 1 November this year at, for example, &euro;200,000 and then it sells a year hence for &euro;400,000 or &euro;500,000.  We accept that within a certain margin property prices are probably going to increase over the next while, but if a property went up by a huge amount in a short space of time, that might be indicative that it might have been undervalued for the purposes of LPT.  Again, however, in that situation our approach would be to ask the property owner for the basis of the value.  We would very much rely on that assumption that people are being honest and making their best efforts to value their tax, but we have options there in respect of compliance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021070600002#G01400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Keith Walsh"},{"type":"speech","time":1625526000,"counter":890,"content":"<p>I will move to the third Fianna F&aacute;il slot.

I thank the witnesses for the opening statement, which I have read.  When reviewing this tax, and a proposed change was long overdue, the principles of fairness and limiting increases or trying to achieve no increase for homeowners were very important.  To address the fairness, it was important that the new homes that had been exempted be brought in.  That was a significant point of concern.  I wish to ask about the widening of the bands and the reviewing of the rates every four years.  I understand that the objective is to create more certainty for homeowners and to create greater harmony.

As the Senator noted, the bands have been widened by 75%, which matches the average property price increase from 1 May 2013, the beginning of the current valuation period, to the present day.  As I said in response to Deputy McAuliffe, that 75% is an average for the country as a whole.  The closer a property is to that average, the less likely the owner is to see an increase or a decrease in the property tax bill.  Obviously, the 75% is an average and there will be many properties close to the average, but there will likewise be many that are not especially close to it.  That is the nature of the very varied property stock throughout the country.<\/p> <p>  It is probably very welcome for everyone - Revenue and property owners - that the valuation period is reverting to four years.  When property tax was introduced, although I am open to correction on this, I think the initial idea was to have a three- or four-year valuation period, but that period has been extended a couple of times and it is now the case that properties have been valued at the 1 May 2013 values for eight years.  Unfortunately, that creates a number of inequalities and challenges within the system.  One relates to the properties that were outside of the property net as long as the current valuation period existed, which will be included in the new valuation period, while the other concerns a matter I discussed earlier in response to the Chairman.  Many people will have amended or extended their house, in various ways, over the current valuation period, and the longer that period goes on, the more of those kinds of extensions and enhancements on houses there will be.  Until there is a revaluation, those changes will not be incorporated in the valuation.  The best example given earlier was that there could be two houses side by side that were valued the same in 2013 but even though one might since have installed a massive extension, with gold-plated taps and so on, the two owners will still pay the same property tax.  The four-year period has many benefits in regard to fairness.<\/p> <p>  The Senator went on to ask about the income thresholds for deferral.  I do not know a great deal about this area, to be honest, but as Ms Walshe mentioned, the legislation will bring forward an increase in the thresholds for that, to &euro;18,000 for an individual and to &euro;35,000 or &euro;36,000 for a couple.  There is an attempt, therefore, to make allowances.  The increases are based on an analysis of changes in incomes, particularly at the lower end of the income distribution over the period since the thresholds were first introduced.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021070600002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Keith Walsh"},{"type":"speech","time":1625526000,"counter":894,"content":"<p>Obviously, this has to be legislated for.

It is welcome that we are moving towards a four-year review and that we set in stone that it is what it is, with no delays for any reason.  The change in the bands, in order to mitigate any increase, is very welcome also.  Bringing estates that were not being accounted for into the LPT is important because there is a fundamental unfairness, particularly where new estates have been built alongside existing estates.  In many cases, estates began construction but have not been completed, and ultimately the new units, as they were completed over recent years, have not been levied with property tax.

Our policy has consistently proposed that we replace the LPT with a site value tax, which we believe addresses various issues such as poor usage of land and land hoarding.  It will incentivise land and property improvement, which ultimately increases the provision of housing and reduces homelessness.  Another benefit of this model is that it is also easier to administer than the LPT since land values are generally static.

I omitted to ask it earlier.  It relates to an issue which has always been a bugbear for councillors.  I spent 11 years on Waterford City and County Council.  The timing of when the local property tax notification has to go to Revenue does not correlate with the local authority budget process.  It is a separate meeting which has to take place a month ahead of the annual budget for the council.  That has an impact since you are shooting blind at that point because you are some way from knowing the outturn figures from the end of the year.<\/p><p>Is there capacity to move the period, given that it is now a well-established practice?  I appreciate that when we set this up, we needed ample time to notify homeowners and so on.  Now that is a well-established practice, could we consider moving forward the notification period by three weeks to bring it in line with many local authority budgets and at least give local authorities the option of incorporating that decision into the overall budgetary decision?  Having one independent of the other does not make sense.  It does a disservice to councillors throughout the country to ask them to make blind decisions on property tax and whether to increase it or decrease it, as the case may be, without knowing the parameters of their own budget three weeks later.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021070600002#J01600","speaker":"1647","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1625526000,"counter":921,"content":"<p>I will try to answer that.  We are very much aware that this is a challenging process from the point of view of local authorities, and we have engaged with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Housing to try to find a better option or to streamline the processes.  The timelines are very tight on our side, given the number of things we need to do between September or October and the end of the year such as getting returns to people, after which they will need to revert to us and notify whether they are changing their payment method.  For whatever their payment method is, we need to set that up and to send instructions to banks regarding direct debits or to employers regarding reductions from salaries.  That all has to be done and in place before January, given that the collection of the tax begins then.  We have considered this and it is difficult to see where we can make additional allowances or space.<\/p> <p>  It is an issue that we consider regularly, although it is complicated even further in a revaluation year, when there is an additional process and the valuation of properties has to be complete by 1 November, so the valuation has to be done in advance of that.  That is why, as we discussed earlier, the notification date for local authorities in a revaluation year is brought forward to August.  We appreciate that that causes problems and is difficult, but it is not something we are doing for no reason.  It is because we have a series of processes we need to run through and get into place before the end of the year to ensure that collection will happen from 1 January.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021070600002#K00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Keith Walsh"},{"type":"speech","time":1625526000,"counter":922,"content":"<p>I appreciate that but we might take the two issues separately.

I ask the Department to reconsider all its processes.  Even a three-week period would make a considerable difference.  Local authorities can split the difference and they have flexibility to move their budgetary processes as well.  If some compromise could be found, it would make this a more workable scenario for local authorities throughout the country, particularly as we are looking to empower local authorities further.

Something has to be done and this will have to be reconsidered.<\/p> <p>  Derelict or vacant properties can, by their nature, be undervalued by their owners.  In fact, because they are derelict or vacant, they may not have the same value as similar properties next to them.  In considering those valuations, does the Department consider the valuation of the average property price in that area or of the derelict property itself?  A person who owns such a property might leave it derelict if he or she does not intend to sell it because it will keep the property price low.

LPT, as the Deputy noted, has in some respects been manipulated for a certain advantage.  Has consideration been given to adding a multiplier to act as a penalty on certain residential properties being left vacant?  There is a particular issue in Dublin city whereby newly built properties, built for rental purposes and held by investment funds, are lying vacant during a housing crisis caused by a lack of both supply and affordability.  While there is a vacant site tax, there is not a vacant residential property tax.  Has the Department examined using LPT to apply a penalty to discourage that type of vacancy?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021070600002#K00600","speaker":"1656"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1625526000,"counter":926,"content":"<p>I might try to answer those questions, particularly as I think Ms Walshe may have been disconnected again.  As an important clarification on the notification date for local authorities, my understanding is that the Bill being brought forward will push back by a few weeks the valuation date for the non-revaluation years, from the end of September to mid-October, which I hope will be of some assistance to local authorities and may alleviate some of those issues.  It does not get around the fact that revaluation year involves a particular set of circumstances, and that has to work to an earlier deadline in August.  It is proposed in the general scheme to push that back, so that will give a bit more leeway.<\/p> <p>  On vacant properties, LPT in the current valuation scenario will continue to be based on that value of the property which does not take into account whether the property is vacant.  We are asking people to put a value on their property as they expect it to be on 1 November 2021, taking into account whatever condition in which they expect it to be on that date.  Whether it is vacant will not impact on that.<\/p> <p>  Nevertheless, our proposal for this year is that we are going to use the revaluation exercise and the sending-out of returns to collect a bit more information on the number of vacant properties out there.  As I am sure members will be well aware, there is, perhaps, confusing evidence regarding exactly how many properties are vacant and how many of them are holiday homes versus those that have been vacant for longer term or shorter term reasons.  We will use the revaluation exercise to collect more information on how many properties are vacant or unoccupied on 1 November and the reason for that vacancy.  I stress that that will be for purely statistical information purposes.
