Members of the committee are attending remotely from within the precincts of Leinster House due to the constitutional requirement that in order to participate in meetings, members must be physically present within the confines of the place where the Parliament has chosen to sit, which is Leinster House or the Dublin Convention Centre.

I also members to use the raise-your-hand function on Teams when they wish to contribute and take it down again when they are finished.  I ask them to keep their mobile phones on silent or switched off.  Members are reminded of the provision within  Standing Order 218 that a committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy of Government or a Minister of the Government or the merits of the objective of such policies.  Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make a charges against a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<\/p> <p>  We have five items of business.

The first No. R0665 from Mr. Denis Egan, chief executive of the Irish Horseracing Regulatory Board, IHRB, dated 14 June and providing information requested by the committee relating to the cost and timeline for the installation of CCTV at racecourses.  At our meeting of 29 June, we agreed to note and publish this item and hold it over for consideration at today's meeting.  It is an issue I wish to raise.

In all honesty, the correspondence is a bit petty and it is a poor response, almost childlike in its manner.  However, I welcome the clarification of a few details that the committee had picked up incorrectly.  The fact is that the IHRB had for years been talking about CCTV cameras, at least since 2017.  It is true that it diverted funds for that away to the online integrity portal.  I understand the matter is coming before the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine in the next few days.  That committee also had concerns around items in the media.  The matter will be discussed at that meeting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021070600002#A01100","speaker":"1497"},{"type":"speech","time":1625560200,"counter":15,"content":"<p>The key issue here is that we had all read the same information the same way.

The important thing is that the CCTV be installed in the stables at every racecourse to protect the industry and the individuals who work within it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021070600002#A01200","speaker":"1489"},{"type":"speech","time":1625560200,"counter":16,"content":"<p>Both Deputies mentioned the importance of the industry.  It gets in the region of &euro;70 million a year from the public purse.  There has been a long and winding road with this issue.  I looked through my notes last night.  Some &euro;18 million was awarded for the integrity fund back in 2018.  Twenty-five racetracks in the State were to start a programme of installing CCTV.  An amount of &euro;60,000 was allocated for CCTV systems at four tracks in 2018.  Some &euro;80,000 was then allocated in 2019.  We were told in correspondence that the &euro;60,000 was not spent and lapsed.  The &euro;80,000 was transferred and reallocated for licensing.  The &euro;80,000 comes back into play in 2018.  That money was provided to install CCTV at four tracks.  At this point, only one of the 25 tracks, Leopardstown, has CCTV.  Members can tell me otherwise if I have that wrong.<\/p> <p>  On 4 May 2021, invitations were eventually published for tenders after we followed up on all of this earlier in the year.<\/p><p>The question is why did it take three years to get this far.  Why were the four tracks not done in 2019?  I do not know what the answer to that question is.  When the &euro;80,000 was first allocated in 2018, what happened there?  Why was the original &euro;60,000 in 2018 not used?  It is a really long and twisty road the board has travelled with it.  I ask that the clerk write back to it.  I welcome that the agriculture committee is taking this issue up as well.  Its members will pursue this vigorously.  We should ask the IHRB to inform us of progress because it said in its last letter that the invitation for tenders was only published on 4 May.  The closing date for submissions of tenders was 21 May.  That has been extended, according to the letter, and the conclusion of the contract is August 2021.  The IHRB goes on to say: \"However, the number of tenders and the complexities of the submissions may impact on the above timelines.\"  That indicates we may have further delays, so we should ask the board to be informed after that date on what progress has been made and has that process has been concluded.  Is that agreed by the committee?  Agreed.  I thank members.<\/p><p> The next item is No. 667B from Mr. Maurice Buckley, chairperson of the Office of Public Works, OPW, dated 18 June 2021, providing information requested by the committee on the ongoing discussion between the OPW and the landlord of Miesian Plaza, now the headquarters of the Department of Health.  It concerns the OPW's mismeasurement, or I suppose we could call it under-measuring, of the floor space which was flagged by the Comptroller and Auditor General and is expected to cost the taxpayer about &euro;10 million during the lifetime of the lease.  We addressed the matter in our report on our engagement on the OPW which we published in May.  The OPW has been in negotiations with the landlord since 2018.  According to this correspondence, a meeting took place on 3 June but no further information is supplied other than to say that both parties are committed to continuing the process.  At our meeting on 29 June we agreed to hold over this item for consideration at today&rsquo;s public meeting.  We also agreed to request the agenda of the meeting referred to in the correspondence, the minutes and details of the matters discussed, including the outcome of the meeting, and the agenda for the next meeting and when it is scheduled to take place.  Deputy Catherine Murphy flagged the Miesian Plaza item for discussion.

It is fair to say that given they have been meeting since 2018, the OPW is, from what we have seen so far, not in a very strong position legally.

I understand the landlord may have other properties rented out to the State.<\/p> <p>  No. 668 is correspondence from Ms Vivienne Flood, head of public affairs at RT&Eacute;, dated 18 June.  It provides information requested by the committee regarding the audit being conducted by Revenue, which relates to RT&Eacute;&rsquo;s engagement of contractors.  At our meeting on 29 June we agreed to note and publish this item of correspondence, and to hold it over for consideration in public session today.  We have an ongoing exchange of correspondence arising from our engagement with RT&Eacute;, representatives of which were before us on 27 April.  We requested further information arising from that meeting and have sought clarification and additional information on a number of areas.  The correspondence before us today is a response to our letter of 8 June.  Arising from our meetings on 15 and 22 June, we issued another letter to RT&Eacute; on 28 June, to which we await a response.  We also sent a letter to the Minister expressing the committee&rsquo;s concerns about the lack of information RT&Eacute; has provided to the committee.

When we asked RT&Eacute; it cited the confidentiality agreement with Revenue.  It is clear from Revenue's correspondence there is no restriction on its part.  I therefore propose we write to RT&Eacute; again asking it, in the public interest and considering it is substantially funded through a compulsory charge on each household, to publish the full details of that settlement with Revenue in order for us to have a better picture of the work on bogus self-employment and other issues this committee has been actively engaged on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021070600002#B00600","speaker":"1451"},{"type":"speech","time":1625560200,"counter":23,"content":"<p>Obviously Revenue cannot disclose it but RT&Eacute; can voluntarily disclose it to us and it should do so.

I would also invite RT&Eacute; management informally to take it upon themselves to write to the committee and disclose what we have asked.  Revenue has made it as clear as black and white that there is nothing whatsoever precluding RT&Eacute; from doing that.  It is vital it does that in the interests of transparency.  Let us just wait and see if RT&Eacute; comes clean and furnishes us with that information.  No. 668 was the comparative review of the remuneration of Irish-speaking workers I raised with RT&Eacute; when they were in.  I asked a review of the time.

One is that a letter go to the Department, as outlined by Deputy Murphy.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.

Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  The next item of correspondence is No. 661 and I propose we take it with No. 710.  No. 661 is from the European Anti-Fraud Office, dated 17 June 2021, responding to our request regarding publication of the office&rsquo;s previous correspondence to the committee.  The proposed action is to note this item.  It relates to our requests for information on the ongoing investigation into the so-called Cabra Accounts.  We have a related item of correspondence from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, No. 685, as well as correspondence from Deputy Marc MacSharry, No. 710, so I propose we take these together?  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  The response from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na acknowledges the ongoing investigation by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, and states that any comment on that investigation could be prejudicial to a possible criminal investigation.  Correspondence No. 710C is from Deputy Marc MacSharry, dated 5 July 2021, enclosing correspondence from an individual, and it was forwarded to the clerk to the committee yesterday.  It requests that the committee &ldquo;consider and endorse&rdquo; 23 questions and send them to GSOC.  The correspondence concerns the aforementioned GSOC investigation, which GSOC has stated is a criminal investigation undertaken in the public interest.<\/p> <p>  While the previous Committee of Public Accounts published a report in 2017 on its examination of matters related to financial procedures at the Garda College in Templemore, and while GSOC is accountable to this committee in terms of its annual accounts, it is not clear how attempting to direct the GSOC investigation would assist our work or whether it would be in order for the committee to proceed as suggested in the correspondence.  The committee only received the correspondence yesterday and it runs to 33 pages.  The secretariat received the correspondence items at lunchtime yesterday, they were circulated around 4 p.m. yesterday afternoon, and the first sight I had of them was this morning - all 33 pages.  I propose that the correspondence be considered by the committee next week.  This will allow me, as Cathaoirleach, and other members of the committee time to consider its content.<\/p> <p>  Deputies MacSharry, Murphy and Carthy have flagged this issue for discussion.

I am concerned that it is almost four years to the day, or just in excess of that, since we first dealt with this matter.  I support the Chairman's call that we would be able to consider these questions over the course of the week and discuss them next week.  The reason I was rushing to get them in was because I thought today was the last day we could discuss anything and I did not want to lose the summer before having us consider these very detailed questions.  Obviously, GSOC may well come back to us, if the committee agrees to submit them, and say it will not be answering them and it is continuing with its work, or whatever.  In any event, the detail of these questions can usefully be put by the committee and, perhaps, if they are published by the committee as questions of the committee, it might focus minds elsewhere to inject a little pace into a process that seems to have lacked it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021070600002#D00600","speaker":"1606"},{"type":"speech","time":1625560200,"counter":44,"content":"<p>I note that GSOC advised the committee in correspondence on 21 April that its investigation was in its final stages and would conclude shortly.

I also think, given it is a time-sensitive issue, that we should advise the correspondent to forward any information he has at this point to GSOC.  If GSOC is in the final stages of its criminal investigation and if the correspondent has information that may be pertinent to that, he should forward it to GSOC immediately.  Obviously, GSOC has to make judgments on these matters, and the more information it has, the better.

It is a very important issue.  I am concerned about it.  Deputy Murphy and other committee members are also concerned about it.  There are serious matters involved.  I am also mindful that a criminal investigation is being carried out.  Matters have also been raised in the correspondence that are relevant to a court hearing on 5 October this year.  We are to be mindful of that also.  These are two reasons in doing our work we do not want to impair or impact negatively on the work of GSOC or the work of the courts on a different matter on 5 October.  I respectfully suggest the committee scrutinises the correspondence over the next day or two and then comes back to it.  Is that agreed? Agreed.<\/p> <p>  No. 663B, from Mr. Niall Cody, chairman, Office of the Revenue Commissioners, dated 17 June 2021, provides information requested by the committee on the disclosure of details of settlements made with Revenue.  This is correspondence we referred to earlier.  We had more or less dealt with this.  We had asked Revenue if, from its point of view, there was any impediment to RT&Eacute; providing the committee with details of its settlement with Revenue.  Mr. Cody says &ldquo;it is wholly a matter for the person or body who entered into a tax settlement with Revenue to decide whether it is appropriate to disclose the details of any settlement subject to any legislative constraints&rdquo;.  The proposed action is to note and publish.  We have dealt with that, and if Deputies Murphy and Munster are happy with that, we will move on from it.  The point made in the letter is that Mr. Cody clearly outlines there is no issue from Revenue's point of view with RT&Eacute; disclosing to the Committee of Public Accounts how much was involved in that settlement.  Is the committee happy enough with that?  Yes.<\/p> <p>  No. 681B, from Mr. Graham Doyle, Secretary General, Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, dated 23 June 2021, provides information requested by the committee regarding cost rental schemes.  This arises from our engagement with the Department on 3 June.  I understand the committee secretariat has also received the rest of the information that was requested at that meeting and it will be circulated in due course.  This information has just come in.  The proposed action is to note and publish. Deputy Carroll MacNeill had particular questions around that.  Deputy Murphy has also flagged this issue for discussion.

Deputy Carroll MacNeill's question was around the ownership, which is outlined in the correspondence that says it is one of the first cost rental homes projects in Ireland.  The project is 50 two-bedroom cost rental apartments on Enniskerry Road in Stepaside by D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council.  These will be completed and tenanted by Tuath Housing and Respond, both approved housing bodies, in the third quarter of 2021.  There are also 105 social homes.  Deputy Murphy's point is they are still costing &euro;1,200 a month, which still a high enough rent considering there is Government and Exchequer subvention.

I completely acknowledge that &euro;1,200 per month is very significantly less than &euro;2,000 per month, but my understanding of cost rental is it would be a mix of people, including individuals on the housing lists.  If it is going to include both, it would require quite a bit of subsidy from the public side, probably through the housing assistance payment, HAP.  I question whether, if people had a real choice, they would take on a 25-year-long lease at &euro;1,200 per month.  When they end up as a pensioner, where do they go from there?  There is some thinking out to be done on this with regard to value for money.  It is more from the policy aspect rather than the point of view of the Committee of Public Accounts.  I am not at all sure this aspect has been considered.  The particular housing association has done as well as it could do, but it shows how expensive housing will be and how precarious it will be later on for people when they get to pension age.

The legislation is before us in the House this week.  We can discuss it in that context also.  The current scheme does not allow subvention through HAP.  There is not a long- term subsidy to provide it through HAP.<\/p><p>The second issue is there is an allowance for people in order that they can continue to live in their current home at a reduced rent or with an income support when they reach retirement age.

We cannot look at it closely enough to make sure both the public and private providers, which are going to provide this model, do so in a way that is efficient.

I was surprised to learn recently, when I raised this matter with the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Ossian Smyth, that only 4,000 connections have been done so far this year.  That would show we are barely chipping away at it and taking a small chip out of what needs to be done.  We know from replies to parliamentary questions that the contract had a target of 115,000 connections in 2021, so 4,000 so far is not what you would call good progress.  You could say that Covid-19 could hold up communications works.  Communication workers were out on the ground.  It is one of the areas that was not held up by Covid-19.  I note from the correspondence that there will be a remedial plan.  We need to see that plan.<\/p><p>In my interaction with the Minister of State, which was only a couple of weeks ago, he confirmed to me, which came as a surprise, that no penalties are included in the contract despite me, when I was spokesperson on this matter, and indeed other people in the House being assured there were going to be stringent penalties.  We have now been told that only 4,000 have been connected up to a couple of weeks ago and that the target falls a long way short of the 115,000 connections to premises and households in 2021.  For members' attention, I have a transcript of the Minister of State, Deputy Smyth's, reply to me in the D&aacute;il:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThe Deputy asked whether there were penalty clauses. As I understand it, there are none in the current contract.<br \/><br \/>The Deputy also asked about the Minister's representative on NBI.  I might defer to the Minister, Deputy Ryan, if he has an answer. <\/blockquote> <p>The point I am making is we have only one representative on the board.  My real areas of concern from the point of view of public money are that only 4,000 connections were done at that stage, according to the Minister of State, and he was not aware of any penalties.<\/p><p>I ask that we correspond with the Secretary General of the Department to express our concern about this reply from the Minister of State in the D&aacute;il and ask the Department to confirm the current position.  We should ask it to clarify exactly what the current position is regarding the number of connections but also whether we are in a situation where there is no penalty in terms of missed targets for the broadband contract.  If the contractors do not meet the targets, then so be it.  There are no penalties for them.  I was assured, as were other Deputies in the D&aacute;il Chamber on a number of occasions, as far as I can recall, including by the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment in the previous Government, Deputy Bruton, that there would be penalties.  We could ask for that to be clarified.<\/p><p>It is worth mentioning that, in his reply, the Minister of State said the number of homes that have been passed and are ready for connection to broadband is 4,000.

I would be agreeable to that suggestion.  This was quite controversial at the time.  There was only one bid at the end and there were question marks, first of all, about who would own the asset at the end.  The second issue was the ability of the entity actually to deliver because its experience had been more on the financial side than delivery on the telecommunications side.  We always understood this was about the number of houses and businesses that were passed.<\/p> <p>  One of the reasons we would have been concerned is that the cost of broadband may not be sufficiently attractive for people to take up the opportunity to connect to broadband.  There has never been a greater need, which I believe we all appreciate.  The previous year has certainly demonstrated that broadband is an essential service.<\/p> <p>  We are right to interrogate what exactly this tender guaranteed.  What they are doing now is largely overlaying on existing infrastructure.  The entity that originally considered pitching for the broadband plan then withdrew.  Some of its apparatus is being used, for instance, telephone poles and so on.

It includes information on a range of issues, including driver theory tests, the DART interconnector project, the Coast Guard, the process for appointing new members to agency boards, and roads improvement and maintenance.  The proposed action is to note and publish this correspondence.<\/p> <p>  I wish to raise a few points about this, as does Deputy Catherine Murphy.  A detailed amount of information came with the correspondence.  The information of particular interest to me relates to the suspension of driver theory tests.  The Department points out that work is progressing on ensuring that the Road Safety Authority, RSA, has sufficient facilities for temporary testers and that the current plan is to have these in place by July.  The Department mentions that the current facilities are being expanded, where possible, to accommodated new testers.  The intention is to add six new driver test centres, which is welcome news.  A centre will open in Birr in my constituency at the County Arms Hotel.  The Department says that, in line with the further easing of restrictions, the gradual reopening of in-person driver theory tests commenced on 8 June.  The RSA will reopen its network of test centres and will be permitted to conduct 25,000 theory tests per month.<\/p> <p>  Having read all of this, I am still baffled as to why the theory test was not continued during the pandemic, given that it is carried out in cubicles and does not involved large gatherings of people in rooms.  I understand that the test is carried out in a specially designed kiosk.  I fail to see why the tests were suspended.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021070600002#G01500","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speech","time":1625560200,"counter":81,"content":"<p>It is useful correspondence.  It is comprehensive and contains some good information, including on the issue of test centres and the strategy in that regard.<\/p> <p>  I have picked out two matters in particular, the first of which is the DART interconnector.  In 2015 or thereabouts, it was brought to railway order level, which meant that all of the detailed work had been done.  A significant amount of money had been spent, certainly tens of millions of euro, on the investigations into the route the tunnel would take, the environmental considerations and the civil engineering issues.  I was trying to find out how much of that work could be reused.  Obviously, a new study is ongoing because the reply reads: \"As the study is ongoing, the amount of useable information in progressing a preferred route, leading to a corridor for protection, can only be determined following the study's outcome.\"  Some of the same areas are being studied again.  I imagine that there are not many additional routes that can be considered.  Maybe we should ask the Department how much was spent getting the project to that stage.  I would like us to do that.  The Department is saying that a full reassessment of the route has to be obtained, but we do not want a duplication of costs.  That is my concern.<\/p> <p>  I believe the whole country will benefit from this project.  Someone will possibly be able to travel seamlessly from one end of the country to the other by virtue of that interconnector.  Certainly, the counties surrounding Dublin would benefit from it considerably.  A great deal of money is being spent on the expansion of DART, and this project is a part of that.  Might we ask the Department what had been spent on it by the time it reached railway order level so that we have something to match it against when this review happens?  We need to reuse information and the work that was done previously as much as possible.<\/p> <p>  I also wish to raise the issue of the Coast Guard.  At the meeting, we were told that the State did not own the helicopters.  What seems clear from this correspondence, though, is that this does not meant that we did not invest in helicopters.  We provided a grant for helicopters that we do not own.  Might we ask plainly how much capital the State invested in helicopters that we do not own?<\/p><p>It seems clear from the reply that this was a one-off, major purchase.  It is implied that we invested in helicopters but they are not owned by the State.  The amount of the total investment would be useful information to have.

This issue was referred to in previous correspondence from the Department, No. R0551, dated 29 April.  The Secretary General reiterates in the latest correspondence that &quot;the Department of Health did not gather sensitive medical and educational information on children involved in court cases in the manner portrayed&quot; in a television programme broadcast on 25 March.<\/p><p>Mr. Watt also provides a report, published in April, that sought to establish the facts regarding special education litigation in the light of certain allegations made in that programme.  It states:<\/p> <blockquote> \tGiven the complexities of the &quot;SENS&quot; litigation, the time necessary to either settle or defend these cases, and in recognition that the plaintiffs require coordinated responses in education and health, it was agreed a number of years ago between senior management in the Department of Education, the Department of Health, and the HSE, that valuable and limited State resources should be concentrated on resolving the cases, where it possible to do so. <\/blockquote> <p>The report goes on to say:<\/p> <blockquote> \tShould the State parties not act in coordination, it would not be possible to either provide a resolution to the plaintiff that is appropriate and complete, or otherwise, where necessary, to defend proceedings in a proper fashion.  This also ensures a consistent approach and that applicants in similar positions are treated in similar fashion and limits the possibility of some plaintiffs being treated more favourably than others, due to lack of knowledge as to how other plaintiffs in similar circumstances have had their cases dealt with. <\/blockquote> <p>The proposed action is to note and publish this correspondence.  Deputy Carthy has flagged it but he has not yet returned from the meeting of the agriculture committee.  I propose that we note and publish the correspondence.<\/p><p>The next category is C, which is correspondence from, and related to, private individuals, and any other correspondence.  Item No. R0669, dated 23 June 2021, is correspondence from an individual in regard to a protected disclosure made to Tusla.  The correspondent made the disclosure but his correspondence is more concerned with the process involved, which the correspondent feels is deeply flawed.  He states that, like many others, he was forced into a settlement agreement as a consequence of having no available legal representation afforded to him by the State.  We have received a significant number of requests for assistance from individuals who have made disclosures and been unhappy with the process.  We have sought information on protected disclosures from all Departments recently.<\/p><p>The proposed action in regard to this item of correspondence is to request the correspondent to consent to forward it to the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach, which is currently undertaking pre-legislative scrutiny of the  protected disclosures (amendment) Bill 2021.  The joint committee will have the opportunity to make recommendations on the draft legislation.  In that regard, the secretariat of this committee has circulated a draft submission from us to the joint committee highlighting some of the concerns raised by members in regard to protected disclosures.

There is a difficulty in that the Free Legal Advice Centres, FLAC, have responsibility only for providing free legal aid in family law cases.  There is no provision for legal aid in the case of people taking cases to bodies like the WRC.  Last year, there was a significant increase in the number of people who sought legal aid, mainly because there were issues to do with redundancy and a range of other issues that arose in the context of Covid.  The pandemic really exposed a weakness in the system.  It is fine when somebody has union representation, for example, but there are occasions where people do not have that representation.  In fact, the more precarious their employment, the less likely they are to be represented.  There is a gap there that is not necessarily around the issue of Tusla and the nature of this particular complaint.  There is a wider issue in regard to the WRC and the availability of free legal aid where people require it.  There is no provision in that regard.

All members must join remotely from elsewhere in the parliamentary precincts.  The secretariat can issue invitations to join the meeting on MS Teams.  Members may not participate in the meeting from outside of the parliamentary precincts.

Please note that messages sent to the meeting chat are visible to all participants.

I welcome Mr. John Neenan, chair of GMI, Mr. Kieran Dunne, Kildare Growers Group, Mr. Mel O'Rourke, Commercial Mushroom Producers, and Ms Anna Kavanagh, independent horticulture consultant, who are all appearing remotely.  We have received their opening statement, which has been circulated to members.  As we are limited in time due to Covid-19 safety restrictions, the committee has agreed that the opening statement will be taken as read so that we can use the full session for questions and answers.  All opening statements are published on the Oireachtas website and are publicly available.<\/p> <p>  I must give an important notice regarding parliamentary privilege.  Witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence relating to a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Participants in the committee meeting who are in locations outside the parliamentary precincts are asked to note that the constitutional protections afforded to those participating from within the parliamentary precincts do not extend to them.  No clear guidance can be given on whether or the extent to which participation is covered by the absolute privilege of a statutory nature.<\/p> <p>  This is a very important topic.  We discussed it earlier in the year and had a committee meeting on it.  We were given assurances at that meeting that there would be an interim report which would be provided to us in early April.  The indication was that it would allow home-grown peat to be harvested for the horticulture industry.  That has not happened.  Members of the committee fully understand the witnesses' anxiety and the financial pressure they must be experiencing.  I and the members of the committee are very interested to hear what they have to say this morning.  The idea of importing peat into this country is not only financial madness but also environmental madness.  Banning peat cutting in this country makes a nonsense of what we are trying to achieve.  The witnesses will have the opportunity this morning to make their presentation and answer questions from members.  Then the committee will decide what political pressure it can apply to try to help their industry.<\/p> <p>  I will open the meeting to the floor.

I do not intend to take up too much time because I spent a lot of yesterday being mushroomed out with talking about it.  The national newspapers today have covered this issue quite extensively.  I am very supportive of the horticulture sector and particularly the witnesses' sector.  It is grossly unfair and hypocrisy at its best to talk about bringing in peat or substitute peat from the Baltic states, such as vermiculite, cocoa shells and so forth.  We know they simply do not work.  We know from the Teagasc representatives who appeared before the committee that there is really no alternative.  I have focused on mushrooms but there is also the general horticulture sector.  Peat and milled peat are also used in forestry, particularly forestry nursery stock, and also in horticulture stock, including ornamental stock, and salad and vegetable production.<\/p> <p>  There is a very mixed message from the Government.  I am not in government or in a Government party and I am not here to criticise any member of the committee who is in a Government party because every member of the committee is fully committed to agriculture and horticulture.  How have the witnesses engaged with the Department?  What was the response of the Department to the case they made?  I would advocate strongly that there should be a ten-year exemption period.  Yes, we all recognise that we must find alternatives, but there are no real alternatives.  I realise I am preaching to the converted here but I am very conscious of the jobs in Monaghan, Louth, Wexford and the midlands.  We talk about sustainability and we discussed the climate action Bill, but this does not make sense.  Basically, we have carbon leakage by importing peat substitutes.  I thank the witnesses for attending the meeting and I urge them to keep advocating on behalf of their industry.  There are huge implications.  I have no doubt that we will see aspects of this issue in the courts; I am quite confident we will.  I thank the witnesses for persisting in pursuing this.  They should mobilise their industry and mobilise their elected representatives to put pressure on the Government.  The reality is that the Green Party is part of the Government.  It is part of the problem.  It might think it is part of the solution but I do not believe it is at this time.  We need to shift and apply political pressure and the industry's pressure on politicians so we can have some sort of practical alternative arrangement to support the horticulture industry in the months and years ahead.<\/p> <p>  Finally, the witnesses have a great ally in Bord Bia.  Bord Bia has done a tremendous amount of work in promoting mushrooms.  As I said yesterday in the Seanad, I went to a few supermarkets at the weekend and picked up mushrooms from refrigerators in different stores.  I could clearly see the proud Irish brand, Bord Bia, on the food products.  That is a very strong link and a strong synergy.  It is something the witnesses have to capitalise on in this case because I believe Bord Bia will be their ally.  It certainly has vast budgets for promoting organics and particularly for promoting mushrooms across the world.  I thank the witnesses for taking the time to engage with the committee on this very important issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021070600002#A00300","speaker":"1634"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1625526000,"counter":102,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for inviting us to the meeting at such short notice.

That will certainly cause major upheaval, with potentially up to 17,000 people made unemployed.  It will also affect the sector and nurseries that have been in business for two and three generations in rural Ireland, which will be devastating in certain areas.  We highlighted the situation previously and we are very disappointed that the Department has not taken the opportunity to appear before the committee to explain its actions.  Growing Media Ireland and the other representatives with me today have engaged fully with the working group.  We had six meetings and we produced an interim report.

Like Senator Boyhan, I condole with them on their plight.<\/p><p>I see the pure ridiculousness and stupidity of it.  I know hauliers who are hauling peat from Drogheda down to the south of the country.  We have this climate change and climate action debate in these Houses on a regular basis.  The one key message is the bringing of people with us and having buy-in from the community.  However, people are watching such ridiculous nonsensical activities as the importation of peat from eastern Europe.  Harvesting it out there is having the same effect on the environment and climate as doing it here but then the diesel-burning ships and lorries taking it to and from the port must be taken into account.  It just does not make sense.  We have been putting on political pressure and we will continue to do so.  As GMI said in its submission, it seems to have fallen between the cracks by virtue of there being numerous different Departments, which are able to push the blame, for want of a better word, onto each other.  Somebody must step up to the plate and make a decision.  I have a couple of quick questions.<br\/><br\/>I am thinking about how we get a resolution to this going forward.  The GMI submission is prescriptive on the alternatives being examined or developed at the moment.  In this situation, as in others, just transition has gone out the window and we have put the cart before the horse.  We have stopped the peat and now we are talking about scientific experiments and the development of alternatives.  However, of the ones GMI has listed, aside from composting and green waste, none of them seem to be Irish.  It would be an import scenario for all of them even if they were up to scratch.<br\/><br\/>Will the witnesses elaborate a little on green waste?  When I saw the heading I thought this was the solution but there are issues and problems with it that GMI has identified.  I would like to hear how we might be able to tweak some of them because it seems to be the only real alternative mentioned, from an Irish perspective.<br\/><br\/>I would also like to know about a mixture of one or other of the alternatives and peat.  If we were going to table saying that going forward, we will only need a percentage of what we did in the past, it might be easier to get a green light.  Is there the possibility of using mixtures of any or all of the alternatives GMI has mentioned?<br\/><br\/>This might be a stupid question but we are here to ask the questions.  Is there any possibility of recycling peat between different sector of the industry?  Maybe peat that has been used in horticulture could then go to the mushroom industry or <i>vice versa<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>I am trying to come up with a strengthened case for minimising the volume of peat that would need to be harvested to keep the sector viable, going forward.  As things stand at the moment what percentage of peat is the industry getting from Bord na M&oacute;na, from the private sector, or both, when it comes to harvesting?  To conclude, it is now July, so even if there was a solution to this issue and the green light was given for peat harvesting by the close of business today, have we missed a harvesting season?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021070600002#A00500","speaker":"1651","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1625526000,"counter":105,"content":"<p>There are a number of very pertinent questions there.

I hope I get to all of them.  Peat is the best growing medium and that is why we have been using it for decades.  Irish peat is the best in the world.  We have seen that over the decades because people have wanted it.  It is medium-decomposed peat and has the best air and water properties.  It has a high lignin content so it is very useful for long-term crops.  The other thing about peat is that it is a relatively light material with a low pH and low nutrient.  The beauty of that is lime and fertilisers can be added to suit any crop.  The other thing is peat is not just one product.  Peat is brought in, graded and then blended.  Even in my days in Bord na M&oacute;na there could be up to 1,000 different recipes for growers in Ireland, so the number of recipes worldwide is much higher than that.<\/p> <p>  Peat will be needed in the phasing out of peat in favour of alternatives in Ireland.  The Senator mentioned the alternatives and asked us to say a bit about green waste.  Again, from my experience in Bord na M&oacute;na, we had a state-of-the-art facility in Kilberry and green waste was produced to a good quality.  The important point is that a very good quality is needed for retail products and is even more important for professional products.  I illustrate this by saying that if you go out and by a bag of compost and grow your plants, you probably will not mind if they are different sizes and if one dies you blame yourself before anyone else.  On the professional side of the business, if I sent a load of compost to Mr. Dunne and he had variance in his plants and lost plants it is all off the bottom line as they are grown to tight specifications.  Thus the need for quality on that side is critical.  Green waste is also a very heavy material.  It is about 500 g per litre.  At the moment, green compost could only be used at about 10% to 15% in a mix because of the weight and everything else.  It also has a high conductivity, which is the salts in there.  There are concerns with green compost, depending on the source, about contamination by glass or plastic and it can even have needles in it.  There is also a concern about whether pesticides have been used on the crops, grass cuttings, hedge cuttings or anything else that goes in there.  There are a lot of issues really.  On top of that human pathogens must also be considered.<\/p> <p>  Going forward and looking at alternatives we must take a more holistic approach where we look at the entire system of production of stuff.  With, say, the green waste we can ask if there is anything else we can do to it to eliminate some of these issues.  Bord na M&oacute;na has successfully used green compost in the hobby market for number of years now, going back to 2005, probably.  Bord na M&oacute;na was the leader in peat reduction in the hobby market in the UK, so it is not as if Ireland has no experience in this area.  However, on the professional side of the business it is an entirely different matter.  There plant production is in a critical situation and things must be very closely monitored.  To use green compost in professional mixes there would need to be a very high standard.<\/p> <p>  The Senator inquired about other products.  Wood fibre is a good product and is seen worldwide as probably one of the leading products that can be used in peat reduction.  Wood fibre can be used, although it has issues with possible nitrogen lock-up.  It is a light material and has been used successfully up to approximately 35% in mixes.  The big problem with wood fibre is the competition from fuel and other wood industries.  It is difficult and the price can be sensitive.  It may be possible to have schemes going forward - and this should form part of our research and development - where there would be incentives, subsidies or land put aside to grow crops specifically to produce growing media.  That would be one option.<\/p> <p>  Coir is another product that has been mentioned but it comes predominantly from Sri Lanka.  Coir is the outer husk of the coconut.  We are talking about taking a product like that and transporting it all the way from Sri Lanka, India or somewhere around there.  We are talking about taking it from a country where water resources are valuable, even for people's own use, and asking them to use that water to clean the coir, because it contains certain salts and so on, to give us a product for growing media.<\/p><p>It is also used locally in those countries as soil conditioner and as a fuel.<\/p><p> The Senator mentioned pearlite and vermiculite.  Many other products are used as additives.  There are other products such as anaerobic digestate and waste materials that should be looked at.  Any alternative needs to be fit for purpose and sustainable.  What criteria are we using to say that it is sustainable?  I feel that we should find out what products are locally available in Ireland in sufficient quantities that we could use in future and rate those products on a scale.  In the UK, there was a calculator which looked at energy use, water use, social compliance, renewability, habitat biodiversity and other criteria.  It scores each material based on those criteria and comes up with a total score.  Peat should also be on that because it will be needed for a long time yet.<\/p><p> Another issue that the Senator mentioned was mixtures.  Mixtures can be used.  It is unlikely that there will be one material that will be used in future.  Peat has been a great product.  It is foreseen that we will use mixtures of products.  When you start research and development on mixtures of products, it is not a matter of adding A, B and C, and adding 1 and 1 to get 2, or 2 and 2 to get 4.  When these products are added, their properties need to be categorised and assessed, then you have to look at how they are put together and assess that product all over again.  It is not as simple as putting two products together then making it available.  That is where much of the research and development work will happen.  All of those combinations and their physical, chemical and microbial characteristics need to be assessed.<\/p><p> The Senator asked about the possibility of recycling peat.  That has been done a bit in the past.  It is a possibility.  With the new technologies, those things are all possible.  It is a good recommendation.  To my knowledge, Bord na M&oacute;na has ceased supply of peat for horticulture at this point, so whatever is available is coming from other producers or from abroad.  I agree with the Senator and I cannot believe that we would talk about importing peat.  If we are really concerned about climate action, kicking the ball down the road is not the answer.  If we are talking about global climate action, then buying peat from abroad is only adding to our environmental issues and it is not helping in any way.  As I said earlier, that peat is not even of the same quality as the peat in our own country.  It will decompose faster, which would contribute more to carbon dioxide emissions.<\/p><p> The Senator said that it is now July.  I agree and have raised this several times in our working group.  The main peat harvesting season is from May until September.  We have missed May and June and we do not know what the weather will bring in the next couple of months.  We need immediate action.  The working group and its industry members have been patient.  We have contributed and worked hard in six meetings over four months.  There has been much behind the scenes work to contribute to those meetings.  We need an answer for the industry at this stage.  It is at crisis point, as the Senator pointed out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021070600002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Anna Kavanagh","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1625526000,"counter":108,"content":"<p>Those were comprehensive answers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021070600002#C00200","speaker":"1611"},{"type":"speech","time":1625526000,"counter":109,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for coming in.

The mushroom industry is based on having a high-quality compost and a thin layer of peat on top of that compost to grow the mushrooms.  The industry has been successful.  People talk about the horticulture industry in general when it should be divided into subsectors.  The mushroom industry is a subsector which exports &euro;120 million worth of product to the UK.  We depend on high quality casing material, which is a blend of peat and sugar beet lime or ground limestone.  It is different from what is used in the amenity sector in that it is deep black peat that never dries out until it goes onto the bed to grow the mushrooms.  The mushrooms absorb moisture from that peat.  The peat requirement is only 20% of the growing substrate.  For each cubic metre, which is equivalent to a tonne of meat, we grow about 5 tonnes of mushrooms.  In a nutshell, the mushroom industry depends on deep-dug peat.  There is no alternative in the short or medium term.<\/p><p>Research has been carried out in Israel, South Africa and Holland to find alternatives because they have to import peat.  We are a net producer of peat and an exporter to most of those countries.  In the short to medium term there is no alternative.  To return to the point made by Senator Daly, the growing medium that we use in mushroom production can be taken out and used as a growing medium in another area of horticulture or it can be spread on the land for cereal production.  It is widely accepted that it is a valuable product for the cereal growing industry, where it is spread on the land.  We get a double use from that material.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021070600002#C00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mel O'Rourke","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1625526000,"counter":112,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. O'Rourke and I call Deputy Michael Collins.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021070600002#D00200","speaker":"1611"},{"type":"speech","time":1625526000,"counter":113,"content":"<p>I am-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021070600002#D00300","speaker":"1461"},{"type":"speech","time":1625526000,"counter":114,"content":"<p>I did not get answers to my questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021070600002#D00400","speaker":"1508"},{"type":"speech","time":1625526000,"counter":115,"content":"<p>I will come back to the witnesses in a moment and they can answer them then.

The horticulture industry, in particular the nursery stock industry, is in crisis, with raw material prices having increased by more than &euro;1,000 per load.

Is there a plan for transition for the replacement of peat for the horticulture industry in this country?  What about the peat in the bogs that can never be rewetted and returned to habitat?

That was the view across the working group from Friends of the Irish Environment to An Taisce and from the experienced horticulturists around the table.  The short-term solution is agreed.  There is general consensus that sub 30 ha. would be possible as a short-term solution and that it would be sufficient to supply the Irish horticultural industry until the medium and long-term solution is put in place.<\/p> <p>  The experience of the working group was very valuable.  A great deal of work has been done since our last meeting with the committee on 16 February.  Behind the scenes, the working group and the industry have put in a huge amount of effort to try to resolve this issue.  Up to seven months ago, we stated that by June we would be in a crisis situation.  We waited months for the working group to be put in place.  We submitted the interim report in sufficient time to allow for a resolution of the situation.  That was two months ago.  We have received little by way of solid reaction from the Government.

We are extremely hardworking and provide good paying quality jobs in rural communities throughout the country.  This can be turned into a good news story.  Instead, we are in crisis.  We have survived -18oC frost.  We have worked our way through Brexit and survived it with the help of the Departments.  Throughout the pandemic, we have remained open and kept all of our people employed.  We have put our shoulder to the wheel and put on the green jersey.  We cannot be asked to do more.  We survived the recession, which was not easy in terms of the banks, overdrafts and loans.  We survived all of this.  We are very proud of what we do.  We are hardworking people throughout rural communities in Ireland.  <\/p> <p>  Bord Bia was mentioned earlier.

By next September, we could be out of peat, which would have an impact on many parts of the horticulture industry.<\/p> <p>  We have spoken about the working group and the long-term goal of moving the industry in a slightly different direction, but I am lost as to what is happening in respect of ministerial involvement.  This is probably one of the main issues I wish to raise.  There was an interdepartmental meeting of three or four senior officials.  Is there any knowledge of what happened at that meeting and where the game stands in trying to find a solution?  Three Departments have a role in solving this issue.  Due to that interdepartmental mix, though, there seems to be little movement.  My understanding is that the remaining number of weeks are crucial.  It is unfortunate that we do not have officials from all three Departments before us so that we might try to get movement on this.  We have to reconsider doing so if possible.  I am at a loss as to why the three Departments are not present and why we have not received answers to key questions about the timeline for delivering a suitable short-term plan.  From speaking to officials and others over the past 48 hours, the next six weeks will be crucial.  There will be a major confidence issue within the industry, due to which the amazing number of people involved in it could be affected.  Given that it accounts for 17,000 jobs and more than &euro;500 million, this is a significant issue.<\/p> <p>  My understanding is that 90% of our peat imports are of water-based materials, so we are effectively paying to import water.  Is there a more effective way of importing peat from the Balkans or Poland?<\/p> <p>  I have more questions than answers, but I hope that we can get some movement in a short time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021070600002#E00500","speaker":"1666"},{"type":"speech","time":1625526000,"counter":128,"content":"<p>Regarding the officials, this meeting was called at short notice at the request of the horticulture industry and no officials were available to us this morning.

According to GMI's submission to us, the working group was still awaiting a detailed response to the report.  Has there been progress towards the urgent action required?  Had the Minister of State any light to shed on the report's contents or was his just a letter of acknowledgement?

We have.  The working group had an interim report, but it was not unanimous.  NGOs such as Friends of the Irish Environment, An Taisce and one or two more basically wrote their own report.  The interim report effectively recommended that peat harvesting continue throughout 2021 under emergency legislation and that legislation on a single system from 2022 onwards be introduced.  I am not a legal eagle, but our legal people have advised us that, in the short term, an Act of the Oireachtas could exempt large-scale harvesting for a limited period, facilitate screening for an environmental impact assessment, EIA, or an appropriate assessment, AA, instead of a full EIA, and release the industry from the requirement of a licence for a limited time, that is, 2021.  That is a short-term solution.  Primary legislation would facilitate a long-term solution exempting large-scale peat harvesting from planning requirements once a licence had been granted or an EIA report had been submitted.  The Minister could then amend the Environmental Protection Agency Act to deal explicitly with a retrospective use of peatlands and to cover any planning element that was not included in the Act.  We submitted to the working group, which submitted to the Departments, the heads of a Bill that would probably sort out this issue.  We had previously submitted them to the Departments last March.  We have heard nothing back through the working group.<\/p> <p>  Senator Lombard asked about the three Departments and the meeting of senior officials.  Officially, we have not heard anything about that.  Unofficially, we have.  Obviously, however, we have received no response.<\/p> <p>  Regarding Deputy Browne's question on whether all of the Departments were acting the same, it was felt by officials at the initial working group meeting and the previous meeting of the Oireachtas committee that some action could be taken in the short term and that legislation could be passed within two or three months.  By the second meeting of the working group meeting, though, that view had changed completely and we were back to three to four years.  Even if we had a single system, it was stated that legislation on it could take three years.<\/p> <p>  Members have asked what this committee can do.<\/p><p>Our feeling is that Government Departments do not accept that there is an emergency.  They believe there are sufficient alternatives available.  That is clearly not the case.  The Departments do not appear to understand this.  They do not understand what it is like to have a nursery and try to get supplies.  What do we tell our employees?  It is the same in the mushroom industry.  Those Departments and the Ministers concerned do not understand that there is a real crisis just around the corner at the end of September.  Mr. Dunne mentioned this, but I believe it is even worse than he has said.  One of the companies that have supplies and bought some from Bord na M&oacute;na has now been threatened with legal action that it cannot take those supplies from stockpiles, which were purchased previously.  That is ongoing also.  This is a disaster for the horticultural industry, an industry that we need to build up.<\/p><p> Last week I attended a webinar about plants, the health of plants, and the dangers involved in importing plants and peat into Ireland.  That does not seem to be taken into account either.  The situation is that the Departments do not understand or want to accept that there is an emergency going to happen.  For some unknown reason they believe that there are alternatives.<\/p><p> At the working group it was mentioned by one of the NGOs that in the short-term coir is almost essential.  I respectfully suggest that anybody who advocates for this has read absolutely nothing about coir.  As Ms Kavanagh mentioned, we do need to get a life cycle analysis of all the materials that are being used.  It certainly appears to be a case of anything but peat.  What has happened is unbelievable, that this is not understood.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021070600002#E01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Neenan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1625526000,"counter":134,"content":"<p>I have remarks to make rather than questions.  First, I must compliment the industry on the way they have approached this over the past number of months.  I am aware that the Chairman has stated that the officials were not available.  I was a Minister of State for more than nine years and no matter how short the notice the Department had of a meeting, some officials in the Department were found to come in to bring some sort of clarity to the situation.  I will not say that our meeting today is a worthless exercise but the people we need in front of us today are the Department officials.  I know exactly what our representatives from the industry are going through.   Last Thursday I spoke with a Minister - it would be wrong of me to put names on who I spoke with - and I was told, and the contributors were told, that Department officials and Ministers were meeting last Thursday.  I looked for an update on that meeting on Thursday evening and I was told yesterday that a solution would be found.  If a solution is to be found I believe it is right and proper that Department officials would come before the committee and tell us exactly how they are going to approach the issue.<\/p> <p>  My background is in the horticultural sector and I studied it in college, so I understand the industry fairly well.  It is an absolutely ludicrous situation.  We talk about climate change and greenhouse gases but when the witnesses before us today bring a solution to climate change and greenhouse gases the Department and the Ministers say to them \"You are doing a great job\" while at the same time giving them a kick up the behind.  Normally I am very slow to criticise officials because they are the pillar heads in any Department, but they should be coming before the committee here no matter how short the notice.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Neenan referred to Klasmann, which was mentioned to me also by somebody in my constituency.  I want to be very careful on this because I do not want to complicate any legal case but is it true that legal action could now be taken or is being taken whereby Klasmann has stockpiles that will bring the industry through over the next 12 months or even longer, but they are not allowed to travel across the bog to draw in these stockpiles?<\/p> <p>  Reference was also made to the importance of Bloom.  I would like to see Bord Bia taking a more proactive approach on this, in talking to the Departments of agriculture and the environment, on the importance of the sector.  Bloom is not only European renowned; it is a world renowned showcase that occurs in the Phoenix Park annually.  It attracts thousands of overseas visitors, trade stands and so on.  I am sure they are laughing at us when we talk about some people who are trying to stop the industry in its tracks in doing what it does best.<\/p> <p>  Perhaps the witnesses could let the committee know about the Klasmann issue.  I am not sure if they can say too much about it.  I compliment Mr. Dunne on his approach to this.  I have spoken with people who were on that group over the past months and I am aware that they have approached this in a very professional manner.  It is up to the Ministers of State, Senator Hackett and Deputy Noonan, and the Department officials, to step up to the plate and to bring some clarity to this issue.  I am in government and I will do whatever I can, as I have been doing over the last months, to bring some solution here.  I understand there are environmental issues but I really do believe that a solution can be found here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021070600002#F00200","speaker":"1619"},{"type":"speech","time":1625526000,"counter":135,"content":"<p>Deputy Kehoe asked a very specific question about a particular company and a legal case.

We as a group, and I personally, have been in touch the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, and the horticulture sections within that Department, and with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage on a daily and weekly basis.  We started out on this issue four or five months ago and we have been fair, experienced, understanding and professional.  I must say that all of the Departments have been equal to that.  They have not ignored us.  The situation is so difficult.  They have not ignored us, but we have not made progress.  We have not made one ounce of progress moving forward.  To be fair, it is not easy to resolve this situation.  We have resolved so many other difficult issues that it is not impossible to resolve it.  It was mentioned earlier that where there is a will there is a way.  All we want is the will.<\/p><p>We as an industry have bought into all aspects of government by way of policy, support and working on all aspects of growing our industry, both locally and on the export market, so there is a will on the part of our industry to work together.  I work very closely with the Department, and as of 8.40 a.m. - we were on our test call at 8.45 a.m. - there was no further update from the three different Departments, or will we call them the three musketeers?  At this point in time there is no progress.  I think someone mentioned earlier urgency.  There was urgency five months ago, so this is certainly urgent at this point in time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021070600002#F00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kieran Dunne","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1625526000,"counter":142,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. O'Rourke, Mr. Dunne, Ms Kavanagh and Mr. Neenan for an informative and pragmatic overview of the situation in which they find themselves.  As a Government representative on the committee, I am both disappointed and somewhat embarrassed that there has been no progress.  When we last met the witnesses, we met departmental officials as well, and maybe I was naive at the time but I felt the working group would arrive at a solution.  I thank the Chairman for allowing the witnesses to come before the committee at short notice.  Everyone on the committee will agree it is imperative that we get these three Departments in before the committee as a matter of urgency.  We will discuss this later, but our work schedule for the remaining days of this D&aacute;il session needs to be set aside until we deal with this issue.  As was rightly said, two months of the sector's harvest have been lost, and unless we get a breakthrough in a matter of days or weeks, the sector will not get any significant harvest this year.  Mr. Neenan set out that the sector has put forward its own solution.  It sounds workable and pragmatic.  I am still not sure whether the working group has fact-checked that proposal or whether it has an opinion on it.  We will have to get that from the Departments when we get them in before us because, in the absence of the Departments coming with another viable plan, that seems to be the only plan open to us at the moment.<\/p> <p>  As for replacements for peat for the horticultural sector, we talk about all the various options but there is no proven option out there.  It seems ludicrous, given the strong horticultural sector we have, to suddenly stop supplying peat in the hope that something will magically appear overnight to replace it.  There is simply nothing out there, and no business or PLC would make such a decision.  For three Departments to procrastinate on this issue in the hope that somehow a replacement product will magically appear seems nonsensical.<\/p> <p>  I have one question for Mr. Dunne.  His view is that Bord na M&oacute;na has stopped producing peat.  I am based in Longford, and over the past four to five days, I have had numerous calls about Bord na M&oacute;na stockpiling large quantities of peat.  I am just looking back on my notes on this.  Tonnes of peat are being stockpiled in embankments of 100 m to 150 m at Clooneeny bog on the outskirts of Killashee.  The plan is to continue stockpiling it, and over time it will be moved by lorries and sold on.  However, it will take months to move the peat that is there and Bord na M&oacute;na continues to stockpile it.  Clearly, therefore, the company is continuing to operate regardless of what has been said, and that is worrying.  It is also worrying that the horticulture industry is basically being held to ransom while Bord na M&oacute;na, it would appear, continues to operate.  If Mr. Dunne could shed any light on that, I would appreciate it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021070600002#G00200","speaker":"1597"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1625526000,"counter":143,"content":"<p>I certainly can.  It is not my view that Bord na M&oacute;na is not moving any peat.  That statement came from Bord na M&oacute;na at an IFA meeting.  The only peat Bord na M&oacute;na has at the moment is for briquettes.  It is fuel peat, not horticultural-grade peat.  I know this from walking the bogs and from the officials in Bord na M&oacute;na.  Horticultural peat can be stockpiled for a maximum of 18 months or it is not usable.  Ms Kavanagh might like to come in on this, but that is what I know from being on the ground.  I have hundreds of acres of Bord na M&oacute;na bog pretty close to me with same stockpiles but I could not use it.  It is purely fuel peat and is not suitable for horticulture.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021070600002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kieran Dunne"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1625526000,"counter":144,"content":"<p>I agree with Mr. Dunne.  Even the bog he mentioned would not be used for horticulture.  I am pretty confident that Bord na M&oacute;na has finished the supply of horticultural peat.<br\/><br\/>Deputy Fitzmaurice asked about research and development and whether it would take five to ten years or whatever else.  It is difficult to answer that question.  Going on my experience in the UK, where I spent 20 years, it was at the forefront of not using peat and examining peat alternatives and has been doing so since the early 1990s but it has not come up with alternatives to peat.  The UK is using a lot of alternatives along with peat in both the retail and the professional market but it has not replaced its more than 5 million cu. m of peat used with alternatives, so there is not a quick fix and we need to see what sustainable, responsibly resourced materials we have.  As Mr. Neenan and I said earlier, we need to do life cycle analyses on those materials and need to know whether any of them seem to be as bad as people perceive peat to be, which is not necessarily our view, to judge it from there and then to test and research those products.  It is difficult to put an exact year on it.  Furthermore, going back to the properties of alternatives, there is no better diluent for those alternatives than Irish peat because Irish peat has the best buffering capacity.  It will kind of buffer the inadequacies of some of those alternatives.  It is crazy that we are importing peat.<br\/><br\/>I wish to refer briefly to an article published in the <i>Baltic Business Quarterly<\/i>magazine on 29 June.  It states that Latvia has reported a 35% increase in exports of its peat in the past four years.  It is giving Latvia its highest export potential, and 31% of what is used in the EU comes from Latvia.  It is also stated in the article that 1 cu. m of peat grows 6,000 young trees, enough to cover 3 ha of land and grow 7,000 seedling plants.  That is enough to grow 16 tonnes of cucumbers or 32 tonnes of tomatoes.  Latvia produces 2 million tonnes, which is 10 million cu. m to 12 million cu. m, of peat.  Estonia and Lithuania produce the same amount.  The distinction is made between use for power, energy and fuel and use for horticulture.  That has been missed here, and I would like to point out that the use of horticultural peat in Ireland represents only 0.12% of Irish peatlands.  That contributes to food production and plant production, which is for the well-being of our citizens.  There can be an inaccurate accounting of greenhouse gases as well.  Peat is part of a circular economy.  It does not go to waste when it is finished.  The peat that is used to grow plants eventually probably ends up in the soil so it is used in that way.  Mr. O'Rourke also pointed out that in the mushroom industry it is used on land to condition soil for cereal growing.  We should appreciate that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021070600002#G00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Anna Kavanagh"},{"type":"speech","time":1625526000,"counter":145,"content":"<p>I have others who want to come in.

People have been talking about relevant Ministers.  It is time the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine takes a hands-on approach to this issue because this is an agricultural issue.  It deals with farms and farms that need our support.  The sector I am most familiar with is mushrooms because it is a key component of agriculture in my own county, Monaghan.  It is important that people recognise where it came from.  The mushroom farmers of Monaghan generally come from small holdings, historically unprofitable, who did what they were asked and diversified.  They found an alternative product which meant they moved from being unsustainable and unprofitable holdings to being key economic drivers for a whole region.  Now they are telling us and the Minister that they face an existential crisis.<\/p> <p>  I do not take any industry verbatim when it comes to outline the issues it faces; one always has to balance that with alternative facts that are available.  The difficulty the Government has here is that no alternative facts have been presented.  There are only those presented by Growing Media and the others here before us.  No one has disputed what they have said to the degree that when the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Ryan, was challenged by me and others in the D&aacute;il on the solution, he volunteered that it was the importation of peat from third countries.  That is a lunatic position.  It is lunacy in economic terms for the operation of the farms I mentioned but even from an environmental perspective, if environmental and climate action concerns were your driving motivator, why would you not take the opportunity to ensure that we have robust environmental rules around the extraction of horticultural peat and ensure that those rules are enforced and monitored in a way that you simply cannot do when a product is imported?<\/p> <p>  I will reiterate a point that was just made.  This goes to the lack of understanding among Ministers in Departments which conflate the use of peat extraction for the use of fuel and energy with that of horticultural peat.  We are talking about horticultural peat mass being 0.1% of the overall peat mass in this country.  The position that has been adopted is tokenism at its worst.  It is doing a huge disservice to those of us who are ambitious and who want to see a robust climate action agenda adopted by the State.  It is setting out that our Government's priority is tokenistic measures that do nothing for the environment but put people out of jobs and farms and companies out of business.  <\/p> <p>  I think emergency legislation is necessary to allow peat extraction to take place this year and next year.  What would the timeframe need to be for that to happen?  There has been some discussion on alternatives.  As well as the Minister's much-lauded importation of peat, we have heard of composted green waste as an alternative.  Coir, the extract from coconuts, and also products such as perlite and vermiculite which are sourced from open cast mines.

Whether peat is got in Latvia or any other country, does it make any difference?  Why should we import a product that we have in plentiful supply in this country?  I have listened to this debate and I listened to other debates.  The guests are welcome.  Their industry has been attacked, like a lot of other industries around this country, because of decisions being made by politicians.  Deputy Kehoe spoke earlier about officials and the Chairman mentioned officials coming in at short notice.  The reason the officials do not want to come in today is because there is no political leadership in this.  The political leadership in this is that they do not want peat to be produced in this country.  We have a daft situation where we are bringing in peat from Latvia.  I fell over a bale of briquettes the other day that came in from another country, and us with more peat in this country than any place else in the world.  If it is going to be taken out of some place else in the world, would we not be well to take it out in Ireland?  We will have to make political decisions today when this meeting is over.  We are going to have to talk.  This is a political issue that needs to be dealt with because we will have more problems down the line if this continues.  I am getting sick and tired of the direction we are going in.  I was not that in favour of voting for the Bill last week.  It was either do that or get out of the party and that may have to come at that stage as well.<\/p><p>The detail in that has not yet been produced but when it is, it will hurt the Chairman and many other Members.  There may come a time when we have to say enough is enough.  Enough is enough with peat.  Peat should be harvested in Ireland, sold in Ireland and produced in Ireland.

Some of my questions have been answered but for the most urgent one, I do not think there has been a clear answer.  It concerns what legislation would need to be amended or what new legislation might be needed.  I acknowledge Mr. Dunne 's point that this is not an easy fix, although it is nonetheless urgent.<\/p> <p>  This was signalled perhaps two years ago, when Bord na M&oacute;na, for commercial reasons, ended horticultural peat extract.  Might more have been done then in order that we would not find ourselves in this position now?  I am open to being educated by the witnesses.  Is it simply the case that the industry and the operators within would need to apply for planning permission and go through the formal processes of appropriate environmental impact assessment reports and so on?  Was that not done and are we now in a situation where that would take too long, given that planning permission cannot be granted quickly?<\/p> <p>  I might make a point in response to Deputy Ring.  I do not think the climate Bill has any bearing whatsoever on this and we should not leave anyone watching proceedings with the impression it has.<\/p> <p>  Finally, what proportion of harvested horticultural peat was exported in 2019?  Can our guests confirm that we are looking for a solution purely for domestic horticultural peat and that we are not seeking to open up export potential as well?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021070600002#J00300","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1625526000,"counter":159,"content":"<p>A number of questions have been raised.  Deputy Flaherty asked whether the legislation that GMI submitted to the Government was fact-checked.  The working group submitted it to each of the Departments, namely, the Departments of the Environment, Climate and Communications and Housing, Local Government and Heritage, in order that their legal representatives could check it.  That was probably at the end of April or early May and there has been no response to that.<\/p> <p>   Deputy Carthy and the Chairman asked about a timeframe for primary or secondary legislation.  Emergency legislation can be prepared in a very short period by way of secondary legislation., although ideally, the longer-term solution should be by way of primary legislation.  Our legal advisers have submitted heads of those two Bills to both Departments, and we have no difficulty submitting them to the committee after this meeting as well, if members wish.<\/p> <p>  To respond to Deputy Leddin, the situation has been ongoing since 2012 or 2013.  It came to a head in February 2018, when operators first learned of a difficulty with the long-standing exemption from planning.  GMI and many others believe it was an unintended consequence of an Act of 2011.  In December 2018, operators learned that this difficulty would not be resolved by an appeal to the Court of Appeal.  In January 2019, they learned the State had resolved the difficulty by removing peat harvesting from planning control and transferring the responsibility to the Environmental Protection Agency.  In October 2019, the court ruled that the legislation was not correct and that there were issues with it and in July 2020, operators learned they could not lawfully resolve the issue within the substitute consent process, which was another problem.  In December 2020, operators learned the State had passed a law to remedy the public participation defect in the process.  One of our members has had an application in with An Bord Plean&aacute;la for more than 14 months, seeking leave to apply for substitute consent, and that has not been dealt with.  Another member got leave to apply but that is likely to be challenged in the courts.<\/p> <p>  I listen to these issues as a member of the working group.  The company I work for, Klasmann-Deilmann, was offered grant aid by the State to develop the bogs in Rathowen, County Westmeath.  Part of the grant aid was given on the basis that the company could not sell its product in Ireland or the UK but rather in Europe.  Questions are now being asked as to why the State fulfilled that.  It was the same with Bord na M&oacute;na.  People do not know the history of these issues.  The board was set up to develop the boglands and create much-needed employment in those rural areas, and to supply energy peat as well.  Things move on, and we seem to forget all those aspects and they need to be pointed out.  There was nothing wrong with companies exporting peat.  As I said, they were encouraged by the State to do so.  Klasmann-Deilmann was funded to improve our facilities and our training for all our employees, which we availed of.  Now, some companies have commitments to supplying peat, having entered into contracts with some of the multiples.  They have to continue with that but it will finish soon.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Fitzmaurice knows more about the sub-30 ha provision than I do.  My understanding is that the point about the sub-30 ha provision was raised in the context of moving some turf cutters from one bog to another and they were brought to areas of under 30 ha.  The sub-30 ha provision, as Mr. Dunne said, will be a very short-term solution.  Imagine the dairy farmers of Ireland were told they could operate with their dairy herd only on 30 ha or less.  Would Avonmore, Kerry Group, Lakeland or whatever remain in Ireland doing that?  It is crazy when we consider that just over one tenth of 1% of boglands in Ireland are for horticulture.<\/p> <p>  I am not a legal expert but we are happy enough with the legislation.  I would respectfully suggest that it is not Growing Media Ireland that should be providing to the State the solution for a problem.  However, we have offered a solution, as well as outlining it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021070600002#J00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Neenan"},{"type":"speech","time":1625526000,"counter":160,"content":"<p>I call Senator Gallagher.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021070600002#K00100","speaker":"1611"},{"type":"speech","time":1625526000,"counter":161,"content":"<p>If I may-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021070600002#K00200","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speech","time":1625526000,"counter":162,"content":"<p>I will call Deputy Leddin again in a minute.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021070600002#K00300","speaker":"1611"},{"type":"speech","time":1625526000,"counter":163,"content":"<p>I will be very quick.

Many families and communities are totally dependent on the mushroom industry.  The word \"crisis\" has been used regarding this situation; I would use the word \"emergency\".  It is unforgivable that we are a matter of weeks away from a doomsday cliff-edge situation where the economy of County Monaghan will be severely damaged as a result of this.<\/p> <p>  I have listened to the contributions of the witnesses and the members of the committee which I have found very informative.  I would use the term \"environmental showmanship\", not just on this issue but in respect of food production in this country, because we do not mind moving the problem so that it is anywhere but here.  We are turning a blind eye to carbon footprints and carbon emissions in other countries at the expense of production there and in the context of the issue in question in this country.

This is a serious issue.<\/p> <p>  I will confine the remainder of my contribution to questions.

Mr. Neenan said that no Department or office of the State has come back to him with their consideration of his submission on the heads of the Bill to counteract the court decision made in 2019.  I ask him to provide more detail about the application for leave for substitute consent which spent 14 months with An Bord Plean&aacute;la awaiting decision.  Again, we see impact of the lack of a statutory time limit for An Bord Plean&aacute;la to make decisions.  We see this in the context of housing, in the commercial sector and now in this sector, which is under immense pressure.  Even with the limited options that remain open for application, it is not good enough that an arm of the State has been dealing with this application for 14 months.  The Government has committed to a planning reform Bill in the autumn.  I call on this committee and others to offer their support to ensure that An Bord Plean&aacute;la will be subject to a statutory time period in which to make decisions on planning applications.<\/p> <p>  I refer to the working group and its consideration of the just transition.

Committee members will know that we commissioned reports from Grant Thornton on three different topics.  One of those was to outline the position around competition law in Ireland.  The second report related to the market requirements for beef.  The third report related to the price points in the supply chain.  Included in the reports we got from Grant Thornton was an attempt to calculate the average price that farmers got for cattle over a two-year period and the price at other points of the chain.  It was not possible to get representative data in respect of the price outside Ireland because of the difficulty in getting data from operators outside this country.  In respect of Ireland, it was possible for Grant Thornton to state the price farmers received and the price factories received, on average, for the product that was exported.  Included in that calculation was a figure for the value of the fifth quarter.  Grant Thornton has, effectively, come back with an overall figure for the value of beef at the processing stage and its value at the farming stage.  One can be compared to the other.

Department officials, through the Irish Embassy in Beijing, continue to engage positively with their Chinese counterparts with a view to regaining market access for Irish beef.  There has also been engagement at political and diplomatic levels.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy McConalogue, and the Minister of State, Deputy Heydon, had a virtual meeting with the Chinese ambassador to Ireland, H.E. He Xiangdong, in March 2021 at which a number of market access and trade issues were raised.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, raised the issue with his counterpart in the Chinese foreign Ministry in May of this year.  Most recently, the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, has written to the relevant Minister in China, informing him of the revised BSE status awarded to Ireland.  The Minister, Deputy McConalogue, noted the strong trade links with China that have emerged in several areas.  He also stressed his desire to see beef exports resume and offered the engagement of his officials, as relevant, to try to resolve this issue.  We very much hope for and continue to work towards the imminent resumption of trade but we must recognise that the timing of this decision lies with the Chinese authorities.<\/p> <p>  In the meantime, the Department continues to work to try to gain access to as many new markets as possible.  It is also carrying out equally challenging work to enhance and retain access to existing international markets.  Each part is crucial to our mission to expand our global footprint while maintaining our position as a quality food producer and supplier.<\/p> <p>  Another of our priority markets for beef is Korea.  A public consultation on our beef access recently concluded in Korea, following which Ireland's beef market access is now with the National Assembly for deliberation.  It passed to the National Assembly in May.

In the veterinary certificates report, 33% of countries said they would accept product from 48 months and even up to 72 months.  Were those countries prepared to pay premium price, although they were accepting the older beef?  Did the Beef Taskforce question that if they were paying premium, why then would the factories not pay premium to the farmer for the post 30-month carcass, when, based on that report, they evidently had 33% of the countries surveyed as a market?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021070600002#S00800","speaker":"1651"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1625526000,"counter":226,"content":"<p>These are the health certificates and the conditions we negotiate with the third-country markets, so they are the bottom line and we cannot export anything that does not fit those requirements.

In April, members of the committee expressed disappointment at the market transparency studies, and the reports failed to identify the division of price among those in the supply chain.  In June, at the next meeting of the task force, there was dissatisfaction with the contribution of the meat processing industry, particularly in regard to the sudden drop in base prices in February of this year.<\/p> <p>  It is precisely because of inconsistencies such as this and the lack of transparency that our farmers want this task force to work properly.  Is it not true to say that when it comes to the level of transparency that farmers want, we are not much further along the line?  In the Grant Thornton conclusions on the demand for in-spec bonuses, it pointed out that several customers referenced developing market requirements and the fact demands may change over time.  When something is being reviewed, we have to look at the weakest point, which may be the most problematic.  What is Mr. Dowling's view on this level of ambiguity about the market demand?  Does it indicate to him that there are shortcomings in regard to the demands that are placed on farmers by the processors in regard to in-spec bonuses?<\/p> <p>  Is there not a fundamental problem with the fact the price paid by the end consumer is not within the scope of the report, and neither were processor-to-processor sales?<\/p><p>Why was that excluded?  Does Mr. Dowling believe that omissions such as these serve the best interests of small family farmers?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021070600002#S01900","speaker":"1613","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1625526000,"counter":238,"content":"<p>I have referred to the in-spec bonuses and in-spec criteria.  I understand people are from time to time disappointed with the price.  In terms of transparency, we asked Grant Thornton to go the whole way along the chain.  It was not possible to do so because it was not possible for the company to get sufficient information from operators outside of Ireland to do the final bit.  It did, however, get significant, comprehensive and representative information in respect of the Irish market and beef that is exported.<\/p> <p>  It also could not get sufficient information from operators outside of Ireland to get the final bit on what the retailer of food service operator or manufacturer was paying.  That is not all that is surprising.  There is no compunction on people who are buying Irish beef from Irish processors outside of Ireland to supply information, which effectively means supplying information on their margins.  They would normally regard that as confidential and would probably be slow enough to provide it, even in their own markets.  That is, therefore, a problem.  It is not a problem manufactured by the task force, however.  It is a problem of people not wanting to give information they do not necessarily have to give.  That is one issue.<\/p> <p>  Through Bord Bia, we got significant additional indices comparing Irish prices with prices across Europe.  In particular, Bord Bia has produced an index providing a composite price based on the internal producer prices in the main markets to which we supply beef.  That shows, over a long period, a reasonable correlation between the price being paid in Ireland and the price that would be paid across all the markets we mainly supply in respect of their own beef.  Sometimes the exports composite price is above our price and sometimes our price is above theirs.  The difference is not all that significant at any stage, however.  That provides some degree of greater transparency than was there before the task force came into operation.  Ms McPhillips wants to add something to that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021070600002#T00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Dowling"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1625526000,"counter":239,"content":"<p>The issue of price transparency is not confined to Ireland.

Those issues can be considered in respect of the primary legislation attached to that office.  Establishing the cost of production, which can vary from farmer to farmer, would be a significant challenge.  The second thing that distinguishes Ireland from France and Spain is that in those countries, farmers are largely selling into their own domestic market.  Primary producers therefore have much greater sway in discussions with retailers and final trade customers, whereas in Ireland, 90% of the beef we produce is exported, so the final customers are far away and are much less subject to influence by producers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021070600002#X00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Sin&eacute;ad McPhillips"},{"type":"speech","time":1625526000,"counter":306,"content":"<p>I accept that point.

We are not by any means suggesting that that is the answer to all of the issues relating to the beef sector, but it is one mechanism for which the Department has legislated and provided financial assistance to enhance the position of the primary producer.  Our view would be that producer organisations present a significant opportunity to strengthen the position of the beef farmer in the supply chain.  There are currently three Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine recognised beef producer organisations that received recognition from the Department in September 2019, October 2019 and May of this year, respectively.  The Department is engaged extensively, through the task force and separately, with stakeholders in promoting the establishment of beef producer organisations which are exempt from competition law requirements and allow for producer organisations to bargain on behalf of their members.

In fairness, some people outside the country co-operated with Grant Thornton.  However, on the value of an animal, the fact is there are now people around the world who are looking for many parts of an animal, including gallstones.  We talked about the fifth quarter, offal and all the different parts but we have no genuine figure for what an animal is worth.  We do not know, even though we have gone through three reports because we could not get co-operation.  In my view, that report is not finished.<\/p> <p>  The officials talked about specifications.  The person who actually does the survey should be in the shop or outside the door or wherever, in the same way surveys are done to see who votes for whom.  Until we do that we are going nowhere because, as has been pointed by Deputy Carthy and others, nothing is written down stating that a certain animal was 36 months old and it was moved five times.  At the moment, and I am reiterating this, you can get top dollar for any animal, no matter what it is, because of supply and demand.  I am concerned that we have two reports from Grant Thornton that do not seem to be finalised because it said it could not get the information for one and the second, in my view, did not include the people it needed to.  If I was sent to Dublin in a lorry to collect 100 cattle and I came home with 70 or 80, there would be queer looking.  Grant Thornton should finish compiling those reports in a different way.<\/p> <p>  Any information can be found out nowadays.  It is easy to look at the price of products on the shelf.  I will give a very simple analogy.  If I am selling to five different companies in five different countries, I know who they are.  They are well known and their products are on the shelf.  We can walk along the shelf, look at the price of the stuff and see how much it is per kilo.  Did the factories give all the information about what they are getting for what they are exporting from Ireland?  Would it be fair to say you would not need to be mathematician to find that out?  Did the Department get information from factories in Ireland about what they get from retailers in the different countries they are selling to?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021070600002#Z00800","speaker":"1508"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1625526000,"counter":342,"content":"<p>That was not the problem.  The problem was what the retailers or food service operators were getting for beef.  That information could not be got.  The information on what factories get is compiled.  That is how Grant Thornton was able to get the figure for the total value of the product exported from, or sold within, Ireland.  That was not the difficulty.  It is not as simple as going along, if I understand what the Deputy said, and saying we can find out what the retailer is getting because we can look at the price he or she is charging.  First, it is nearly impossible to do that on any sort of representative basis but, second, a big proportion of what we sell goes into food service.  Food service product comes out as a beefburger or some other sort of product, which is mixed up with other agricultural products on the plate people buy.  It is not an issue that is very easily solved by doing a spot-check of what is on a retail shelf.<\/p> <p>  Grant Thornton had expertise and it did its best.  It could not get the final price but it got the prices in between and that was, at least, beneficial in understanding what sort of gaps there are between farmer price and the price that beef is sold to the final customer, although not the final consumer.  To do a survey of consumers to ask them what they think about specifications etc., would not necessarily give any information other than the fact that consumers probably do not know an awful lot about the matter.  Producers are not selling directly to the consumer; they are selling directly to people who are either manufacturing, cooking or retailing the beef themselves.  They are the people who create and who are the demand for Irish beef.  They are the people Grant Thornton had to try to deal with.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021070600002#Z00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Dowling"},{"type":"speech","time":1625526000,"counter":343,"content":"<p>That is grand.

Under the Technological Universities Act 2018, an appointed day for the establishment of a technological university and its name in both English and Irish, shall be made by order.  The order must be approved by resolution of each House of the Oireachtas and I thank the committee for this opportunity to discuss the matter.<\/p> <p>  I wish to set 1 October 2021 as the appointed day for the establishment of a new technological university to be known in English as the Technological University of the Shannon: Midlands Midwest and Ollscoil Teicneola&iacute;ochta na Sionainne: L&aacute;r T&iacute;re, An tIarthar L&aacute;ir in the Irish language.  The establishment of a third technological university in the State is another important milestone for higher education in Ireland and, in particular, for the midlands and mid-west.  The merging of Athlone Institute of Technology, AIT, and Limerick Institute of Technology, LIT, creates a new step-change institution of sufficient size, capacity and critical mass to maximise its potential and deliver significant additional benefits to the region. <\/p> <p>  The Government has a clear ambition to create a series of interlinked higher education institutions of greater capacity and reach across all regions of the country to help deliver on our key national strategic objectives.  Technological universities, TUs, are a key component in this strategic approach, providing increased reach, international recognition, greater research capacity, enhanced foreign direct investment, FDI, attraction, skills creation and retention, regional development, enhanced staff and student experiences and opportunities and advanced socio-economic progression.  Uniquely, TUs provide higher education programmes at all levels of the national framework of qualifications, NFQ, from apprenticeships right up to doctoral degrees.  This attribute provides significant additional opportunities for individuals, students and staff and wider stakeholders, to learn, innovate, undertake research and operate to their maximum capabilities in their own region.<\/p> <p>  From October, the new technological university of the shannon: midlands midwest will start its journey and drive the agendas of higher education access, excellence in teaching and learning, regional development, research-informed educational provision and strengthened linkages with industry and the community.  This is a transformational event for the people of the midlands and the mid-west.  The benefits of technological universities are many faceted and we see how they can transform regions elsewhere.  I very much look forward to this new technological university bringing those benefits to counties Clare and Limerick, through County Tipperary, up the Shannon and across the midlands to Athlone and beyond.<\/p> <p>  We all want to ensure prosperity for this generation, which has been so affected by the Covid-19 phenomenon, and for future generations.  We want to ensure that they have the foundational skill sets and qualifications to compete and succeed in a hugely altering and highly competitive world.  I thank all concerned, especially the staff and students of AIT and LIT, the wide variety of stakeholders in the midlands and mid-west, the international advisory panel, the Higher Education Authority, HEA, the Qualifications and Quality Assurance Authority of Ireland, QQI, and the Department, all of which played a key role, statutory and non-statutory, in getting the fledgling new university to this point of establishment.  <\/p> <p>  I thank members of the committee for their kind attention today.  I also thank all Oireachtas Members for their steadfast support for this hugely important higher education project.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021070600002#A00500","speaker":"1493"},{"type":"speech","time":1625526000,"counter":354,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

We have provided the committee with a detailed submission so I will confine my remarks to a number of key points.<\/p> <p>  The IUA welcomes this Bill, noting the need to update the half-century old legislation.  In overall terms, it is essential that the Bill clearly differentiates the respective roles of the HEA and the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science.  The legislative reform, while welcome, must be accompanied by the long-awaited decision to address the serious underfunding of the sector.  New laws for the sector without adequate funding would be meaningless.<\/p> <p>  The provisions in the Bill to underpin accountability, as outlined in the heads, are strongly supported by the IUA.  It is important, however, that the agility of individual universities is not unduly constrained.  The principle of maintaining the primacy of the governing authority of each university in their governance, with the HEA providing appropriate oversight, is a sound one but it is essential that the specific provisions of the Bill do not compromise institutional autonomy.  This is defined by UNESCO as \"a degree of self-governance, necessary for effective decision-making by institutes of higher education regarding their academic work standards, management and related activities\".<\/p> <p>  The Bill, particularly head 66 and a number of related heads, provides for a statutory basis for codes of governance and guidelines for the sector.  While this provision is necessary, it is important that the codes themselves continue to be developed in partnership with the sector and that a comply-or-explain approach is maintained in line with best governance practice.<\/p> <p>  There is a range of provisions under heads 67 to 76, inclusive, on regulatory oversight by the HEA, including those relating to intervention with a particular institution or a determination for action.  It is critical that the trigger mechanism for such intervention is clearly defined in the legislation and that there is adequate provision for an independent appeals process in such cases.  We have outlined this in more detail in our submission.<\/p> <p>  While noting the need for consultation on strategic plans, it is important that governing authorities retain ultimate decision authority on university plans.  We welcome the move to competency-based governing authorities in line with best governance practice elsewhere.  We have proposed that consideration be given to providing for a range of sizes of governing authorities in line with the individual needs of universities.  We believe the proposed cap of 70 on the size of academic councils be removed.  Academic councils are effectively the parliaments of our universities and, as such, it is important that size constraints do not impair the representation of the diverse range of interests in our universities.<\/p> <p>  There is a need for the HEA's role in research to be strengthened and we have outlined a number of proposed measures in our submission in this regard under head 53.<\/p> <p>  The committee should be aware that any increase in direct State control of our autonomous universities arising from the Bill could risk the &euro;1 billion borrowings of our members being transferred to the State balance sheet at a time when State borrowings are already severely stretched.<\/p> <p>  We ask the committee to consider advocating change for a number of heads of the Bill as we have outlined in our submission, in particular heads 66 to 76, inclusive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021070600002#B00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Miley"},{"type":"speech","time":1625526000,"counter":360,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Miley.

The colleges I represent have enrolled 27,000 students, or nearly 12% of the student higher education population.  They are also significant contributors to the Irish economy.  Equality, diversity and inclusion are proposed objectives of the reformed Higher Education Authority.  The unequal treatment of students in private higher education institutes from disadvantaged backgrounds who are excluded from State student supports must be addressed.<\/p> <p>  In 2017, students and their parents told the committee of pleading with the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and credit unions for financial help.  The committee strongly supported them and two members of that committee are present.  Senator Fiona O'Loughlin was Chair of that committee.  It issued a special report recommending that disadvantaged students be entitled to grants for QQI accredited courses in whatever college they wish to attend.  The committee's report was never implemented.  We understand this was because of cost fears.  The HECA estimates the cost to the Exchequer would be estimated to be less than &euro;5 million given that the number of eligible students is likely to be in the hundreds.  The argument of a lack of funds does not sit well with the supports to public sector students received over and above the SUSI grant, none of which were given to private students.  This further exacerbates the inequality.  There was &euro;50 million in Covid-19 supports, &euro;6.5 million in additional hardship assistance supports and disability grants, and &euro;4 million for students to study abroad.<\/p><p>Compared to these amounts, &euro;5 million is a paltry sum.  While Covid-19 and hardship support is welcome and disability support is essential, Covid-19, hardship and disability are not visited solely upon students of public sector institutions.<\/p><p> Referring briefly to designated institution status, the Bill should provide for interested institutions to apply for this and give a timeframe within which a decision should be made.  A timeframe is essential to avoid repetition of the inordinate delay in delegating authority to private HEIs to award degrees.  In 2012, QQI was statutorily required to publish procedures and criteria, and the Minister was obliged to make relevant regulations, as soon as practicable after the establishment day of QQI.  Nine years later, there is no sign of either.<\/p><p> The committee should also be aware that learner protection does not exist in the public sector.  Students have had to resort to High Court action against the HEA to ensure course continuance.  Alternatively, students have lost out due to a receivership of a public sector owned HEI in mid-course.  By contrast, HECA learners benefit from action plans in place to ensure course continuance by another HECA college, backed by a &euro;3.6 million protection fund.  Public sector institutions should be part of the proposed national learner protection scheme, as is the case in Australia.<\/p><p> Our proposals on HEA board membership, research, strategic development plans, equality policies and equity of access and participation progress indicators address other concerns.  We need better progress indicators.  Sometimes I fear we are driving the HEA car without a speedometer or a fuel gauge.  HECA colleges have much to contribute to the national HEA agenda.  While busy internationally, we question whether the obstacles to our provision for Irish students are in the national interest.<\/p><p> Finally, the HEA consultation document advises a shared approach.  The legislation has the opportunity to consider a fair, student-centred, State funding model which will enhance equity of participation for disadvantaged students and support the Government's aim for a more inclusive, diverse and equal higher education system.  Nobody should be left behind.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021070600002#B01100","nonspeaker":"Professor Diarmuid Hegarty","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1625526000,"counter":365,"content":"<p>On this signal day for all along the Shannon, I appreciate this opportunity to contribute to what has been an inclusive process to date.<\/p> <p>  A key characteristic of the consultative documentation is the adoption of a collaborative approach as seen in the internal shared governance model, marked by co-regulation between the HEA and the institution.  This recognises the maturity and the critical responsibility that must lie with an institution, while affording the HEA the wherewithal to manage its oversight role.  The recent establishment of a governance forum by the HEA, and including IUA and THEA, is regarded as a positive manifestation of this shared approach.  This raises an interesting question as to whether a regulatory agency can also be a fostering body.  THEA&rsquo;s view is that we live on a small island.  We work to a common goal - facilitating the realisation of personal potential and contributing toward social cohesion and to the growth and sustenance of our economy.  In a mature construct, it is advisable to work collegiately while retaining respect for the statutory functions appropriate to all actors.  The co-regulation advocated in the document is warmly welcomed, as is the risk-based regulatory approach.<\/p> <p>  The HEA also has a role in defending diversity.  Moves that lead to the homogenising of the system, consciously or otherwise, should proactively be resisted, as they will ultimately undermine the clear policy direction set out in recent legislation.<\/p> <p>  The paper sets out a concept of a shared governance model that separates the corporate, executive and academic strands.  While the architecture and distinct roles are generally understood, there can be questions on the margins of what lies within the competence of each.  For example, the role of the governing authority in the academic oversight of an institution, and thus the nature of its relationship with the academic council, deserves particular attention.  The role of the chief officer is also understated in the draft to date.<\/p> <p>  There has been a drive for some time to effect a reduction in the size of governing bodies.  The desire to achieve this in the Technological Universities Act was not fully realised and it pointed again to the cultural challenge of moving from a representative to a competency-based structure.  THEA is in favour of the proposal which states that governing authorities are more effective when the number of members is reduced.  However, this comes with the following caveats.  First, there a risk in constructing governing bodies that are too small.  Given the increasing complexity and responsibilities of these organisations, a cap of members results in practical housekeeping difficulties.  It can be hard to achieve a quorum, to comprehend the range of skill sets that are essential and to lead and populate the principal committees.  Second, section 12 of the Technological Universities Act sets out the membership of a governing body.  There would be a logic in the technological sector in settling on a figure that is within the lower end of that frame for consistency.  Third, essential to this is a shared willingness to embrace a competency-based model of governance.  This is not to deprive anyone or any group of a voice, but a shared governance model as is proposed here would be advised to move to a conception of governance, and especially at the apex, that is grounded in a diverse and informed view of what is best for the institution and those it serves.  Given the connected nature of the technological sector, there is undoubted merit in having a stronger external voice.<\/p> <p>  Legislators will also note the geographical extent of the regions covered by these new universities.  The question of ensuring that all in a given region can identify, and feel an affinity, with the university is itself an argument for a slightly larger governing authority than proposed in the paper.  The terms of office and the staggered appointment to boards are considered good practice.<\/p> <p>  There is the danger of perceiving the HEA as an extension of the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science.  It would be advisable to have that relationship carefully documented within the scheme.  One of the central considerations in the initial discussion about this renewed legislation centred on the independence of the HEA.  It is the view of THEA that the system is best served by a strong and independent authority.<\/p> <p>  Reference was made to the research role of the HEA, which is expressed through the funding through the core grant and dedicated funding to support capacity building in technological universities, in accordance with the Technological Universities Research Network, TURN, report.  The role of the HEA in research also needs to be aligned with the role of the Department in research policy.  It would also be beneficial for the Irish Research Council to have increased autonomy.  This would allow better alignment with its mandate, putting arts, humanities and social sciences research on an equal statutory footing.<\/p> <p>  Concerning equity, diversity and inclusion, the work commenced by the HEA centre of excellence for gender equality might be reflected in the legislation.  As regards the borrowing framework, our institutions have been seeking this for some time.  THEA trusts that the new legislation will reflect this ambition.  On data sharing, as a system we have access to a significant volume of data and there would be merit in the alignment of data sets between defined entities under appropriate controls.<\/p> <p>  In conclusion, I thank the committee for the opportunity to make these points.  The muscle in this general scheme lies in chapter 3 of part 7 dealing with oversight of designated institutions.  Achieving balance between respect for institutional autonomy and a requirement for accountability instruments will be the test of the legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021070600002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Joseph Ryan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1625526000,"counter":366,"content":"<p>I am a member of Galway County Council with more than 20 years' service.  I am speaking as president of the Association of Irish Local Government, AILG, representing 949 city and county councillors from all 31 local authorities and from all parties and from none.  The association made a substantial submission last April to the Department's consultation on the scheme of the Bill before the committee.  This submission has been forwarded to each of the members through the good offices of the clerk to the committee.  I hope the members have had the opportunity to read it, as it sets out our compelling case for retaining councillors on the governing bodies.<\/p> <p>  As an association of councillors, we are deeply committed to education at all levels, but the association has a particular commitment to third-level education.  For more than a century, the association and its predecessor, the General Council of County Councils, has been nominating members to the governing body of University College Dublin.  This statutory nomination has been paralleled by our member councils, which nominate to the governing bodies of the universities in Cork and Galway.  In all, there are 25 nominees of councillors sitting on the governing bodies of universities.<\/p> <p>  The association has no issue with the general thrust of the proposed Bill in strengthening the governance framework for the third level colleges.  However, it is concerned specifically with head 77, which sets out to reform the size and composition of the governing bodies.  We are concerned that such reforms will eliminate the representation by public representatives on the boards of universities.  It is the association&rsquo;s view that there are compelling and constructive reasons for councillors to continue to serve on the governing bodies.  I will highlight just three of many.<\/p><p>Representing the public interest on the university boards, councillors have the legitimacy to speak on behalf of the Irish public.  Through their daily interaction with communities, councillors bring an awareness of the public&rsquo;s views and concerns regarding higher education to the governing process.<\/p><p> Regarding diversity, councillors come from a range of backgrounds - rural, urban and suburban - and from a diversity of vocational backgrounds and professional competences.  Such diversity is a powerful counterbalance to the corporate phenomenon of groupthink and ensures that the governing bodies benefit from diverse and challenging contributors.<\/p><p> Councillors are involved in all levels of the education sector, including as members of boards of primary and secondary schools, as well as being members of the education and training boards countrywide.  They bring this awareness of the challenges faced by primary and secondary education to the tertiary level of education as members of the university bodies.<\/p><p> The short time allocated for the opening statement prevents me from elaborating further on the well-founded justification for retaining councillors on the governing bodies.  There are many problems facing Irish society, including climate change, digitisation and housing, but it is only by closer co-operation, not less co-operation, between local government and the university sector that we can work towards resourcing the communities in which we live and work.<\/p><p> I think the members the opportunity to address the committee today and thank them for their attention.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021070600002#C00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary Hoade","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1625526000,"counter":368,"content":"<p>I call Senator Malcolm Byrne, to be followed by Deputy Conway-Walsh.

What is the appropriate relationship between the HEA and the Department?  Where is the balance under this legislation between the authority's regulatory role and its advocacy and developmental role?  I am conscious of Dr. Ryan's point on this.  Where does the balance come between autonomy and accountability?  Related to this is the question of sanction.  An institution should be allowed autonomy but if there is a problem with how it is spending money or some of its activity, what sanctions should be built into the legislation?  <\/p> <p>  The function, size and purpose of the governing body should follow that of the function and purpose of the university or higher education institution itself.

The HEA should have the oversight and advocacy role.  The primary role of the Department is to source the funding and set policy for Government.  That is the differentiation I would see.<\/p> <p>  On the balance between the regulatory and advocacy approach, it is important that the HEA retains a strong advocacy role in keeping with other sectors where the sectoral State agency would have that advocacy role, be that on the business side or elsewhere.  It is very important it retains that.  That needs to be upweighted in the sector.<\/p> <p>  On the autonomy and accountability balance, the principle is outlined well in the legislation.  Essentially the decision-making is located as close as possible to the front line - with the governing authority and the relevant institution.  That speaks to what Dr. Ryan referenced as avoiding the homogeneity of the sector with everyone becoming the same.  It is important.  We fully accept, as outlined in our submission, that the accountability needs to be strong.  That accountability should be manifested through the governing authority and only in cases where absolutely necessary would the HEA step in.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021070600002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Miley"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1625526000,"counter":371,"content":"<p>I wish to complement the points made by Mr. Miley.

The question of independence is the first piece.<\/p> <p>  On the balance between the regulatory and fostering role, I would be on the same page as Mr. Miley.  Ireland is a small island and there is definitely a case for a very strong fostering role.  That does not compromise the role of the HEA as a regulator.  <\/p> <p>  The Senator asked about autonomy and accountability.

Scrutinising this legislation is an almost impossible task.  There is an enormous responsibility on us to ensure we come out with the best possible legislation that serves to give us a system that is fit for purpose.  The key issue in the legislation is striking the right balance between the Department and the HEA; between the HEA and the institutes of higher education; between the governing authorities and the chief executives; and between the external and internal members of the governing bodies.  In addition, we need to strike the right balance in representation and competency on the boards and the governing authorities, as well as between accountability and institutional autonomy.<\/p> <p>  Accountability is obviously paramount in all areas where we spend public money.

We will live with the new legislation for a long time and it is important that we get it right.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy's question speaks to the heart of the issue, that is, how to strike the right balance.  Almost &euro;1 billion has been borrowed by seven of our eight members.  That is off the State's balance sheet due to the way it is treated.  It is a complex process in which the Central Statistics Office, CSO, and EUROSTAT are involved, as the Deputy will be aware.  It is related to the level of control that the State has over the sector.  If the State exercises greater control through this legislation, there is a risk that existing loans will be cast onto the State's balance sheet, impairing the sector's capacity to borrow in future.  We need to get the balance right.  It is possible to frame the legislation in a way that does so, but it is important that the line is not overstepped.<\/p> <p>  I will defer to my colleague, but regarding the size of the governing authorities, we have suggested a range.  We strongly support a competence-based approach, but some flexibility in the size ranges might be the way to go.

This is one of the themes that is coming across.<\/p> <p>  On the question of the legislation's impact on borrowing, we have just had a technical move towards the technological university of the Shannon.  It is a great day.  We are looking at there being five technological universities by the start of next year.  They are nascent bodies at the moment and will need time to build capacity.

Under the heading of Dr. Alan Wall's line, \"Our institutions require a balance between autonomy and accountability\", which has been referred to several times, I will discuss governing authorities.  As I understand it, this balance is necessary to the integrity of our system.  The Irish Horseracing Regulatory Board, IHRB, will be before the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine on Thursday.  It gets &euro;9 million or &euro;10 million of taxpayers' money and is accountable to the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Given that autonomy is necessary, how does the public ensure that money is being well and properly spent?  Are representatives from local authorities on governing bodies not part of that process, in that they guarantee a certain visibility of the governance of higher education to the public it is supposed to be serving?<\/p> <p>  Perhaps Councillor Hoade will have a view on my next question.  While I get the importance of competence-based appointments, is there some support that we could give to members of local authorities so that, when they set about discharging their responsibilities, which I hope they will continue to have, as members of governing authorities, they can come to the job with the expertise they need?  Can we have it both ways in terms of competence-based appointments while also recognising the particular competence of local authority members and enhancing that through training as people join the board and so on?<\/p> <p>  I have been raising issues about academic freedom and the safety of students coming from China in particular to participate in higher education in this country, where there are developing relationships between Irish institutions and institutions in other countries, not just China, where our rights and freedoms may not be respected.  If we are speaking about autonomy and academic freedom, we need to recognise that these may be under threat in the developing relationships between our universities and institutions in certain countries.  What does this legislation have to say to that challenge?  The committee may decide to explore this issue.  That is not yet decided, but I am preparing a scoping report on the topic.  What can be done to assist the accountability of our higher education institutions to ensure that we are doing our utmost for the safety and security of staff and students, both ours going abroad and people from other countries coming to Ireland?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021070600002#E00900","speaker":"1673"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1625526000,"counter":385,"content":"<p>Griffith College has been bringing in students from China since 1994.

The changes that are happening are slow, but they are happening.  The best contribution that we in the West can make is to quietly and gently impart the values that the Senator spoke about to the students.  They will bring them back to their country and will be part of the change.  As is always the case with social change, there will be a reaction and situations where governments may feel that people have gone too far, but I believe that what I have seen in China is a gradual change.  It is probably best that we not get terribly excited.  We have to be concerned about civil rights, but we also have to respect the history of the country.  We have to, and do, respect the fact that the party in China has done a significant job in building the country since 1989.

If there is repetition, perhaps we can use the time to expand a little on those discussions.<\/p> <p>  My first question concerns the relationship between the HEA and the Department, and the need to distinguish between the two bodies.  I have a slight nagging concern and I might use the HSE and the Department of Health as an analogy.  My worry is about accountability to the D&aacute;il.  The Department of Health is often used as a distancing device, whereby it is difficult for us to ask politicians to have a line of sight to issues within the HSE that might worry us.  I am concerned that creating that distinction between the HEA and the Department, which I accept is necessary, might make the body less accountable to the D&aacute;il.<\/p> <p>  Turning to the borrowing framework, I am a Deputy who represents Waterford and the south east, so a recurring issue for me relates to the ability of the institutes of technology to access borrowing in the same way as universities.  Will that follow through to the technological university system?<\/p> <p>  The institutes of technology, and I hope the technological universities, will be able to work closely with industry.  This goes to the issue of autonomy we talked about.  The agility and the responsiveness in courses offered at the institutes of technology will, I hope, continue through to the technological universities and be maintained.  There appears to be a tension between Councillor Hoade's position regarding representatives on governing bodies and what Dr. Ryan argued for, that is, a greater emphasis on competencies.  If that tension is there - I do not mean to stoke any problems or anything like that - it is probably best that we name it and speak specifically to that point.  Councillor Hoade strongly put the argument for the representative element, so I would like to hear the counterpoint from the competency point of view in the context of the governing bodies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021070600002#F00500","speaker":"1617"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1625526000,"counter":393,"content":"<p>On the issue of accountability to the D&aacute;il, the comparison the Deputy outlined is interesting.  Nevertheless, we are very much involved in research and innovation and are drivers of economic growth through fostering that.  I see us very much in the developmental space as much as in that of education.  Enterprise Ireland, for example, has a strong fostering role for SMEs and indigenous industry, as well as a direct funding and grant-making role, while there is a similar dynamic at Bord Bia.<\/p> <p>  I would see the HEA in that space.  It has that oversight and funding function but also has that role of advocacy and fostering the benefits of the sector.  I will leave the question on the borrowing framework because I think that was directed more to Dr. Ryan and others.<\/p> <p>  I am glad the Deputy mentioned agility.  We sometimes talk about autonomy as if it is an end in itself, but this is all about agility.  During Covid, all our institutions have responded in a very agile way to the pressures of Covid, not just in translating to an online teaching environment but also through staff being seconded to the health services, research laboratories being transformed into testing centres, contact tracing and all that work.  We have to link that to the individual agility of the institutions to make those decisions and move quickly to do that.

When the Oireachtas was debating what is now the Technological Universities Act, both Deputies and Senators were very keen to ensure that the technological sector would not lose that agility, that connectedness it had.  That was a key part of the debate.<\/p> <p>  On competency, I do not think it is as stark a difference as the Deputy suggested.  I am not saying we should exclude anyone from this.  I am conscious of the Chairman's injunction not to name names, but a leading provost of a European university has told me the key to the success of that university involved choosing the most competent people for its governing body, in whom everybody could have faith, rather than going down the route of a representative model, which tends, by its nature, to get larger and larger in any case.

I was a contract researcher in NUI Galway and I understand the concerns and needs in that regard.  Will Mr. Miley expand on how important is the investment in research and innovation as a driver of economic growth?  How are we going to ensure that by funding research and innovation, we will drive and maintain our position on those <i>QS World University Rankings<\/i>?

It is a real case study for how valuable our sector is to the economic growth of the country.  Countries such as Denmark, Estonia or Finland spend around double what we spend on research.

Does this Bill further this or contradict it?  I return to the funding model and the CSO categorisation.  In 2018 when EUROSTAT and the CSO revisited the assessment of the control of universities, they came up with the criteria of autonomous institutions under public or private control or market or non-market.  The result was that the universities were seen as autonomous institutions under public control and as a market operator.  I think we can manage everything that needs to be achieved and still remain off the balance sheet.  In 2018 the CSO report clearly states that all fee income, whether that is paid by households or the State on behalf of households, is treated as sales.  This would mean that provided a funding model is correctly designed the universities could continue to have full off-State balance sheet borrowing.  <\/p> <p>  Mr. Miley or Dr. Ryan might address that question.

In a broad sense, this Bill has to address the problems and look at what success means.  Funding is absolutely a key issue for the higher education sector.  That was outlined in the Cassells report and we still have not addressed it, so the Bill has to take that on board.  It is also really important to look at what it means to be successful in third level education.  I sat on a governing authority as a public representative and we spent a huge amount of time coming up with a strategic plan for the university.  One of the key things was openness.  I will read out for the committee what Professor &Oacute; h&Oacute;gartaigh wrote in the opening statement in that strategic plan:<\/p> <blockquote> \tWe recognise that we cannot achieve our ambitions alone.  We are a university with no gates.  When darkness comes, we don't close.  Openness means we welcome friends and strangers in.  It also means we go out, seeking new and deeper research co-operation, new ideas, new partnerships, new communities, and new ways of engaging. <\/blockquote> <p>That has to be a key part of what governing authorities do.  Competency is absolutely key, but it is not just about ensuring we can wash our faces when it comes to money.  A university is also a social good.  It is not just about the students who are there; in Galway in particular, it also has to encapsulate the entire city in it.  That is why it is key that we do not lose that element of having the public involved in the running of the university.  That may not look like having a certain number of public representatives but it absolutely cannot be based only on what it means to run an institution.  It also has to have that representative element to it.  I would like to hear the witnesses' thoughts on that.  There are problems with it - do not get me wrong.  I got on the governing authority at the flip of a coin and was the only female councillor on it at that time.  That goes to our political system as well.  Councillor Hoade, in her short time as president of the Association of Irish Local Government, AILG, has done a huge amount of work regarding gender balance on local authorities.  We have local authorities on which there might be one woman and the rest are men, and that needs to be addressed.  It spills over when it comes to the kinds of boards councillors are on, and I was on a number of them.  Those are a few of my thoughts on that and about the importance of not just competency but also how the witnesses reflect wider society in the running of their institutions.<\/p><p>There have clearly been some problems, and gender discrimination is one.  Do the witnesses think a Bill of this kind will address some of the issues surrounding the lack of transparency that has existed in the past?  I think all of us who have served on boards, be they boards of management for schools or for universities, know there have been difficulties.  If we are honest and if we look down through the list of the problems with appointments to particular positions within universities, do we think the Bill will address that lack of transparency sufficiently?  We definitely had issues in Galway.  The landscape has changed in that regard, but we need to make sure that these things do not happen again.  That is where accountability comes in.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021070600002#J00200","speaker":"1693"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1625526000,"counter":424,"content":"<p>I can offer, if I may, through the Chair-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021070600002#J00250","nonspeaker":"Dr. Joseph Ryan"},{"type":"speech","time":1625526000,"counter":425,"content":"<p>There is about a minute left in this slot, so whoever is first may respond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021070600002#J00300","speaker":"1619"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1625526000,"counter":426,"content":"<p>Reflecting on what the Senator said, when I went to college - I am going back a bit now - the number of students amounted to approximately 15% to 20% of the age cohort; they now amount to more than 60% of the age cohort.

That access and the link to region and community are key to the build of these new technological universities.  The linkage between governance and place and region has been a key theme to which we have been referring all the time.  I do not think there is any disconnect between that connectedness, which is the byline of the TURN report on the build of these technological universities, and that question of linkage back into community.

What is the role of international students in positioning Irish colleges and universities with the infrastructure and laboratories to compete at world class level for research?<\/p> <p>  I want to consider the agencies that fund universities, including for the arts area and Science Foundation Ireland for the science and technology areas.  There are several partnerships or collaborations, including the US-Ireland research and development partnership programme and the US National Science Foundation and the US National Institutes of Health.  There is the Horizon Europe at the moment.  What ways can we look to support the research path students take from masters to PhD to post-doctorate level?  How do we support people in our research sector in universities?  What can the HEA do to help?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021070600002#K00700","speaker":"1654"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1625526000,"counter":444,"content":"<p>Again, I go back to what I said recently in respect of regional knowledge and local knowledge and our connection with universities and local needs.

Our proposal is not that the State does this in isolation by any means.  As committee members are aware, our universities and institutes of technology have long and detailed partnerships with industry and access money for research through a variety of mechanisms.  One thing we can look at has been striking in recent years.<\/p><p>The Senator is probably aware of the analysis on this issue.  In order to qualify for European Research Council, ERC, grants, one needs State support and to be able to show other sources of funding.  By not giving certain grants to some of our lead researchers, the State is causing other difficulties for them.  It is interesting that some of the people who are featured on television nightly or weekly talking about Covid did not have access to ERC grants in recent years because, in order to qualify, they needed a certain seedbed of State grants to kick them off.  It is very much a matched funding model.<\/p><p> To bring this back to the legislation, it is important that the Higher Education Authority would have a pivotal role in setting the ground rules in this area and developing a framework around them.  The money is one side of it and the framework through which the money is channelled is the other.  It cannot just be about recurrent funding.  The infrastructure funding, which the Senator referenced, is critical.  We have a situation where, in some higher education institutions, students are being educated and researchers are working in laboratories built in the 1980s and 1990s.  That is a real problem when trying to developing industry partnerships.  If a third level institution brings in representatives from the local FDI company, they will not want to take a student into their super-high-tech environment who is coming out of that environment.  There is a real issue in terms of bridging that gap and the funding needs to address it, both in terms of how it is structured and the quantum of funding.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021070600002#K00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Miley","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1625526000,"counter":447,"content":"<p>There was a reference to North-South funding.

We have seen examples during the Covid period of research being developed in the universities and being applied.  Individual professors are doing good work in that regard.  I feel, however, that there are not sufficient connections between the employment and investment incentive, EII, scheme and research within the universities.  There is potential there in terms of funding for applied research if the universities were to develop the skills needed to cultivate Asian investors, for example, and perhaps work more with the Department on developing the EII scheme.  I serve on Dublin Chamber and we made submissions to Government last February on the scheme.  It needs to be broadened significantly and it needs to reward people for risk-taking.  Research can involve total risk and total loss or it can involve substantial gain.  In the case of applied research, there is an opportunity there.  If we had more of those types of commercial skills within the universities, it might enhance the potential return universities and individual researchers can get from the research.

Concerns were raised regarding the proposed composition and size of the governing authorities.  Can any of the witnesses comment on how the governing authorities might be constituted to ensure they are as representative as possible, while also being small enough to make their work effective?<\/p> <p>  Mr. Miley spoke about our high-skills economy and compared us with other countries that are spending double what we spend on research.  If we were spending similar amounts of money, where might we be at right now?  When does he see us being able to afford to spend the same amounts of money?  That leads into the question of access to third level education, which is a huge concern of mine.  When I go back to my constituency, which is Wexford, one of the main issues people raise with me is access to third level education and the cost of it.  Accommodation costs have gone through the roof and many families are struggling.  The cost of living has gone up but salaries may not have increased.  There are greater expectations on other family members and so on.  We need to invest more in research but we also have to make it affordable for students to go to third level.  We are still going back to the Exchequer and the same pocket of money.  What is more important in terms of prioritising funding?  Should we give 50% to research and 50% to making third level more accessible to students?  It is absolutely fantastic to see people who got their education in Ireland making their name worldwide.  There should be the same accessibility to third level for everybody.  It is a huge concern of mine that we are making it way too expensive for people.  I will be raising this issue with the Minister, Deputy Harris, when he comes before the committee to discuss the reopening of colleges.<\/p> <p>  I will call Mr. Miley first to respond on that point, after which Dr. Ryan and Professor Hegarty may also wish to comment.  Councillor Hoade might comment then on the point about membership of the governing authorities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021070600002#L00600","speaker":"1619"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1625526000,"counter":452,"content":"<p>I very much share the Chairman's view on access.  It is critically important and it speaks to both the legislation and the upcoming announcements we hope to see on the sustainable funding for the sector that the Minister and Taoiseach have pledged for this year.  It is vital that we have a system that is accessible and fair.  This means doing something, for instance, for the 85% of pupils who are not getting access in the school Professor Hegarty mentioned earlier, which is located not far from where I am sitting.  We must ensure that more of the children in that school who have the ability to go to third level are given the capacity to do so.  There is a more complex issue around this in that the pathway starts in primary school.  It is not something that just happens at the end of the cycle.  There is a larger question to be considered in that regard but I very much share the Chairman's sentiment.<\/p> <p>  The Chairman referred to the high-skills aspect and what is needed in that regard.  In essence, we would say that something in the order of &euro;80 million to &euro;100 million per year in extra funding for research is needed over the next five years.  We have proposed a &euro;3.5 billion investment over a decade for the entire sector, through the national development plan, a substantial portion of which should be on the research side.<\/p><p>That is to deal with the infrastructure issues we have outlined.  I urge the committee to think about this.  This is not a matter of funding something for the sake of it.  It is about funding a working asset for the country and economy.  We should view it in those terms.  There is a discernible return on that asset.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021070600002#L00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Miley","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1625526000,"counter":454,"content":"<p>Mr. Miley's last point was that it is an investment into the future of our country and economy.

A number of years ago, following the Cassells report, I examined the Australian model.  It was a loan repayment scheme.

One thing that I constantly ask myself and that we in Griffith College and indeed HECA colleges constantly ask ourselves is if we are giving students the capacity to earn to repay the debt.  The reality of the matter is that the Chairman is correct that accommodation costs are out of hand, and education costs and living costs are not getting lower, so students have to borrow.  It is important that they get skills from their years in college that will quickly enable them to earn salaries at a decent level so that they can repay those loans and they are not hanging over them for life.  The loans are not terribly large relative to potential incomes but we have to give them the skills to get into the workplace quickly.  That is imperative.  I would be delighted to contribute to the committee's deliberations on that aspect.

We did that due to the access issue since we felt that it would exacerbate the challenges for so many people accessing higher education.  I made the point earlier that the sector I have the honour to represent is the access sector.  It has done much for the democratisation of education.  These new technological universities are geographically more dispersed, which will make things easier.  That is not to gainsay the Chair's points.  The challenge is that the student fee is one of the highest in Europe.  Accommodation costs are high.  I used to work as a registrar in the college and one could hear the pips squeak a number of years ago when families came and said that they could not afford to have their next son or daughter go through education.  The funding is a three-legged stool.  Hopefully, we will have a discussion dedicated to funding in time.  That three-legged stool is the student contribution which I propose is effectively maxed out, as it stands.  The second part is the National Training Fund, which is now at 1%, a significant contribution from enterprise.  The third part is central funding.  I fully take the point that has been made here a few times.  We are looking at a potential change in the tax regime.  Our native genius is in the talent of our people.  It is worth investing in the talent of those people because that is what draws people to this small, open, productive economy.

We recognise that a significant proportion of students take out loans to get themselves through college.  That is a reality.  What we do not have is a structured loan scheme, as in Australia and elsewhere.  The political debate on that is probably near to twilight, if I am reading the tea leaves correctly.  In dealing with the substantive funding question, which we understand is coming to the table soon, I would simply come back to the point that the fact of the matter is that a cohort of students is going to college who are stretched and finding it difficult to cope.  We also know that another cohort is not getting access to college due to financial constraints.  In dealing with the funding question, we have to have that front and centre.  We also have to have front and centre that there is a cohort of families and students who can afford to pay.  Many of them are paying &euro;6,000 to &euro;12,000 a year for secondary school and then going on to third level.  The fairness equation needs to apply across the spectrum.

We have a serious bulge coming into the system.  We need to do two things.  Whoever is in the system needs to be funded appropriately.  The worst thing that we could do is pull more people into the system and not fund them adequately.  Second, we need to make sure that alternative channels are provided for them, through apprenticeships or more flexible opportunities.  We would advocate as strongly as anyone else for that.  The worst thing for any 18- or 19-year-olds is to find themselves in a course or an institution which does not suit them.
