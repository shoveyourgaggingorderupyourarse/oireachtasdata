It seems that the previous Government sat on its hands over a two-year period.  Even though various plans went to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the National Transport Authority, nothing happened because nobody wanted to deal with these issues in the run-up to the 2016 general election.  In the aftermath of that election, the old management was cleared out.  The very aggressive approach that has now developed is putting the onus entirely on workers' terms, pay and conditions.  In my view, the objectives of this strategy, which is essentially driven by conflict, are to reduce the average bus driver's wages to &euro;32,000 or &euro;33,000 in one fell swoop and to achieve redundancies and other efficiencies.  In other words, the workers will have to bear the entire brunt of the savings of &euro;12 million that have been identified and are being sought by the company.<\/p>  <p>  The position and behaviour of management at the Labour Relations Commission on Monday was very provocative.  The ideological position of Fine Gael and the Minister, who hails from the same stable, is aligned to this strategy.  The Minister is engaging in classic Pontius Pilate behaviour by hiding behind the industrial relations fig leaf and refusing to engage.  He is privately comfortable with the undermining of this public transport company and the all-out assault on the terms and conditions of its workers.  I accept that efficiencies and reforms are needed.  I agree with that but I do not agree with a race to the bottom, which is what is actually going on.  I do not agree with the undermining of an important State bus company.  The last time we discussed this matter, I asked the Taoiseach to set out his position on it but he equivocated on the idea of supporting and maintaining a State transport company like Bus &Eacute;ireann.  It is interesting to note that the Luas and Dublin Bus disputes got sorted.  Was that because those companies are based in Dublin?<\/p><p>To hell with the regions and rural Ireland and let chaos prevail.  That is the message being sent in the contrasting way the various disputes have been dealt with.  The hands-off approach of the Minister, Deputy Ross, is ensuring that occurs.<\/p> <p> The basic question I have put to the Taoiseach is why it is not possible for the Minister, Deputy Ross, and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport to engage with the National Transport Authority, NTA, Bus &Eacute;ireann management and unions to work out the policy implications and issues that could contribute to a resolution of this particular dispute.  We should remember the public service subvention has been reduced from approximately &euro;45 million in 2010 to &euro;36 million in 2016 and the free travel contribution per passenger is approximately &euro;4.86 on the Expressway, with &euro;11.78 being the average fare on the service.  The policy matters and it is time for the Minister to engage on those issues with all the stakeholders.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200003#A00200","speaker":"1224","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487765100,"counter":8,"content":"<p>It is very disappointing that talks have broken down and, potentially, there is a catastrophic position for hundreds of thousands of passengers if this spreads throughout the company.  The problem is on the Expressway service, which is a commercial service that is not subsidised.  The NTA representatives at the transport committee today are focusing on the financial position of Bus &Eacute;ireann.  Of the passengers carried by the company, 81% are on routes that are subsidised under the public service obligation, PSO, contract that Bus &Eacute;ireann has with the NTA.  These services are fully remunerated by the NTA, and the subvention for PSO services by the NTA increased from &euro;24 million in 2014 to &euro;40 million in 2016.<\/p>  <p>  I have no equivocation about supporting a public transport system, as we have with Bus &Eacute;ireann carrying hundreds of thousands of passengers.  The difficulty lies with the commercial Expressway business and that must be addressed for the sake of the workforce in Bus &Eacute;ireann, including drivers and those who maintain the buses, and also the travelling public.  The Minister, Deputy Ross, is very anxious that the machinery of the State would be used, and all the other strikes mentioned by the Deputy have been settled around that table, as this one can and will be too.  The Minister has been in touch with the Minister for Social Protection in respect of the current funding levels for the scheme of subvention that is operated, with 81% of passengers carried on those routes.  As I stated yesterday, rumours of taking away the free travel system were completely and utterly false.<\/p>  <p>  There will be some further intense, difficult and complicated discussions before this is resolved and it will require direct engagement, one way or the other, between the management and unions.  The issues we have seen reported in recent days highlight the internal focus of the problems the company faces.  My understanding is the three routes mentioned were for discussion and no decision has been made.  There is one to Derry, one to Westport from Athlone and one to Clonmel.  They are important routes.  The NTA has pointed out that in the event that discussions continue and changes are made to the Expressway service, it will step in and provide connectivity for the public in those areas that would be affected by any change in the Expressway service by Bus &Eacute;ireann.<\/p>  <p>  I hope this matter can be sorted out in the same way as all others.  It is complicated, difficult and tension-filled, but as the Deputy rightly points out, so many other awkward cases have been dealt with and settled through the machinery of the State.  I hope at this late stage that unions and management can get together again and work out issues.

There is a huge gap and a contribution that could be made.  There are avenues to be explored under the PSO obligations in terms of some of the routes.  The changes being demanded apply to far more than just the Expressway service.  They are more fundamental and broad-ranging.<\/p> <p> Given his ideological disposition, the Minister has deliberately stood back.

The management of Bus &Eacute;ireann announced measures that threaten the rights of bus workers and, most importantly, those of passengers, particularly people who live in rural Ireland.  By slashing overtime and Sunday rates and cutting pay, the management is forcing the issue to an industrial dispute.  The Taoiseach was well warned about it.  This race to the bottom in respect of workers' pay and conditions is unacceptable.<\/p>  <p>  Although the Taoiseach and the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport say rural Ireland is the Government's top priority, there is no evidence for that.  The Government has closed Garda stations, post offices, hospitals and other facilities.  It is attacking the public bus service in the same way Fianna F&aacute;il and the Progressive Democrats did when Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin was in government.  A huge number of people, particularly in rural Ireland, rely on Bus &Eacute;ireann.  They are the young, the old, the poor, rural dwellers and tourists.  The outworking of Government policy is that people who live in rural Ireland and who cannot afford a car or, for whatever reason, cannot drive, must stay where they are, even if it means they cannot access work, study, health care or a social life.<\/p>  <p>  The nub of the question is whether the Taoiseach believes public transport is a right and whether he believes rural dwellers have this right or not.  The Government believes in privatisation.  In that case, the profit motive will determine who gets a public bus service or a bus service at all.<\/p><p> Bus &Eacute;ireann is part of our vital infrastructure, especially in rural Ireland.  It is possible, with good management and by listening to transport users and workers, to create a service that will attract more people to use public transport.  That should be the Government&rsquo;s position.  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, should ensure the future sustainability of Bus &Eacute;ireann as a public service.  He could take a number of decisions, including; a review of loss-making routes on which private carriers currently operate; a review of the number of private licenses issued on these routes; and an increase in funding for the free travel pass - the amount currently allocated covers just 41% of the cost of the average journey.  The Minister needs to provide clarity regarding routes and services including, as the Taoiseach said, the Dublin to Derry, Dublin to Clonmel and Athlone to Westport routes.  There is always, however, the get-out answer that the decision has not yet been made.  The Minister needs to engage immediately with all of the stakeholders to prevent serious travel disruption and a protracted industrial dispute.  His aim must be to ensure that together we find a way to protect, preserve and enhance our public transport network.  I again ask the Taoiseach to ensure that the Minister, Deputy Ross, engages with all of the stakeholders, including his own Department, the National Transport Authority, NTA, Bus &Eacute;ireann and the unions in order to find a resolution in respect of this issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200005#C00700","speaker":"1330","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487766000,"counter":18,"content":"<p>Deputy Adams raised a range of issues.  I again point out to him that the commercial end of Bus &Eacute;ireann is not subsidised by the taxpayer.  A total of 81% of passengers who travel by Bus &Eacute;ireann are availing of the public transport system that is subsidised, a subvention that was increased to &euro;40 million in 2016.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy says that nothing is being done about rural Ireland.  I fundamentally disagree with this point.  Not only have we drawn all the programmes together, there is, on a community basis, an opportunity for the vast majority of communities of small towns and villages to avail of benefits and opportunities under that programme.  The rural transport links scheme that applies not only services rural Ireland, it also brings people from their homes to towns and villages and back again.  There is always a consultation about the transport needs of every parish and community.  This is where the rural transport link is exceptionally strong.  Supports for rural Ireland include the programme relating to the development of IDA Ireland plants in different towns and villages throughout the State, the development of the hospitality sector, the retention of the 9% VAT rate, the abolition of the travel tax, the expansion of the lake land areas, the continuation of the Wild Atlantic Way and Ireland's Ancient East initiatives and increased flights into the country.  All of these measures are important.<\/p>  <p>  On foreign direct investment, IDA Ireland has been directed that 135,000 of the 200,000 jobs to be created between now and 2020 should be located outside the greater Dublin region.  The NTA means what it says.  At a meeting of the Joint Committee on Transport, Tourism and Sport this morning, the NTA pointed out - as it has done on many occasions - that if there are any changes arising from the discussions that must take place between management and unions regarding Bus &Eacute;ireann, it will, through its system, manage those changes in the context of connectivity for the public.  The essential point is that the Expressway system is a commercial system and is not subsidised by the taxpayer.  That is where the problem lies and it is the context in which it must be resolved.  The Minister, Deputy Ross, is anxious that this would happen; that union and management will sit down again - difficult though it may be - to work to resolve their differences.  Changes that arise from the Expressway system will be taken up by the NTA.  I do not accept Deputy Adams' assertion that nothing is being done.  In fact, more is being done for rural Ireland in so many ways.

That is the Taoiseach's legacy.  It is because he does not believe in the rights of citizens that he refuses to ask the Minister, Deputy Ross, to intervene in the Bus &Eacute;ireann dispute.

I said then that over recent months we had heard a lot of noise but little clarity about the future of Bus &Eacute;ireann.  What has now become clear is that the crisis is being used to slash the terms and conditions of front-line workers in Bus &Eacute;ireann.  A registered employment agreement - we restored those, if the Taoiseach recalls - is in place covering bus workers but that is now being ignored by management.  I believe management is trying to bypass the industrial machinery of the State.  It is open to the Government, in the interest of industrial relations and sectoral pay policy, to put in place a system of sectoral employment orders - the Taoiseach will recall we put that in place in legislation in our time.

Second, does he agree that no one - not the market, not the consumers and not the workers - benefits from a ruthless race to the bottom?<\/p><p> Third, will the Taoiseach accept that the members of this Government are not mere bystanders?

Does he agree, therefore, that he must at the very least ensure a common minimum acceptable floor with regard to the terms and conditions in this sector?  If he accepts that, will he agree, as a matter of belated but important action, that it would be a condition of public transport bus licences that the licensee would join representative employers in that sector who will negotiate common and fair terms and conditions?

I am especially proud to have retired Commandant Leo Quinlan, son of the late Pat Quinlan, as well as Jadotville veterans, Quartermaster Sergeant Michael Tighe and Corporal Tadhg Quinn, as my guests in the D&aacute;il today.<\/p>  <p>  Sadly, only 41 survivors from the siege of Jadotville are still alive today.  On behalf of the students from Galway community college, I appeal to the Taoiseach to award medals to the officers and NCOs, as recommended by Commandant Pat Quinlan in 1961 following 56 years of campaigning.<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach is no doubt aware of the fact that a 1965 military board considered the recommendation of Commandant Pat Quinlan that medals be awarded to eight or nine of his officers and NCOs who were under his command in Jadotville.  No medals were awarded and no one seems to know why.  Only recently, I learned that when that board met in 1965, it was not asked to consider the actions of the commander of the day, Commandant Quinlan.  Commandant Pat Quinlan should be considered for a medal of recognition of his outstanding military and tactical leadership in the field of battle.  The evidence is clear from his actions: Commandant Quinlan saved the lives of his men in his company.<\/p>  <p>  I understand that the awarding of medals for members of the Defence Forces falls to a military board that reports to the Chief of Staff.  I believe that the time is right to ask the Chief of Staff, Vice Admiral Mark Mellett, to appoint a medals board to review the awarding of medals of the solders of Jadotville.  In particular, such a board should review the awarding of a medal to Commandant Pat Quinlan.  Will the Taoiseach support the officers, NCOs and men from the siege of Jadotville, as well as their families, and ask Vice Admiral Mellett to convene the board as a matter of urgency?  Furthermore, will the Taoiseach commit to reporting progress to the House following his discussions with Vice Admiral Mellett?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200009#G00200","speaker":"1313"},{"type":"speech","time":1487767500,"counter":29,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Grealish for raising this, and I understand he has some of his colleagues with him in the House.

The board indicated that the issues raised had received consideration and that it was not prepared to alter its findings.<\/p>  <p>  On the occasion of the 55th anniversary of the siege of Jadotville the Minister of State at the Department of Defence, Deputy Kehoe, took the decision to honour the collective actions and bravery of the men of A Company and issue a unit citation.  This was the first time that a unit citation was awarded within the Defence Forces to recognise formally the brave actions of these men.  The Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe, hosted an occasion in Custume Barracks in Athlone on 17 September last at which the unit citation was presented to the company in respect of its collective heroism and professional performance during the siege of Jadotville while cut off from support and reinforcements.  A specially commissioned insignia will also be provided to the members and the next of kin of deceased members of A Company in the coming weeks.  These are rewards that are used internationally by other military forces to recognise units that have served with particular distinction or heroism.  The Minister of State is satisfied that the award of a unit citation and the associated specially commissioned insignia properly honours the collective bravery of the men of A Company, 35th Infantry Battalion.<\/p>  <p>  On 19 December last, the Minister of State was in Renmore Barracks with Deputy Grealish and other Members of the Oireachtas and he met students of the fifth year history class of Galway community college.  He was impressed by the interest and knowledge of the students about the events at Jadotville in 1961.  Since then, the Minister of State has written to the students outlining his reason for awarding a unit citation and insignia as a means of formal recognition of the collective bravery and outstanding performance of the men of A Company.  I have a letter I received from Galway community college and I commend Alanna O'Reilly, Stefan Madalin, Wiktoria Gorczyca and Patrick Lenehan, on behalf of the fifth year students in Galway community college, on the way they wrote it.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Grealish made a particular point in respect of Commandant Pat Quinlan, his bravery and the fact his actions saved lives at the time.  I will have the matter examined.  I will talk to the Chief of Staff but I will not give the Deputy a guarantee.

For example, the number of cyclists in Dublin increased by 160% between 2004 and 2014.  Approximately 12,000 commuters cycle into Dublin city centre every day.  Cycling Ireland, which has seen a major increase in its membership from 6,000 members just five years ago to 28,000 members now, estimates that approximately 250,000 cyclists regularly use Irish roads.  All Irish road users are more than aware of the increased presence of cyclists, which is obviously a good thing from many perspectives.  Sadly, these cyclists are particularly vulnerable.  Twenty cyclists have been killed on our roads over the past 24 months.  This Bill seeks to create a minimum passing distance which motorists must observe when overtaking cyclists.  I propose to set this distance at 1 m in areas where the speed limit does not exceed 50 km\/h and at 1.5 m in all other areas.  We are setting out to create a safe space on our roads where cyclists can feel protected from passing traffic.  While most drivers give sufficient space to cyclists, a worrying number of them seem to have an attitude of &quot;no contact, no harm&quot;.  This kind of irresponsible driving behaviour is simply not acceptable.<\/p><p>Along with my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Regina Doherty, I have been working closely with Mr. Philip Skelton, who is a committed road safety campaigner, to bring this Bill to fruition.  Mr. Skelton, who is in the Public Gallery, is the founder of the &quot;Stayin' Alive at 1.5&quot; campaign.  He has been working diligently for many years to raise awareness of the need for a minimum passing distance law in Ireland.  I am very grateful to him for his commitment to the campaign and for his extensive research into international best practice in this area.  Ireland needs to learn from the positive experiences of other countries.  To date, laws of this nature have been passed in France, Spain, Portugal, Belgium, 28 states in the US, two provinces in Canada and five states and territories in Australia.  If we are serious about protecting cyclists on Irish roads, we should follow their good example.  This short Bill facilitates that by giving all cyclists, including children travelling to and from their local schools, members of families who go out for a Sunday spin and our future winners of international medals, designated space on our roads where they can feel somewhat safe and protected.  That is the very least they deserve.

The proposed amendments are in line with the recommendations made by the expert group on the review of the 2001 Act, which are yet to be fully implemented.  The Bill defines a voluntary patient as a person with decision-making capacity, aligns the principles of the 2001 Act with those of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 and affirms that both voluntary and involuntary patients with decision-making capacity must give consent to treatment before that treatment is carried out.

This assessment was shared with the Opposition leaders when I consulted them, but their strong view was that the investigation should proceed.  The estimate does not take account of the cost and time impact of any legal challenges which may be taken.

The <i>per diem<\/i>rates for a senior counsel are &euro;788.28 and a junior counsel &euro;394.14.  It is very much reduced from what it used to be during past years.

There is &euro;4.763 million in the Vote for this year, which includes provision for the IBRC and Fennelly commissions.

The Committee of Public Accounts has been holding hearings on this also.  I referred this to Deputy Doherty at the committee meeting on Estimates recently.  The committee had received a large amount of evidence from NAMA and many other interested parties, including some from outside the jurisdiction.  I understand that the Committee of Public Accounts is to issue its report shortly and that statements on the establishment of the commission of investigation into NAMA were taken in the House on 1 February 2017.

This is also having a huge impact on the taxpayer.<\/p>  <p>  Parallel with these inquiries, we need to have a programme within the public service and within our existing mechanisms to ensure that part of the remit of the vision of any organisation involves providing timely, professional responses to issues that arise.  Consider, for example, the volume of issues that go to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC.  It is extraordinary.  GSOC has almost become paralysed on foot of the volume of work it has on hand and its lack of resources and capacity.  One is obliged to wonder, in the context of the overall picture, what it is all about.  This volume of complaints must speak to something that is wrong with within our system.  I put this to the Taoiseach in respect of the inquiry into Siteserv and the IRBC.  Project Eagle is a classic illustration, where &euro;4 million or &euro;5 million ends up in an offshore account and nobody bats an eyelid.  People were saying the problem was \"Over there, and not over here\".  It is just bizarre that any State institution would have a view that it was fine because the potential wrongdoing was on the purchaser's side and not on that of the vendor, and that the issue would not need to be examined.

The Deputy previously suggested the establishment of a permanent inspectorate for public inquiries that would be professional, deal with issues in a timely fashion and have the experience to know which direction should be followed.  For his information, the proposal was considered by the Law Reform Commission in 2005 when it dealt with the report on public inquiries, including tribunals of inquiry.  I am open to the idea.  The Law Reform Commission made three points.  It said that, over time, an inspectorate's staff would become experienced in investigation and would be paid salaries rather than a daily rate, resulting in savings to the Exchequer.  Second, the office would have easy access to precedence and guidance on procedural issues.  Third, it would provide a one stop shop for those seeking information on inquiries.<\/p><p>The commission also listed some disadvantages.  Although there were a number on inquiries at the time, there was no guarantee that there would be a need for a similar body in the future.  The commission also said that public inquiries are, by their nature, <i>ad hoc<\/i>and their structure and personnel should reflect this.  Having weighed up the advantages and disadvantages, the commission did not recommend the establishment of a permanent standing inspectorate.  It did, however, recommend the establishment of a central inquiries office that would be charged with collecting and managing a database of records and information regarding public inquiries.  This would provide those charged with establishing and running public inquiries easy access to precedence, guidance on a wide variety of matters pertinent to their inquiry - including legislation - procedural issues, the drafting of terms of reference and administrative matters.<\/p><p>It should be borne in mind that the Law Reform Commission report was published in 2005, the year after the enactment of the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004.  Obviously, since then we have had a number of commissions of investigation.  Any decision to establish a permanent inquiries inspectorate or a central inquiries office would have to take into account the experience gained in the intervening period, as well as the Law Reform Commission's report and other relevant factors.<\/p><p>I would be open to having a rational discussion in the House about this matter.  Protected disclosures are flooding in and they are very complicated and complex.  Ministers have a duty and a responsibility for them, but cannot actually talk about them.  While other cases are to follow, many of the cases raised with me by Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin a few years ago are still coming back in.  They were examined by senior counsel but people are still dissatisfied.  Perhaps the House should consider the idea recommended by the Law Reform Commission.  I may put this in train and see what will come of it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200020#S00700","speaker":"1245"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"D&aacute;il Reform","time":1487773200,"counter":174,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200020#S00800"},{"type":"question","time":1487773200,"counter":175,"qnumday":5,"qnumall":"[7364\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200020#S00900","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"the status of the commitment in the programme for Government on political reform.","asker":"1283","askee":"1245"},{"type":"question","time":1487773200,"counter":176,"qnumday":6,"qnumall":"[8552\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200020#S01000","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he will report on commitments contained in the programme for Government in respect of political reform.

In December, the Government published a report on the programme setting out the progress made to date across all of Government on implementing the programme.  This is the first of many regular reports to be published in addition to the annual report which will be published in May following the Government&rsquo;s first year in office.<\/p>  <p>  In respect of D&aacute;il reform, this Government continues to build on the Oireachtas reform packages introduced by the previous Administration.  Implementation of A Programme for a Partnership Government requires a new relationship between the Government and Oireachtas.  This is reflected in significant D&aacute;il reforms that are being implemented, providing a significantly greater role for members of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  These arrangements require greater collaboration and sharing of information by the Government with the Oireachtas.<\/p>  <p>  Central to our approach for delivering on this ambitious programme is the concept of good faith and no surprises.  Following the general election in 2016 this Government, and the previous Government, played a crucial role in the process of D&aacute;il reform including the first election of a Ceann Comhairle by secret ballot, the selection of Oireachtas committee chairs under a d'Hondt system and the establishment of an all-party D&aacute;il reform committee, which has since made a number of recommendations.  Within my Department, there is an expanded role for the Chief Whip to support these arrangements including supporting good communication between Departments and the Oireachtas, particularly in terms of progressing Government legislation through the Oireachtas.<\/p>  <p>  The new arrangements include more proactive communication between Ministers and their Departments and Opposition spokespeople and Oireachtas committee chairpersons and Members.  It requires greater sharing of information with the Oireachtas to inform its deliberations, for example through the new budgetary procedures, use of pre-legislative scrutiny by committees and more briefing on significant developments or issues.  There is a new D&aacute;il business management committee established to discuss and agree on the D&aacute;il schedule, more time for Private Members' business, new arrangements for Topical Issue motions and reformed structures for parliamentary questions.  These all require a new approach from Ministers and their Departments and the Government is committed to ensuring it works effectively.<\/p>  <p>  On Seanad reform, several steps were taken by the previous Government in relation to Seanad reform and we continue to progress this matter. The programme for a partnership Government commits to pursuing the implementation of the Manning report as a priority.  In response to a suggestion by Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin last year, I have indicated that, provided there is all-party support for the Manning Report, the interim implementation body proposed in the report should be set up comprising members of all parties and groups in the D&aacute;il and the Seanad.  On foot of this, I wrote to party leaders, D&aacute;il groups and Seanad groups seeking agreement to the setting up of the implementation group and seeking nominees for same.  I understand the three groups have not yet responded yet.  I believe there is a bit of dispute over who should actually chair the group.

However, the biggest difficulty is getting answers from Ministers, either in the exchanges in the Chamber or as one goes about trying to make representations on behalf of constituents.  The Taoiseach cited the need for greater co-operation and greater information sharing with the Oireachtas.<\/p>  <p>  I will give an example which I am sure matches the experience of all Teachta&iacute;.  I am fighting a case for a 42 year old adult with serious issues whose parents can no longer deal with this chap because he has such profound issues.  I made representations to the HSE, as other Deputies would.  The HSE sent back responses which are not adequate.  We then made representations to the Minister.  In this case, the Minister for Health referred it to the Minister of State with responsibility for people with disabilities, and we got an answer saying he has referred it back to the HSE.  That is the universal experience.  In another case, a five year old boy has only had two one-to-one speech therapy sessions despite the fact this child could be helped greatly if he got this therapy in a timely way.

Imagine the family who are beside themselves trying to get respite care and other care for a 42 year old adult or, on the other side of the scale, the parents of that five year old boy.  That is the reality.  It is not just an issue when I talk to the Taoiseach every so often.  It is an issue in their lives every single day.

There was a system whereby the HSE would come to the audiovisual room in Leinster House to answers queries from Deputies about issues like that.  Some Deputies will table a parliamentary question to the Minister for Health and get an answer from the HSE, and the paper trail goes around, but the Deputy still does not have the answer he or she might get through a phone call or a direct discussion with whoever might be in charge.

This represented an increase of over 9% on the year before and demand continues to be very strong so far this year.  Notwithstanding these pressures, renewal applications submitted through Passport Express continue to be processed within the 15 working day target.  Some categories, however, such as first-time applicants, take longer because of additional anti-fraud measures.  For example, first-time applicants are advised to allow 20 working days; the current turnaround time is 19 working days.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will readily appreciate, it is very important that citizens use the right channel when applying for a passport.  There have been a number of cases in recent times where applicants have used Passport Express despite their travel plans falling within the processing period for their passport, and I know that people in this category frequently contact my office and those of other Deputies.  Where applicants are travelling in less than 15 working days, the best course of action is to make an online appointment at the Passport Office in Dublin or Cork.  There are a limited number of appointments available daily in both offices.

The passport service through the Minister's Department employed additional clerical officers last year to deal with the spike around summer time, which is understandable.  All of those were let go before Christmas and now we are employing them again.  I put it to the Minister that we have to prepare in a post-Brexit Ireland because the level of applications being submitted will continue to increase.  Employing temporary clerical officers in the passport office, letting them go and continuing that cycle is not a long-term solution.  The passport service needs to revisit the turnaround time issue and republish those because as we approach the summer months and the holiday period, thousands of holiday makers and people who wish to go on business trips will be disappointed, as we have seen already.

However, I would remind the Deputy and the public that all applicants should carefully check the validity of their passports, and in particular those of their children, and then choose the correct mode of application because there have been a number of pressure points in recent times.

Minimising the impact on trade and the economy is a key priority for the Government in the forthcoming Brexit negotiations.  From our perspective this means, as the Taoiseach stated, that the best possible outcome in the negotiations is the closest possible economic and trading relationship between the European Union and the UK.<\/p><p>Every county in Ireland will be impacted by Brexit, including County Wexford which has significant trade and passenger traffic to the island of Great Britain and to continental Europe.  Consequently, the Government's preparation for the forthcoming negotiations has been extensive.  Responsibility for the strategic oversight of Brexit rests in the Department of the Taoiseach, and preparations for this next phase are co-ordinated through the dedicated Cabinet committee which the Taoiseach chairs and which has met six times since its formation.  Within my Department, a team of experienced senior officials both in Dublin and abroad is preparing intensively for the complex negotiations.<\/p><p>Brexit is an all-of-Government issue and each Minister and Department has an important role to play.  To date the Government's approach is to analyse on sector basis rather than county by county.  However, as this process advances and in particular as work progresses on a future EU-UK relationship, county level analyses may be required to complement this sectoral work.  In this regard, an analysis of County Wexford would be important.<\/p><p>That said, regional issues have fed in to the extensive analytical work undertaken to date, not least under the framework of the all-island civic dialogue process.  Fourteen sectoral dialogues have been hosted by Ministers in a range of locations throughout the country.  More than 1,100 industry and civic society representatives have participated in the events.<\/p><p>In addition, work by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has identified the maintenance of funding for INTERREG programmes as a priority issue.  The Ireland-Wales INTERREG programme, which covers County Wexford among other parts of the country, is one of three EU-funded cross-Border programmes involving Ireland and the UK.<\/p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House<\/i><\/p><p>The programme has a total value of almost &euro;100 million over the period 2014 to 2020.<\/p><p>As part of its contingency planning for Brexit, the risks to the cross-Border programmes, which are 85% funded by the EU, were identified by the Department.  I am pleased, therefore, that following intensive discussions with the Welsh European Funding Office and the Department of Finance in Northern Ireland, agreement was reached at the end of October on a safeguard clause that has enabled funding agreements to be put in place and letters of offer to issue for these programmes.  <\/p><p>The Government's strategy of outreach with EU partners and institutions in advance of the Brexit negotiations has included engagement with the French Government.  Shortly after the referendum last year, the Taoiseach welcomed French President, Fran&ccedil;ois Hollande to Government Buildings for a bilateral meeting, and I travelled to Paris for discussions with my counterpart Foreign Minister Ayrault in December.  Today, I welcomed Foreign Minister Ayrault to Iveagh House where we had a further exchange which focused largely on Brexit.  Since the referendum, the Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs has also twice met the French Europe Minister, Harlem D&eacute;sir.  Feedback to date from this comprehensive engagement has been very encouraging.<\/p><p>Maintenance of the common travel area, CTA, arrangements between Ireland and the UK is a priority for the Government.  At their meeting in Dublin on 30 January, in which I participated, the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister, Mrs. May, reaffirmed their joint commitment to maintaining the CTA and to continuing the two Governments' work in this regard.  I also discussed the impact of Brexit with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland in my meeting with him last Tuesday, 14 February.  Contacts are ongoing with the UK Government through our Embassy in London.<\/p><p>As we move towards the negotiation phase, I remain confident that, given the extensive work which has been undertaken to date, Ireland will be prepared and ready to protect and defend the best interests of all of Ireland and Irish citizens.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200026#Y00700","speaker":"1233"},{"type":"speech","time":1487776800,"counter":271,"content":"<p>I appreciate that Brexit will affect the entire nation and we need an all-nation approach to it.

It is important to recognise the fact that in 2016 alone, 181 irregular migrants were detected on the central Mediterranean route.  The vast majority of these people reached Italy, which has reported an 18% increase in arrivals.  This is a very challenging issue and it is important to note the vast majority of these migrants are unlikely to meet the criteria allowing them to qualify for refugee status.  In the first instance, we should look towards achieving political stability in Libya.

I did deal with the issue of Brexit, particulars of which we probably have already discussed.<\/p>  <p>  On the current political situation in Northern Ireland, the Secretary of State and I shared the view that it was of the utmost importance that the conditions would be in place for a power-sharing Executive to be established as soon as possible following the Assembly elections next month.  I emphasised to the Secretary of State that as co-guarantors of the Good Friday Agreement, both Governments had a role to play in supporting the effective operation of the devolved institutions and in upholding both the letter and the spirit of the agreement as a whole.<\/p>  <p>  I also discussed with the Secretary of State last week the imperative of dealing with the range of issues related to the legacy of the Troubles in a way that meets the needs and expectations of victims and survivors and of wider society through the comprehensive legacy framework provided for under the Stormont House Agreement.  I reiterated my determination that this be established at the earliest opportunity.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding engagement with the political parties in Northern Ireland, I have in recent months been in regular contact with the leaders of each of the main parties as the crisis in the Executive has deepened.  I met last month with the DUP leader, Arlene Foster, a Sinn F&eacute;in delegation led by Martin McGuinness and spoke by phone to the leaders of the SDLP, UUP and Alliance Party.  I also had the chance to hear from and engage with members of Sinn F&eacute;in, the SDLP and the Alliance Party at last week's civic dialogue plenary meeting in Dublin Castle and at the successful sectoral dialogue on human rights in Maynooth university last week.  The Taoiseach has also been actively engaged and was in direct contact with the British Prime Minister, as well as with the leaders of both the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in.<\/p>  <p>  I have agreed with the Secretary of State that both Governments should continue to work closely together in the weeks to come, looking ahead to the post-election period when a new power-sharing Executive will need to be formed.  We have also urged the parties to conduct their election campaigns in a calm and respectful way, conscious that polarising rhetoric and frayed relationships will damage the prospects of forming an Executive after the votes have been counted and the results announced.<\/p>  <p>  We must all be mindful that effective devolved Government, underpinned by a genuine spirit of partnership, is what the people of Northern Ireland voted for in 1998 and what they expect their politicians to deliver.  After the election, it will therefore fall to the parties to form a power-sharing Executive, and this will require the parties to find a way forward on issues which contributed to the calling of the election in the first instance.  The Government is always ready to support and assist the parties in any way we can.  Our commitment as a co-guarantor of the agreement is a constant one.<\/p>  <p>  I assure Deputy Darragh O'Brien that I specifically raised the issue of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings.  I acknowledge the fact I go to these talks, discussions and meetings fully armed and conscious of the D&aacute;il motions on this issue that have been passed, in particular the motion of 25 May last year following 42nd anniversary of the bombings on 17 May.  I assure the Deputy that I will continue to raise this issue.  I will continue to engage directly on the matter of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings and pursue all possible avenues to achieve progress on this issue, consistent with the mandate given to me being in the form of a request by the D&aacute;il.  I hope we can bring some measure of closure to this.  I have not only raised and discussed this issue regularly with the Secretary of State since his appointment last summer but I can tell the House that there have been regular meetings at official level between my officials and the officials of the Secretary of State with a view towards coming back with an element of progress that I am sure everybody in the House wishes to see advanced.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200028#AA00100","speaker":"1233"},{"type":"speech","time":1487778000,"counter":295,"content":"<p>I will take supplementaries from the Members present who tabled questions to which the Minister can give a composite response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200028#AA00200","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1487778000,"counter":296,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for that update and also for raising the matter of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings.

Accordingly, I share the concerns expressed by other EU partners regarding this development.<\/p>  <p>  I have noted the clarification issued by the Embassy of the United States in Dublin on 31 January 2017, to the effect that the executive order in question does not restrict the travel of dual nationals to the United States, so long as they hold the passport of an unrestricted country and possess a valid US visa, if required.  The US courts have since intervened and imposed a suspension on the implementation of the executive order.<\/p>  <p>  Both the executive order of 27 January and the question of immigration reform in the United States were high on the agenda for my visit to Washington, D.C. from 31 January to 2 February last.  I had a number of engagements with the Administration and congressional leaders, including the Speaker of the US House of Representatives, the House Majority Leader and the House Minority Leader among others.<\/p>  <p>  In my meetings with congressional leaders, as well as with the now former US National Security Adviser, General Flynn, I expressed Ireland's deep concerns with regard to the nature and impact of the executive order of 27 January.  In response, General Flynn outlined to me the rationale in terms of US immigration policy for these temporary measures while I pointed out their damaging consequences in humanitarian terms, as well as for the international reputation of the United States.  <\/p>  <p>  Achieving relief for the undocumented Irish citizens in the US and securing greater legal pathways for migration to the US remain key objectives for the Government.  These priorities featured in all of my meetings in Washington D.C., including with General Flynn, Speaker Ryan and other congressional leaders. <\/p>  <p>  Both the Administration and Members of Congress are fully aware of the importance of this issue for Ireland and appreciate our strong and continuing interest in securing immigration reform.  The Taoiseach's forthcoming visit to Washington, D.C. for St. Patrick's Day, which is now widely welcomed in the House, will provide a key opportunity to raise the issue of immigration reform, especially the plight of our undocumented, directly with the US Administration at the highest level.<\/p>  <p>  During my visit, I also met members of the Irish community in Washington, D.C. and reassured them as to the Government's commitment to immigration reform.  I emphasised that while the political context in Washington may have changed, the Government's objectives remain constant, namely, relief for the undocumented and finding greater pathways for legal migration to the United States of America.  I noted that we can only advance these objectives if we engage fully and articulate our views with the key decision makers in the Administration and in Congress.  In addition to these contacts at political level, the embassy in Washington and our consulates across the United States continue to work with Irish immigration centres on a daily basis in providing support to Irish citizens in the US.  <\/p>  <p>  Our ambassador to the US held a workshop with key immigration stakeholders in the Irish community, from across the United States at the embassy on 12 January last.  Ambassador Anderson and her team remain fully engaged.  The Government and my Department are committed to providing practical support to undocumented Irish citizens in the US while also continuing to advocate for immigration reform.  I acknowledge the work, commitment and engagement at every level of my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy McHugh, who is today on diaspora duties outside the jurisdiction. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200030#CC01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"speech","time":1487779200,"counter":333,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for that outline.

While I believe the Taoiseach should go to America, I suggest he should carry with him the strong voice of this D&aacute;il, which does not agree with what President Trump is saying.  A report produced by Amnesty International refers specifically to the politics of demonisation, which shamefully peddles a dangerous idea that some people are less human than others and thereby strips away the humanity of entire groups of people.  While the undocumented Irish are extremely important and near to my heart - I welcome the questions about them - the importance of this issue and this policy extends beyond Irish people in America and goes to the heart of what we want the Taoiseach to tell President Trump.  It is simply not acceptable to ban people based on race, religion or a decision made on a whim by an American President.  Since the suspension of the initial order, the US Administration has brought in a new executive order, which is equally worrying in respect of the undocumented Irish and all the other undocumented people in America.  The Minister should familiarise himself with it.

We fund several organisations that provide a range of services in the US.  I acknowledge the recent changes in respect of the J1 visa programme, which has been tremendously successful and has formed a strong basis of our relationship with US Administrations over the past 50 years.  Almost 150,000 Irish third-level students and young people have participated in the programme over the years.  Following an announcement that was made last week, an additional 2,600 J1 places will be made available this year.  I have discussed at the highest level the need to explore a number of pathways and options that may be available to secure relief for the up to 50,000 undocumented Irish people in the US.  It is important that every avenue and every opportunity is pursued.  My understanding is that there may well be an initiative in the US towards the end of this year.

I do not believe an adequate investigation was carried out by the Garda at the time of the murder.  I want the Garda to carry out a further examination.

This might have allowed people to meet to agree their statements before those statements were made to the Garda.  The DPP has confirmed that Kieran was killed by stabbing on the stairs in the dwelling but his body was found outside in an open area.  Clearly, many of the events on the night have not been adequately explained and further examination is needed.  That is why I am calling on the Minister to make a statement.

According to the post mortem on Kieran, he died as a result of a single stab wound.  He had been to the dwelling where he was stabbed earlier in the night.  He knew the people who were present in the dwelling, including the person who allegedly inflicted the fatal stab wound.  A number of men were present at this dwelling.

We remember that legislation going through the House.  Like the members of Kieran's family and their solicitor, as a local Deputy I am very concerned about this decision.  The 2011 Act provides that someone can use force against another person if \"he or she believes the other person has entered or is entering the dwelling as a trespasser for the purpose of committing a criminal act\" and \"the force used is only such as is reasonable in the circumstances\" to protect himself or herself or his or her property or to prevent the commission of a crime.

The T&aacute;naiste is aware of the reports surrounding this tragic case and sympathises greatly with the family and friends of Kieran Monahan.  I am sure everyone in this House is conscious of the very serious impact of violent crime on victims and their families.<\/p>  <p>  The T&aacute;naiste is advised by the Garda authorities that the incident in question was the subject of an investigation by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in 2012.  A file was then submitted to the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, who directed that there be no prosecution in this case.  The Deputies will appreciate that criminal investigations are properly dealt with by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the first instance and that the T&aacute;naiste has no role in particular investigations.  It must be also stressed that the DPP is an independent body, which makes decisions as to whether a person should be prosecuted and for what offence.  Whereas the T&aacute;naiste appreciates the ongoing distress of family and friends in the aftermath of this tragedy, it is not open to her to intervene in regard to the DPP's decisions in individual cases.<\/p>  <p>  It is worth noting that there is provision to allow for certain people, including a victim's family, to seek reasons for a decision made by the DPP.  I understand that details of the procedures in this regard are available from the office of the DPP.  This tragic case highlights the trauma and damage that can occur where knives are used in dispute situations.  There is a robust legal framework in place on the illegal use of knives.  Under the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, the maximum penalty for possessing a knife in a public place without good reason or lawful authority was increased from one to five years.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also has an extended power of search without warrant regarding knives and offensive weapons.  It should be noted, however, that many incidents involving knives occur in domestic settings and on the spur of the moment, which increases the challenges for preventative policing and enforcement.<\/p>  <p>  At an operational level, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na proactively targets public disorder and anti-social behaviour, including knife-related crime, through the strategic deployment of Garda resources.  In this regard, detective units and divisional crime task forces may be utilised to provide a high-visibility presence in areas such as late night bars to deter and detect possible altercations.  Finally, the accelerated programme of Garda recruitment underlines the Government's commitment to tackling all forms of criminality and providing communities with visible and effective policing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200032#EE00200","speaker":"1307"},{"type":"speech","time":1487780400,"counter":348,"content":"<p>I acknowledge the response from the Minister of State, which does not deal with the issue at all.

It was quite shocking as we learned for the first time that it was the intention of the Mental Health Commission to de-register the psychiatric unit in University Hospital Waterford and completely close it down.  It is the psychiatric acute unit for the counties of Wexford and Waterford.  The new determination of the Mental Health Commission was to reduce the number of acute beds from 14 to six.<\/p>  <p>  I will give some brief background.  In 2010, following the closure of St. Senan's Hospital in Enniscorthy in accordance with A Vision for Change, the acute psychiatric services for County Wexford, except for its very north, were added to the acute psychiatric service for Waterford and provided in Waterford.  The 14-bed unit had caused deep concerns over recent years as being inadequate.<\/p><p>The letter from the Mental Health Commission states that serious concerns remain as to the safety, health and well-being of residents in the approved centre and that it is quite clear that the current unit is not fit for purpose.  While this may well be the case, the notion that there would be only six acute beds available for the counties of Waterford and Wexford is wholly unacceptable.  In a letter received by me and, I presume, other Deputies yesterday, the Minister of State, Deputy Helen McEntee, to whom I wish a speedy recovery, indicated that an appeal would be lodged.  However, the appeal must be determined by next Friday.  If not, the unit will be reduced to six beds as and from next Wednesday.  It is unacceptable.<\/p> <p> Will the Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne, indicate in very clear terms what provision will be made for acute patients beyond next Wednesday, assuming the ruling of the Mental Health Commission stands?  The letter I received yesterday aggregated acute and sub-acute beds and referred to 36 beds.  I am focusing exclusively on acute beds, which are to be reduced from 14 to six, which is wholly unacceptable and will cause consternation among all the population of Wexford and Waterford.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200032#EE01000","speaker":"1353","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487781000,"counter":358,"content":"<p>I, too, have a copy of the Mental Health Commission's leaked report which considers a number of options, one of which is to deregister the entire unit at University Hospital Waterford, which would be inconceivable.

I was suffering from chest pains and was having a severe panic attack.  I was seen by a psychiatrist but I was informed that due to a shortage of beds I could not be admitted.

How is it allowed that people with suicidal ideation are turned away without adequate supports?  I would have gladly sat on a glass floor rather than being sent home.  I was left at home and suffered multiple panic attacks since.  Do those in authority understand what it is like to suffer from mental health issues?

The current system is already under pressure and patients are being turned away from the hospital.  I have received late night calls from people who have been asked to travel to Cork because the services were not available in Waterford.  I have received responses to parliamentary questions to the Minister for Health informing me that key psychiatric posts in the hospital have not been filled.  This is adding to the pressures.<\/p><p>Will the Minister of State confirm that the possibility of the unit being deregistered is not on the table?

Now we have learned that we could lose up to eight beds.  It is unacceptable and wrong.<\/p>  <p>  The 14 acute beds in the psychiatric department covering Waterford, Wexford and part of the south east has a catchment area of approximately 300,000 people.

The practice of admitting people suffering from mental health issues to emergency departments must end.  Mental health spending is allocated year to year.  It is obvious it is not working.  We need a multiannual plan in order that our mental health services can be developed with certainty and we do not see a recurrence of this.

Why are children being put into adult units?  Where are the out of hours services for children and adults?  Where are the crisis houses?  None of these exists, yet we are going to close the only outlet, which is access to hospital units.  We must increase, not decrease, services.  I expect a clear response from the Minister of State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200033#FF00400","speaker":"1354"},{"type":"speech","time":1487781000,"counter":361,"content":"<p>It is unfortunate the Minister of State, Deputy Helen McEntee, cannot be here but she was taken ill suddenly last night.

The acute mental health unit at St. Senan's Hospital, Enniscorthy, County Wexford, was amalgamated with the Waterford mental health services in 2010.  This now provides a 44-bed acute inpatient mental health unit at University Hospital Waterford.  The department of psychiatry in University Hospital Waterford provides inpatient assessment, treatment and care to service users living in the Wexford area.  Service users who live in north Wexford, who attend Tara House mental health services in Gorey and who require acute inpatient admission have access to Newcastle Hospital, Greystones, County Wicklow.<\/p> <p> To ensure that each mental health facility is fit for purpose, the Mental Health Commission is charged with visiting and inspecting every approved mental health centre at least once a year.  On 3 February 2017 the Mental Health Commission notified the HSE that following a number of inspections during 2016, it proposed that the department of psychiatry at University Hospital Waterford would be registered as an approved centre, with conditions.  Primary among these conditions was that the number of beds be reduced.  As Deputy Howlin stated, the HSE has until Friday, 24 February to make representations to the commission to either modify or remove those proposed conditions based on evidence that University Hospital Waterford is or will be compliant with the regulations to which the proposed conditions relate.  The HSE intends to request that the commission does not, as a condition of registration, require it to reduce the number of beds in Waterford.  Under section 64(6)(b)(iii) of the Mental Health Act 2001, the commission can specify the maximum number of residents in an approved centre or within an area of an approved centre.  In this instance, that is proposed because in the view of the inspectors there is insufficient space for the total number of residents, there is a lack of dining, recreational and quiet spaces for residents and the previously proposed programme of works would not have addressed these issues.  Taken together, these issues pose a risk to service user safety.  The HSE will make representations to the commission before 24 February detailing how the HSE intends to address these issues, including a revised programme of works and associated timelines.<\/p> <p> The HSE will outline how, on balance, a bed reduction is less safe for the service user population of the community health care organisation region CHO 5 than maintaining the current bed base, with the controls and improvement plans to be provided.  Bearing in mind all the circumstances, I am confident that the HSE and University Hospital Waterford will resolve the issues raised by the commission.  The Department will, however, continue to closely monitor the issues raised by the Mental Health Commission, in conjunction with the HSE, to ensure that the necessary corrective actions will be taken.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200033#FF00500","speaker":"1307","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487781600,"counter":363,"content":"<p>I regret to say that the Minster of State has not given factual information to the House.

Bizarrely, the commission's recommendation is to close the unit or dramatically reduce the numbers there, with no consideration given to people who have mental health issues and who need the services of that unit right across the region.  Rather than looking at closing or reducing the services, the Minister and the Government should be focusing on increasing the capacity, which the Mental Health Commission has said is not there.  Where are the therapists?  When are the vacant psychiatric posts going to be filled?  How is the Minister going to increase the physical space for recreation areas and quiet rooms?

In February 2015 the previous Administration made available &euro;150 million for property solutions for the regions.  It was something I was very supportive of and I understand there simply cannot be a major advance factory or major IDA investment in every town and village.  However, every constituency should certainly be given the prospect of some expenditure.<\/p>  <p>  I found out the fund was being made available to Waterford and I can understand the logic of this as Waterford is the largest urban area in the south-east region.  I then received information that funding was going to Carlow-Kilkenny, which is a five-seat constituency.  Again, I can understand funding going to the northern perimeter of the region to try to get jobs out of the greater Dublin area, for example, back-office jobs.  However, to my very great disappointment, I was then told the funding would revert back to Waterford for the next expenditure from that fund for the south-east region.  This is just not acceptable.  It means that funding has gone to the four-seat constituency of Waterford, then to the five-seat constituency of Carlow-Kilkenny, then back to Waterford, while leaving out Wexford exclusively.  Wexford is a large five-seat constituency and one of the largest counties in the country, with 150,000 people.  It is not fair.  I have said in this House, and in the other Chamber when I was there, that I am okay with getting a fair share but I am not at all okay with not getting a fair share.  On this occasion, it is not happening.<\/p>  <p>  The number of IDA foreign direct investment visits has been in low single digits in recent years.  In the first six months of one recent year, there were just three visits.  At the same time, I can understand there only being three visits because there is no premises available, although there is some land in the IDA industrial estate in Wexford town - I think it is three acres, in a county the size of Wexford.  Again, I am not looking for anything we are not entitled to.  I am looking for what we are entitled to, which is to get some shake of what is available.  That is not happening.  I look forward to the Minister of State's response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200035#HH00700","speaker":"1364"},{"type":"speech","time":1487782200,"counter":378,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy D'Arcy for raising this issue.  I know he has a particular interest in ensuring Wexford gets its share of jobs.  I apologise on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Mary Mitchell O'Connor, who was unable to attend due to a prior diary commitment.<\/p>  <p>  I think it would first be useful to set out some information on the aims and operation of the IDA regional property programme.  As Deputies may be aware, this initiative was launched in February 2015 by the Government and it is being delivered by the agency over a five-year period up to 2019.  The fundamental aim of the programme is to allow the IDA to invest in property solutions that will serve to attract further foreign direct investment opportunities and win additional projects for the regions outside Dublin and Cork.  In practical terms, this means equipping the IDA with the means to improve existing business parks and acquire and service suitable sites.  The programme also entails the construction of advance facilities, which can be marketed to prospective investors, in areas of the country where the private sector has been slow to build.  The availability of such advance facilities is an important part of the programme and 30% of the total funding available has, therefore, been allocated towards their construction.<\/p>  <p>  To answer Deputy D'Arcy's point as to why Wexford was not included, it is important to point out that IDA Ireland, in determining the most appropriate sites for these facilities, has applied a set of key criteria.  These include the following: the population density of the area in the question; the nature of other commercial activity and investment in those surroundings; the proximity of third level educational institutions, given their importance as effective feeders of employees for new companies; and the availability of local infrastructure than can support and foster further development in the area.  It was on this basis that nine locations were selected for facilities at this particular stage, including Sligo, Athlone, Tralee, Galway, Limerick, Castlebar, Dundalk and Waterford.  Facilities at six of these locations are due for completion this year and the remaining three, including Waterford, are scheduled to be completed by the end of 2018.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to point out the advance facilities, although important, form only part of the IDA's regional property offering and the agency has other tools at its disposal to help attract investment to the regions.  In respect of Wexford, for example, the IDA has two business parks, one in Wexford Town and one in Enniscorthy, both of which the agency&rsquo;s officials are intensively marketing in order to attract new investment.  Furthermore, the IDA holds a further 1.8 hectares of land at Drinagh which it hopes to be the home of future investment.  We should not forget that arguably a more efficient way to increase FDI in regional locations is deepening and strengthening engagement with client companies that are already there.  In other words, where there is foreign investment, it is vital to consolidate this in order to increase the footprint of such companies.  We note that IDA statistics are clear that approximately 70% of all new FDI comes from existing clients.<\/p>  <p>  Wexford is home to 17 existing IDA Ireland clients which, between them, employ almost 2,630 people in a range of manufacturing and service operations.  There is potential to increase the size of this existing FDI footprint and that is why IDA Ireland is constantly engaging with these client companies to explore the potential for further investment.  This approach has already borne fruit and in 2016 client companies already present in the county increased their employment numbers by almost 150 positions.<\/p>  <p>  I want to conclude by emphasising the Government is committed to regional development all across Ireland, including in Wexford.  The regional property programme is an important and useful tool but the IDA will continue to pursue all options and avenues to help win further FDI for Wexford, the south-east and Ireland as a whole.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200035#HH00800","speaker":"1272"},{"type":"speech","time":1487782200,"counter":379,"content":"<p>I think it is important to add some information to the Minister of State's script.  While he is correct there is an IDA business park in Enniscorthy, there is no land available because it is full.  I also want to correct myself as I said there was 3 acres of land whereas it is 4.5 acres.  However, if a major client wanted to come to Wexford, it could not do so because that land is not available.<\/p>  <p>  The issue is that if a new company is preparing to invest, either land or a premises must be available.  I am fine with the investment in the towns the Minister of State outlined, namely, Sligo, Athlone, Tralee, Galway, Limerick, Castlebar, Dundalk and Waterford, and also that the next funding is being prepared for Carlow.  However, subsequent to that, the funding will go back to Waterford, which is not fair.  The IDA has made it very clear it is going back to Waterford but it has an obligation to County Wexford as well as County Waterford.  Given the Government had made funding available, I do not believe the IDA can just exclude a county in the manner in which it is currently excluding Wexford.  I ask the Minister of State to address that specific point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200035#HH00900","speaker":"1364"},{"type":"speech","time":1487782200,"counter":380,"content":"<p>The information I have in regard to the business site at Drinagh is that it is 7.5 acres and it is available for marketing.  I want to highlight a point I referred to in my first contribution, namely, 70% of new jobs are created by existing clients.<\/p><p>That is an important statistic.<\/p> <p> Wexford is very strong in the medical-technology, medtech, sector.  Ireland's medtech sector is on a par with those in Minnesota or Germany.  We are very strong in that area.  It is not all about IDA Ireland jobs.  It is about Enterprise Ireland jobs also.  Enterprise Ireland is doing an excellent job in that regard.  There are 17 foreign direct investment, FDI, companies in Wexford, many of them in the medtech sector.  The number of indigenous small industries that can come out of those foreign direct companies speaks for itself.  Employment in the south east increased by 4.6% last year.  IDA Ireland had a very strong year last year, which saw all regions experiencing growth.  <\/p> <p> I am familiar with what Deputy D'Arcy is talking about in the Wexford-Waterford area.  Wexford has its strengths.  The Deputy spoke about site visits.  He is correct.  There were very few site visits in 2012; I believe there were only three.  Last year, there were seven site visits.  IDA Ireland's team in the south east is marketing Wexford equally as much as Waterford but he must consider the way IDA Ireland operates.  It operates in regions.  It has to try to bring jobs into regions.  It cannot simply bring jobs into towns because it is competing with other big cities such as Manchester, which has a population of 5 million or 6 million.  That is the way it has to operate to attract companies into these regions.  In any event, it is up to the companies to decide where they locate but it is important the Deputy takes note of the fact that 70% of new jobs come from existing companies.  I believe there are great opportunities for the existing IDA Ireland companies, particularly in the medtech sector but also in the indigenous area, and for Enterprise Ireland to grow jobs as well as the local employment offices.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200035#HH01000","speaker":"1272","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1487782800,"counter":382,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 4.22 p.m. and resumed at 5.02 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Industrial Relations (Right to Access) (Amendment) Bill 2016: Second Stage [Private Members]","time":1487783100,"counter":383,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200037#NN00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1487783100,"counter":384,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&quot;<\/p><p>I am sharing time with a number of other Deputies.<\/p><p>James Connolly once famously said that the cause of labour is the cause of Ireland and the cause of Ireland is the cause of labour.  He recognised that a republic is only a republic in name if it does not vindicate the rights of citizens.  Central to this tenet is the vindication of the rights of people in the workplace.  Sinn F&eacute;in believes in strong, robust, fair and effective employment rights.  We believe in the right of workers to organise, join a trade union and be represented by a trade union.  We support the right of workers to bargain collectively.  We see this as inextricably linked to trade union recognition.<\/p><p>The current voluntary system has worked for some but has failed many.  Some unscrupulous employers refuse to recognise trade unions and engage in campaigns of bullying, harassment and intimidation.  This cannot be said of all employers; the vast majority are decent.  However, for those who are not, we must ensure that appropriate laws are in place.  Those who are unscrupulous operate as they do because they can and because the current system allows them to.  Decent employers should have no truck with such tactics and neither should any Government interested in the rights of workers.  A voluntary system of trade union recognition allows unscrupulous employers a hiding place.  If an employer has nothing to hide, then it has nothing to fear.<\/p><p>During the infamous Ryanair dispute of 2007, Mr. Justice Geoghegan stated:<\/p><blockquote>As a matter of law Ryanair is perfectly entitled not to deal with trade unions nor can a law be passed compelling them to do so.  There is an obvious danger however in a non-unionised company that employees may be exploited and may have to submit to what most reasonable people would consider to be grossly unfair terms and conditions of employment.<\/blockquote><p>How right he was.<\/p><p>This Bill does not confer the right to trade union recognition.  It does confer the right for trade union members to associate with and meet trade union officials in the workplace.  The general secretary of Mandate, John Douglas, recently remarked that being a member of a trade union in Ireland was like being a member of a golf club but not being allowed to play golf.<\/p><p>Employers who value their employees have nothing to fear from strengthened labour laws.  Those who seek to bully and routinely to ignore industrial relations laws and trade unions do so to protect their interests over those of their employees.<\/p><p>A successful economy is one that values those who contribute to it.  A successful employment rights infrastructure is one that operates on the basis of equality and a level playing field between worker and employer.  There is no level playing field if workers cannot be fairly and properly represented by their trade union.  In far too many sectors, the odds are stacked in favour of the employer.  This has resulted in instances of abuse and exploitation.  The best way to avoid industrial disputes is to have genuine engagement and respect for all sides.  The most effective way to avoid workplace conflict is to resolve disputes at the earliest possible opportunity.  What better place than the shop floor or place of employment?  The right of trade union representatives to engage with trade union members in the workplace should not be feared by anyone, including Government; rather, it should be embraced.  It is a right afforded to workers in many countries that are competitive and that lead the way in workers' rights.<\/p><p>The Bill mirrors the Australian and New Zealand model.  The model works effectively and is supported by employer groups and trade unions in those countries.  It is seen, rightly, as an opportunity to avoid conflict in the workplace and as a way to promote harmonious relationships between employee and employer.<\/p><p>Far too often, we hear examples of employers granting the right to trade union access in the workplace only to withdraw it when it suits.  It is a right conferred when everything is going well but used as a punitive measure when conflict arises.  This <i>&agrave; la carte<\/i>approach to workers' rights cannot and must not be tolerated.  It is telling that instances of abuse and intolerance and breaches of employment law are highest in sectors where low pay, precarious work and if-and-when contracts are the norm.

It is also part of an attempt by the company to break the union as part of what has been termed project black.  In fact, in recent days Tesco has boasted and put out false figures of the number of people who have passed the picket line.  That is what these workers have to deal with.

We hear Fine Gael Ministers state repeatedly, when they deny workers rights, that it is about being competitive and flexible but for far too many workers flexibility is synonymous with abuse and exploitation.  Flexible work is good, but undermining workers' rights is about only one thing - greed.  We are the lawmakers.  It falls to us to protect workers and to put in place a strong, robust and effective legislative framework that protects the interests of working people.  Our current labour laws have positive aspects that should be recognised and celebrated.  While I do, there are far too many gaps and weaknesses which must be filled.  This Bill seeks to address one such weakness.  It is not a panacea for all the problems that affect workers or the plethora of rights they are denied.<\/p> <p> I have published legislation on piercing the corporate veil, on dealing with low-hour and if-and-when contracts, on trade union recognition and on tactical insolvencies.  All were rejected by the Government.  Every proposal my party puts forward to deal with workers' rights is thrown out the window because the Government is not supportive of such concepts.  However, this Bill is about the right of workers to engage with their trade union representative in the workplace.  Ministers repeatedly accuse Sinn F&eacute;in of opposing and not offering solutions.  Today, we offer a solution but the response of the Government is once again to hide behind its ideology and deny workers' basic rights.  Fine Gael is a party that represents a privileged, cosseted class.  In Fine Gael's world the working class is ignored while it represents the interests of big business and the elites.  Does the Minister or the Government care about exploitation and abuse in the workplace?  Have they any idea what life is like for many workers?  These workers are often pitted against highly trained human resources managers or an employer's legal team and yet are refused access to their trade union official.  The Minister stands over this.  Workers on low-hour contracts who complain about their terms and conditions of employment have their hours cut by unscrupulous employers, because the employers are allowed to do it.  The Minister sits on her hands and does nothing about it aside from vote down Bills brought forward by Members on this side of the House.<\/p> <p> This Bill seeks to amend the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2015 to allow trade unions access to their members in the workplace for purposes related to the employment of their members, for purposes related to the union's business or both.  There are sufficient checks and balances in the Bill.  It sets out conditionality relating to the permission which must be sought to allow trade unions to engage with their members in the workplace.<\/p> <p> I ask all Members, including those in Fianna F&aacute;il, to support the Bill.  No Bill is without flaws.  I have acknowledged that in recent times when my party has supported many Bills brought forward by Fianna F&aacute;il that were flawed.  When we agree with the principle, we support them.  Too often, however, Fianna F&aacute;il does not support our Bills.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions, Mandate and unions that represent workers in the financial services sector, the banking sector, the private sector and the public sector all support this Bill.  The only people who do not support it are Fine Gael Members.  We have yet to hear from Fianna F&aacute;il Members but the word is they will not support it.  That says it all about both parties.<\/p> <p> Members have a job to do, which is to legislate in the interest of workers who need to be properly represented.  We are doing our job.  It is now over to the Government and Fianna F&aacute;il to do their jobs.  I commend the Bill to the House.  I thank the Independent Members and Members from other parties who have indicated their support for the legislation and I look forward to their contributions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200037#NN00400","speaker":"1258","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487783700,"counter":388,"content":"<p>I remind Deputies that they may refer not only to what is in the Bill but also to what could relevantly be put into the Bill.

Judging by the eagerness with which Fianna F&aacute;il representatives were scrambling to get into photographs beside striking Tesco workers this week, I was almost fooled into thinking that the party had experienced a road-to-Damascus moment and had been converted to the side of workers.  Unfortunately, Fianna F&aacute;il remains a party of photograph opportunities, not principles.  That this very reasonable Bill could be opposed by a party which claims to represent ordinary people, as Fianna F&aacute;il does, indicates how far we have fallen with regard to protecting workers' rights in this State.  Obviously, we had problems, having followed the Thatcherite path of the UK in the late 1980s and having legally hamstrung unions with industrial regulations that practically outlawed effective strikes in the 1990s.  It now appears radical merely to argue for the right of unions to access workers and attempt to organise.  The fact that this law is not already in place is sad and the fact it is necessary is an indictment of the State and lays bare whose side Governments have taken.<\/p>  <p>  The erosion of workers' rights over recent years is clear.  Zero-hour contracts, intimidation, blacklisting, punishment for union activities and bogus self-employment contracts are just a few examples of daily attacks on the rights of workers to organise.  With the increasing move towards automation, the role of unions has never been so important in ensuring that workers are not cast by the wayside in the name of ever-increasing profits for an increasingly small number of shareholders.  The effect of this erosion is insidious but pervasive on the public perception of fellow workers in other industries.  Many ordinary people who would have stood with their class a generation ago now decry the idea that anybody working in an ordinary job should earn wages that allow them to live.  It appears that people who work in unskilled or semi-skilled positions should be punished.  The consequences of not defending workers from the increasingly savage attacks of capitalism will be truly dire, most of all for those in power who will reap the whirlwind of the discontent they have sown.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200038#OO00300","speaker":"1279"},{"type":"speech","time":1487783700,"counter":390,"content":"<p>It has been obvious for some years that the race to the bottom for Irish workers is in full swing but the Government continues to turn a blind eye to it.  Workers' hard earned rights and conditions are under attack.  We see it with Bus &Eacute;ireann and Tesco workers, newly qualified teachers, workers in the hospitality sector and part-time workers, as well as with minimum wage and minimum-hour contracts, zero-hour contracts, non-union shops and workers not knowing from one end of the week to the next what will be their hours or pay.  They cannot plan a week in advance, never mind plan their future.  All of this is happening on the Government's watch.  The Government states the economy is in a recovery but there is no recovery for workers.  There is a clear policy of busting unions, as can be seen in Tesco and other large retail outlets at present even though these companies make enormous profits in Ireland.  Again, the Government turns a blind eye.<\/p>  <p>  This Bill is about unions having access to the workplace and their members.  In fact, it is about workers' rights.  Under the Bill, workers can ask their union representative to come to their workplace to speak to them.  The Government opposes this measure.  Why would it oppose a worker's basic right to have his or her union representative come to his or her workplace?  Is Fianna F&aacute;il actually opposed to allowing a worker have his or her union representative come to his or her workplace?

It will be a cheap and hollow photo-opportunity if those Deputies vote against the Bill or abstain in the vote.  The vote on this Bill will show up the Members who are talking the talk but will not walk the walk.

It is evident that workers' rights are now worse in many areas than they were when we joined the European Union in the early 1970s.  The race to the bottom with regard to wages and rights started many years ago but it has accelerated greatly in recent years under both Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael Governments and, amazingly, under Governments in which the Labour Party was a partner.  The Bill brought forward by Sinn F&eacute;in will allow trade unions to have access to the workplace to meet their members regarding official trade union business.  This is a fundamental right that many people in this country have strived for since the beginning of the last century and before that in some cases.  The Bill will allow trade unions to work out a reasonable time with an employer for access to trade union members in terms of discussing collective agreements as well as wider workplace issues.<\/p><p>This will prevent unscrupulous employers using the law to stymie trade unions in their work.  The purpose of this Bill is to bring some necessary balance to the situation.  It might not be popular for some Members of this House or for those in the media to admit the work that trade unions have done on equality and working conditions, their many other positive contributions to this country or the importance of their role in society.  Trade unions protect the rights of employees and, by doing so, serve a vital social and economic function.<\/p> <p> It is disgraceful in this day and age that we are standing in this Chamber discussing the need to pass this Bill while there is an ongoing battle against a race to the bottom in terms of workers' pay and conditions.  The State cannot continue to allow companies to slash wages to increase profits when those wage cuts end up as an expense for the State.  For example, 10% of Tesco staff are already on low pay.  The State has to top up their incomes with supplementary social welfare.  Now the company is trying to drive down wages and conditions of employment for their longest serving staff, leaving the State to step in to subsidise these low wages with welfare payments.  I ask the Government and its partner, Fianna F&aacute;il, to support our Bill, especially as the Government itself regularly deals with unions and has seen the benefits of negotiations with these unions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200038#OO00500","speaker":"1303","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487784300,"counter":393,"content":"<p>I, like others, commend the Bill and I look forward to the debate.

It is not something that is in any way radical.  It may have been seen as radical 100 years ago but I would have thought the idea of workers being organised in a modern Ireland was very much a positive thing.  If we look at other jurisdictions, this is clearly working.  It is about preventing, not encouraging, disputes.  If there are people on the ground who can come into a workplace and resolve issues, that is a big plus.<\/p>  <p>  We will probably hear tonight from some of the hard cases that it will not work.

Let me state from the outset that it is vital that trade unions are able to represent and take action in support of the interests of their members and that the laws of the State vindicate that right.<\/p>  <p>  It has been the consistent policy of successive Irish Governments to support the development of an institutional framework supportive of a voluntary system of industrial relations that is premised upon freedom of contract and freedom of association.  Our industrial relations legislation offers robust protections to trade unions to allow them to go about their business of protecting workers rights.  These include protection from tort regardless of any damage caused to an employer's business because of a trade dispute.  Furthermore the code of practice on victimisation drawn up under the industrial relations legislation offers protection against victimisation arising from an employee's membership or non-membership of a trade union.  This was further enhanced in 2015 to include an explicit prohibition on the use by employers of inducements, financial or otherwise, designed specifically to have staff forgo collective representation by a trade union.<\/p>  <p>  We should acknowledge that our industrial relations structures are very successful.  Hundreds of disputes are resolved each year by the Workplace Relations Commission and the Labour Court and many more are resolved by the parties themselves through dialogue.  There is an extensive range of statutory provisions designed to back up this voluntary framework.  The Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2012 provides for a revised framework for wage setting under the Joint Labour Committee framework.<\/p>  <p>  The Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2015 significantly changed the existing industrial relations landscape in Ireland and it provides for a new statutory framework for establishing minimum rates of remuneration, pension and sick pay, to replace the former sectoral registered employment agreements.  It also ensures that where an employer does not engage in collective bargaining, an effective framework now exists that allows a trade union to have the remuneration and terms and conditions of its members assessed against relevant comparators and determined in a binding way by the Labour Court.<\/p>  <p>  The 2015 Act was the culmination of a process of in-depth consultation with stakeholders, including employer and worker representatives, and a review of the experience of the operation of the existing legislative framework as put in place under the Industrial Relations Acts of 2001 and 2004.<\/p>  <p>  From my perspective, the most important concept to consider in this debate is that of balance.  The 2015 legislation provides a clear and balanced mechanism by which the fairness of the employment conditions of workers in their totality can be assessed in employments where collective bargaining does not take place and brings clarity and certainty for employers in terms of managing their workplaces in this respect.  Of course the industrial relations structures of any jurisdiction must be fit for purpose.  We cannot simply cut and paste what exists in another country and apply it here.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill under discussion today has many flaws, particularly in relation to balance.  The practical issues which would arise if this Bill were to be enacted are numerous and capable of creating many difficulties across our economy and in these respects it is unworkable.<\/p>  <p>  The House may not be aware but there are currently 56 registered trade unions in Ireland.  This Bill sets no limits on the number of trade unions that can seek access to a place of work.  Granting statutory rights to enter premises is a very serious matter.  Thus, potentially, an employer could have multiple unions and multiple trade union representatives seeking access to a place of employment.  This applies even if the union does not have a single member in the employment.  This may present an onerous burden for employers, regardless of whether they have one or a thousand employees.<\/p>  <p>  The consent provisions outlined in this Bill effectively mean no consent is needed.  The timelines are unworkable.<\/p><p>The Bill proposes that the only grounds under which an employer can deny access to a union representative is if it is certified by the Attorney General that access would prejudice the security of the State or the investigation or detection of offences.  This is not a function the Office of the Attorney General can perform.<\/p> <p> The Bill as presented also proposes that a union representative may enter a workplace to deal with matters concerning the health and safety of union members.  Ireland has a competent and specialist Health and Safety Authority that includes an inspectorate warranted to enter premises.  The Bill would cut across the statutory mandate of the Health and Safety Authority.<\/p> <p> Furthermore, the Bill seeks to empower union representatives to monitor compliance with employment rights-related matters.  Inspectors of the Workplace Relations Commission have strong powers to monitor and enforce a robust suite of employment and equality legislation and I cannot see how a statutory role for union representatives in this area could work.<\/p> <p> I am open to considering any issues that arise in practice in terms of access and the potential for further developments regarding access that enhance our industrial relations landscape.  I believe that this is a subject the Joint Committee for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation might usefully consider for inclusion on its work programme should it so wish.  I am sure that employer and worker representative bodies would be eager to contribute their own analyses and suggestions and I am sure many of my colleagues in the Chamber would welcome the opportunity to explore any potential developments, particularly where there is some common ground.  I would welcome any conclusions or findings from such a process, if the committee were to decide to give the matter some consideration.<\/p> <p> However, the flaws in the Bill are such that I cannot support it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200039#PP00400","speaker":"1247","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487784900,"counter":397,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to discuss this Bill.  Fianna F&aacute;il has a long track record of supporting workers' rights and balanced industrial relations legislation.  The constitutional right of citizens to form associations and unions is enshrined in our progressive Constitution, Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann, which was introduced under Eamon de Valera back in 1937.  My party has a strong record on worker protection from introducing the National Minimum Wage Act to instituting the labour relations machinery of the State by establishing the Labour Relation Commission, which is now the Workplace Relations Commission.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, it has been a consistent policy of ours to end exploitable low-hour-type arrangements and we supported a Private Members' Bill on freelance workers' rights in the Seanad last year.  I believe this Bill is being taken next week in the D&aacute;il under Private' Members time also and look forward to discussing its legislative proposals.<\/p>  <p>  However, having reviewed the Bill before us, Fianna F&aacute;il will not be supporting it for a number of reasons.  There are many weaknesses and much legal ambiguity in the Bill, which would place excessive and disproportionate regulatory requirements on existing enterprises, fundamentally risking the strong FDI footprint in Ireland, which employs some 200,000 people directly.  Significantly, it could undermine the current functioning of the Workplace Relations Commission and give rise to serious data protection concerns.  This Bill is not fit for purpose and sends out the message that Ireland is closed for business to international investors.<\/p>  <p>  There is a strong body of industrial relations law currently in operation in Ireland.  The Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2015, enacted just over 18 months ago, struck a proportionate balance between increased collective bargaining rights and anti-victimisation provisions for workers, while maintaining the voluntarist approach to collective bargaining in Ireland.  Importantly both main social partners had a direct role in shaping this legislation to ensure it would work in the best interests of workers and employers.<\/p>  <p>  Were all the main social partners consulted on this Sinn F&eacute;in Bill?  Were labour officials in the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation consulted?  Were representatives from the Workplace Relations Commission consulted?  If yes, I would be very curious to hear their feedback.  As the Fianna F&aacute;il spokesperson, I was not lobbied by ICTU or any other trade union, with the exception of Mandate.  I received three or four e-mails on it.  I received correspondence from Deputy Cullinane, who invited me to a briefing.  Other than that nobody asked to meet me about it and I have not received any big lobby on it.  I look forward to getting clarification on the consultation that was carried out in drafting the Bill.<\/p>  <p>  The first cases under the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2015 are only working through the industrial relations system now.  It would be premature to change this legislation at this early stage.  The 2015 legislation is progressive and has the capacity significantly to improve the rights of workers seeking to negotiate collectively with employers through their unions.  It provides an avenue for workers through their trade unions to secure improvements in pay and conditions when an employer refuses to engage in collective bargaining.  This means, in cases where it can be demonstrated that collective bargaining does not exist in a company, a group of workers have a right to a hearing at the Labour Court where they can be represented by a trade union and have their case examined.  In these cases, legislation allows for the Labour Court to make a determination in a dispute, which can then be enforced by way of a Circuit Court order.<\/p>  <p>  Ultimately, the 2015 Act will be judged by its ability to resolve industrial disputes.  My party will carefully monitor this situation and the need for any potential future changes, provided there is clear evidence showing that the existing industrial relations architecture needs to be strengthened in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  Significantly, the Bill fails to differentiate between unionised and non-unionised employers.  It provides that all employers, regardless of whether they are unionised or non-unionised, must allow a union representative access to its employees at the workplace at any time during working hours.  This is clearly not a proportionate piece of legislation.  The Bill fails to recognise the voluntarist industrial relations model operating in Ireland.  It is claimed that Ireland's voluntarist approach is key to our ability to attract foreign investment.  The Bill empowers a union representative to enter any workplace and \"monitor compliance\" with collective agreements and legislation regarding employment rights.  In effect, it could undermine the current functioning role of the Workplace Relations Commission.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200040#QQ00200","speaker":"1221"},{"type":"speech","time":1487784900,"counter":398,"content":"<p>Did the Deputy get his briefing from the Minister?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200040#QQ00300","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1487784900,"counter":399,"content":"<p>The Workplace Relations Act 2015 gives Workplace Relations Commission inspectors the power of inspection and enforcement.

Workplace Relations Commission inspectors may also issue compliance notices as well as fixed-payment notices to employers for non-compliance, which may ultimately lead to a criminal offence.<\/p>  <p>  There are also serious data protections concerns emanating from the Bill.

Perhaps we should not be surprised because Sinn F&eacute;in's anti-jobs platform is consistent considering its proposal to introduce a new rate of 15.75% employer PRSI.  An increase in PRSI would make it more difficult for Ireland to compete with other countries for much sought after investment and job opportunities.  These are exactly the sort of policies that are counterproductive at a time when we face an oncoming hard Brexit and are trying to attract high skilled, well paid jobs.  Initiatives such as this will repel future multinational investment as well as threatening existing jobs.  For every ten jobs created through FDI, a further seven are generated in the wider economy.  This translates to more than 300,000 people employed directly and indirectly in IDA Ireland supported companies nationwide or one in five private sector workers.<\/p>  <p>  As legislators, we must do all within our remit to sustain existing employment levels and create a regulatory framework to sustain high quality, long lasting jobs with the competitiveness challenges ahead.  With a hard Brexit on the horizon, this is a more salient point than ever.  Last month, the chief economist at the Department of Finance said that the emerging Brexit scenario could lead to a 33% reduction in exports to the UK and may result in 40,000 Irish job losses.  Notwithstanding this, we believe that immediate Government focus needs to be on doing everything possible to safeguard Irish exports and jobs from Brexit.  This includes transitional aid measures to the most exposed sectors.  Government action in this area has been sorely lacking.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill, if enacted, would have a detrimental effect on retaining the FDI by means of which more than 300,000 people are employed in direct and indirect jobs and affect our ability to attract new companies to invest and grow jobs in Ireland.  For the reasons outlined, we will not be supporting the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200041#RR00900","speaker":"1221"},{"type":"speech","time":1487785500,"counter":418,"content":"<p>In June, a Labour Party motion on workers' rights was passed by the House but the Government has done nothing to implement what was passed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200041#RR01000","speaker":"1349"},{"type":"speech","time":1487785500,"counter":419,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200041#RR01100","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1487785500,"counter":420,"content":"<p>The motion was passed by everyone in the House except those in government.  The foundation of my party is inextricably linked with the trade union movement.  We have argued throughout our history that the best means of strengthening the hand of workers and their unions is through co-operation of both organised and political labour.  This means that we have been unwavering in our support for workers when in government and in opposition, during bad times as well as good.  For that reason, I welcome this Bill, which the Labour Party will support.  It is a very well-intentioned Bill that seeks to put into law an important principle which should be available to all trade unions representing workers and seeking to meet them in their places of work.  It is a Bill that needs some work and there are some flaws in it that will need to be examined on Committee Stage.  There are questions about some of the language and generalisations used.  I refer, for example, to the continual use of the words \"reasonable\" and \"practicable\".  There are concerns about how enforceable some of the provisions would be in law and how they might be put into practice in real terms in the workplace.  In saying that, however, we will work with the instigators of the Bill, who are putting it forward for the right reasons, to improve it and to ensure that it becomes better legislation.  We feel it is worthy of that effort.<\/p>  <p>  Parts of the Bill could also be covered by collective agreements already in place between trade unions and employers.  That is something I would like to see thrashed out on a later Stage.  We have seen with the Tesco strike in recent weeks and the cack-handed approach by Bus &Eacute;ireann management recently that in many cases employers do not treat their employees in the way they should.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the Bill .  I also welcome Sinn F&eacute;in's recent alignment to my party's work in this area and its embrace of the workers' rights agenda which we have championed for many years.

I stand here as one of the few people who knows what it is to take workers out on strike.  A young organiser told me recently that he invited some fellow workers to join his union but they asked him why they would do that because they want to be promoted at some point.  There is often a fear of retaliation in joining a trade union.  Many employers have used this fear to drive down terms and conditions, increase casualisation and get more work out of people outside of contracted terms and conditions.  They are all threatening in the way they do that.  They ensure that there is precarious work and unions cannot strengthen the rights of workers through the tactics they employ.<\/p>  <p>  Since this Government was formed, efforts to improve workers' rights have stalled.  We have no Minister with responsibility for labour affairs.  There was an excellent Minister of State with responsibility for labour affairs in the previous Government.  The amount of legislation that former Deputy Ged Nash got through was incredible.  In the programme for Government, only two paragraphs relate to this area.  That is depressing.  The Low Pay Commission, while still carrying out valuable work, has not been given a new mandate to reach a living wage and has awarded only a 10% increase in the minimum wage for this year.  There have been no Government efforts to tackle the increasing use of precarious contracts.  The Protection of Employment (Uncertain Hours) Bill proposed by my party would protect against the use of zero-hour and if-and-when contracts and would support workers and create stable employment.  The place where the highest number of these contracts exists is over the Border in Northern Ireland.  The world of work is rapidly changing and yet we have seen no Government response.  It is easier for employers to impose non-standard terms and conditions and precarious work on low paid workers.  Low pay, insecure hours and enforced and bogus self-employment are all contributing to a weakening of social mobility and secure work.<\/p>  <p>  During the crisis across Europe and the developed world, many governments dealt with the crisis by cutting the rights of workers.  The Labour Party ensured this did not happen in Ireland and that is a fact.  I have quoted Jack O'Connor but I could also quote Patricia King of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU.  We restored the &euro;1 cut to the minimum wage, which was made by Fianna F&aacute;il, the so-called social democratic party, after its recent branding.  We then went on to increase it by a further 50 cent.  In 2012 we restored the joint labour committee, JLC, system through the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act and employment regulation orders are now in place for over 55,000 low-paid security and contract cleaning staff.  This has ensured these workers received pay rises over recent years.  From December 2016, contract cleaning staff will receive their second pay increase of just over 10% under the employment regulation order that the Labour Party made possible.  In 2015, we historically brought into law collective bargaining rights for workers.  We are seeing the benefit of that law now.  SIPTU secured a landmark Labour Court ruling against a sandwich maker in June with a &euro;2.12 per hour pay increase for over 50 staff at a company in Ballymun.  A sick leave scheme is to be introduced and a number of other benefits are going to all the workers.  SIPTU's manufacturing division took the case under the legislation which provides for binding increases in pay and conditions in circumstances where an employer does not engage in collective bargaining.<\/p><p>The Communications Workers Union was also able to use the legislation against a company recently operating a 999 call centre, and there are many more examples.<\/p> <p> The first new registered employment agreement, REA, was put in place for Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann.  Disgracefully, however, the management is currently ignoring it.  We will know how this will end.  As the crisis in Bus &Eacute;ireann unfolds, the Labour Party, again trying to be progressive, has proposed that it is time to look at a sectoral employment order for the bus transport industry in order to ensure that workers will be protected and that there will not be a race to the bottom.  We need to examine the workplace bullying legislation, the bogus self-employment legislation that is hitting small businesses and the self-employed and if-and-when contracts.  The latter must be dealt with.  We also need to extend the hours laid down under the transfer of undertakings directive and regulations, TUPE, to many other sectors, including the security and hospitality sectors.<\/p> <p> To end on a better note and in fairness to the Minister - we do not always see eye to eye - she has supported a Bill, which has passed through the Seanad, the Competition (Amendment) Bill, which relates to freelance workers and which protects songwriters, singers and performers.  She also supported amendments to that legislation which we will be accepting.  We will introduce that Bill in the D&aacute;il in the coming weeks and I ask every Member to support it in order to allow collective bargaining and negotiating on behalf of all those workers also.<\/p> <p> We will be supporting the Bill before the House and we hope to work on it in committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200041#RR02000","speaker":"1349","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487786100,"counter":430,"content":"<p>I want to make it clear to Deputy Cullinane that I do not show any favouritism in the Chair.

We believe it can improve the ability of unions to more fully function in workplaces where they have a membership base.  We believe it can be a useful tool against union busting.  When we think of union busting, we think of the United States of America where it is a multi-billion dollar industry.  We think of companies such as Walmart, Coors, Coca-Cola and so on, but we also have union-busting in Ireland.  It is nothing new.  We all know about 1914 and William Martin Murphy, but we have a modern brand of union-busting too, and we see that very clearly currently in Tesco where union officials have been banned from the premises.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister made an interesting point.  She conjured up a picture of 56 different unions trying to get in the front door, the back door and perhaps wriggle in the window also in order to try to unionise companies which might have two, three or four people working for them.  What about a company that has 12,000 workers and where there is not a single union official allowed on the premises?  Where is the famous balance in that situation?  This is a company from which unions are banned from putting their notices on notice boards and from holding meetings on the premises, such as in a canteen.  It is a company which rips up the contracts of its longest serving staff members without their consent and which engages in intimidation.  Let me be quite clear, this is happening on a nightly basis at present.  Workers, an hour before they ballot on whether to strike in their shop, are being called in by managers and told that if they do not have contracts, they will not work there again if they vote the wrong way.  If they have contracts, they are being told that they will see their hours being cut if they vote the wrong way.  What we are seeing is a campaign of economic terrorism by a corporate giant against working men and women in this country.  It is happening right under the Minister's nose and she is refusing to support legislation which would assist those workers.  That is shameful.<\/p>  <p>  The UK law firm Eversheds Sutherland now has an Irish wing.  The lawyers in that firm have been the top union busting advisers in the UK for nearly 20 years, and they are working with Tesco.  They deny that they are involved in union busting in Ireland, but it does take a rocket scientist to work out what is going on.  In terms of politics, the number of union busting companies in the United States grew from approximately 100 to a figure in the thousands in 1980s.  Such firms seem to be getting a foothold in Ireland under Fine Gael's watch.  In the US, the union busters flourished under Reagan.  Are they now going to gain a foothold in Ireland under Fine Gael?<\/p>  <p>  Fianna F&aacute;il deserves mention as well.  We talk about foreign direct investment, FDI, companies, but that party is protecting precisely those companies that come from a union busting culture in the United States and their right to try to deny the union rights of Irish workers.  When Deputy Donnelly joined that party a few weeks ago, he talked about joining a party of republican social democracy.  I do not see much of that on show in the debate tonight. <\/p>  <p>  There is a need for legislation to outlaw what Tesco has done in stopping the check-off of union dues on its workers' payslips.  There is also a need for mandatory union recognition to complement that legislation.  We will table amendments on Second Stage but the Bill is a positive step and we will be voting in favour of it this week.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200042#SS00900","speaker":"1281"},{"type":"speech","time":1487786100,"counter":438,"content":"<p>I want to have a go at the Minister because I am a member of the committee which deals with issues that are the responsibility of her Department.  On each occasion that an issue relating to workers' rights arises or when discrimination against workers comes to the fore, regardless of whether it is in an FDI company, the Minister always finds fancy language to use when washing her hands of any responsibility for jobs.  She is the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  When we refer to jobs, we do not mean jobs at any price.  What we are talking about are good, decent jobs for the decent people who live in this country and who we are trying to represent.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister and Fianna F&aacute;il seem to think that we live in this bubble.  In a way, the D&aacute;il is a bubble in which there is a belief that somehow we are all in this together.  There are those who support FDI companies, there are Fianna F&aacute;ilers, Fine Gaelers, the left and those who represent the workers and there is a belief that we all share the same agenda and are pursing the same issues.  We do not share the same agenda as FDI companies, employers such as Tesco, De Beers Industrial Diamonds in Clare and other employers that will run down workers' rights, issue them with if-and-when contracts, as Bus &Eacute;ireann is trying to do at present, undermine their existing contracts and try to break the law, as the bosses in Tesco are doing.  The Minister should have the latter in her office for breaking contract law, which is what they are doing.  They are breaching the legislation.  Those workers have contracts and they cannot be taken from them until they agree to a change in the terms.  The Minister, who has responsibility for jobs, has got to answer in respect of that matter.<\/p>  <p>  Fianna F&aacute;il has the biggest cheek.  It is the party that told us in the 1930s that labour had to wait, that we could deal with the issue of workers' rights and equality for ordinary people and that we had to look after the national question.  However, it did not do that.  It neither looked after the national question nor did it look after workers, yet its members put on the red shirt when it suits them and go down to the Luas pickets or across to the Tesco pickets and pretend that they are on the side of the working people.  At least the Minister wears her blue shirt and we can see her true colours.  The Fianna F&aacute;il guys are like chameleons and change their colours all the time.<\/p>  <p>  I say to workers outside this House that there is a big test coming down the tracks for both Irish workers and workers who are not from Ireland but who work in this country.  That test is to do with the Tesco strike.  It is a big test for trade unionism, the right to organise and the right to be represented.  We have to get 100% behind those on the picket lines.  I call for people across the country to participate in mass protests at 12 noon on Saturday afternoon at every Tesco store in this country on which there is a picket.  I ask them to support the workers, help them to finance their solidarity fund and ensure that they can win this battle.  It is not just their battle, it is everyone's battle.  It is a battle against the type of employment offered by a company such as Tesco that can made &euro;250 million in profits each year in this country, which it refers to as \"Treasure Ireland\".  That is the name the British bosses put on Tesco stores in this country.<\/p>  <p>  It is outrageous that we have a Government and a so-called Opposition that will say diddly-squat about it and pretend that they are all things to all men.  Ultimately, they represent one class interest in this country, namely, that of the boss class.  They do not give a damn about workers' rights.  They will sell our souls, not just their own, for so-called FDI.  However, the game is up in that regard as a result of Brexit and Trump.  The game is up on their low-tax economy and they had better wake up to the fact that there is such a thing as worker solidarity in this country.<\/p><p><i>6 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p>We will ensure, along with the Tesco strikers, the Bus &Eacute;ireann strikers and all those being exploited outside of the House, that this voice is heard and this House is forced to legislate for it.

It is vital and important legislation.  All workers should be entitled to access their union representatives at places of their convenience.  In most workplaces, this would be the shop floor of the place where the workers are working together.  It is vital that we allow workers to organise and be represented by people who know the ins and outs of labour law and can advise workers properly.  The relationship between workers and management in companies throughout the country is not an equal one.  The workers on an individual level do not have any power.  All the power is held by management and the workers need the support of organised labour to help them negotiate with their management.<\/p>  <p>  Many examples have been outlined in the House of the reasons we need this support.  Others have mentioned the Tesco workers and the disgraceful intimidation by management of those workers, attacking their right to ballot and to access the union representatives in their workplaces and forcing and intimidating them into voting against strike action.  Management should be forced to allow the workers to have free and fair discussions with their shop stewards and union representatives and to make free and fair decisions.<\/p>  <p>  Then again, we should not be surprised that the Government will oppose the Bill when one considers what the Government is doing and allowing to be done in respect of Bus &Eacute;ireann.  It is clear that management in Bus &Eacute;ireann wants to break the unions representing its workers and create a budget bus company in which precarious work, casualisation of labour and massive pay cuts will all take place for the workers.  The Government appears to be quite happy to allow this to happen.<\/p>  <p>  I note that the Minister in her contribution outlined all the great industrial relations procedures already in place in the country and how, in her mind, they are effective.  However, if they were effective, we would not need this legislation.  If they were effective, Tesco workers would not be intimidated in their workplaces.  If they were effective, Bus &Eacute;ireann management would not be trying to undermine union representation and attack bus workers throughout the country.<\/p>  <p>  I believe it is a policy of Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il to ensure the ongoing casualisation of work and creation of precarious work for workers throughout the country is pushed forward.

The Government's recent survey on income and living conditions, SILC, report backed this up, finding that 105,000 people in Ireland are now \"working poor\" - in employment but unable to escape poverty.  Precarious work practices are also rampant.  Ireland has the second highest level of underemployment in the EU 15.  This reflects information from the International Labour Organization showing part-time work here doubled between 2004 and 2014.  Bogus self-employment has also skyrocketed, a prominent example being the number of self-employed people working in construction, which has risen from 24% in 2004 to over 40% today.  In other words, almost half of construction workers are in bogus self-employment.  Under the Minister's watch, large and important sectors of the Irish economy, from retail, restaurants and hotels to social care, construction and farm labour, are being turned over to part-time, low-paid and precarious work.  One of the key factors in this is an aggressive campaign on behalf of exploitative businesses to keep trade unions out.  This is what this Bill, modelled on legislation already in place in Australia and New Zealand, aims to remedy.  It aims to give trade unions the right to access workplaces where they have members on site.<\/p>  <p>  In recent years in Ireland, trade unions have been physically removed from the car parks of hugely profitable companies such as IKEA.  They have been blocked from building sites on which their members have been seriously injured.  They have been unable to set foot on construction projects such as schools, funded with taxpayer money, where exploitative employment practices continue right under our nose.  I spoke yesterday to an official from the Financial Services Union who told me he had been denied access repeatedly to workplaces in the Irish Financial Services Centre, IFSC, where people were dealing with serious cases of work related stress.<\/p>  <p>  A number of years ago, the Taoiseach promised Ireland would be the best little country in which to do business.  I put it to the House that the Government has allowed Ireland to become a wild west for work.  However, it is not only Fine Gael that is refusing to stand up for workers' rights today.  Fianna F&aacute;il is joining it in opposing the Bill.  There are some Tesco workers in the Gallery today, fighting very bravely against an unscrupulous employer for their legal contracts to be respected.  Deputy Barry Cowen joined those workers on their picket in Tullamore recently.  Meanwhile, their union must carry out ballots in hotels and pubs because they are banned from the staffrooms in Tesco.  That is what this Bill is about.  Deputy Cowen now intends to vote for this situation to continue.  The Bill is a litmus test and a small but hugely necessary step for workers' rights, and we will find out much more about where people stand by how they vote on the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200043#TT00300","speaker":"1306"},{"type":"speech","time":1487786700,"counter":442,"content":"<p>I am delighted to speak in support of the Industrial Relations (Right to Access) (Amendment) Bill and congratulate our Sinn F&eacute;in colleagues, specifically Deputy David Cullinane, on bringing this timely Bill before us.  Deputy Cullinane also held an informative briefing recently at which representatives from some of our major unions were present and showed quite clearly the difference this Bill, if passed through these Houses, would make for trade union members.  I note this wide level of support across the trade union movement.  Those of us who have been shop stewards realise the importance of the Bill for the welfare of workers and indeed of the enterprises and institutions in which they work to ensure industrial relations problems and issues are identified and addressed early on to the satisfaction of everybody, workers and employers alike.  It is very disappointing, therefore, that Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il will oppose the Bill.  It was in this context that I introduced the very first Trade Union Recognition Bill in the Twenty-eighth D&aacute;il, parts of which later became law.  That Bill was introduced against the background of a ferocious campaign of intimidation against SIPTU and Irish Air Line Pilots' Association, IALPA, which were representing workers in Ryanair.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill before us is legally sound.  It is based on legislation in place in New Zealand and Australia.  It works very well in those common law jurisdictions.  We know that access to trade union representatives happens on a voluntary basis in many workplaces, but proper, structured access would help to avoid industrial unrest and, as I said, help businesses as well.  Voluntary access is just that &ndash; voluntary - and can therefore be revoked when any ripples of problems or unrest start.  For example, we have seen recently in the case of Tesco, as my colleagues have said, a business that was previously seen as a reasonable employer with a positive relationship with its main trade union, Mandate, but which has now limited trade unions' access to their premises.<\/p>  <p>  I am delighted to commend our Sinn F&eacute;in colleagues and to support the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200043#TT00400","speaker":"1361"},{"type":"speech","time":1487786700,"counter":443,"content":"<p>The Bill is entitled \"an Act [...] to allow Trade Unions access to their members in the workplace for purposes related to the employment of its members or for purposes related to the Union&rsquo;s business or both\".

I speak as an employer.  Any new law in this area must strike a balance between the interests of workers and employers by providing certainty and clarity for businesses while protecting union activity in workplaces.  We must be very careful because it is a very difficult time and has been for the past ten years since the recession.  We must all ensure exploitative work practices, where they exist, are challenged and ensure a sufficiently robust system of representation for workers.  That goes without saying.<\/p>  <p>  However, as I said a moment ago, there needs to be a balance, and that balance is very fine, very delicate and very thin.  Unilateral demands from union representatives to enter places of private business or work would simply ignore any legitimate concerns of employers.  This must be resisted because we cannot have that.

I have no time for them and what they do.  I am talking about small employers and the fledgling employers Enterprise Ireland supports to help the economy recover.  Unions have a vital role to play but membership should not be compulsory.  I would want very clear guarantees that the rights of non-union members will not be impinged upon by any new legal entitlements which give union representatives access to the workplace.  People have a right to join a union or not.  We cannot make that compulsory.  What if the workplace has to close?  What about the deduction of pay for non-union members in those circumstances?  Unfortunately, many have closed and will close because of Brexit and other reasons and issues which have not been dealt with by successive Governments.  They are not all Tesco or big multinationals.  There are serious problems in the way workers are being treated.  If a company has to close what will happen to non-union members?<\/p>  <p>  It is already extremely difficult to set up and operate a small business in this State.  There are significant and costly levels of red tape and regulations to be adhered to.  Deputies have no idea of the amount red tape and regulation.  Will there be another plethora of red tape?  We have all had the experience of over-zealous union members interfering with work practices.  That is not good and the unions would not want that.  It has happened and I have experience of it.  I have no experience as an employer but I am involved, as I am sure many Members are, in community and voluntary organisations and I am chairman of a community employment scheme which employs 17 or 18 people.  I have some understanding of work regulations and workers' rights and health and safety.  It is very arduous and people will not be interested in being involved in community development associations and social benefit schemes because of the threat of legislation.  We deal with the unions and have a good relationship with them.  Will we have union representatives on the scheme who will demand time be given to meetings with the volunteer board members who have to give up time from their own employment?  It is not feasible.  We should not be introducing further legislation which makes it even more difficult to run a business in a smooth and efficient manner.<\/p>  <p>  I respect and support Deputy Cullinane's motivation to protect the rights of workers from exploitative practices but it goes way too far and I could not support the Bill.  There is a parallel in the denial of access to those willing to assist lay litigants in courts.  That is a shameful thing that I have protested against.  I have been with some lay litigants who are not allowed in either.  There are many areas where people are denied support.  <\/p>  <p>  People and families are under continual threat of exploitation by judgments of county registrars and yet they are forbidden to have access to people who may advocate on their behalf but who are not in the legal profession.  I heard the King's Inns or one of those organisations advertising for people to become barristers from their homes.  That is badly needed but lay litigants need to be able to get help and support from friends or people who can assist them.<\/p>  <p>  The worker needs to be protected in the workplace but so does the employer.  It is not beyond our comprehension to accept the fact that employees can utilise union representatives to make vexatious and frivolous claims.  Most employees would not do that but it has happened.  There must be safeguards in place for both parties.<\/p>  <p>  There is a plethora of bodies responsible for health and safety, etc.  The Deputy invokes the Attorney General in the Bill.  The National Employment Rights Authority, NERA, was very antagonistic to employers.  It had far too much power and a plethora of officials in the good times.  Those officials could arrive at any premises and argue about the time the employees worked, whether before or after midnight, and about the age of the employees, etc.  I said countless times in the middle of the recession that NERA should be stood down and its name changed to one which signified that it was an employers' support agency.  We respect the workers but employers need support.  Who is going to help them?  Who will fill out their P45 tax certificates and pay their taxes?  What pensions do they get?  They have rights too.<\/p>  <p>  If we want our economy to grow, we need entrepreneurs and young people in business to employ people and go out to work.  We cannot have parties of the left continuously frightening off employers and foreign direct investment.  That is what is happening.  Some of those who have left the Chamber &ndash; not members of Sinn F&eacute;in &ndash; were lecturing employers as much as to say that we do not have a right to help on the picket.  We need balance.  We need to encourage employers and we need employer supports.  It is not all one-way traffic and it is a difficult and thankless job often to have one, five, ten or 12 employees and to keep the doors open, particularly when rates, income tax, wages, insurance and pension schemes must be dealt with.  There are more and more regulations and inspectors, flashing badges and books but none of them could run a henhouse.  They could not run a corner shop or a sweet shop.  That is what is wrong.<\/p>  <p>  Some aspects of this legislation are badly thought out and come from a totally different ideology that has no place in modern employment.

Similar legislation is in operation in Australia and New Zealand.  The Bill simply gives trade unions the right to meet their members regarding official trade union business in the workplace.  It seeks to bring balance to labour relations.  There is no such balance at present.  The Bill also seeks to limit the ability of employers to undermine trade union membership and the solidarity of workers.  What reason, apart from pandering to corporate interests, do Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael give for opposing this Bill?  Why are they opposing a fair Bill to protect workers?

I reiterate the view of the Minister, Deputy Mitchell O&rsquo;Connor, that it is only right that trade unions are able to represent and take action in support of the interests of their members and that our laws support that right.  The policy of successive Governments has been to support industrial relations.  Our laws protect our trade unions to allow them to go about their business of protecting workers' rights.  Protections from tort are provided where damage to employers results from legitimate trade disputes.  Protections against victimisation are provided and were enhanced in 2015 to include an explicit prohibition on any inducements that might be offered to have staff forgo collective representation by a trade union.  A revised framework for setting wages under the joint labour committee framework was introduced through the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2012.  The Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2015 provides a new statutory framework for establishing minimum rates of remuneration, pensions and sick pay, in the form of sector employment orders.  The 2015 Act ensures that when an employer does not engage in collective bargaining, an effective framework exists to allows a trade union to have the remuneration and terms and conditions of its members assessed against relevant comparators and determined in a binding way by the Labour Court.  This has been successfully used by trade unions.  The Government will continue to support the important role played by trade unions in our society.<\/p>  <p>  Unfortunately, the Bill before the House fails to appreciate properly the tried and trusted voluntary nature of industrial relations in Ireland.

Perhaps the opportunities offered by modern methods of communication should be considered.  In France, only elected trade union representatives in a company have unlimited access.

The word \"reasonable\" is strewn throughout the Bill yet there is no definition of what constitutes reasonable in the view of the drafter or, indeed, who is to be the arbiter of what is reasonable.  The consent provisions outlined in this Bill effectively mean no consent is needed.  The timelines are unworkable and the Bill proposes that the only grounds under which an employer can deny access to any number of union representative is if it is certified by the Attorney General that access would prejudice the security of the State or the investigation or detection of offences.  This is not a function the Office of the Attorney General can perform, which means there will never be a basis for an employer to decline access.<\/p> <p> The Bill also proposes that a union representative can enter a workplace to deal with matters concerning the health and safety of union members.  Ireland has a highly competent and specialist Health and Safety Authority that includes an inspectorate warranted to enter premises.  This Bill would cut across the statutory mandate of the Health and Safety Authority.  Furthermore, the Bill seeks to empower union representatives to monitor compliance with employment rights-related matters.  Workplace Relations Commission inspectors have strong powers to monitor and enforce a robust suite of employment and equality legislation and I cannot see how a statutory role for union representatives in this area could work.  Under the Workplace Relations Act 2015, inspectors are appointed by the director general, with the consent of the Minister, and they exercise such powers as are conferred upon them by the Workplace Relations Act 2015.  I cannot agree that it is appropriate for a union official to have a statutory function not dissimilar to an employment rights inspector and would strongly oppose any move in this direction.<\/p> <p> The Bill under discussion is not balanced and fails to sufficiently respect employers&rsquo; rights.  It fails to create a fair balance between trade unions having access to employees in the workplace and an employer&rsquo;s right to carry on business and survive in a very challenging environment.  Neither does it consider the burden the obligations it lays down will impose on enterprise.  What about the employer with one employee?  The obligations contained in the Bill are the same whether one employs one person or 1,000 people.  The burden imposed by the Bill on small businesses has obviously not been thought through.  The paid time off for employees and the administrative time which management would have to expend on dealing with requests for access would be costly.  All the obligations set out in this Bill are a direct cost to business.<\/p> <p> I have just touched on the more obvious defects of the Bill before us today.  Overall, the Bill does not sit well with our tradition of voluntary engagement and it ignores the unique make-up of our economic, social and cultural history.  I strongly support the range of addition protections and enhancements legislated for in recent years.  These have included significant enhancements to the protection of trade unions and their members through extended discussion and negotiation.  This Bill has none of the hallmarks of any discussion or negotiation between representatives of workers and representatives of employers and therefore lacks the balance required to make it workable.  I support the comments of the Minister, Deputy Mitchell O&rsquo;Connor, regarding further discussion and development of thinking in this area, including with the committee dealing with jobs, enterprise and innovation, with inputs from all sectors of industry.  However, for the reasons stated, I cannot support the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200045#VV00900","speaker":"1260","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487788500,"counter":459,"content":"<p>Deputy Adams is sharing time with Deputy Cullinane.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200046#WW00200","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1487788500,"counter":460,"content":"<p>Ba mhaith liom an Bille os &aacute;r gcomhair um thr&aacute;thn&oacute;na a mholadh.

This is an important Bill and I hope Teachta&iacute; will see that it strengthens the rights of workers by allowing trade unions access to their members in the workplace in respect of official union business.  The current voluntary system has worked for some but it has failed many others.  We all know there are employers who engage in campaigns of bullying, harassment and intimidation of workers engaged with union activity, and that must be ended.<\/p>  <p>  We believe in the rights of workers to organise, join a union and be represented by a union.  In a topical issue, Bus &Eacute;ireann management has sought to unilaterally cut overtime and Sunday rates, as well as stopping pay increments for employees.  In another topical issue, we have seen the shocking treatment of employees at Tesco, with the company refusing to engage with unions and trying to unilaterally cut the pay of their longest-serving workers.  We have seen this two-tier race to the bottom culture many times, which particularly affects some of the larger employers.  A successful employment rights infrastructure operates on the basis of equality between workers and employers.  That is what is needed and this Bill will assist that process.<\/p>  <p>  I am surprised Fianna F&aacute;il is not supporting the Bill and I did not know that until I came here this evening.  Surely the newly minted progressive radical Fianna F&aacute;il of \"Comrade\" Martin and \"Brother\" Collins would have been delighted with a Bill to permit the basic and modest right of workers to access unions.

I will get to some of that in a moment.  I thank the Deputies of Independents 4 Change, the Labour Party speaker and other Independents who spoke in favour of the Bill.  I also thank my colleagues in Sinn F&eacute;in who made contributions and will be supporting the Bill.<\/p>  <p>  I listened to the contributions of the Minister, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor, the Minister of State, Deputy Canney, and an Teachta Collins and the first thing I said was \"Roll on the day when Sinn F&eacute;in is in government and the day we have Sinn F&eacute;in Ministers sitting where they are sitting now\".  For all the talk we hear from Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael about not wanting to talk to Sinn F&eacute;in or see us in Government, I have asked myself why that is so.  It is because they do not think the same as us.  They do not agree with basic rights.  They do not believe a workers who is being victimised, on a low-hour contract or is employed by one of the multiples or a multinational company can be isolated and sometimes harassed and bullied by an employer and should have access to a trade union representative in the work place.  They have no difficulty, of course, with employers having the right to highly paid human resource managers or very expensive barristers.  I do not have a difficulty with that.  The Ministers and Deputy Niall Collins seem to have a problem with ordinary working people having the basic entitlement to engage with trade union representatives in the workplace.<\/p>  <p>  Some of the comments from the Ministers for opposing the Bill are laughable in the extreme but they have been outdone in the game by Fianna F&aacute;il.  I will go through some of the comments in the short time I have.  It is extraordinary.  The Minister spoke about balance but what has she done about the Vita Cortex issue raised earlier and redundancy payments being dealt with through legislation?  Nothing.  What has she done with if-and-when contracts and low-hour contracts?  Nothing.  What has she done with regard to trade union recognition?  Nothing.  What has she done about tactical insolvencies and not having the Clerys situation repeated?  Nothing.  She speaks about balance but she should tell that to the workers at Vita Cortex, Lagan Brick, TalkTalk, Waterford Crystal, Dunnes Stores or Tesco.  All those workers have been treated disgracefully by employers in this State because they could do it.  The Minister and Fianna F&aacute;il have allowed it because they will not bring forward any reasonable legislation to deal with any of these issues.<\/p>  <p>  We heard hollow words from an Teachta Niall Collins and it is quite clear he does not agree with the principle of the Bill.<\/p><p>If the Deputy had concerns with what the Government had called weaknesses and ambiguity in the Bill, which I do not accept, he could put forward amendments on Committee Stage.  There have been several examples of Bills with which we have had difficulty and which were brought forward by Fianna F&aacute;il, but which we supported on Second Stage on the basis that they could be dealt with on Committee Stage.  Rather than throwing the baby out with the bath water and having no Bill whatsoever, one amends the Bill on Committee Stage.  All I can take from the Fianna F&aacute;il contribution is the brass neck of those Deputies who stand on picket lines with Tesco workers to show faith and feign solidarity and who then come here with their hollow comments and fake concern about flaws in the Bill.  Deputy Niall Collins has a brass neck.  He has absolutely no interest in the rights of working people.<\/p> <p> The Minister talked about copy and paste.  We made no secret of the fact that the Bill is built on what is called the gold standard on trade union access in New Zealand and Australia.  I have spoken to trade union representatives who work the system in those countries and they say it works well.  Employers' organisations in those countries also state it works well.  I always hear from Fine Gael that the best way to resolve workplace conflict is through dialogue and discussion.  If that is the case, why not allow it on the shop floor, in companies and in the workplace?  What does the Government fear from an ordinary working person having an entitlement to deal with his or her trade union representative?  What does Fianna F&aacute;il fear from it?<\/p> <p> All sorts of concerns were expressed about foreign direct investment.  Many multinational companies in the State recognise trade unions and deal with them all around the world in multiple manufacturing plants.  It is a false argument.<\/p> <p> Deputy Niall Collins talked about ICTU, which has given the Bill its full support.  It represents trade union officials who have been thrown out of companies, who have been refused permission to enter premises to even talk to their workers and turned away and who have faced intimidation because of unscrupulous employers.  Many other trade unions have also given the Bill their full support.<\/p> <p> Deputy Niall Collins stated the Bill failed to differentiate between unionised and non-unionised workplaces.  This links in with some of what the Minister said when she painted a scenario in which 43 or 44 trade unions could be seeking to come into a premises and get time to speak to their representatives.  It is nonsense.  It is outrageous to put that proposition out as a credible reason for which the Government would oppose the Bill.  Trade unions behave in a responsible way.  Most trade unions operate in a company in which there is one trade union.  They do not overlap.  It is the nature of trade unions.  The Minister knows it, yet she throws it out just to muddy the waters and confuse the issue.  She knows it is not reality.<\/p> <p> The Bill is based on a model that works in other countries.  If there are flaws, why have those flaws not manifested themselves in Australia and New Zealand?  However, if there are flaws and if the Minister really has concerns, she could have addressed them on Committee Stage.<\/p> <p> The reason the Government supports the voluntary system is because it is a get-out-of-jail card for unscrupulous employers.  In his speech, the Minister of State, Deputy Canney, stated the Bill \"fails to properly appreciate the tried and trusted voluntary nature of industrial relations in Ireland\".  This is the same tried and trusted system that has resulted in disputes in Tesco, Dunnes Stores and all the other examples I gave, including Vita Cortex, Lagan Brick and Waterford Crystal, where workers' rights were trampled on by employer after employer.  Tried and trusted?  Spare me.  What are needed on the Government benches are Sinn F&eacute;in Ministers who will actually deliver real workers' rights for people, not what we are getting from the Ministers who sit there now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200046#WW00400","speaker":"1258","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1487789100,"counter":463,"content":"<p>Question put.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1487789100,"counter":464,"content":"<p>In accordance with Standing Order 70(2), the division is postponed until the weekly division time on Thursday, 23 February 2017.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200047#XX00300","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Communications Regulation (Postal Services) (Amendment) Bill 2016: Report Stage (Resumed) and Final Stage","time":1487789100,"counter":465,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200047#XX00400"},{"type":"speech","time":1487789100,"counter":466,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 5:<\/p><blockquote>In page 3, between lines 28 and 29, to insert the following:&ldquo; &ldquo;(bc) to undertake a review of terminal dues with particular regard to the requirements of section 29(1) of the Communications Regulation (Postal Services) Act 2011 and to report to the Minister within 6 months of the commencement of this Act.

As discussed on Committee Stage, ComReg already has a role regarding terminal dues and as recently as June 2016, ComReg published a review of An Post's terminal dues agreements in the context of complying with section 29 of the 2011 Act.  Terminal dues are rates paid for delivery of international inbound mail items.  The Minister is mindful of the concerns expressed regarding the impact of terminal dues on An Post.  In this regard, the Minister has instructed his officials to liaise with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to draft an amendment along the lines proposed by Deputies Dooley and Eamon Ryan.<\/p>  <p>  As was outlined on Committee Stage, the clear advice of the Attorney General was that an amendment of the nature proposed would create legal uncertainty and would likely have an impact on ComReg&rsquo;s existing powers under the 2002 Act.  More worryingly, it could potentially leave previous actions undertaken by ComReg on terminal dues open to challenge.  It was on that basis that I was unable to accept the amendments tabled on Committee Stage.<\/p>  <p>  Since Committee Stage, officials have continued to work with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to develop a provision which will go some way to addressing the issues raised regarding the review of terminal dues.  The result is the Government amendment tabled this evening.  The proposed Government amendment will require ComReg to consider any consequential impact of the repeal of the price cap on terminal dues as part of the review of the repeal of the price cap provided for in section 3 of the Bill.  ComReg has advised that it will continue to review terminal dues agreements against the provisions of section 29 of the 2011 Act.  Having regard to the Attorney General's advice, I cannot accept the amendments proposed by Deputies Dooley and Eamon Ryan.  I hope the Government amendment will be accepted as a compromise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200047#XX01000","speaker":"1314"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1487789100,"counter":472,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1487789100,"counter":473,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 7 and 9 are related and may be discussed together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200047#XX01150","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1487789100,"counter":474,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 7:<\/p><blockquote>In page 3, line 33, after &ldquo;appropriate.&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;The Commission shall complete this consultation within a period of 42 days&rdquo;.<\/blockquote><p>As we outlined on Second Stage and Committee Stage, we recognise that action needs to be taken.<\/p><p>We want to see An Post continue as a strong semi-State company.  We recognise also that the problems highlighted as far back as 2002 and 2003 were not addressed.  These issues, combined with the decline in traditional mail services, have created a lot of pressure on the company.  We must be careful how we do this.  We do not want to see long, protracted consultations.  We have tabled amendment No. 7 to put a limit of 42 days on the Minister in this regard and we hope he will accept the amendment.  We cannot see any reason for objections to it.  We all know that reviews and consultations can go on and on.  We must try to make things more efficient in the State.  An Post has to be able to sustain itself, and this is one of the reasons for the main thrust of this Bill as put forward by the Minister, Deputy Naughten.  To leave a consultation period open-ended would be a retrograde step and could cause problems for An Post down the line, no matter which Government body is given the task, be it ComReg or another body.  It is very important that they would have those time limits put on them.  It is important to protect the jobs in An Post and protect the five day delivery service.<br\/><br\/>I will now turn to amendment No. 9.  We have concerns about this Bill and have articulated these very clearly, especially the fact that ComReg is taking on the role of spectator rather than regulator.  We accept that urgent action is needed, as I said in relation to amendment No. 7, and I accept the current Minister was not in the post in 2003, 2004 and 2005, but the Ministers with responsibility at the time were asleep at the wheel right throughout the past 13 or 14 years.  I know that Ministers are busy but it is very important to maintain An Post.<br\/><br\/>An Post is a very important semi-State company that provides one of the best postal services in Europe.  Its service is reliable and people use it every day.  The company is a significant employer in the State with good unionised jobs, and we discussed workers' rights earlier in the Chamber during a debate on the Sinn F&eacute;in Industrial Relations (Right to Access) (Amendment) Bill 2016.  An Post's workers are represented by the Communications Workers' Union, the CWU and they enjoy the rights of trade union recognition.  Millions of euro come back into the State in PRSI and income tax from An Post workers who are in good steady employment and who provide a valuable service to us all.  It is very important that this is maintained.<br\/><br\/>This is the spirit in which we submit, and I propose that Deputies accept, amendment No. 9.  We suggest the Minister would have a role at the point when the price increase proposal would come to the Minister for final signing off.  It is a semi-State company and the shareholder is the taxpayer, represented by the Minister.  We are not talking about Tesco here.  We are talking about a semi-State company.  The Minister has a role to protect that service and to ensure we do not have runaway stamp prices.  We see the predicament the company is in.  We know a price increase is needed, but it cannot be a runaway price and we cannot give <i>carte blanche<\/i>to a company to do whatever it likes with regard to price increases.  It is important the Minister represents the taxpayer and this House, and that the Minister has the final sign off on a price increase in postage rates.  We ask that the amendment be accepted on that basis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200047#XX01200","speaker":"1232","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487789700,"counter":476,"content":"<p>I propose to take amendments Nos. 7 and 9 together.  Amendment No. 7 specifies a period of 42 days for consultation on the review of the repeal of the price cap.  I should point out that ComReg is the independent regulator and the timing of any consultation period would be a matter for it to determine in the first instance.  ComReg has advised me that it has very specific procedures in respect of consultation and these are set out in ComReg's information notice 11\/34A, which is published on its website.  I understand that the length of consultation depends on the complexity of the matter, what data or evidence are required and what data or evidence are available.  I am advised that during public consultation, ComReg normally allows four weeks for interested parties to respond.  Those responses to consultation are then considered by ComReg.  In the circumstances, it would not be appropriate for the legislation to define a maximum period for consultation.  In any event, ComReg has advised me that the consultation timeframe for the review envisaged by this legislation will be informed by meeting the deadline of presenting the report to the Minister, as required by the Bill.<\/p>  <p>  I will now deal with amendment No. 9.  The purpose of repealing the price cap mechanism is to give An Post immediate pricing freedom to enable it to generate additional cash resources in the short term while a restructuring plan is being implemented.  I believe there is agreement across the House on the urgent need for this measure.  The repeal of the price cap will be effective on foot of a commencement order which the Minister expects to sign shortly after the enactment of the Bill.<\/p>  <p>  This Bill allows for a review of the consequences of the repeal of the price cap mechanism after a two year period.  ComReg will report to the Minister on its findings within six months.  The Bill also enables ComReg to undertake such consultation as it considers appropriate in carrying out this review.  The Minister currently has no role in approving pricing decisions by An Post nor is it the purpose of this legislation to allow for ministerial involvement on future price increases or decreases.

The Bill was initiated in the Seanad and has passed all Stages in that House.  I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Joe McHugh, my predecessor in this role, for his stewardship of the Bill through the Seanad.<\/p><p>Baineann cumas l&aacute;idir le geola&iacute;ocht ilghn&eacute;itheach na h&Eacute;ireann nuair a aims&iacute;tear fosaithe breise barainneacha mianra&iacute;.

D&eacute;antar athch&oacute;iri&uacute; agus uasd&aacute;t&uacute; ar an gc&oacute;d sin sa reachta&iacute;ocht nua seo.<\/p> <p> The Bill will provide a modem regulatory regime for exploration and development of minerals, whether in State or private ownership.  In doing so, it will repeal a suite of Acts dating from the 1940s and replace them with fit-for-purpose, streamlined legislation.<\/p> <p> Before providing Members with the specific objectives of the Bill and an overview of the various elements I will set out some background to the minerals sector in Ireland and the existing legislation regulating it.  Minerals exploration and development is currently regulated through the Minerals Development Acts 1940 to 1999.  The exploration for economic deposits of minerals is carried out under prospecting licences administered by my Department.  The mining of any such deposit requires a State mining lease in the case of State minerals or a State mining licence for privately-owned minerals, which is also administered by my Department.  Exploration and mining are undertaken by private companies, although the Bill empowers the State to undertake prospecting.<\/p> <p> Ireland is one of the leading zinc and lead mining countries in the world and continues to attract high levels of exploration interest and investment.  In 2013, a report was produced by independent economic consultants Indecon Limited.  The consultants assessed the contribution of the minerals sector to the Irish economy.  Focussing on the year 2012, when there were still three operating zinc and lead mines - there is one now - the consultants made a number of key findings.  For zinc metal in concentrate, Ireland was ranked Europe's largest producer and the tenth largest in the world.  For lead metal in concentrate in the same year, Ireland was ranked Europe's third largest producer and 12th in the world.  In 2012, the direct output value of mining in Ireland amounted to &euro;426 million.  Exploration and mining companies contributed a total of &euro;56 million in taxes to the Exchequer.  The State also benefitted from payments made by mining and prospecting licence holders in the form of royalties, licence fees and payments - this amounted to &euro;9 million - as well as from indirect taxes and revenues.  Exploration and mining activity supported over 1,300 jobs directly during the same period, with a further 1,900 supported indirectly.  Notably, the jobs are in different parts of the country, as mining is a regional activity.  This demonstrates a broad contribution to the economy, estimated at over &euro;800 million when the direct and indirect impacts of the wages and salaries of workers as well as the exploration expenditure of the companies are taken into account.  Coupled with the support of over 3,000 jobs that are provided on a broad regional basis, this clearly shows the importance of the sector and its vital economic contribution.<\/p> <p> Given the significance of the industry, it is important to have in place a legislative framework that continues to attract investment.  Therefore, the development of a single national system for regulating mineral exploration and clarity on the ownership of mineral rights are vital.<\/p> <p> Currently, the minerals industry is regulated by the Minerals Development Acts comprising five statutes: the Minerals Development Act 1940; Part III of the Petroleum and Other Minerals Development Act 1960; the Minerals Development Act 1979; the Minerals Development Act 1995; and the Minerals Development Act 1999.  These Acts incorporated provision for regulating minerals prospecting and development, a statutory vesting of the exclusive right to work minerals in the Minister, subject to the payment of compensation; acquisition of other rights necessary for efficient development of minerals, subject to payment of compensation and payment to the State of rents and royalties from the extraction of minerals.<\/p> <p> The Bill will replace that suite of legislation, which dates back as far as 1940, with modem streamlined statutory provisions.  The existing legislation is extensive and hence we now have what I believe to be a comprehensive Bill, with a total of 251 sections.<\/p> <p> I am keen to make some comments on the scope of the Bill to be clear on what it does and does not cover.  First, the minerals referred to in the Bill do not include water, stone, sand, gravel, clay, turf, peat or topsoil.  Second, the Bill does not cover oil and gas, as the exploration and development of petroleum are regulated under separate legislation.  Therefore, issues such as hydraulic fracturing or fracking are outside the scope of this Bill.  In fact, hydraulic fracturing is not a technique used either in prospecting or mining for minerals.  Third, Deputies should be aware that in respect of environmental regulation of mining, the Environmental Protection Agency and local authorities play a key role.  Nevertheless, the Bill does take appropriate account of environmental matters, in particular, the need to address obligations under the Aarhus Convention, which has been ratified by Ireland.  The Aarhus Convention concerns access to information on the environment, public participation in environmental decision making and access to justice in that context.  The implications of the convention for exploration and mining were carefully considered in close consultation with the Attorney General's office and the provisions have been drafted accordingly.  Finally, the Bill covers the mining of minerals.  This refers to the extraction, or the development, of mineral deposits.  In the Bill this activity is also referred to as \"working\".<\/p> <p> The proposed legislation is built around a number of key objectives.  The first is to produce a modern regulatory regime for exploration and development of State minerals.  The second is to provide for regulating, in accordance with the principles of social justice, the exercise of private rights over minerals and ancillary rights, while reconciling their exercise with the exigencies of the common good.  The third is to provide for the continued vesting in the Minister the exclusive right of working, selling or otherwise disposing of private minerals that are not in the course of development, subject to payment of fair compensation.  The fourth is to provide for preparation and implementation of rehabilitation plans for abandoned mine sites.<\/p> <p> In modernising the legislative code applicable to the minerals sector, a number of key changes would be introduced.  These include changes in respect of the procedures for compulsory acquisition of ancillary surface rights, the basis for calculation of rents and royalties and the basis for payment of compensation in respect of private minerals.  The Bill will provide for greater transparency and predetermination of financial terms.  It will streamline the permitting process and bring other aspects of the regulation of the minerals sector into line with best practice, having due regard to the constitutional protection of property.<\/p> <p> The Long Title of the Bill is: \"An Act to make further and better provision for the development of minerals in the State and for that purpose to repeal the Minerals Company Acts 1941 to 1950 and certain provisions of the Minerals Development Acts 1940 to 1999, to make consequential amendments to other Acts, and to provide for related matters.\"<\/p> <p> I will outline a summary of the main provisions.  The Bill is divided into eight Parts.  I will provide an overview of each Part.<\/p> <p> Part 1 provides standard provisions, including Short Title, commencement arrangements, scope and interpretation.  It provides that the Bill will apply to all minerals within the State or within designated areas of the continental shelf and that, for the purposes of the Bill, as in previous legislation, minerals do not include stone, sand, gravel or clay, turf or peat or petroleum.<\/p> <p> Part 2 relates to prospecting.  This Part addresses the administrative practice for prospecting licences from application to surrender, including public notice and consultation prior to issuing of licences.  It also covers payment of compensation for damage or nuisance arising from prospecting activity.  It introduces a new type of licence, known as a retention licence.  This is relevant where a prospecting licenceholder has discovered a mineral resource that cannot, for the time being, be worked due to a need to address access issues, environmental concerns or other matters.  This part also provides for the Minister, in assessing the public interest of an application, to take into account the economic benefits to the region, as well as the environmental impact of the proposed exploration programme.  It provides for making regulations setting out conditions for a prospecting or retention licence.  A new requirement covers the manner in which prior written consent will be required for boreholes, trenching and bulk sampling.  Airborne geophysical surveying is a matter for the civil aviation authorities but provision is made to require prior notice of such surveys and the submission of data.<\/p> <p> Part 3 relates to working minerals.  The Minerals Development Act 1979 vested in the Minister the exclusive right to work minerals, with the exception of a small number of existing mines in operation at the time.  It also provided for granting of that right to third parties under licence, subject to the payment of compensation to the mineral owners.  These arrangements will be continued under the Bill.  It has long been stated policy that an application for a permit to mine will only be accepted from holders of a current valid prospecting licence over the relevant area.  This will now have a statutory basis.  The main thrust of the changes in this area relate to eliminating the difference between State and private minerals from the development perspective, providing greater predetermination and clarity of terms, financial and non-financial.  Previously, the Statute Book provided for leases to extract State minerals and licences for private minerals.  Now, there will be a single instrument, to be known as a mining licence.<\/p> <p> Part 4 relates to ancillary rights.  To extract minerals safely and efficiently, it is necessary to carry out a variety of other activities.  These are referred to as ancillary rights.  Existing legislation provides that the holder of a State mining lease or licence is entitled to enter on the land on or under where such minerals lie and use such land in such manner as may be reasonably necessary for the working of such minerals or for any purpose incidental thereto.<\/p><p>This gives too broad a scope by today's standards.  Current legislation also provides for compulsory acquisition of land and rights over land necessary for efficient working of minerals.  The Bill will clarify rights necessary for working minerals and divide them into ancillary underground rights and ancillary surface rights for licences issued.  It will also bring the compulsory acquisition procedures into line with modern best  practice.  I consider it necessary to have these compulsory powers in place, even though they are rarely, if ever, used.<\/p> <p> Part 5 deals with rehabilitation.  It is based on Part 9 of the Energy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2006 and deals only with orphan legacy sites.  It is the responsibility of current mine operators to properly close and rehabilitate sites when activity ceases.  Mine operations, through the planning process, are subject to environmental impact assessment which requires detailed closure plans with financial sureties to fund their implementation, aftercare, monitoring and maintenance.  Part 5 provides that, in certain circumstances, the Minister, having consulted the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, may designate a former mine site or adjacent land as a rehabilitation area.  The Minister may only designate such a site where a mine has been abandoned or where operations have permanently ceased and it is necessary for the safety of the public or animals or to address major environmental damage.<\/p> <p> Once an area is designated as a rehabilitation area, the Minister may develop or adopt a rehabilitation plan and implement it or authorise a local authority or the Environmental Protection Agency to do so.  This does not affect any obligation of former lessees or licensees who had been responsible for the mine site, owners or occupiers of sites, or any other person who may have obligations.  The Minister may recover through the courts any expenditure incurred in the implementation of the plan.  The Minister may, with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and  Reform, acquire private land, either by agreement or compulsorily, for the purpose of implementing a rehabilitation plan.  The Minister must undertake a public consultation process before making a rehabilitation acquisition order.  If considered appropriate, the Minister may appoint a hearing officer to hold an oral hearing to evaluate objections.<\/p> <p> Part 6 deals with the Mining Board.  The Mining Board has been in existence since it was established under the Minerals Development Act 1940 and adjudicates on various issues arising under the Acts, including compensation for private mineral owners.  This Part provides for the continuation of the board which consists of a chairperson and two ordinary members appointed by the Government on the recommendation of the Minister.  The chairperson shall be a practising barrister or solicitor of at least ten years standing.  Each ordinary member shall be a property arbitrator under the Property Values (Arbitrations and Appeals) Act 1960.  The provisions relating to the board are being updated in line with current best practice.  New provisions in the area of ethics are provided in line with current legislation regarding other statutory boards.<\/p> <p> Part 7 deals with enforcement and miscellaneous matters.  This Part mainly contains standard provisions, restated or updated where necessary.  Penalties in respect of offences such as unlawful prospecting or working of minerals are brought up to date in line with current practice.  Injunctive powers are being provided for continuing offences and in a case where the Minister might be prevented from undertaking rehabilitation work.  Provision is being made for the appointment of inspectors to enforce the Bill.  A requirement to notify the Minister of boreholes drilled for reasons other than prospecting or mining is a restatement of existing provisions in the 1940 Act.  The vesting in respect of intellectual property rights in the Minister relating to the processing of data collected under the Minerals Development Acts and the Bill is also provided for.  This Part also deals with the registration of minerals that were exempt from the statutory vesting under the 1979 Act and other miscellaneous matters.<\/p> <p> Part 8 relates to transitional provisions, repeals and consequential amendments.  It provides for various transitional arrangements, including the continuation of any licence granted under previous Acts on the terms under which it was granted until renewed under the revised legislation.  Applications for prospecting licences or mining leases and licences made before enactment of the Bill will be deemed to be for licences under the Bill, unless the Minister has already given notice of his intention to grant a licence.  Chapter 2 sets out the Acts which will be repealed by the Bill, while Chapter 3 lists amendments to other Acts as a consequence of the Bill.<\/p> <p> The Schedule contains a list of substances which, for certainty, are included within the definition of minerals.  The list is not exhaustive as the definition of minerals contained in section 2 describes the term as meaning all substances, including scheduled minerals.  It may, therefore, allow other substances to be defined as minerals.  There was a similar Schedule to the 1940 Act which has been reviewed with some additions and deletions.  For example, flint and chert have been removed because experience has shown that their inclusion was not helpful.  Mineral oils and natural gas have been removed because the 1960 Act provided for separate regulation of oil and gas exploration and production.  Other substances added are industrial minerals that were not important in 1940 but have since gained significance such as andalusite, garnet and sepiolite.<\/p> <p> Government approval for the publication and introduction of the Bill was given, subject to such technical or drafting amendments as may be agreed between the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment and the Attorney General.  My  Department has been liaising with the Attorney General's office in the interim and I propose to table a number of such amendments on Committee Stage.  I also propose to table amendments to address concerns raised by Senators during the course of the debate in the Seanad, in particular in respect of the treatment in the Bill of dolomitic limestone and, separately, the sale of small tonnage or small value State minerals, as provided for in section 82 of the Bill.  In addition, amendments will be proposed to give effect to certain obligations under the Minamata Convention on mercury which was signed by Ireland in 2013 and which will prohibit primary mining of mercury.<\/p> <p> I look forward to engaging with Deputies in a positive and constructive debate on the Bill on Committee Stage.  The Bill is important to improve and consolidate the legal framework underpinning the minerals sector which has been of great economic and social benefit in the past and will continue to be in the future.  I am happy to commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200050#AAA01000","speaker":"1314","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487791800,"counter":494,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for introducing the Bill which Fianna F&aacute;il will support.  The Bill has a long provenance.  It will replace five Acts dating from 1940 to 1999.  It was Fianna F&aacute;il in government in 2006 that initiated work on the Bill; therefore, it has taken some time to get to the House.  I hope we will get it through the remaining Stages in a shorter timeframe.  The Bill is very important in consolidating, simplifying and modernising the existing legislation on exploration and the extraction of materials.  It will make better provision for prospecting for and the development, management and control of the mineral resources of the State in the interests of better regulation and ensure that as many provisions as possible pertaining to minerals prospecting and mining will be consolidated.  The Minister of State has confirmed that hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, is a separate matter and not related to the provisions of the Bill.  It is covered elsewhere.  The exploration and mining sector is an important one and makes a significant economic contribution in Ireland, employing over 3,300 persons.  The overall value from the sector amounted to &euro;810 million, with &euro;56 million in taxes to the Exchequer in 2012.  Ireland is one of the leading zinc producing countries in the world, with output amounting to &euro;426 million in 2012, the last year for which records are available.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill consolidates five Acts, the Acts of 1940, 1960, 1979, 1995 and 1999.  As is often the case when a measure consolidates and tidies up so many statutes, the resulting legislation is quite long and weighty, but it has improved and simplified the legislation that preceded it.  It was a Fianna F&aacute;il Government that commenced drafting of the Bill in 2006.  At the time there were a number of discussions at the relevant Oireachtas committee in which many of the concerns that might have been raised were teased out.  A number of departmental officials also appeared before the committee.  Among the questions raised was one about property rights.  The evidence given to the committee was that property rights would not be diminished in any way by the provisions of the Bill.  There is a right to drill in search of materials, as there was in the 1940 Act, and this continues under a new prospecting licence, but it is regulated, controlled and limited.  Property owners have the right to object and have the Minister consider their objections.  Of course, as with all such matters, they have the right of access to the courts as a constitutional prerogative.  That remains the position under the Bill.  The processes are being brought up to date, but the fundamental rights contained in the Bill are no different from what have been in place since 1940.  The departmental officials gave this evidence at a relevant committee hearing at the time the Bill was reintroduced post-2006.<\/p>  <p>  The objectives of the Bill are, in accordance with the principles of social justice, to exercise private rights in respect of minerals and ancillary rights and reconcile their exercise with the exigencies of the common good; to provide for the vesting in the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment of the exclusive right of working, selling or otherwise disposing of private minerals not in the course of development, subject to compensation; and provide for the preparation and implementation of rehabilitation plans for abandoned mine sites.<\/p><p>The latter is important because there is some degree of abandoned mine sites around the country.  Their remediation, preparation and rehabilitation is key.  It is, of course, a national issue but no less than my constituency of Kildare has them also.  I would suggest that pre-1964, pre-planning permission and prior to the regulatory and environmental regimes that we now enjoy, standards were not at the same level they might be at today.  That sort of rehabilitation and remediation exercise is much needed and is a very important measure to take.  I look forward to its implementation, I hope when the Bill proceeds into law and is actioned.<\/p> <p> There is greater transparency of terms, rents and royalties to streamline the permitting process and other acts of regulation of the mineral sector into best practice, while again having recourse to the constitutional protection of property.  Environmental matters are, of course, more appropriate to the EPA and other such environmental authorities.  The legislation establishing the EPA, as I understand it, actually precludes the Minister from attaching conditions to mining permits, which may have been designed to limit or control emissions to the environment.  It might seem laudable, but according to the legislation setting up the EPA, the Minister is actually prohibiting from doing so.<\/p> <p> Of course, it must take account of the obligations under the Aarhus Convention,  which was ratified by Ireland and which governs the right of the public to participate in environmental decision making, their right to get access to justice and information and the exercise of those constitutional rights and protections as they are enshrined in the Aarhus Convention and in our Constitution.  The Bill will take account of those in its enforcement when it is passed into law.<\/p> <p> I will not go through the specific sections of the Bill, as the Minister has done that already in his opening statement, but I will note one point of interest.  I believe my colleague, Deputy Jackie Cahill, will speak about dolomitic limestone, and the Minister alluded to it.  It is a special case and the Minister has suggested he is going to look at it, perhaps on Committee Stage.  As I believe Deputy Jackie Cahill is going to speak on that issue also, I will not overlap.<\/p> <p> There are possibilities.  As we have said, many of these mines were felt to be reasonably well understood in terms of what deposits were contained within.  It was zinc primarily, but other substances and ores as well.  It is of interest to the House, the Minister and the Department that technology in this area, as always, advances.  Some of the mines, including ones I have spoken about, which may be in abeyance, abandoned or disused, may actually become, through technology, sites for re-exploration and reinvestigation.  This is because some rare earth minerals have recently been discovered in many of these sites.  I am talking about the type of minerals we find in the likes of an iPhone, some rare earth minerals that are quite precious.  Things like platinum can be found.  Often, I am told, these are found in what are called slag heaps, which are effectively the waste outputs of existing mining locations.  These may actually have within them a rich, untapped seam because it was perhaps not understood at the time of the original exploration what lay within.  It may be an apt opportunity to revisit some of those sites and to examine what is known within the industry as the slag heaps, which may contain quite valuable precious earth minerals, again within the confines of the Bill.  I think that would be possible.  I have studied the Bill and do not see anything in it to preclude that, although we may look at some amendments when it goes to Committee Stage if they are necessary to advance that.  I welcome the Minister's and other parties' views on that possibility also.<\/p> <p> The other aspect of that is it could be an opportunity to remediate such sites.  If, for example, the slag heap of a disused mine was to be revisited, with the goal of re-excavation and extraction of those type of materials, it could lend itself to a parallel rehabilitation and remediation of the site.  There are environmental benefits of cleaning up the sites accruing in parallel with excavation of potentially very valuable materials.  That is perhaps an unexpected side effect of it, or an unexpected opportunity that arises.  I want to credit Science Foundation Ireland and, in particular, the iCRAG research centre which recently discovered the technique that allows the further extraction of these minerals, which once were not understood and which it was not realised were there.<\/p> <p> As I say, I welcome the Bill and we certainly will be supporting it.  I look forward to further investigation on Committee Stage of the various issues I mentioned above.  I will yield to my colleague, Deputy Jackie Cahill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200052#CCC00200","speaker":"1323","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487792400,"counter":496,"content":"<p>As Deputy James Lawless said, Fianna F&aacute;il will be supporting this Bill.  The economic value of the mining industry to Ireland is very important.  In 2012 the value of mining to this country was &euro;810 million and we had more than 1,300 people employed full-time in the industry.  All those were employed outside Dublin which adds greatly to the importance of the industry.  My own constituency, Tipperary, has had the pluses and the minuses of the way mining has been regulated.  Lisheen mine, which was the largest zinc mine in operation in Europe for a number of years and is just a couple of miles outside my own town of Thurles, closed in the last two years.  The way the closure was carried out and the way the mine was left was absolutely exemplary.  They invested greatly in the local community and in local infrastructure, and are still endeavouring to get other potential investors onto the site to create employment.  There are plans in place to create alternative industry on the site that Lisheen has vacated.<\/p>  <p>  We had the opposite with Silvermines.  As Deputy James Lawless indicated, planning regulations were not as stringent.  We have a tailings pond in Silvermines, which still has not been resolved to the satisfaction of residents in the area.  It has caused enormous difficulties for years with dust being blown off the tailings pond causing human health problems and also problems for agricultural practices in the area.  Private individuals were allowed to buy the tailings pond.  The State has spent enormous amounts of money on remedial work on that tailings pond site in Silvermines and it still does not have ownership of the site.  This is something that I have brought up with the Minister's Department.  While the State has spent up to &euro;8 million on that tailings pond, we still do not own it.  Damage is now being done to the tailings pond again by the farming practices being carried out.  The State spent money on it and much of the good will be undone.  I tabled a few parliamentary questions on this and I was told that the purchase of that site is under negotiation by the Department.  I just cannot understand why a compulsory purchase order is not put in place so that all the money that was spent there will not be wasted.  This issue needs to be resolved.  It is has been a thorn in the side of people in that locality for many years and I hope it will be resolved.  It goes to show why a Bill like this is so important to ensure that in the future, it will be like Lisheen, that there will be a good taste left in the mouth when a mine closes and that the community and the environment can return to normal.<\/p>  <p>  As Deputy Jams Lawless said, I would like to raise the issue of dolomite limestone.  I would like this to be taken up on Committee Stage.  I have a presentation that I will raise on Committee Stage.  I think there is a very good argument being made that it should be outside the provisions of the Bill.  As it stands, it has been discriminated against.  To describe it as a mineral is probably stretching the definition.  This needs to be looked at.  I think it would be common sense to leave it outside the realms of this legislation.  It would be of benefit for the people who are quarrying that limestone and it would make them competitive with those in other jurisdictions.  To have it under this regulation would add significant cost to the production of dolomite limestone.  I would appreciate if the Minister would give consideration to leaving it outside the regulation of this Bill.  It would be a welcome development.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200053#DDD00200","speaker":"1350"},{"type":"speech","time":1487792400,"counter":497,"content":"<p>I welcome this Bill.  It is very important that we have legislation and regulations surrounding mining that are brought up to modern standards.  Sinn F&eacute;in supports the progression of this Bill to enact necessary changes that reflect the modern mining industry and licensing needs.<\/p><p>This Bill, however, must first and foremost reflect the needs of the State and wider society.  For too long it has been the <i>modus operandi<\/i>of the State to sell off the valuable natural resources of the country at bargain basement prices.  Were these resources to be correctly managed and safely exploited they could be of great economic value to the State and benefit to society.<\/p><p>Every day we hear that the health service is struggling and that we need money to build houses to house people and to update our infrastructure.  We must be mindful that the decisions we make on issues such as mining licences and royalty can have a great impact on how successful we are as a society.<\/p> <p> We welcome the Bill overall but will be seeking to make some amendments.  We have a concern over section 82 which allows the Minister to sell State-owned minerals without imposing substantial royalties to guarantee a return for the public purse.  We do not want a repeat of what happened in the case of other extractions which are not covered under the Bill such as our offshore oil and gas whereby we have transferred almost all profits to private companies.  We have experienced far too much privatisation in Ireland and do not want to suffer a repeat of what we have witnessed in other sectors.<\/p> <p> While TTIP is probably dead and buried with the arrival of President Trump in the White House, CETA is still there.  Such agreements could have the potential to obstruct our ability to use these natural resources for the overall common good.  Canada for instance, is home to one of the world's biggest mining industries.  These large-scale mining companies operating in Ireland would not necessarily provide any boost to either the local or national economy, would not necessarily provide much local employment nor provide significant royalty revenue to the State.  The Bill should ensure that any mining operation undertaken in Ireland provides the maximum positive impact for local communities and wider society while also seeking to protect the environment.<\/p> <p> The safety of mines is also a source of concern.  The State has a responsibility to ensure all mines operate to the highest safety standards.  There is a need to ensure shafts, site heaps, slagheaps etc. are kept safe for workers and the public.  It is important, where a private company or owner is involved in mining, that it also be compelled to ensure the site is safe and that the Minister have the necessary powers to enforce that.<\/p> <p> Section 132 on the designation of rehabilitation areas refers to a consultative process with the now defunct Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government.  It is very important that that matter is dealt with in the Bill.  However, is it the intention that a consultative process will remain between the now Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment and the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government or will responsibility fall entirely to one or the other?<\/p> <p> Pollution of ground water and soil contamination are a serious threat from neglectful mining practices.  We heard Deputy Cahill outline the situation at Silvermines where there is a huge problem.  That occurs as a result of mines falling into an unmaintained state of disrepair.  As a small nation where agriculture represents 10% of the economy and with a huge tourism sector we depend heavily on our natural environment and it is important to protect our ecosystems.  We must be extra vigilant in protecting our most important natural resources which are our clean water and air.  The State's influence and control over mining practices in Ireland have helped us to avoid any serious environmental damage from mining thus far.<\/p> <p> I agree with the Minister of State that the Bill seeks to update the legislation.  It is a big Bill running to 120 pages.  It is the largest Bill I have dealt with since I was first elected to the D&aacute;il six years ago.  It is clear that years of work have gone into it and we need to get it right.  However, the harmonisation of international standards could put this record in jeopardy with agreements such as CETA.  For example, International Lithium Corp. is a Canadian mining company that has carried out extensive explorations in this country.  Canada is geographically a very different country from Ireland with a population density that is 20 times lower than ours.  It is natural in countries such as Canada and Argentina, where ILC also conducts mining operations, with vast uninhabited areas that regulations on mining would be different and that there is less concern among local communities.<\/p> <p> However, Ireland's population is spread out more evenly across the country with a dispersed rural population, meaning that the impact on local communities of such projects is likely to be greater.  Therefore, we cannot expect companies like ILC to operate by the same standards here as they do in Canada.  However, certain Members of this House are creating this risk by supporting CETA and not dealing with these issues that will arise if not in our time in our children's time.  This Bill should have a provision to protect against any future changes to environmental or regulatory standards as a result of any such trade deals.<\/p> <p> This is an important Bill and we welcome that it has finally come before this House.  Some specific issues remain to be addressed which we hope to amend on Committee Stage.  We also have concern that limestone is included and I ask the Minister of State to review that.  I note the list of what is not included.  My understanding is that smokeless anthracite is included.<\/p> <p> I have an issue in my constituency regarding the colliery in Rossmore on which I have contacted the Department on many occasions and I have had a number of exchanges with Ministers on it.  I am informed that it contains significant deposits of smokeless fuel.  The area has a long mining tradition.  There are also significant deposits of fireclay.  Lagan Brick Limited needs large supplies of fireclay.  The national unemployment figures are improving, which is welcome, but in Carlow town and south-east Laois including areas such as Graiguecullen, the Swan, Graigueard and Ballylinan there are no jobs.  One can drive from Portlaoise to Carlow town and across that huge swathe of countryside and find that jobs are few and far between.<\/p> <p> There is an opportunity to tap into supplies of smokeless fuel.  Some mining is going on.  I know that there are issues, but I do not want to go into them.  I ask that the departmental officials make a determined effort once and for all to sort out the issues in Rossmore with the interested parties and come back to me on it.<\/p> <p> I do not want the environment damaged either, but I believe with modern mining practices, the fact that it is smokeless fuel, the fact that the fireclay is being used locally and is being processed locally, means we would not have a big carbon footprint.  It only has to go a couple of miles up the road which is of great benefit.  A lot of material is being used in this country.  Some companies are importing stone that is being brought on ships from China with a huge carbon footprint.  The Minister, Deputy Denis Naughten, the Minister of State, Deputy Se&aacute;n Kyne, and all of us here are very concerned about reducing our greenhouse gas emissions.  Here is an opportunity to ensure that locally sourced material can be processed locally very close to where it is being extracted.<\/p> <p> There is a need for jobs.  All the pieces come together.  We talk a lot about joined-up thinking.  The Rossmore colliery provides an opportunity to do that.  I ask the Minister of State to have his senior officials look at the case of Rossmore again and see if we can come to a permanent solution with it so that things are regularised, jobs can be provided, smokeless fuel can be provided and we can continue to extract fireclay from that site in Rossmore and create those badly needed jobs in south County Laois.<\/p><p><i>8 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p>Overall, we welcome the Bill.  It is a comprehensive piece of work but, inevitably, when we go through it, there are pieces we want to tweak.  <\/p> <p> My other concern is about the royalties.  Our party is very concerned about this.  We have a situation where in 2012, there was &euro;9 million, which is a drop in the ocean.  The 1,300 direct jobs in mining and the 1,900 jobs which are supported indirectly are good and we welcome them.  The fact is that with royalties, we are getting &euro;9 million.  There are tiny companies around the country in which there are only a couple of people working.  They are paying that in revenue to the State by way of PRSI and tax.  It is absolutely minuscule.  If we divide that out between the 42 companies operating, we are talking about a very small figure.  We ask the Minister of State to address that issue.  I do not want to harp on about this but if we look at what happened with our oil and gas, we know how it happened.  I am not blaming the Minister of State for that because he was not here at the time.  We gave it away.  Other countries have sovereign funds from what is being extracted.  Norway is an example.  We might not have the island gas that Norway has but we have some.  It is a separate issue.  We are dealing with mining here, not oil and gas.  Let us use this as an opportunity to ensure we get royalties from extraction.  Let us ensure the State and its citizens get what they are entitled to and let us use the badly-needed money from royalties and revenues that come in from this type of industry for the common good.  I appeal to the Minister of State to examine that issue again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200053#DDD00300","speaker":"1232","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487793600,"counter":500,"content":"<p>Ba mhaith liom bu&iacute;ochas a ghabh&aacute;il leis na daoine a scr&iacute;obh an Bille.  We should acknowledge the work of the officials in consolidating this legislation.  It is legislation that goes back to the 1940s.  We have to acknowledge it was no easy task to do such a thing.  It is important that we acknowledge the work the officials have done on this.  I will be very brief.  We are supporting the Bill.  I will add my name to the list of people who wish to raise the issue of dolomite and dolomitic limestone.  I have a submission and I am sure other Members have the same submission on the interpretation of minerals.  The Minister of State dealt with this in the Seanad.  There is a definition of minerals which attempts to provide clarity on where limestone ends and where dolomitic limestone starts.  The Minister of State has given some indication that he will deal with this on Committee Stage.  I will read an extract from correspondence I received:<\/p><blockquote>Section 2 Interpretation &quot;Minerals&quot;\u00a0attempts to provide clarity on the definition of where limestone ends and dolomitic limestone starts. <br \/><br \/><i>&quot;Section 2 \u00a0Interpretation &ldquo;Minerals&rdquo; \u00a0(f) dolomitic limestone that occurs in association with dolomite in a deposit where dolomite is less than 85 per cent of the deposit;&rdquo;<\/i><\/blockquote><p>My correspondent states there is a difficulty with this implementation:<\/p><blockquote>The implementation of what is Dolomitic Limestone and what is limestone is subjective.  Inconsistent implementation under the current Minerals Act has been very subjective where large scale Multi National Companies have exploited deposits of dolomitic limestone ...  This section had the potential for distortion of the market where one deposit is considered limestone and another Dolomitic Limestone. <\/blockquote><p>He goes on to say:\u00a0<\/p><blockquote>Examples of where dolomite products compete with limestone products in the same market place is in refractory production, (one company uses limestone and salt water in the production of high end refractory for furnaces without contributing any royalty, yet to produce similar refractory with a Dolomitic Limestone a royalty payment would be compulsory).<\/blockquote><p>These are issues that are familiar to the officials.  They are familiar to the Minister.  I want to state them for the public record.  If there is a mechanism to deal with this by way of Government amendment on Committee Stage, we would welcome such a clarification.  I see no need to delay proceedings tonight.  We are in favour of the Bill.  I acknowledge the work of the officials and if the issue of dolomite and dolomitic extraction is dealt with, we will be very satisfied.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200055#FFF00200","speaker":"1276"},{"type":"speech","time":1487793600,"counter":501,"content":"<p>I will call on Deputy Eamon Ryan because I am next in the slot but I am not taking my time until later.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200055#FFF00300","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"speech","time":1487793600,"counter":502,"content":"<p>I will not take long.  If the Deputy wants to follow me, it should not be a long delay.  I join the other Deputies in commending the officials for getting this Bill into the D&aacute;il, hopefully to be enacted in a reasonably short period of time.  It has been over ten years in preparation.  In my time as Minister in the former Department, I remember having a series of meeting with officials.  It was very interesting.  It was not deeply contentious but at the same time it was important that we got it right.  This legislation is extensive.  It will not necessarily affect most citizens but it is important that we order the development of mining in this country in a sustainable and proper fashion.  The importance of that was drawn out.<\/p>  <p>  I was interested to hear the update on the Lisheen mine today.  I hope it was closed in an orderly fashion.  We compared that with other instances, in particular the Silvermines site, which I am familiar with, where companies left behind a scar on the landscape.  There were huge tailings ponds that were unstable and I was concerned to hear today in the debate that some of the restorative measures that have been put in place may again be threatened due to land use practices and other issues in the area.  If the deposits there are exposed again and we start getting run-off into the water system of arsenic, cadmium and all sorts of pollutants, it will be of huge concern to people in that part of the country, in Tipperary and beyond.<\/p>  <p>  The issue is the extent and duration of the pollution that can be caused.  I will take the example of the Avoca River and the waters in Glendalough.  Many people are very familiar with the stunning Spinc walk around the mountains in our beautiful valley of Glendalough.  When one looks down, one sees that the tailponds are still there 50 years after the closure of the mines.  The Avoca River is highly polluted.  What should be a stunning and pristine river suffers from very severe pollution which is not easy to remediate because of the legacy issue of how mining was left unregulated.<\/p>  <p>  It is important we get this right.  It is important we make sure that mining companies are responsible and that we have the proper guarantees in the State that any work being done will be done with due care.  There are particular examples where we face difficult choices.  A famous example down through the years is the seam of potential gold deposits on the southern and western sides of Croagh Patrick in County Mayo.  We had to make strategic decisions to say it was not an area we would mine because it is too sensitive and too important an area for historical, tourism and cultural reasons.  It might be an inappropriate mining analogy to say that one often takes these things with a pinch of salt.  When people say they have discovered gold again, for example in County Monaghan, one has two feelings about it.  One might think it is a good economic opportunity but when one realises what a lot of gold processing requires there are significant instances where we will not exploit those mineral resources because the environmental costs are too high.<\/p><p> I have an interest in the way we will develop our mining resources because I hope the world will move towards a system of a more circular economy where resources are tapped and that we are not just developing a throw away society.  Particularly with the increased demand for many rare earth metals, we cannot afford to continue the form of mining that has been historic, which is exploitative and reflects a throw away culture that does not care about the environment, the life cycle, recycling and the precious nature of some of the resources.<\/p> <p> I would like to see in the Bill - whether there will be any encouragement for this as we delve into it on Committee Stage - a move towards going back on some of those old tailing ponds and looking at our entire system to see if we can start recovering materials, reducing the wasteful use of materials and promote the recycling of materials in order that we do not have to be so reliant on a constant trail of exploitative mining resources.  I do not know if we will have access to some of the expertise of the geologists the Department in terms of what the possibilities might be in that regard.  It would be interesting to see if we could stitch such circular economy thinking into the Bill as it moves through Committee and Report Stages, even at this late stage 11 years on since its inception.  The world is changing.  The understanding of the value particularly of some of those rarer metals is changing and perhaps we could return to our significant zinc deposits and other resources that we have not historically considered as valuable resources for use in our modern economy.<\/p> <p> I note the comments of other Deputies.  Our activity is not huge.  We have very large mines, including some of the zinc mines in Navan, but when we look at the volume of the turnover at approximately &euro;400 million a year in those valuable resources the share accruing to the State in terms of royalties seems disproportionately small.  That is another question we might have time to consider on Report Stage in terms of teasing out whether we are getting best value for money or providing too much incentive for development companies, despite the fact that the level of recovery seems to be low.  Historically, we have had significant mining industries here, including in Roscommon, Sligo and a range of locations in west Cork, the copper mines and so on.  It is not as if we do not have a geology that has provided rich mining deposits in the past.  When we look at some of the figures I have a slight concern that the State could be looking to get a greater return from our resources.<\/p> <p> Those are the details.  We agree with the broad thrust of the Bill and we will be supporting it.  I hope we might be able to tease out points I mentioned on Committee Stage but I very much welcome the arrival of the Bill in the D&aacute;il.  I commend the officials for getting it here and look forward to discussions with the Minister as we put it through its various Stages.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200055#FFF00400","speaker":"1294","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487794200,"counter":504,"content":"<p>I understand the members of the Rural Independent Group are sharing time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200056#GGG00200","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"speech","time":1487794200,"counter":505,"content":"<p>Yes.

It is a very long time since we had such legislation before the House.  It is important legislation but, like everything, we should make haste slowly and not rush it.  The background to this Bill is that the previous Acts date from 1940 to 1999 and include the provisions for regulating mineral prospecting and development and a statutory vesting of the exclusive right to work minerals in the Minister for Communications, Climate Change and Environment, subject to the payment of compensation. <\/p>  <p>  We have to develop our natural resources and with Brexit it is important that we ensure that whatever resources we have underground must be extracted for the benefit of the people.  We have lost so much of our fishing resources since our accession to the European Union and autonomy over so much of our indigenous areas of existence and survival.  It is very important that we examine this, that we have fair play and that we are careful that we will not have unintended consequences.  The Minister of State can correct me if I am wrong but I do not see any section in the Bill that provides for a review of the legislation and an impact assessment not too far down the road after it is enacted.  One would have that fear because previous Acts, namely, the Minerals Development Act 1940, Part II of the Petroleum and Other Minerals Development Act 1960, enacted two years after I was born, the Minerals Development Act 1979, the Minerals Development Act 1995 and the Minerals Development Act 1999 are so old.  These Acts incorporate a provision for regulating mineral prospecting and development; the statutory vesting of the exclusive right to work minerals in the Minister, subject to payment of compensation; the acquisition of other rights necessary for the efficient development of minerals, subject to payment and compensation; and payment to the State of rents and royalties from the extraction of minerals, with which I have some issues.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill will replace a suite of legislation which dates back to 1940 with modern, streamlined statutory provisions.  The existing legislation is obviously quite extensive and hence we now have what the Minister believes is a comprehensive Bill with a total of 251 sections.  Part 2 addresses the administrative practice for prospecting licences from application to surrender, including public notice, consultation prior to issuing of licences and payment of compensation for damage or nuisance arising from prospecting activity.  This is a very wide-ranging area and like other issues such as wind farms, wind energy development, major roads projects or whatever, a compulsory purchase order, CPO, can be invoked.  These are massive projects and while they are meant to be for the benefit of the people they can have major impacts on ordinary citizens.  This legislation introduces a new type of licence known as a retention licence where a prospecting licence holder has discovered a mineral resource that cannot for the time being be worked due to a need to address access issues, environmental concerns or other matters.  This Part also provides that the Minister in assessing the public interest of an application takes into account the economic benefits for the region as well as the environmental impact on the proposed exploration programme.  It provides for making regulations setting out conditions attaching to a prospecting or a retention licence.  A new requirement is that prior written consent will be required for boreholes, trenching and bulk sampling.<\/p>  <p>  The legislation does not say much in terms of providing for a community where the members have come together in the case of a quarry or in some development activity where explosives might be used, which creates dust and noise.  I have a plant hire business and know all about dust and noise.  One cannot make an omelette without breaking eggs.  I have been involved with local communities during the period I was a member of a county council and prior to and subsequent to that.  There is an issue currently with EirGrid where it is riding roughshod over a community stretching from Cork right down across Tipperary, parts of Waterford, Tipperary and into Kilkenny.  We have had sham consultations and engagement.  This legislation is not sufficiently robust to provide for a proper, honest and full consultation with communities from the start of the project - from the cradle to the grave.  Often the first a community hears of a development is when a site notice is erected, no consultation has taken place, then there is a row, all types of issues arise, and there is mistrust and distrust and that is not good for anyone.<\/p>  <p>  Sections of the Bill provide that the State must benefit from such activity, as I said in my opening remarks, but there must be gain for small communities where they have to put up with all that is involved in a mine.  I accept that it will generate employment and many people will travel to work to it.  My son-in-law worked in Lisheen Mine for many years and it was a great place but now it is empty.  That is a pity and it is a big loss.  It is an example of where there was good consultation, engagement and involvement with the communities.  When they moved out of that mine, they tried to set up a different industry.  I was involved in that and they have a fine clean situation.<\/p><p>This is a good example, but there are many horrific examples of rushed planning, strange planning decisions, numerous appeals to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, court cases, constant aggravation and improper rehabilitation works when the work is finished.  Therefore, we need to update the legislation but we also need to have it copper-fastened and draft it in such a way that there is a community gain as well.  If the community is paying, it is entitled to some gain.  This way, a good example can be created and can lead the ship in other ways.<br\/><br\/>The specific sections of the Minerals Development Bill I have raised in the past concern dolomite and dolomitic limestone, its inclusion in the Schedule of minerals and its definition under &quot;minerals&quot; in section 2, headed &quot;Interpretation&quot;: &quot;(f) dolomitic limestone that occurs in association with dolomite in a deposit where dolomite is less than 85 per cent of the deposit&quot;.  I do not understand what this means and I think very few people do.  It is mangle jangle.  I see my colleague beside me, Deputy Michael Healy-Rae, wondering whether I have gone a bit dotty.<br\/><br\/>The four following points illustrate why dolomite and dolomitic limestone should be excluded from the Schedule attached to the Bill.  This applies to ordinary quarry people.  I call them the backbone of our society.  They might employ ten, 20 or up to 100 people.  It is not all about CRH.  We know how powerful CRH is and how it has got away with setting exemptions and sometimes possibly infringing on the planning laws because it is big and powerful.  We see so much of this now with companies such as Tesco and EirGrid, all the big media companies and - if I may go there - the vulture funds.  I know where I would like to have them: in a disused quarry ready to be filled in.  I would make sure many of them would be inside before flooding it and covering it over.<br\/><br\/>First, is the definition subjective?  Can it be interpreted to include one deposit and exclude another?  Can the Minister of State honestly put his hand on his heart and say as much?  How can he?  I assert that this has been the case in the past.<br\/><br\/>My second point concerns all-island consistency in the treatment of dolomite and dolomitic limestone.  If a royalty is applied to dolomitic limestone in the jurisdiction of the South and the Northern Ireland Act does not include dolomite, there is potential to distort the market by effectively subsidising Northern Ireland producers.  We have seen this so many times, even with coal.  Deputy Eamon Ryan's - t&aacute; s&eacute; imithe now - introduced the famous levy on coal for the anti-pollution - I cannot think of the phraseology.  We saw how the suppliers in the shops, the people who were bringing it in here and the wholesalers lobbied.  Now what has happened?  They have all gone out of business because it is all coming in with no levies from the jurisdiction of Northern Ireland.  This is very important.  As I said earlier, this would stop the market by subsidising the Northern Ireland producers up the road who will now be more aggressive competitors than ever with the onset of Brexit.<br\/><br\/>Uimhir a tr&iacute; concerns unintended consequences, to which I referred earlier.  Dolomite and dolomitic limestone is the host rock for virtually all the lead and zinc deposits in Ireland.  Will implementation of the Bill into law place the existing mines in a position where they have illegally extracted another scheduled mineral not included in their state mining facility?  Has the Government copper-fastened this?<br\/><br\/>Uimhir a ceathair concerns a cost-benefit analysis.  In 2003 - a long time ago - the then Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources was asked in a parliamentary question &quot;the amount which has been paid in royalties over the past ten years&quot;.  The Minister's response was that &euro;140,539 had been paid, averaging &euro;14,050 per year, which was buttons.  One would not give that to children going to mass in one diocese, not to mind the whole country.  I question the cost of administering the State mining facilities that facilitated the collection of this royalty.  It is farcical.  I pay that amount in PRSI for two of my employees.  It is a joke.<br\/><br\/>The Bill has a number fundamental flaws, particularly in respect of the treatment of dolomite and dolomitic limestone.  Dolomitic limestone is a limestone rock with raised levels of magnesium with commercial values similar to limestone aggregate, and we all know what that is.  The interpretation of &quot;minerals&quot; in section 2 attempts to provide definitional clarity as to where limestone ends and dolomitic limestone starts.  It is a very thin line.  Again, the definition reads, &quot;dolomitic limestone that occurs in association with dolomite in a deposit where dolomite is less than 85 per cent of the deposit&quot;.  How does one assess this?  It is not really possible to make an assessment to such a fine degree as 85% versus 15% by drilling a test hole or bore hole.  This provides the lower demarcation levels between dolomitic limestone and limestone.  However, clarification is needed as to what &quot;dolomite is less than 85 per cent of the deposit&quot; actually means and how it is assessed and arrived at.<br\/><br\/>The sentiment in the section is noble, that is, to claim and recover to the State royalty from any limestone deposit which has a raised magnesium level, irrespective of the sector in which the dolomite limestone is used.  The difficulty with this is implementation.  Is it worth the candle going after this for &euro;14,000 per year?  What is the cost of the administration?  The implementation of law regarding what is dolomitic limestone and what is limestone is subjective.  Inconsistent implementation under the current minerals Act has been very subjective.  On the one hand, large-scale multinational companies have exploited deposits of dolomitic limestone without State mining facilities and, on the other, owner-operator deposits have had to attempt to obtain State mining facilities.  This section has the potential for distortion of the market where one deposit is considered limestone and another dolomitic limestone.  An example of a case in which dolomite products compete with limestone products in the same marketplace is refractory production.  Premier Periclase uses limestone and salt water in the production of high-end refractory for furnaces without contributing any royalty, yet to produce similar refractory with dolomitic limestone, a royalty payment would be compulsory.  This is very confusing.<br\/><br\/>Another anomaly concerns active lead and zinc deposits.  The host rock in the deposits at Tara, Lisheen, Galmoy and the potential site at Caherconlish is in all cases dolomitic limestone.  The base metals are extracted from the host rock, which is returned to refill the mine void space as a concrete, yet the current State mining facilities issued only levies royalty on the base metal.  It is like a merry-go-round.  It is very technical.<br\/><br\/>It is important that implementation is consistently applied.  Under the current Act, the implementation track record does not inspire confidence.  The Schedule of the 1940 Act also includes dolomite and dolomitic limestone.  However, the first issued State mining facility for dolomite and dolomitic limestone was not until 1969 - 29 years later - to Quigley Magnesite, with a second issued for a deposit at Stonyford, County Kilkenny, to the Irish Sugar Company.  The Geological Survey of Ireland published a directory of quarries, mines and pits in which the first three entries were dolomitic limestone, yet none of these deposits had or has a State mining facility.<br\/><br\/>A further inconsistency concerns the Department's exploration and mining division's six-monthly section 70 reports to the Oireachtas under the Minerals Development Act 1940 whereby up until 2013, the list of State mining facilities, SMFs, published had two dolomite entries which had expired in 2009.  CRH's deposit was and is still in operation without such a facility.<br\/><br\/>I rest my case because I am out of time.  One of the most fascinating aspects of the Bill is the length of time it has taken to be published.  Initial requests for expressions of interest were published in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>in July 2005.  One could write the Bible in the intervening time, but the Bible is a document on which we can depend, quote from, act on and live up to.  I feel the Bill is not a document from which we can quote, or of which we can be sure.  We should make hay slowly.  Why did it take so long for the Bill to come before the House?  Why is preferential treatment shown to CRH, while many small businesspeople have been forced out of business, demanding royalties and turning a blind eye to the big brothers?  The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission has been, as I said before, toothless, useless and fruitless in tackling this.  I hand over to my colleague, Deputy Michael Healy-Rae.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200056#GGG00500","speaker":"1347","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487794800,"counter":509,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak in this debate.  The Bill, in consolidating and modernising legislation on the exploration and development of minerals, is to be welcomed.  Deputy Mattie McGrath is right that it has been a long time in the making, but it is better it comes before us now rather than later.  We must have regularisation and the ground rules set out for future years.<\/p>  <p>  One deep concern I have is with regard to the mines that have closed.  I have always said that one of the most valuable and important things any small community can have is a quarry, be it a stone quarry or a gravel quarry.  This is not just because of the jobs and spin-off it creates.  If there is a mine or quarry in an area that produces materials that are needed locally, whether for the local authority, young people building houses or our farming community, it is an invaluable resource.<\/p><p>It upsets me very much that through planning regulations we have lost so many quarries in small communities in the past six or seven years.  It is a tragedy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200057#HHH00200","speaker":"1319","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487795400,"counter":511,"content":"<p>I agree.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200058#JJJ00200","speaker":"1347"},{"type":"speech","time":1487795400,"counter":512,"content":"<p>One of the most unusual aspects is that the planning authorities which, in many instances, were involved in closing quarries are paying the highest price for the fact that the competition is gone and they might be looking for material in south Kerry but may have to travel to north Kerry for it.  That does not make sense.  Long ago when county councils were building roads, they dug out clay from the sides of roads which became lay-bys.  That was common sense in action.  Now there is no sense.  It is all gobbledygook and regulation.  It is frightening to see how many quarries have closed because of planning issues.  In many cases the local authorities that closed them are paying the biggest price because they were major beneficiaries from having a quarry.  We have lost many mines over the years.  It is like losing the rural rail network and the odds of it ever being reopened are slim.  In England and Scotland great industries were brought to their knees.  The coalmines were closed.  It is a shame to think of generations of families who worked in the mines and how unemployment was rife after the mines closed.  There was no replacement industry in many cases.  That was a tragedy of the past 20 years.<\/p><p>Deputy Mattie McGrath, rightly, spoke about the spin-offs for communities.  I have studied the Indecon report which states: <\/p><blockquote>In addition to creating and supporting jobs and expenditures at local level in Ireland, exploration and mining companies also contribute to local communities in the form of financial supports to community sporting and other organisations. According to the findings of Indecon's research, mining and prospecting companies contributed a total of almost &euro;460,000 to local community activities and organisations during 2012. <\/blockquote><p>It is a small sum of money compared to what the industry is worth and the money it has made, although any money spent and contributed at local level is welcome. <\/p><p>The issue of fracking was debated here and many politicians, me included, were very concerned about it.  We did not want to see the country allowing it to happen ever because of its consequences for communities.  I would be very fearful for the mining industry in Border counties post-Brexit.  There will be major implications and transitional changes because of it.  It will affect employment and the operations of quarries.  I hope, however, that it will not be to the detriment of any mine or cause them to close.  I welcome the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200058#JJJ00300","speaker":"1319"},{"type":"speech","time":1487795400,"counter":513,"content":"<p>Like other speakers, I welcome the Bill in the sense that it updates, consolidates and modernises legislation on exploration and the extraction of minerals.  It is welcome that it provides for the continuing vesting in the Minister of the exclusive right to work minerals, subject to certain exceptions.  It also provides for the remediation of abandoned mines, which I welcome, and for the prosecution of summary offences.  It also deals with compensation and its calculation and so on.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill provides that royalty rates will be set by the Minister, as one or two other speakers mentioned.  It provides that a licence is granted for eight years, about which I have some questions.  It is welcome that the Bill aims to implement international environmental legal obligations by providing for public participation and access to justice provisions for members of the public, taking account of the Aarhus Convention.  People have fought for years for the convention to be implemented in domestic legislation.  I welcome that and the procedural steps taken, although I wonder if it is strong enough.  I will come back to this issue through amendments on Committee Stage to ensure it will be fully implemented to have the maximum rights to allow people participate.  <\/p>  <p>  While we are no experts in the D&aacute;il, I wonder if we should rewrite our geography classes and tell teachers the same.  The Minister of State is younger than me, but as most of us grew up we were told constantly that we had no resources in this country.  I have taken great trouble to read the Bill digest.  I thank those who prepared it and put a great deal of work into it.  It is heart-inspiring to see the amount of our natural resources, yet we have proceeded as a country that has none.  The ones we thought we had in County Mayo we sold and we learned no lessons from it.  The best part of the Bill is to come on Committee Stage in the form of an acknowledgement that the country is rich in resources.  That message has to go out and we have to begin to act like a country that is rich in natural resources.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland is the biggest producer of zinc in Europe and the tenth largest in the world.  I did not learn that at school and neither did my children who are aged 19 and 20 years.  We are also high producers of lead, but there are many other minerals.  As I said, Ireland is a leading producer of zinc and lead; it supplies 28% of Europe's zinc and 10% of its lead, meaning that it is ranked 12th.  Ireland is ranked No. 1 for the amount of zinc extracted per square kilometre.  In addition, other commodities currently sought in Ireland include gold, silver, copper, iron, platinum, tungsten which is very important in the production of saws and tools, lithium, calcium and so on.  Fifteen mines have been discovered since 1960 and five or six are still in use.<\/p>  <p>  The Fraser Institute gave Ireland top rating for policy jurisdiction factors.  Is that because we have an easy policy on the payment of royalties and tax?  That is the reason I understand, but I will put my hands up if I am wrong.  That is my learned experience from watching what happened in County Mayo.  <\/p>  <p>  I know that oil and gas are not covered under this legislation.  As part of its policy, the Government will be obliged to lay a report before the Oireachtas every six months on the operation of the legislation.  I welcome the continuance of that provision as part of the legislation.  However, such a report has never been discussed in my time in this House and I will have been elected one year ago, like the Minister of State, at the end of this month.  It give up-to-date figures in terms of who is involved in the industry.<\/p><p>The most recent report reveals that \"as of 31 December 2016, there were 10 extant State Mining Leases [and] 6 extant State Mining Licences\".  I know this legislation will change the duplication there.  The report also states that on the same date, \"567 extant Prospecting Licences\" were held by 46 companies.  Towards the end of the report, we learn that \"the total amount of moneys collected by the Minister under or by virtue of any lease, permission, or licence under [the Minerals Development] Acts was &euro;5,477,575.49\".  That is the total money taken in.  I know that there are separate moneys collected as tax.  It is estimated that this comes to approximately &euro;60 million.  This report has not come the House for discussion.  If such a debate were held, Deputies would educate themselves about these matters and work with the Government to ensure the best return is secured on behalf of the citizens of this country, which is rich in natural resources.<\/p> <p> Page 2 of the most recent biannual report lists all those who were involved in mining at the end of December 2016.  It refers to once-off payments made \"in lieu of Royalties\".  In other words, no royalties were paid in these cases.  It happens that Tara Mines Limited is mentioned on more than one occasion on this page, which states that the company has a licence to engage in mining from \"3 July 1998 to 30 November 2023\".  Among the various \"considerations\" referred to on page 2 - no royalties are being paid - are amounts of &euro;190,460, or just under &euro;200,000, and of &euro;1,050,000.  Each \"once off payment [made] in lieu of Royalties\" relates to a different area near Navan, County Meath, in which Tara Mines is engaged in mining activity.  The royalties vary enormously.  I think it would be very helpful to have a discussion on this report, which was theoretically laid before the Houses at Christmas but has never been discussed here, in the D&aacute;il in order that we can see where we are going with the new-found information we have about Ireland as a mineral-rich country.<\/p> <p> The Indecon report mentioned by the Minister of State was published some years ago.  It seems to have had positive things to say about the moneys returned to the economy from this activity.  How do we judge that?  In what context can it be judged?  What country should we look at so that we can make a reasoned judgment on how best to use our resources to bring in money that can be spent on the provision of proper public services?  I think this real debate needs to take place very soon.  It seems to me that the Government is constantly left with messes to clean up without any money coming back.  Even though the Shell to Sea protestors were demonised year after year, the fact is that every single safety issue resulted from their work on the ground in forcing change and improvements.  All the safety improvements resulted from the work of people on the ground.<\/p> <p> We need to have a debate in this context on how we can encourage companies to engage in mining in Ireland, while at the same time ensuring we get a return on that activity.  How do we judge that?  What countries have we looked at to learn lessons from them?  While I welcome this legislation, as I have said, I would not be happy that we are learning from the debacles of previous years.  Are we going to continue to be left with the mess?  I welcome the section of this Bill on cleaning up abandoned mines.  As I have said, the Government collected just over &euro;5 million under the Minerals Development Acts last year.  That is a tiny amount of money in the context of what it costs the Government to clean up abandoned mines.  The non-payment of royalties, to which I have also referred, must also be considered in this context.  Who is making the decisions to reach these agreements, and on the basis of what criteria?  As I mentioned earlier, the most recent biannual report contained successive references to once-off payments being made \"in lieu of Royalties\".  How is that judged?  We need to reflect on what have we learned from that before we give out any more long licences.  As I mentioned earlier, some of the current licences take us up to 2023.  In one case, the licence will not expire until 2034.  I suggest the question of why such long-term licences are necessary should be considered on Committee Stage.<\/p> <p> According to a section of the digest that quotes from research, \"Ireland is described as being \"richly endowed with a diversity of mineral deposits, with a mining heritage extending for over 4,000 years\".\"  The increase in the number of licences being given out is a reflection of that.  Deputy Lawless of Fianna F&aacute;il referred to the huge possibilities associated with what Science Foundation Ireland has told us about the reuse of mines.  Are we going to learn from that?  I think the best way to facilitate that would be to ensure the biannual reports are brought before the D&aacute;il for open discussion.  This legislation can be considered separately on Committee Stage.  We need to share in the decision-making process on the basis that we have learned from previous messes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200058#JJJ00400","speaker":"1316","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487796000,"counter":515,"content":"<p>I thank all the Deputies who participated in this debate and, in general, expressed their support for this Bill to be advanced to Committee Stage.  I appreciate that a number of items will have to be discussed at that point.  As Minister of State with responsibility for the minerals sector which makes a significant contribution to the economy, I wish to maintain and promote a minerals industry that is sustainable and contributes to jobs and economic growth.  Importantly, the jobs in this sector are based in the regions.  The mining sector makes a significant contribution to many rural areas and local economies.  To that end, it is important to have in place a modern statutory code that is suitable for the effective stewardship and development of the sector and fosters the discovery of new deposits.  Ireland has a good record in the discovery and development of mineral deposits, especially zinc.  It is one of the world's leading zinc-mining countries and continues to attract significant levels of exploration expenditure.  However, the minerals industry is global in nature.  As a consequence, we know that a clear set of rules is needed to attract international investment.  That is what this Bill aims to achieve.  It marks a major advance for this sector and will ensure the model is fit for purpose for the years ahead.  As I said earlier, I look forward to engaging with Deputies on Committee Stage.<\/p>  <p>  I will go through a few of the comments that were made.  I thank Deputy James Lawless for expressing Fianna F&aacute;il's support for this Bill.  Like Deputy Jackie Cahill, he gave the House an overview of the contribution of mining to the economy.  He mentioned some mining sites.  We can explore those matters further on Committee Stage.  I remind him that the rehabilitation fund for newer developments supports the rehabilitation cost to the State.  Clearly, there are also older abandoned mines.<\/p>  <p>  A number of Deputies, including Deputies dJames Lawless and Eamon Ryan, referred to the possibility of looking at old mines, mining sites and slag heaps to see whether there are other precious resources at those locations.  We might examine best practice in other countries in this regard in advance of Committee Stage.<\/p>  <p>  As I said at the outset, fracking is outside the scope of this Bill because hydraulic fracturing is not a technique used in prospecting or mining for minerals.  The definition of \"minerals\" in section 2 of the Bill encompasses \"extractive waste\".<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Jackie Cahill spoke about the contribution of mining to the economy with specific reference to Lisheen Mine, which was an exemplary operation.  The mine ceased to operate, after 15 years in operation, in 2015 when all the ore had been mined.  The Department is working closely with the Environmental Protection Agency, Tipperary County Council and other regulatory authorities to ensure the fulfilment of all statutory and planning obligations in relation to closure and aftercare at Lisheen.  The mine will be closed in accordance with global best practice in mine closure.  The mine is currently in the active phase of its closure plan.  The mine is being deactivated and rehabilitated over a five-year period.  The closure plan is well advanced with the mine sealed and the area rewatered.  The majority of the tailings management facility has been capped and vegetated.  Mine buildings have been removed and the land rehabilitated.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Jackie Cahill also spoke about the extensive former mining site at Silvermines, which includes some areas covered by a mining lease which expired in 1998.  The former lessee, Mogul of Ireland Limited, was responsible for the rehabilitation of the areas covered by the lease.  Despite working continuously with the company, the Department eventually concluded that the company did not have the finance or expertise to carry out a remediation programme.<\/p><p>An extensive programme of remediation works at five of the six identified former mining sites at Silvermines, County Tipperary, was undertaken from 2007 and by the end of 2013, expenditure amounted to &euro;11.19 million.  The Gortmore TMF facility was the largest site remediated at a cost of &euro;6 million, with this work including drawing up proposals for future maintenance, having regard to the nature of the site, and a decision was taken to take the site into public ownership.<\/p> <p> A number of Deputies mentioned dolomite, with Deputy Jackie Cahill the first to do so.  It was also mentioned by Deputies Brian Stanley, Sean Sherlock, Michael Healy-Rae and Mattie McGrath.  It is proposed to introduce a Government amendment on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il to delete reference to dolomitic limestone entirely in the definition of minerals in section 2 and the Schedule to the Bill.  Dolomitic limestone will therefore be treated in a similar manner to limestone and will no longer be a scheduled mineral under the Minerals Development Act.<\/p> <p> Deputy Brian Stanley also raised the issue of section 82 in speaking about privatisation.  On Report Stage in the Seanad, the Minister of State, Deputy Joe McHugh, accepted the Opposition amendment to delete section 82 but for procedural reasons, the amendment fell.  It is proposed to introduce a Government amendment on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il to effect the deletion of section 82.  I also agree with Deputy Stanley that mineral development offers opportunities for employment in rural areas.  Large companies are subject to royalties, as Deputy Cahill and others noted.  Lisheen, which is operated by a large company, contributed to the local economy as well as to the State.  A number of Deputies mentioned royalties and section 76(5) of the Bill requires the Minister to review royalty regulations every eight years.  I do not want to comment on the issues with Rossmore as there is an investigation of offences under the Minerals Development Act, with a file sent to the Office of the Chief State Solicitor.<\/p> <p> We will address Deputy Sean Sherlock's concerns and amendment on Committee Stage.  He also thanked the officials, which I do also, for their work in framing the Bill.  I acknowledge the role of Deputy Eamon Ryan as a former Minister.  The definition of minerals includes extractive waste and we share the Deputy's concerns about exploiting minerals in a sustainable manner.  The Deputy also spoke about the old tailings ponds, recycling of materials and royalties.  <\/p> <p> To respond to Deputy Mattie McGrath, section 76(5) of the Bill requires the Minister to review royalty regulations every eight years.  Planning for a mine goes through the full local authority planning process, as well as Environmental Protection Agency processes.  The Deputy mentioned air and water.  Both Lisheen and Galmoy mines had community gain with the development aspects and companies did that voluntarily.  The Deputy also raised the issue of dolomite, which has been addressed, with the relevant portion to be deleted on Committee Stage.<\/p> <p> As I indicated in my opening statement, the minerals referred to in this Bill do not include water, stone, sand, gravel, clay, turf, peat or topsoil.  Deputies mentioned issues relating to quarries that do not come under the scope of this legislation but fall under planning regulations in local authorities.  <\/p> <p> To respond to Deputy Catherine Connolly, royalties were previously set on a case-by-case basis, with some set decades ago.  This Bill sets uniform royalty rates for future developments.  Under new mining licences, there are remediation funds for the remediation of old mines, although I accept there are significant historical problems that must be remediated.  Again, we can explore those issues on Committee Stage, although I am not sure we will have scope to pursue the report suggested by the Deputy.  She could contact the Chairman of the committee to explore it at another stage in advance.<\/p> <p> With regard to the Aarhus Convention, there has been close consultation with the Attorney General's office and the provisions of the Bill in this regard have been drafted accordingly.  We can explore that on Committee Stage.  The Fraser Institute rankings focused on clarity and transparency of the regulatory system rather than fiscal return and infrastructure, although I know where the Deputy is coming from with regard to royalties.  We can explore that issue on Committee Stage also.  <\/p> <p> I thank all Deputies for their contributions and look forward to further debate and engagement on Committee Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200059#KKK00200","speaker":"1314","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1487796600,"counter":517,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Minerals Development Bill 2015 [Seanad]: Referral to Select Committee","time":1487796600,"counter":518,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200060#LLL00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1487796600,"counter":519,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p><blockquote>That the Bill be referred to the Select Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment pursuant to Standing Orders 84A(3)(<i>a<\/i>) and 149(1).<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200060#LLL00400","speaker":"1314"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1487796600,"counter":520,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2016: Second Stage (Resumed)","time":1487796600,"counter":521,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200060#LLL00600"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1487796600,"counter":522,"content":"<p>Question again proposed: &quot;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&quot;<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1487796600,"counter":523,"content":"<p>When we last discussed the Bill I was posing a series of questions on the preparation and implementation of the UN convention to the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath.  I will add a couple of other issues to that.  Will he outline in his response if there has been any formal structured consultation process with civil society, and specifically with people with disabilities, since the publication of the roadmap to ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in October 2015 to inform the Bill?  We were supplied with documents from the likes of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission with observations on the general scheme of the Bill.  The Minister of State might remember that early in this D&aacute;il we had a meeting of campaigners for disability rights in Dublin Bay North, organised by, among others, the great Mr. Martin Naughton, who sadly passed away subsequently.  The Minister of State was not present that night but the issues arose around levels of consultation.<\/p>  <p>  Given that the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights recommends placing \"the focal point on the convention close to the heart of government, such as in the office of the president, the prime minister or the cabinet office,\" is the location of the focal point within the equality division of the Department of Justice and Equality too narrow?  Would it not be better placed within the Department of the Taoiseach to ensure cross-departmental collaboration and leadership at Cabinet level.  That case has been made for Brexit, for example.  Article 33.3 of the convention sets out the requirement to involve people with disabilities in the monitoring process, with civil society in particular being involved, including persons with disabilities and representative organisations.  As the Bill indicates, they shall be involved and participate fully in the process.<\/p>  <p>  Will the Minister of State outline how people with lived experience will be resourced and facilitated to play a crucial role in monitoring the implementation of the convention in Ireland?  Will the Minister of State outline how the Bill will make legislative provision to ensure people with lived experience are the key constituents in monitoring the UN convention in Ireland?  Will he outline the advice his Department sought from the Attorney General with regard to reasonable accommodation and the ratification of the UN convention?  Will that legal advice be published as this is an unusual Bill and the Minister of State indicated he would bring forward very significant matters in the additional amendments?  Will the Minister of State outline if the Bill represents a full ratification of the UN convention and, if not, what reservations are proposed and why?  I heard the Minister of State speak about that several times in the preceding and possibly earlier D&aacute;ileanna.  Will he now put people's concerns to rest in that regard and tell us if other work must be done?<\/p>  <p>  Article 141(b) of the convention clearly states that persons with disabilities should not be \"deprived of their liberty unlawfully or arbitrarily, and that any deprivation of liberty is in conformity with the law, and that the existence of a disability shall in no case justify a deprivation of liberty\". <\/p><p><i>9 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p>The absence of specific legislation on deprivation of liberty as part of the Bill is worrying.  Given the seriousness of this equality and human rights issue, has the Minister of State engaged in any formal, structured discussion with civil society organisations, particularly those which are well versed in legal matters, regarding the deprivation of liberty?  When will legislation be developed in conjunction with people with disabilities on the issue?  What is the Minister of State's timetable for implementation?<\/p> <p> It is a very important Bill and follows on from the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015.  During recent years, I have asked many parliamentary questions about when ratification will take place.  As the Minister of State knows, approximately 600,000 of our fellow citizens have disabilities, approximately one in eight people.  On 16 January, representatives of a number of disability charities launched the #RatifyCRPD campaign.  This included people from the Rehab Group, the Irish Wheelchair Association, the Alzheimer Society of Ireland, Down Syndrome Ireland and the National Council for the Blind Ireland.  Over the years, I have also made many representations on behalf of civil society organisations asking when our ratification will finally take place.<\/p> <p> The Department of Justice and Equality set out a roadmap to ratification, which outlined the principles of the CRPD for which we needed to legislate.  This included Article 3, general principles; Article 5, equality and non-discrimination; Article 12, equal recognition before the law; Article 13, access to justice; Article 14, liberty and security of the person; Article 15, freedom from torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment; Article 23, respect for home and the family; Article 27, work and employment; Article 29, participation in political and public life; and Article 33, national implementation and monitoring.  Those are some of the key headings.  I warmly welcome the fact that Ireland is also signing up to and ratifying the optional protocol to the CRPD, which allows for complaints to be submitted to the CRPD.<\/p> <p> The total budget for disability services is &euro;1.654 billion this year, an increase of &euro;92 million on the 2016 allocation.  In late January, I received a reply from the Minister of State to a parliamentary question I asked about additional resources that will be deployed in disability services as a result of the increase.  The reply stated the funding of &euro;62 million was allocated on an ongoing basis to support the full-year cost of approved compliance work in voluntary and statutory service providers in respect of the national standards for residential services for children and adults with disabilities and emergency places which had commenced in 2015.  Worryingly, the Minister of State's reply went on to state that in this context the key focus across the disability sector is on improving compliance with national residential standards as regulated by HIQA.  He said there had been an overall steady increase in compliance with the most recent analysis of HIQA compliance for disability residential services indicating a national compliance rate of 66%.  While this is welcome, it shows a huge gap which the Minister of State needs to address.<\/p> <p> We recently saw coverage by \"Prime Time\" and other news organisations of facilities for our fellow citizens with disabilities in long-term residential care.  Part of the responsibility for the deterioration in standards of the capital provision of the buildings and staff cuts must be laid at the door of the Minister of State, the Government, the preceding Government and the Fianna F&aacute;il Government from 2009.  There have been massive cuts and hard-pressed staff have been trying to do their best to look after more and more clients.  The Minister of State knows this from his visits to these institutions.<\/p> <p> Disability campaigners have been calling for this ratification since we signed the convention in March 2007, almost a decade ago.  The delay was attributed, at times, to the fact that Ireland was a dualist state.  However, we are the only EU member state not to have ratified the convention.  The basic purpose, stated in Article 1, is to \"promote, protect and ensure the full and equal enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms by all persons with disabilities, and to promote respect for their inherent dignity.\"  It should be a fundamental value of any modern, democratic, egalitarian nation.  For this reason, it is welcome that, at long last, we have reached this stage.  I will be very interested to hear the Minister of State's response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200060#LLL00800","speaker":"1361","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487797200,"counter":525,"content":"<p>Ireland is the only remaining EU member state yet to ratify the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  Ireland signed the convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in 2007 and has since given repeated commitments to ratification, yet it has taken ten years to take into account the need to ensure all necessary legislative and administrative requirements under the convention have been met.  The legislation as proposed is still incomplete and does not contain the complete text.  The Irish ratification process has been painfully slow.<\/p>  <p>  The purpose of the convention is to promote, protect and ensure the full and equal enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms by all persons with disabilities in all areas of their lives and to promote respect for their inherent dignity.  Persons with disabilities include those who have long-term physical, mental, intellectual or sensory impairments which in interaction with various barriers may hinder their full and effective participation in society on an equal basis with others.<\/p>  <p>  It is welcome that the Government has introduced a Bill to allow us to proceed with ratification.  Many people still see themselves as forced to live in inhumane conditions devoid of independence or opportunity to integrate into society.  The Bill will strengthen the rights of people with disabilities to equality in the workplace, guarantee their equal legal capacity and ensure their equal participation in public and political life.  The general scheme of the Bill is to address these legislative and administrative barriers to ratification.  The purpose of the Bill is to amend a number of pieces of legislation so as to address these barriers.  A number of other miscellaneous amendments are being made to equality and disability legislation, some of which will have to be made on Committee Stage, in particular the deprivation of liberty issues in head 3.<\/p>  <p>  The omission of the text of these amendments limits the opportunity of many people affected to have an input into the legislative process.  Will the Minister of State explain why this is the case?  Ms Ann Marie Flanagan, a Clare activist on behalf of disabled persons, recently called on the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, to help end the degrading experience felt by people with disabilities across Ireland and to work closely with those who suffer with disabilities.  People with disabilities are the experts.  Why was consultation with disability representative groups not engaged in prior to the preparation of the Bill?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200061#MMM00200","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speech","time":1487797200,"counter":526,"content":"<p>That is not true.

Who has the statutory responsibility for making a decision that a patient should not leave residential care for health and safety reasons and what appeals should be in place to give legal clarity to it?  The convention represents a substantial shift from the medical model to a rights based social model.  This involves a move away from regarding people with disabilities as persons who require assistance due to their impairments towards regarding them as holders of rights who are entitled to social integration, under the social model.  A clear indication of how people with disabilities live their lives is highlighted by the fact that events to celebrate international day of persons with disabilities had to be held on a Friday rather than on a Saturday last December, given that no accessible transport would be available on the Saturday, according to Martin Tobin of Clare Leader Forum.<\/p>  <p>  The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC, and Inclusion Ireland are concerned that the Government does not propose to implement the convention&rsquo;s requirements that reasonable accommodation be provided to persons with disabilities in all spheres of society.  IHREC recommends we move away from institutional care, that preferably community based care should be provided with adequate funding and that this should be underpinned by legislation.  Member states are obliged to take all reasonable steps to ensure reasonable accommodation is provided to persons with disabilities.  This is something about which I feel strongly and would fully endorse.  Will the Minister of State give the reasons for not implementing this requirement regarding accommodation?<\/p>  <p>  IHREC welcomes the proposed promotion, protection and monitoring in the Bill, which is to be overseen by IHREC.  Will the Government facilitate persons with disabilities monitoring implementation of the convention?<\/p><p>The commission also recommends the absolute prohibition of detention of persons with disabilities, and this is absolutely correct.  The commission and Inclusion Ireland recommends that persons with disability should not be discriminated against in any manner and, for instance, should have access to voting and to sitting on a jury - provided the person possess the decision-making capacity to exercise these rights.<\/p> <p> Inclusion Ireland would prefer that the advisory committee to the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission would be made up entirely with persons with disability or a family member, rather than just made up of 50%.  Inclusion Ireland also regrets that there was no public consultation on any aspect of the new legislation.  Inclusion Ireland recommends that rather than the Department of Justice and Equality having responsibility for implementing the Convention, responsibility would be placed in the Department of the Taoiseach.  This would ensure that the implementation would have cross-departmental focus.  In supporting the Bill I regret the unacceptable delay of ten years, from the time Ireland signed the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, to this move to start the ratification process.  I believe the Bill can be improved in several ways and I encourage the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath to take the views of all stakeholders and the views of those with disabilities into account as soon as possible, while progressing the Bill through the Houses of the Oireachtas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200061#MMM00400","speaker":"1275","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487797800,"counter":529,"content":"<p>Before Deputy Michael Healy-Rae commences, I remind the House that when Deputy Michael Harty was making his contribution the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, used the word &quot;lie&quot; in an interjection.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200062#NNN00200","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1487797800,"counter":530,"content":"<p>Did I?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200062#NNN00300","speaker":"1359"},{"type":"speech","time":1487797800,"counter":531,"content":"<p>I ask the Minister of State to withdraw it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200062#NNN00400","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1487797800,"counter":532,"content":"<p>Outrageous.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200062#NNN00500","speaker":"1347"},{"type":"speech","time":1487797800,"counter":533,"content":"<p>I apologise, but I did not realise I had said that word.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200062#NNN00600","speaker":"1359"},{"type":"speech","time":1487797800,"counter":534,"content":"<p>You are so used to telling it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200062#NNN00700","speaker":"1347"},{"type":"speech","time":1487797800,"counter":535,"content":"<p>The record will show.

It is very important.  I want to raise a couple of items.  I thank the Minister of State for coming to County Kerry recently.  His trip was well received and I appreciated it even though he and I, personally, have differing views on congregated settings.  We are men enough to appreciate each other's positions.  I thank him very much on behalf of all the people in Saint Mary of the Angels, for taking time out of his busy schedule to go there.  I want to acknowledge in the House that his trip was welcomed by everybody.<\/p>  <p>  I want to use the few minutes I have to put on the record of the D&aacute;il, and I am grateful for the work the Minister of State is doing in trying to set it right, that in County Kerry, families of people with a disability, and especially children with a disability, need respite care provision.  In County Kerry there is crisis in respite care provision.  At a public meeting a lady who has a child with special needs spoke out and said a shocking and horrifying thing.  She said, \"I hope to God that my child will die before me\".  I will not identify the person, but she felt that she needed to say it as she did not want to leave her child behind.  This lady believed that the services are not being provided and she wanted to see that her child would be gone out of this world before she was.  That is a shocking thing for anyone to have to say.  I publicly stated at that meeting, and I shall do so again on the record of the House, that I would come back to Dublin, go to the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath and tell him this story.  I know he is aware of it and he assured me that he would do his best with the people in his Department to try and put it right.  I beg him to provide the proper respite care services.  I saw people at that meeting and could see from their faces that they are worn out.  They have been driven down to the ground trying to take care of their loved ones without a break.  I know the Minister of State will take this on board.<\/p>  <p>  I hope the Leas-Cheann Comhairle will allow me the indulgence to say this in that there has been breaking news in the last couple of hours.  The Alpha One Foundation was disappointed to learn this evening from the Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, that the Government will not enter into negotiations to agree a reasonable compromise on the price for Repreeza.  I raised the issue last week with the Taoiseach.  People are suffering from an illness and they need this drug.  It is expensive but the foundation is at a loss as to how the Minister for Health cannot recognise the clear benefits of this drug therapy as evidenced by the patients who have been receiving it for over a decade.  The Alpha One Foundation welcomes the decision, however, of CSL Behring - notwithstanding the Minister's stated position - that it will provide the therapy for an additional two months to allow further discussions to take place.<\/p>  <p>  Let us be clear that these are people who have a very debilitating illness affecting their lungs.  Twenty people are availing of this therapy.  I admit that it is expensive but if they do not have the therapy they will die.  This information only came out this evening and with the Minister of State here, I wanted to put it on the record.  I know he will relay it, in his own good time, to the Minister for Health.  It is so important for those 20 people.  As I have said, their lives are as good as my life, the Minister of State's life or that of anybody else.  Money should not come into it.  Of course we must be prudent with taxpayers' money, and the Minister for Health has to get the best deal possible from the drug companies.  I respect that the companies also must make their money but surely to God, on compassionate grounds, some deal could be brought about between the HSE and the drug company on this very important issue.<\/p>  <p>  I will now return to the Bill.  Some people can say it is late in being introduced.  I recall the day the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, was in County Kerry.  He said that he was disappointed it had not been brought before the House and that it had not been his fault.  It is here now and we appreciate that it is now going through the House.  Trying to do everything we can for people with disability, trying to make their lives better, trying to ensure their safety and their rights and tying together all the legalities contained in this Bill, is very important work and we all have to put our shoulders to the wheel.<\/p>  <p>  I will make way now for my colleague but my final word is on respite care with regard to people with a disability or special needs.  At the public meeting in County Kerry, peoples' anger was not a cross type of anger, it was an upset anger, about the lack of resources for taking care of these very special people.  It is shocking.  Many people with special needs were at the meeting and they realised the pressures this is putting on their families.  I ask that the Minister of State does everything within his power to address this.  At the meeting I said that if anybody would understand the issue, take it on board and try to ensure we have adequate funding for County Kerry, the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath would try to.  I ask that he please deliver on that because I told them I would do my best.  I am pleading with the Minister of State on behalf of the people of County Kerry who need respite care beds for their children and I hope he will try his best to meet their needs.<\/p>  <p>  I thank the Leas Cheann Comhairle.  I believe he owes my colleague a couple of minute's injury time also.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200062#NNN02100","speaker":"1319"},{"type":"speech","time":1487797800,"counter":549,"content":"<p>We stopped the clock at the time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200062#NNN02200","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1487797800,"counter":550,"content":"<p>You did not actually.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200062#NNN02300","speaker":"1347"},{"type":"speech","time":1487797800,"counter":551,"content":"<p>The Deputy is very vigilant.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200062#NNN02400","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1487797800,"counter":552,"content":"<p>I watched as a few minutes elapsed.<\/p>  <p>  I also want to speak about the Alpha One Foundation and how concerned and worried it is.  It is a travesty that the Government would not continue negotiations.  I compliment Senator Marc MacSharry who brought in some unfortunate families, family members and mothers of children suffering from cystic fibrosis.  One powerful young woman testified that she lost her twin one year ago this week.  Why is the Government so heartless with regard to cystic fibrosis and Orkambi?  When the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, was in Opposition - I was in Opposition with him - he was up and down every day demanding and asking.<\/p><p>The Minister of State would not even attend the AV room, nor would any other Minister or Minister of State attend or show any bit of empathy, sympathy or understanding for those families.<\/p> <p> The Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2016 is being introduced as part of a process by which a Government will ratify the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  While I welcome the opportunity for a D&aacute;il debate on any suggestion that will improve the rights of disabled persons, I also want to note the concerns around the UN convention that have been outlined in a document from the US Congressional Research Service, specifically the possible complications around abortion.  Some critics worry that the term \"sexual and reproductive health\" in the UN convention could be a euphemism for abortion.  It is important we have clarity on that.  Some are concerned that the ratification of the UN convention may give Governments and not parents the right to make educational and treatment-related decisions for disabled children.  These are serious concerns.  I want to know if the convention has been scrutinised in light of our constitutional principles.<\/p> <p> On a more local level, we note that while the UN convention may be ratified, questions remain about how we treat the disabled in this country.  For example, I raised the issue of autism units on Leaders' Questions only a week ago.  There are 12 children in a wonderful pre-school unit at St. Mary's, Irishtown, Clonmel, but they have no primary school to go to in September, despite having a constitutional right to go to school.  That is very worrying and the Minister of State needs to act.  There are hundreds of such children across the country, not only in Tipperary.  I note also the concerns outlined by Senator John Dolan, former CEO of the Disability Federation of Ireland, when he noted budget 2017 utterly failed to address issues facing disabled people.  He said: \"After nearly a decade of cutbacks and retrenchment, and into the fourth year from the end of the recession, this first budget statement of our new Government fails to address the significant daily issues facing disabled people all around the country.\"<\/p> <p> When is the Minister of State going to introduce the mobility allowance he made so much noise about when he was in opposition?  He met a lovely family from Tipperary with me, for which I thank him, but despite the promises, we are still waiting.  This is affecting hundreds of families who are entitled to this allowance.  They do not have taxis, the Luas or wheelchair accessible buses in Tipperary.<\/p> <p> The Government is well aware that 600,000 people and their families are still being denied or being rationed access to basic services and supports.  In the past decade people with disabilities and their families in all corners of this country have experienced and had to survive major and ongoing cuts to services and supports.  I am bitterly disappointed the Government has deliberately chosen to take a populist approach when it could have made a strong start to rebuilding the social infrastructure to support those who have, and will have, disabilities in Ireland.  This is unacceptable, especially as we have been given little hope that these issues will be addressed in future budgets.<\/p> <p> There was a focus on disability but will the planned 21,000 housing units include appropriate accommodation for over 1,000 people with disabilities?  I do not believe half of them will even be built.  Where is the &euro;30 million fund sought to improve the chronic situation for housing adaptation grants that we all need in our constituencies on a daily basis?  Will the &euro;497 million increase in health spending restore the &euro;159 million cut from disability services during the recession?  It will not, given the way the Government is wasting money on the children's hospital and given the over-spending in hospitals throughout the country, the mismanagement and the outlaw behaviour of the HSE.  All the Government can do is smile and say, \"Carry on boys\", and give them a pat on the back.<\/p> <p> No funding was provided to meet the extra daily cost of living for disabled people although &euro;20 per week was sought.  The Minister of State should hang his head in shame.  The &euro;5 per week on disability payments simply keeps current parity with others.  The pre-school provision for children with disabilities will ensure they are not excluded from now on.  I acknowledge the medical card coverage for all children on domiciliary care allowance, which will be a great relief to families.  We all fought for that, no one more than the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, when he was on these benches.  Where is it?  What is the delay?  They are still waiting but they do not have it.  The intent was to \"do something\" rather than take the real opportunity to make a focused impact with the funding available for those with disabilities.  Disabled people and their families do not just need measures to relieve pressure.  They need measures to ensure they get out of the spiral of poverty and exclusion.  This budget could have achieved that fairness and kick-started the economy but it does not do so, by any measure.<\/p> <p> The effective way to support people in most need has been deliberately bypassed in this budget.  Children, adults, families and older people in most need are those coping with disability and mental health.  That has not been addressed in this budget.  When resources are modest, they should be focused for most impact.  Populism rather than public benefit has been the winner in the recent budget.  The Minister of State is not too bad at that either.  It is a shame he would not do this.<\/p> <p> I remind the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, that there is a long-established practice - in Tipperary anyway - that when Ministers come to visit, they inform all the Oireachtas Members.  I am talking about his solo run last Friday with the king of spin and plam&aacute;s, when visiting two fabulous disabled centres in Cashel, Scoil Aonghusa and Scoil Chormaic.  It was wrong to use people with special needs like that.  There are photographs all over the newspapers of the Minister of State and my Tipperary colleague, Deputy Michael Lowry, with the Minister of State giggling and smirking, thinking this is a great one up on McGrath and the others.  Mattie McGrath does not care.  The people of north Tipperary are the ones for whom I work - all the people across the board.  I do not have to get the Minister of State down like a knight in shining armour, with his chest out, telling the people what Deputy Michael Lowry could do for disabled children.  We all work hard - Deputies Jackie Cahill, Alan Kelly, Seamas Healy and me.  Those kinds of acts have no place but this is the kind of Independent Alliance member he is.  I know the Minister of State ten years so I know enough about him and I know the way he operates.  The people deserve proper respect, including disabled people.  The disabled children in Tipperary who attend those facilities deserve better, not sly actions and snide visits like that.  When the Minister of State was extolling the virtues of one Deputy on radio, people saw it for what it was.  I know the Minister of State has relatives in Tipperary.  I hope they were not listening to the radio that day because, if they were, they would be highly embarrassed.<\/p> <p> The Minister of State should step up to the plate.  He wanted the ministry he was given.  He has it and I know he has an interest in it.  He has to deliver for these people.  It is a shame he would not attend the briefing today.  There is a Minister and four Ministers of State in the Department of Health, if not five, but none of them would attend the briefing on Orkambi.  The Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, needs to find his courage and conviction, if he can, and do something for the disabled.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200062#NNN02500","speaker":"1347","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487798400,"counter":554,"content":"<p>The Deputy is a waffler.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200063#OOO00200","speaker":"1359"},{"type":"speech","time":1487798400,"counter":555,"content":"<p>I wish to share time with Deputy Joe Carey.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200063#OOO00300","speaker":"1331"},{"type":"speech","time":1487798400,"counter":556,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

Like many Members from all sides of this House, I support the concept of an inclusive society and the need to remove all barriers that currently prevent people with disabilities from fully participating in society.  I have no doubt this legislation will benefit not only those people affected by disability, but also society as a whole as we work towards a more inclusive and equal place for people to live and work in.  I strongly believe people with disabilities should be afforded the same opportunities as every other member of society.  There should be no barriers for those with disabilities to fully participate in all aspects of society.  For too long society has placed too many barriers in front of people with disabilities.  There should be no barriers and this legislation will go some way to ensuring this.<\/p>  <p>  The Disability Federation of Ireland recently reported there are almost 600,000 people in Ireland living with a disability, which is 13% of the total population.  Of people aged 15 years and over who have a disability, 21% were at work, which compares with 50% for the overall population aged 15 or over.  Some 16% of people with disabilities aged 15 years to 49 have completed no higher than primary level education, compared with 5% of the general population.  It is quite clear from these statistics that not enough is being done to make our society more inclusive for those living with a disability.<\/p>  <p>  The purpose of the Bill is to make progress towards Ireland ratifying the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  The Bill, as published, will amend a number of existing acts including the Juries Act 1976, the Electoral Act 1992, the National Disability Authority Act 1999, the Equal Status Act 2000, the Disability Act 2005 and the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act 2014.  These amendments propose a number of changes including introducing a capacity test to see who can serve as a juror, and the Bill specifically provides that a deaf person will not be ineligible for jury service on the grounds that he or she requires a sign language interpreter.  The prohibition of a person of unsound mind from standing for the D&aacute;il will be repealed.  It will be a function of the National Disability Authority, NDA, to provide information and advice to the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission and staff members of the NDA will be civil servants.  The amendments will also introduce a standard in regard to reasonable accommodation and a quota will now apply to Garda civilian staff.<\/p><p>While I welcome this legislation I am also concerned about some of the exclusions highlighted by other Deputies.  The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission has also raised these concerns and has requested the outstanding provisions be published without further delay, which will allow it to engage with the implications of the proposals for human rights and equality.  It has also stated that in its opinion the number of provisions to be introduced on Committee Stage will significantly limit the potential for a detailed analysis.  It made the point that in regard to deprivation of liberty, it might not be sufficient to simply introduce these measures on Committee Stage without a detailed analysis.  I also understand that Inclusion Ireland has raised concerns in that regard.<\/p> <p> We must ensure a thorough analysis is carried out so that any legislation passed ensures that the rights of people with disabilities are fully protected and enshrined in law.<\/p> <p> Concerns have also been raised about the Title of the Bill and the fact that the word \"equality\" has been removed.  I tend to agree with those who have concerns about that and support their call to have \"equality\" reintroduced to the Title of the Bill to take account of the wider reforms proposed.<\/p> <p> With regard to what is included in the Bill, section 1 deals with jury service.  This section provides for an amendment to the Juries Act 1976 to provide that a person who is deaf shall not be ineligible for jury service by reason only of his or her requiring the services of a sign language interpreter.  I welcome this amendment and fully support the fact that those affected by deafness will not be discriminated against in<\/p> <p>this respect.  I agree with the commission, which has stated that all persons should be presumed to have capacity to serve on a jury and that reasonable accommodation should be provided to secure maximum participation in jury service.<\/p> <p> With regard to section 4, it is welcome that there will be a higher standard of reasonable accommodation for persons with disabilities in respect of certain public and commercial services, including banks, insurance companies, telecommunications and transport providers.<\/p> <p> I am strongly in favour of the Bill before us but I have reservations in respect of what is not included, or what has been excluded, at this Stage.  The Minister of State has advised that those amendments will be introduced on Committee Stage but I express my concern that adequate time will not be allowed to debate them on Committee Stage.<\/p> <p> Overall, I am in total favour of any measures that will help those with disabilities to fully engage with society in a real, meaningful and inclusive manner.<\/p> <p> I invite the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, to my home town of Dundalk to meet families that have adult children with severe disabilities.  All they are looking for is a bit of help.  The help they are looking for is respite.  We have very few, if any, respite services in Dundalk and generally in County Louth.  In the coming months, whenever he can fit it into his diary, I would appreciate it if he came to Dundalk to meet those families.  The Minister is doing a good job.  He should keep it up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200063#OOO00500","speaker":"1331","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487799000,"counter":559,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak in this very important debate on the Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill.  Ireland signed the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, CRPD, on 30 March 2007 yet almost ten years later, it still has to ratify one of the most important human rights treaties of the 21st century.  In that period, more than 150 other countries have ratified the CRPD.<\/p>  <p>  Like many other Deputies in the House, I have raised this most important issue on many occasions.  I accept that the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, has spent a political lifetime as a supporter of people with disabilities and it is very appropriate that he introduces this legislation.  While I accept that different countries take different approaches to ratification of international conventions, it is most regrettable that the CRPD has not been ratified before now.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the publication of a roadmap to ratification, which was approved by the previous Government and published in October 2015.  This roadmap outlines the legislative changes required to enable Ireland to ratify the convention.  Since this Bill was introduced for debate in the House, I have received a good deal of correspondence from constituents regarding its contents and lack of contents.  I have received correspondence from advocates like Dermot Hayes and this evening I think of the late Tom King, who was the chairperson of Disabled People of Clare, who campaigned on this particular topic for many years.<\/p>  <p>  In this regard I have some questions for the Minister which he might answer when he is concluding the debate.  Will he, please, explain why the term \"equality\" has been dropped from the Title of the Bill?  Why is the word &ldquo;rights&rdquo; not included anywhere in the Bill?  Article 14(b) of the UN CRDP deals with deprivation of liberty.  The absence of specific legislation on the deprivation of liberty as part of this Bill is worrying.  When will legislation be developed in conjunction with persons with disabilities on that particular issue?<\/p>  <p>  Will the Minister of State, please, inform the House the level of consultation that has taken place with civil society, and specifically with people with disabilities, since the publication of the Roadmap to Ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in October 2015 to inform this Bill?<\/p>  <p>  Also, Article 33(3) of the convention sets out the requirement to involve people with a disability in the monitoring process.  Will the Minister of State outline the way people with the lived experience will be resourced and facilitated to play a crucial role in monitoring the implementation of the UN CRPD in Ireland?  I ask the Minister of State to address these questions when replying to the debate.<\/p>  <p>  I thank the Minister of State for his support and his involvement in helping to resolve a particular issue I have worked on for many years.  It will help solve a housing problem for four people with intellectual disabilities in Newmarket-on-Fergus, County Clare.  Some years ago, it was identified that these particular individuals who had ageing parents, some of whom have since passed on, would need a housing solution.  In fairness to the Brothers of Charity, which has a housing agency called Banner Housing, they joined up with Clare County Council and managed to acquire a unit at Boheroan in Newmarket-on-Fergus.  They acquired five units of high tech, modern accommodation, which is great, but once we had the accommodation the next key aim was to get operational funding.  <\/p>  <p>  Last year, I arranged a meeting with the chief executive of the Health Service Executive in the mid-west, Bernard Gloster, who engaged with parents and with the Brothers of Charity.  Thankfully, a start to that has been made and a commitment given by Bernard Gloster that operational funding will be provided for the units, which will enable two of these persons to take up residence at those houses in Newmarket-on-Fergus.  I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, for his help and encouragement on that particular issue.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the introduction of this legislation.  It is not before time.  I ask that the various amendments the Minister of State outlined in his opening statement will be introduced on Committee Stage would be worked on in a determined fashion to ensure that this important legislation can be enacted as soon as possible.  There is little doubt that, when enacted, this legislation will bring about positive change to a large range of legislative measures that will have a positive and real effect on the lives of people with disabilities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200064#PPP00200","speaker":"1273"},{"type":"speech","time":1487799000,"counter":560,"content":"<p>I wish to share a few minutes of my time with my colleague, Deputy Margaret Murphy O'Mahony, the Fianna F&aacute;il spokesperson on disability, who will wrap up the debate from a Fianna F&aacute;il perspective.<\/p>  <p>  I very much welcome the opportunity to speak on this issue.  It is an issue that has been very close to my heart for many years and one that deserves well informed discussion and debate.  My life as a sister to Cathal, who has Down's syndrome, my experience in the education sector and having worked with Special Olympics Ireland has worked to consistently implement the core tenets of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.<\/p><p>These core tenets represent the most fundamental rights of all persons, regardless of ability level.  They include the right to good health care services, quality education and an environment safe from exploitation and abuse.  They include the right to work and participate in sport.  Most important, they include the right to be included as an equal member of society.<\/p> <p> We must also remember the families and carers of those who have disabilities.  They also have rights when it comes to discussing the rights of people with disabilities.<\/p> <p> Ten years have passed since the UN convention was signed by the Government.  Ratification must be the next step.  It is shameful that this is the only remaining EU country that has not yet ratified the convention.  While the Bill will move ratification one step closer, we must not rest here.  People with disabilities deserve nothing less than full ratification.<\/p> <p> I appreciate that the Minister of State is well-meaning and absolutely acknowledge that in recent years this has been a core issue for him.  However, it is concerning that the Bill only presents part of the solution.  My party and I will not stand in the way of any progress.  However, I call on the Minister of State to provide a timeline in seeking full ratification of the convention.  I understand from him that other amendments will come into play in terms of what has been left out of the Bill.  We need to be clear on when and how these elements will be included.<\/p> <p> I accept that Governments alone cannot do all of the necessary work to change communities.  It is one thing for us to set a standard in law, but it is quite another to set a standard in people's hearts.  The true fulfilment of the convention will only come about when children and adults with disabilities are treated with dignity and justice not only in writing but also in daily life.  Ireland's ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities can serve as a national call to action for all, including Government agencies, NGOs, sports and recreation programmes, public health agencies, schools and many more.  It can serve as a call to mobilise all of our resources in a shared quest to provide a brighter and more secure future for all those with disabilities in Ireland.<\/p> <p> Sometimes we think of people with disabilities as including only those with a physical disability or those whom we see in wheelchairs.  We are conscious of the need to provide access to buildings.  We are to be commended for the budgets set aside to ensure physical access.  However, we must not forget about people with an intellectual disability and all of the invisible barriers they face day to day.  People with intellectual disabilities matter; they count and deserve a chance just like the Minister of State, me or any other person.  There is an urgent need for individuals and communities throughout Ireland to become strong advocates for the ratification of the UN convention.  When rights are defined only by political or judicial norms, they do little to advance the case of those facing barriers that are social and cultural.  A serious job remains to be done by all of us outside as well as inside the House.  The future of rights for people with disabilities requires a new positive message from us, the point of which is that we all own the rights agenda.<\/p> <p> Motivated citizens can make a major difference as we saw in 2003 during the Special Olympics World Games.  I was privileged to play my part in the organisation.  I had the honour of working with 160 host towns throughout the island of Ireland.  I witnessed first-hand the lengths to which people went to ensure their guests who came from 180 countries throughout the world would have the best opportunity to showcase their abilities.  The legacy will long live on.<\/p> <p> For schools to change, it is not only a matter for Governments alone to embrace the principles of universal education.  Citizens must also demand that all children be given the right to attend school.  For employment conditions to change, it is not only a matter for Governments alone to embrace the principles of non-discrimination.  Business leaders and citizens must advocate for workplaces that value the contributions of all.<\/p> <p> Ireland has the opportunity to ratify the convention and, in so doing, show solidarity with all other EU member states that have ratified the convention and begun its implementation.  We have a heightened obligation to ratify and implement the convention.  Every day acts of inclusion have helped to define our social fabric.  Tolerance, acceptance, togetherness, helpfulness and advocacy have all become standard components of a past, present and future Ireland.<\/p> <p> I call on the Minister of State to outline whether there has been a formal structured consultation process with civil society and especially with people with disabilities to inform the development of the Bill.  I draw his attention to Article 33.3 of the convention which sets out the requirement to involve people with disabilities in the monitoring process.  I call on him to outline how people with the lived experience will be resourced and facilitated to play this crucial role.  I call on him to explain how the Bill will ensure people with the lived experience are the key constituents in monitoring the UN convention in Ireland.  What legal advice did the Department of Health seek from the Attorney General on reasonable accommodation and ratification?<\/p> <p> Will the Minister of State explain the cross-over with the EPSEN Act?  That Act was brought forward especially to address the rights area and reference was made to it earlier.  We have already addressed the point that the Bill will not bring about full ratification.  What reservations does the Minister of State have in this regard?<\/p> <p> Article 14.1(b) of the convention states people with disabilities should not be deprived of their liberty unlawfully or arbitrarily, that any deprivation of liberty must be in conformity with the law and that the existence of a disability shall in no case justify the deprivation of liberty.  The absence of specific legislation on the deprivation of liberty as part of the Bill is concerning.  Given the seriousness of this equality and human rights issue, has the Minister of State engaged in any formal structured discussion with civil society organisations of the deprivation of liberty?  When will legislation be developed on the issue in conjunction with persons with disabilities?<\/p> <p> I appreciate that a cross-departmental approach must be taken at the Cabinet.  Disability matters relate to education, health and gaining significant and quality employment.  I know from my work on the Joint Committee on Education and Skills that many issues arise, especially in the case of people with an intellectual disability in accessing quality education.  Day after day, I receive calls from parents who are concerned about their children who have autism and are unable to access primary education.  If they gain access to primary education, a major issue arises in trying to access second level education, but it does not stop there.  I know that the Minister of State recently met representatives of Disability Access Route to Education, DARE, which ran an excellent programme with NUI Maynooth.  It was able to provide the personnel and staff to ensure some clients were able to attend NUI Maynooth and participate in third level programmes.  They did not take full modules but part modules and they did extremely well.  DARE covered all of its costs, but NUI Maynooth was unable to access any funding from the Department of Education and Skills.  If we truly believe everyone in the country has a right of access to education, that right must include access to third level education.  While I accept that it is an issue for the Minister for Education and Skills, I believe it is one the Minster of State should take up with the Minister.  In a situation where someone with an intellectual or a physical disability wishes to access education, has the capability to do so and has support from the service provider, we should absolutely encourage and support that person.  DARE is an excellent supported employment service in an area that stretches through County Kildare, west Wicklow and into counties Carlow, Laois and Offaly.  To date, it has facilitated 156 people in accessing the paid job of their choice in the open labour market.<\/p><p>The vast majority of these are in the private sector, with notable exceptions.  Kildare County Council continues to be a fantastic supporter of the process, with people employed both in its headquarters in &Aacute;ras Chill Dara and in library services around the county.  The local HSE employed somebody recently in its stores department in Naas.  The Minister of State visited Naas hospital and had the opportunity to meet some of the young people working there.  The project is called Project SEARCH.  Essentially, it supports young people with an intellectual difficulty to participate in a real and meaningful internship to prepare them for the world of work.  In fact, I am working with the organisation to try to find a module we could provide in Leinster House in terms of an internship programme with Deputies and Senators.  When a person leaves Project SEARCH, KARE tries to find a meaningful job for the individual.  This is what KARE calls \"job finding\", which is endeavouring to match the people's skills, interests and dreams with what a particular employer might have to offer.  However, there are barriers within the civil and public service, mainly because of the policies and requirements that are in place.  This is something the Minister could take up and perhaps we could work collectively on it.  If there are opportunities in the public sector, we should be able to find them.<\/p> <p> It is very important to have this debate and it is hugely important that we as a Parliament, nation and global citizens seize this opportunity to ratify the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  We must do it with conviction and focus.  A progressive Ireland starts when each of our citizens, regardless of their ability or disability, feels empowered to make a difference.  We must do it with resolve to meet the many challenges that will surely arise, especially when support for our fellow citizens, including my brother and the Minister's daughter, will be positioned against issues such as the public deficit, budget shortfalls, spending cuts and the like.  We must do this, also, in memory of the pioneers who went before us, who dreamt of a day when governments around the world would raise their voices in unison and mobilise to benefit all citizens, with no division.  We must confront these challenges optimistically and courageously.  I refer to the words of the Special Olympics athletes' oath that inspires millions around the world and many in this country with the power of the human spirit: \"Let me win.  But if I cannot win, let me be brave in the attempt\".<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200064#PPP00300","speaker":"1257","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487800200,"counter":563,"content":"<p>As I spoke at length on this Bill on 1 February last, I will share the remainder of my time with my colleagues, Deputies Eamon Scanlon and James Lawless.<\/p>  <p>  To summarise the Fianna F&aacute;il point of view, as I said previously I consider the Bill to be half baked.

In fairness, I am aware that the Minister of State is doing his best to resolve the matter.  It relates to a facility built in Sligo to cater for adults and young people and provide respite care for parents and families.  The facility was built at a cost of &euro;1.2 million six years ago.  There were 28 service users, although unfortunately many families tell me they are having great difficulty getting any respite night.  The Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, is part of the problem.  The staff numbers have been allowed to drop and, as a result, HIQA has said the staff numbers are not sufficient to cater for the people concerned.  Nobody can begin to understand the difference this type of service makes for families with family members who have disabilities.  There is no question that they need respite care and they must know their family members are in a place where they are safe and well looked after.  Unfortunately, that is not the case at present.  I am aware that the Minister has made funds available but I am told that it will take another two to four months for this issue to be resolved.  That is unacceptable.  We must support the parents and the people concerned.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to Orkambi, we were given a presentation today by two parents, the sister of a girl from County Sligo who died at the age of 21 years, the mother of a child aged 12 years, the mother of a child who has passed away and the chief executive officer, CEO, of Cystic Fibrosis Ireland.  They told us about the difference the drug can make.  Jillian McNulty, who has been using the drug, gave a presentation also.  Her quality of life has changed completely.  The CEO told us that 56,000 bed nights were used in hospitals last year by cystic fibrosis, CF, patients who were obliged to go to hospital.  I believe massive savings could be made.  Unquestionably, there will be a requirement for bed nights in hospitals, but savings could be made if Orkambi could be made available.

Niamh is a student in Trinity College Dublin and she represents herself, the students' union in the college and a group called Disability and I.  I understand she subsequently corresponded with the Minister of State and is due to meet him.  I thank the Minister of State for that.  She met Deputy Margaret Murphy O'Mahony last week also.<\/p>  <p>  Unfortunately, Niamh ended up in difficult situation two or three days later.  Unknown to us at the time, she attempted to board a Ryanair flight to travel to London with friends from college and was told she could not do so.  Despite the obvious presence of her wheelchair the Ryanair staff asked her to walk up the steps to the airplane.  She was left sitting on the tarmacadam, crying, as the airplane took off without her.  Her friends, for financial reasons, had no choice but to board the airplane and go on the journey.  This is a horrific, barbaric event to happen to anybody, most of all to somebody vulnerable.  I plead with all Members to advance the convention to address these issues so this type of situation does not recur.  I was ashamed to see from the map that Niamh included in her presentation last week that the convention has been ratified across Europe and beyond, including by many countries which might be considered to be less progressive than Ireland.  Ireland stands alone among European and neighbouring states as yet to do so.  Let us not allow what happened to this young lady recur.  Let us ratify the convention with as much haste as possible.

The principal aim of the Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions Bill) 2016 is to reform national law to enable Ireland to ratify the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  Sinn F&eacute;in welcomes any progress that is made towards the full ratification of the long awaited UNCRPD and we will therefore support this Bill&rsquo;s passage to Committee Stage.<\/p><p><i>10 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p>This important convention seeks to protect and promote the rights of people with disabilities.  The rights set out in the convention are rights that all people have as people, regardless of physical or mental status.<\/p> <p> As mentioned time and again, it is to Ireland&rsquo;s shame that it has taken this long to address the legal and administrative steps that provide for the convention&rsquo;s full ratification.  Ten long years to be exact.  We must all now ensure that the pieces of legislation required to ratify this convention are progressed as a matter of urgency. <\/p> <p> It is my opinion that successive Governments have been far too slow to act on very important issues.  One important cohort of people that springs to mind are the thousands of children with disabilities who are in receipt of the domiciliary care allowance but who have been unable to secure medical cards.  The Minister will be well familiar with this issue.  A commitment was made by Government in Budget 2017 that an automatic medical card would be issued to all those children but this has still not happened.  This must not drag on any longer.  Sinn F&eacute;in produced legislation on this need and entitlement that could be introduced immediately if the Minister had, and I say so respectfully, the political will to do so and the support within Cabinet to progress it.  These children cannot and should not have to wait any longer and I encourage this matter to be addressed as a matter of urgency.<\/p> <p> Sinn F&eacute;in welcomes any progress made to move from a medical to a rights based approach to the provision of mental health and disability services.  We welcome for example the fact that this Bill amends the Juries Act 1976 so that a person who is deaf shall not be ineligible for jury service by reason only of his or her requiring the services of a sign language interpreter.  Let us hope, that in the coming months another positive step will be taken with the final passage of the Recognition of Irish Sign Language for the Deaf Community Bill 2016. It is, however, a great worry to me to note that many civil society organisations working in the area of disability have real concerns about this Bill including real questions about whether this legislation would be fully compliant with the UNCRPD.  A critical aspect when formulating legislation is engagement with NGOs and those who are directly affected by the proposed legislation.  It is unfortunate, disappointing, and in my mind, bad practice, that no public consultation on these matters has taken place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200066#RRR00500","speaker":"1269","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487800800,"counter":568,"content":"<p>That is not true.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200067#SSS00200","speaker":"1359"},{"type":"speech","time":1487800800,"counter":569,"content":"<p>The voice of lived experience is the most important element to ensure UNCRPD compliant legislation and this has not happened in Ireland&rsquo;s case and that is true.<\/p>  <p>  Equality is at the core of the UNCRPD.

However, it is again very disappointing that the opportunity to include persons with a disability in a meaningful way in the advisory committee to the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission in its monitoring capacity has not been taken.<\/p>  <p>  The UNCRPD committee has recommended that States&rsquo; parties \"establish strong and efficient focal points within each ministry and State institution responsible for implementing the Convention\" and this Bill provides for a focal point in the Department of Justice and Equality for implementing the convention.  Sinn F&eacute;in has continuously called for the Taoiseach to be in charge of disability inclusion and in this instance we believe that the Department of An Taoiseach would be the best focal point as it would ensure that the UNCRPD is given a cross-departmental focus which it most certainly requires.<\/p>  <p>  We will of course be tabling amendments on Committee Stage that will address our concerns.  In the meantime I would appreciate clarity from the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, on the points I have mentioned.  I also call on him to engage with and consult civil society on all these matters.  To rephrase the principle of \"nothing about us without us\" which guided the negotiation of the convention, the Minister of State must ensure there is \"nothing about them without them\".<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200067#SSS00300","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speech","time":1487800800,"counter":570,"content":"<p>Go raibh maith agat a Leas-Cheann Comhairle as ucht an deis seo chun labhairt ar an topaic f&iacute;orth&aacute;bhachtach seo anocht.  Sinn F&eacute;in has long campaigned for the full implementation of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and we welcome this legislation in so far as it goes towards that aim.  As many Deputies have outlined in this House tonight however, it is shameful that convention has still not been ratified.  I attended a meeting a year ago hosted by Offaly Centre for Independent Living and at that meeting there were very strong views and great disappointment expressed that we still have not got that convention ratified.  It is just not good enough.  We need to move forward on it as quickly as possible.<\/p>  <p>  We share many of the concerns of disability groups and other non-governmental organisations in that this Bill does not go far enough.  One of the main concerns that has been expressed to me and has been highlighted by other colleagues this evening is that there has been no public consultation with the various stakeholders on aspects of this legislation.  We believe this Bill could be strengthened and we will be tabling amendments on Committee Stage to ensure that the Bill fully complies with the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  For example, while we welcome the provisions in respect of jury service, electoral Acts and expansion of reasonable accommodation, there is clear scope for the Minister to go further.  The issue of deprivation of liberty is a core issue that needs to be addressed to ensure Ireland's full compliance with the UN convention, yet the Bill does not deal with this matter.  Furthermore, this Bill provided an opportunity to include persons with disabilities in an advisory committee to the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission in its monitoring capacity.  It is disappointing this was not done because the voices of the people affected should be always foremost.<\/p>  <p>  Overall, while I welcome many provisions of this Bill, it is a missed opportunity to give full effect to the UN convention and our support is dependent on these issues being fully addressed on Committee Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200067#SSS00400","speaker":"1340"},{"type":"speech","time":1487800800,"counter":571,"content":"<p>I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle.

The specific provisions of the part of this Bill that is actually written that are to be welcomed have been mentioned.<\/p><p>As has been mentioned, people with hearing disability will not be excluded from sitting on a jury purely because they require sign language.  The Bill repeals the prohibition on a person of &quot;unsound mind&quot; standing for election to the D&aacute;il.  The National Disability Authority will become a monitoring authority, although, as has already been said, certain provisions need to be attached to that to really enhance the monitoring such that people with disabilities themselves, the people with the lived experience of disability, are key to the monitoring process, which is a critical aspect of the UN convention.  Nonetheless there has been some progress.<br\/><br\/>The Bill introduces a standard regarding reasonable accommodation.  The public sector quota for employing people with disabilities has now been extended to the Garda.  The Bill gives the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission more responsibilities.  All these things are good, but they are a long way short of what is needed to give full equality and rights to people with a disability.  Critically, this is not the ratification that was promised.<br\/><br\/>The Bill suggests the thrust of it is about removing legislative barriers to the ratification of the UN convention.  I am not an expert in this area; the experts are the people with the lived experience.  Certainly those people, with whom I have been working to a considerable extent particularly in recent months, and those who advocate for them, reject the contention that the need to remove legislative barriers or the need to introduce legislation to make us compliant was a legitimate excuse for the ten years of indefensible delay in ratification.  Somebody has to be telling the truth.<br\/><br\/>The solicitor and chief executive of the Centre for Independent Living, Gary Lee, recently wrote in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>that there is no legal impediment to the ratification of the UN convention.  However, the Minister of State maintains, as successive governments have maintained, that there was and that this was the justification for the delay.  I just do not buy it; Gary Lee does not buy it; and the people to whom I talk, who have the lived experience of disability, do not buy it.<br\/><br\/>I do not doubt the Minister of State's personal commitment on disability; he has a long record on it.  However, I believe he is a prisoner of Fine Gael on this issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200067#SSS00700","speaker":"1238","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487801400,"counter":575,"content":"<p>I try to get the job done and it is hard at times.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200068#TTT00200","speaker":"1359"},{"type":"speech","time":1487801400,"counter":576,"content":"<p>I have no doubt about that.
