The Taoiseach and I spoke yesterday afternoon as he considered the public health advice from the National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET.  I am glad the Taoiseach also spoke to Michelle O'Neill and Arlene Foster about strengthening the all-Ireland approach.  There is no doubt that the decision facing Government yesterday was hugely challenging.  It has decided not to implement the NPHET recommendation to move to level 5 and instead we will move to level 3 from midnight tonight.  The truth is that a move to level 5 now would have proven catastrophic for workers, families and businesses.  I say this because the Government has cut the supports and protections that they need simply to survive and get by.  I was very alarmed by the aggressive approach taken by the T&aacute;naiste on RT&Eacute; last night.  Governments ask for advice and, when given advice, they should accept it with some level of maturity and grace and then make their decision.  The NPHET recommendation comes against a backdrop of very high levels of community transmission and, critically, very low capacity within our health service.  NPHET is worried and it is right to be worried.  Listening to the T&aacute;naiste last night, one would never think he had been Minister for Health, much less that he and his party had been leading Government for the past decade or, indeed, that he joined with the Taoiseach in cutting supports like the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, that people rely on.<\/p>  <p>  The vulnerabilities that we now face are down to the Taoiseach and his partner in government, Deputy Varadkar.  In 2009, we had 289 intensive care beds.  More than a decade on, we have 280.  We have fewer intensive care beds now than we had more than a decade ago.  This represents a decade of failure from Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael.  It is on them.  Last night, as the Cabinet had come to its decision, there were only 39 adult intensive care beds available.  That is the situation we face and it is a troubling one.  Along with testing and tracing, capacity in our hospitals is perhaps the most important measure to protect us from going into very severe lockdowns.  It is how we ensure that non-Covid care is not suspended again with the terrible impacts that has.  It is how we will keep our schools, economy and society open during this pandemic.  When we spoke yesterday, I asked the Taoiseach to provide assurances that we were winter ready, in other words, that we have the necessary supplies of personal protective equipment, PPE, testing kits, reagent, laboratory spaces and ventilators to deal with the second surge.  He could not give me that assurance.  I find that very worrying given the rate of infection in the community, the resurgence of the virus in nursing homes and the increase in people over the age of 65 contracting this virus.<\/p> <p>It seems that the Government does not have its eye on the ball and does not have a grasp on what is needed to ensure people can live safely alongside the virus.  This came across strongly in what the T&aacute;naiste had to say last night.  He expressed his concern about mental health, isolation and poverty.  If the Government is really concerned about these things then take action next week in the budget.<\/p> <p> Is the Taoiseach concerned at the lack of capacity in intensive care?  Does he accept that we now need to urgently increase ICU capacity as we enter winter in this pandemic?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100600003#A00200","speaker":"1466","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1601989500,"counter":8,"content":"<p>Unity of purpose on all fronts is essential in dealing with a pandemic of this scale and severity, including within this House.  The Deputy has consistently sought in recent times to undermine not just the efforts of the Government but those of the HSE in the context of acute hospital care, testing capacity and so forth.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy has now misrepresented the telephone conversation she had with me yesterday when she said I could not give her assurances.  That is not true and she has no right to misrepresent a phone call of that importance.  I took her in good faith.  The Deputy made clear to me that it would be catastrophic to move to level 5.  She could not understand how we could move from level 2 to level 5 and I agreed with her on that.<\/p>  <p>  I take seriously the advice from NPHET about the exponential growth of case numbers.  The situation out there is serious in terms of the growth of cases.  That is why we have moved to level 3 in accordance with the Government's graduated plan, which involved discussions with NPHET prior to its formulation and publication.  I believe we have an obligation to the public and to industry, business and jobs.  There is an expectation they should have a sense of knowing when we could move from level 2 to level 3, level 3 to level 4 and level 4 to level 5.<\/p>  <p>  Given that the advice we received on Thursday was to basically stay at level 2 outside of counties Dublin and Donegal, to then move on Sunday to level 5 would have been an enormous shock to people and jobs.  The Government must take wider issues into consideration.  To be fair to NPHET and the Chief Medical Officer, CMO, they have to advise on public health grounds.  We take that advice seriously and I have great respect for the CMO and NPHET.  I have known the CMO for a long time and served with him during my time as Minister for Health.  At that stage, he was deputy CMO and worked with me on the SARS-CoV-2 situation.<\/p>  <p>  What must also be acknowledged, and I believe the CMO does, is simply that the impact of moving to level 5 would have been severe on the lives of many people.  I spoke to him before the Cabinet decision because it is not something I recommended to the Cabinet or that the Cabinet decided upon lightly as one wants a common approach to this.  We know from our analysis of the pandemic to date that lockdowns affect lower paid people, those in lower income groups and the marginalised more.  When schools close, disadvantaged students lose out.  Notwithstanding that we have provided for the continuation of education at level 5, there is no guarantee that would happen.  One must foresee all eventualities.  Disadvantaged children suffered most during the lockdown when schools were closed and, likewise, in terms of income streams, impact on employment, workers and young people.  Young people do not have savings to fall back on and will suffer enormously in a level 5 scenario.  These are serious and profound decisions with profound impacts on society and the economy.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy said the country was not ready because of cuts to services.  That is not the case.  It is the enormity of what a lockdown does.  We are already looking at a budget next week when we will have a substantial deficit of well over &euro;20 billion.  We are projecting similar figures for the entirety of 2021.  The intervention to support people has been unprecedented.  At one stage, more than 1 million people were on the Government payroll during the lockdown.  We are looking at hundreds of thousands of people being made unemployed once we get to level 5, so it is not unreasonable for Government to take stock before deciding to go to that level in one fell swoop knowing the implications it would have on economic sustainability in the longer term.<\/p> <p>Already pandemic unemployment payments have cost about &euro;3.6 billion which is fine.  It is vital and just.  It will move to &euro;5.2 billion.  Yesterday we decided at this stage not to move to level 5, but it is in all our hands collectively to avoid having to go to level 4 and level 5.  The only way we can do that is by ensuring we contain the virus by our individual behaviours and our collective behaviour.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100600004#B00200","speaker":"1458","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1601989800,"counter":10,"content":"<p>The Government cut the pandemic unemployment payment and the wage subsidy.  That is the reality.  For all of those in low paid work to whom the Taoiseach referred, and whom he correctly said are disproportionately affected by a very severe lockdown, let me tell him that the fact the Government cut these important supports looms large and is to the forefront of their thoughts when there is any talk of a complete lockdown, because those are the supports they rely on to pay their bills and to live.<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach said the Government has to foresee all eventualities.  I absolutely agree with him.  More is the pity that back in 2009, when we had 289 intensive care beds and when we knew at that stage that that was grossly insufficient, he and others in government did not have the foresight to plan for proper capacity.  The truth is this.  We are now reaping the harvest of more than a decade of underinvestment in our public health system.  The truth is that we do not have the necessary capacity to reassure the public and even to reassure NPHET that we can make it through the autumn and winter months.

It is one of the few countries still in a position to meet demand and is exceeding demand right now.  That includes all the serial testing.  Significant progress has been made on testing over the last five or six months, but it never gets acknowledged by Deputy McDonald or by others.  Of course, we can do better and can go further, but testing across the board has made a quantum leap forward in recent months.<\/p>  <p>  An additional 810 general beds have been put into the system.  By the time the winter plan, costing about &euro;600 million, is implemented there will be a further 1,400 beds in total if the 800 beds are added to 590 beds that will be provided under the winter initiative.  By any yardstick in such a short space of time that is significant progress.  It gives us the capability and capacity not just to deal with the impact of Covid, but the non-Covid services as well, which was one of the factors in our decision yesterday.  We did not want to shut down non-Covid services given the challenges they are currently facing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100600005#C00500","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1601989800,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I raise the issue of direct provision and quarantining in the Dundalk area.  In the centre of Dundalk, the Carroll village apartment centre is currently used as a direct provision centre and has been since 2005.  The number of asylum seekers it houses varies from around 50 to 80.  It is known as an own-door-type accommodation and is self-contained accommodation.  I understand that approximately half of the residents have been there for five years or more.<\/p> <p>The building itself is on the old P.J. Carroll site at the northern end of the town and is very well known to locals.  Last week, it was reported on local radio that 80 Covid tests were carried out on residents of the Carroll Village centre on 20 September and that those swabs were subsequently mislaid or lost.  The Taoiseach can imagine that this has caused great concern locally and many questions are now being asked.  I understand that subsequent tests have been carried out.  We need to find out exactly how these tests could go missing.  It is important we get answers and find out if this was an isolated, once-off case or if there were many more cases.  We need clarification as to whether this was an isolated case.<\/p> <p> The Carroll Village centre is situated on the main commercial street in Dundalk and people are asking if proper public health guidelines on self-isolation and quarantine are being adhered to should a resident test positive for Covid.  On quarantine, a local hotel on the outskirts of Dundalk, not far from the Carroll Village centre, is being used as a quarantine centre.  Again, my understanding is that those in direct provision who need to self-isolate or quarantine are being directed to this facility for a two-week isolation period.  I believe the centre is housing people from all over the country for this purpose.  As the Taoiseach can imagine, this is causing great concern for people locally.  The local hotel in question has been used for this purpose since the beginning of September.<\/p> <p> The Taoiseach can appreciate my many concerns about these centres.  First, regarding the Carroll Village centre, can the Taoiseach confirm whether the original 80 test swabs were mislaid?  Can he also confirm that replacement tests were carried out?  Can he confirm that the proper public health guidelines are being observed should a resident test positive for Covid?  On the quarantine centre, I have a very real concern about the means of transport those who need to use the centre are using.  The facility is located approximately 2 km from Dundalk town centre and, as I said, it is accepting people from all over the country.  Does the Department provide the necessary transport for those going to the facility or do the users avail of public transport, which would be a clear breach of public health guidelines?  Furthermore, when a resident's period of self-isolation is completed, what methods of transport are being used to these facilities?  These are real concerns that need to be urgently addressed.  The people of Dundalk, like those of the rest of the country, have made tremendous sacrifice and effort to combat this virus.  We need to ensure we all work together and follow the same guidelines so we can all get back to some form of normality.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100600005#C00600","speaker":"1600","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1601990100,"counter":16,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue given the concerns locally.  Protecting those living in direct provision accommodation centres from any Covid-19 outbreak has been an absolute priority of Government.  A comprehensive programme of serial Covid-19 testing by the HSE has been completed across 66 accommodation centres.  My understanding is about 3,300 tests have been undertaken in direct provision centres and about 18 positive tests have emerged from that testing programme.  That is a positivity rate of 0.53% among residents and staff.  I will endeavour to bring clarity to the points the Deputy raised in the context of local media highlighting these issues.  The transfer of residents from Dublin to Dundalk has created some degree of confusion locally.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy knows, there are two international protection accommodation services facilities in Dundalk, Carroll Village and the Carnbeg re-accommodation facility.  Carroll Village independent living is a block of apartment-style independent living units housing mostly family groups.  The Department of Justice and Equality has confirmed there has been no large-scale transfer of residents either in or out of this centre in recent months.  Routine testing as part of the Covid-19 serial testing programme was completed recently at Carroll Village.  As I said, this was one of the public health measures put in place by the HSE and the Department of Justice and Equality to safeguard residents and staff in direct provision centres since the beginning of this pandemic.  The HSE's investigation into the specific incident the Deputy highlighted found there was an isolated logistics issue whereby swabs did not reach the laboratory within the required timeframe.  As the swabs had expired, they had to be retaken in line with standard practice.  The HSE has apologised for the inconvenience this caused to the residents concerned and it conducted on-site follow-up testing on Friday, 2 October to complete this serial testing and all results have now been communicated at this point.<\/p>  <p>  The Carnbeg Hotel, which opened earlier this year, is used as emergency, temporary accommodation for people who willingly left their accommodation centre at the start of the pandemic and are now seeking to be re-accommodated by the International Protection Accommodation Service, IPAS.<\/p> <p>To be clear, the Departments of Justice and Equality and Education have confirmed the Carnbeg Hotel was not affected by the retaking of tests in recent days.  This facility is used for 14-day quarantine prior to re-accommodation in a dedicated accommodation centre.  It has a regular turnover of temporary residents.

Three days later, it recommended a move to level 5 nationally, in effect reinstating the lockdown from the spring and early summer.  NPHET has pointed to an increase in the 14-day incidence rate in over-65s and 31 outbreaks in nursing homes, seven of which were reported in the last week.<\/p> <p>There are 25 open outbreaks among vulnerable groups, with ten in direct provision centres, seven in homeless settings and another seven in Traveller communities.  NPHET also made a point about increasing admissions to hospital and ICU beds, with 243 of 281 critical care beds now occupied.<\/p> <p> Why are we in this situation?  The Taoiseach and the Government had months over the summer to prepare for the inevitable second wave.  Why are there still only 38 high-dependency beds in the public system?  We all knew the perilous state our public health system was in when this pandemic struck in February and March.  We were overly reliant on acute hospitals, emergency departments, EDs, with a bed-occupancy rate of 95% and a severe shortage of ICU beds.  Germany, for example, has 37 ICU beds per 100,000 of its population whereas we have 6.5 ICU beds per 100,000.  <\/p> <p> It was only last week that we had a discussion in this Chamber about the proposed HSE winter plan.  Serious questions have been raised by organisations representing nurses, doctors and consultants about our ability to deliver on the plan, particularly the increase in qualified staff that would be necessary to deliver on it.<\/p> <p> I must also raise the issue of track and trace.  I note that in the winter plan it is only by November that the necessary levels of staff dedicated to providing track and trace will be reached, allowing HSE personnel currently operating in the system to return to their normal duties.  Can we continue to meet the level of 100,000 tests and traces per week?<\/p> <p> Having flattened the curve due to the lockdown in the early part of the year, there was an opportunity to prepare that was not taken.  We can contrast that with how quickly the Government moved to end the bans on evictions and rent increases and cut the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, and temporary wage subsidy scheme.  The move to level 3 nationally will put thousands of jobs at risk, particularly in the hospitality sector.  The Restaurants Association of Ireland is warning that 180,000 jobs are at risk.  It is entirely possible that the Government will be forced into a turn in the next couple of weeks and will move to level 5.  Such a move would have catastrophic effects on jobs and livelihoods, as the Taoiseach has said.  He has also made the point that those on the lowest pay are most affected by the restrictions under level 3 and would be most affected by the restrictions at level 5.  Will the Taoiseach make a statement that in next week's budget, the Government will restore the PUP and the wage subsidy scheme to their previous levels?  Will he introduce a ban on evictions and rent increases?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100600009#G02600","speaker":"1569","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1601992500,"counter":76,"content":"<p>The Deputy is correct to say that we received advice on Thursday and Sunday.  A lot has been done in public service and about capacity in acute services since the first lockdown in March.  What is increasingly happening is that non-Covid-19 issues are being dealt with.  That is why quite a substantial number of ICU beds are being used - they are predominantly being used for non-Covid purposes.  That is the reality.  With the winter initiative included, we are looking at a 30% increase in ICU capacity.  ICU is not just about the provision of a bed, it obviously also comes with a large complement of staff.<\/p>  <p>  There will also be substantial increases in the numbers of general hospital beds.  Including the measures in the winter initiative, an additional 1,400 beds will have been created in our general hospital system.  I think it has been overstated that the system is run down, although it has challenges.  The health system managed the first phase of the pandemic well within its capacity.  The HSE is clear that it has the capacity to deal with the current situation.  It will obviously have to watch the growth in positive cases, hospital admissions and admissions to ICU.  There are many hospitals around the country that have no Covid patients in their ICUs at the moment.  That is true of many hospitals around the country and must be factored in.  Quite a lot of counties will be aggrieved that they are at level 3 because people there will feel they ought to have stayed at level 2, given their numbers.  We decided to take on board the advice from NPHET that there was a growth trajectory that needed to be arrested.  People in counties such as Tipperary, Waterford, Mayo and Kerry will be looking at their numbers of infection and wondering why are they going to level 3.  I understand that.  It is a severe hit for the hospitality sector in those counties and parts of others.  <\/p> <p>Moving to level 3 has very significant implications and impacts for the hospitality, tourism, arts and culture sectors in the counties that up to now were not at level 3 - those outside Dublin and Donegal.  Could one imagine what it would be like if we had moved to level 5 by midnight tonight in terms of the economic impact, the impact on jobs and so on?  We have to take the broader picture into consideration.   I will not pre-empt the budget but in the budget we will look to see if we can do something more specific for people in certain categories of work or sectors.  The pandemic unemployment payment was originally designed as a 12-week scheme and was rushed into this House, and everybody agreed with it in the context of it being a temporary scheme.  It is now being extended to April, along with the wage subsidy scheme.  By April, &euro;5.2 billion will have been spent on the pandemic unemployment payment.  That is an enormous sum of money for just one social welfare payment.  Social welfare spending overall will go well beyond &euro;30 billion by next April.  We have to consider the financial and economic impacts well beyond April 2021 and we are now factoring in what the situation will be to the end of 2021 in terms of the economic and fiscal impacts of Covid-19.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100600010#H00200","speaker":"1458","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1601992800,"counter":78,"content":"<p>Many people in Dublin and Donegal have lost their jobs over the past few weeks.

There is an exponential growth in the numbers.  It is low in about eight or nine counties, including County Kerry, but it is growing in those counties too.

The purpose of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (Amendment) Bill 2020 is to protect workers in their workplaces.  The Bill makes a straightforward amendment to the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act to make workplace outbreaks of Covid-19 notifiable to the Health and Safety Authority, HSA.  The proactive notification and surveillance of Covid-19 is key to ensuring that we do not end up with clusters of the virus in workplaces, as has been happening throughout this pandemic.  Some might be shocked to learn that workplace outbreaks of Covid-19 are currently not notifiable to the HSA as occupational illness, due to a lacuna in the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act.  We are outliers in Europe in this regard and when we look at other countries like Spain, where Covid is classified as a workplace injury.  In June, I published this Bill to make workplace outbreaks of Covid-19 notifiable to the Health and Safety Authority.  I was compelled to publish the legislation due to the failure of the then Minister, Deputy Humphreys, to use her powers under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act to amend regulations to provide that occurrences of Covid-19 in the workplace would be notifiable to the Health and Safety Authority.<\/p><p>This failure has been compounded by the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, who is now responsible for workers' health and safety and, I shudder to think of it, workers' rights.  He does the very opposite of what his title would suggest.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, has been to the fore campaigning for this change and has written to the relevant Ministers on a number of occasions requesting that this simple change be made.  On 24 July ICTU met the T&aacute;naiste to discuss the issue of notifiable illnesses and diseases being reportable to the HSA.  This, however, resulted in no change to the law and no additional protections.  At the stroke of a pen, the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Varadkar, could make workplace outbreaks of Covid-19 notifiable to the HSA.  Unfortunately he has point-blank refused to do this.  This is in stark contrast to his performance last night, when he tried to portray himself as someone who has concern for workers.  Thrashing public health officials and gaslighting the nation that he has concern for low-income workers is pretty counter-intuitive.  He talks about workers and he refuses to legislate for protections for workers' health and safety.  He talks about poverty and votes against D&aacute;il motions to combat child poverty and introduce a living wage.  He talks about mental health as if his party had not spent the last nine years gutting and underfunding our mental health services.  Indeed, we will see how far the Government's concern for the less fortunate extends this week when we vote on restoring the cuts made to the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP.  The failure of the T&aacute;naiste to do what this Bill seeks to do in making Covid-19 notifiable is proof of his attitude and the attitude of the Government to workers.<\/p> <p>One only has to look at the alarming rise in the rates of infection for health care workers which has trebled in recent weeks from 100 per fortnight to 300 per fortnight.  This Bill is intended to protect workers who simply cannot work from home.  These people work in meat factories, food processing plants and supply chains to get the food to our supermarkets, in nursing homes and hospitals, respite centres, shops and on building sites.  These people are our garda&iacute;, prison officers, Army personnel and many more.  Ordinary workers have been put in danger because of the failure to legislate for this.<\/p> <p> At the time of publishing the Bill in June I stated that given evidence of the incidents of Covid-19 in workplaces such as meat factories and health facilities during the lockdown period this change absolutely must be made and if it was not workers would again be put in danger.  It is with great regret that we have seen this become a reality across countless workplaces.<\/p> <p> The aim of this legislation is to protect workers in all workplaces whether they are in a meat plant, a care home, on a building site or in an office block in the International Financial Services Centre, IFSC.  It can be done by statutory instrument but the T&aacute;naiste refuses to do this.  Therefore, I am left with no option but to table this legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100600017#P00800","speaker":"1467","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1601997000,"counter":177,"content":"<p>Is the Bill opposed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100600018#Q00200","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1601997000,"counter":178,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100600018#Q00300","speaker":"1475"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1601997000,"counter":179,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1601997000,"counter":180,"content":"<p>Since this is a Private Members' Bill, Second Stage must, under Standing Orders, be taken in Private Members' time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100600018#Q00500","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1601997000,"counter":181,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be taken in Private Members' time.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100600018#Q00600","speaker":"1467"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1601997000,"counter":182,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Thirty-ninth Amendment of the Constitution (Right to a Home) Bill 2020: First Stage","time":1601997000,"counter":183,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100600018#Q00800"},{"type":"speech","time":1601997000,"counter":184,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThat leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to amend the Constitution. <\/blockquote>  <p>As Deputies across the House will be aware, the housing crisis has not gone away.  Rents are still unsustainably high.  In fact, the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, index published last week shows rents have increased 1.8% State-wide in the last 12 months and 3.3% outside of the greater Dublin area.  Three counties in particular, namely, counties Carlow, Roscommon and Mayo, have seen rents increase in the last 12 months from 7% to 9%.  It is now &euro;1,226 per month to rent State-wide and a shocking &euro;1,653 in Dublin.  Indeed, new rents in many parts of the city are now above &euro;2,000 per month for a standard two-bedroom apartment or house.<\/p><p>House prices are also still shockingly high.  The latest data from Daft.ie shows house prices in Dublin averaging at &euro;379,000 and &euro;260,000 State-wide.  The fact is that too many working people cannot access secure or affordable accommodation.  An Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, report published last week looking at the impact of Covid-19 concluded that private sector output is going to fall, further widening the gap between supply and demand and pushing ever more working people away from owning or renting their own home.<\/p><p>When we look at homelessness the figures are equally bleak.  Officially, 8,702 adults and children are classified as homeless in this State.  The real figure, however, is more than 10,000 when one includes those continually trapped in direct provision despite having received leave to remain, effectively, using direct provision centres as emergency accommodation or, indeed, those many hundreds of women and children in Tusla-funded domestic violence refuges or those in hostels not funded by the State such as the Regina Coeli Hostel and the Morning Star in Dublin.<\/p><p>We have also seen an alarming rise in the deaths of people in emergency accommodation or sleeping rough.  By the midway point of this year, the same number of people had been found dead than in all of last year or, indeed, the year before.<\/p><p>All this is a direct consequence of the under provision of social housing, a lack of Housing First tenancies, an over-reliance on congregated emergency accommodation and adequate addiction and mental health supports.  Currently, more than 100,000 households are in need of social housing when one adds those on local authority lists and in receipt of short-term subsidies such as housing assistance payment, HAP, or the rental accommodation scheme, RAS.  Indeed, the new need, that is, the number of families coming onto our local authority housing waiting lists every single year, still outstripped the total number of new social homes added to the stock on an annual basis.<\/p><p>None of this is an accident.  Housing need is not a force of nature.  It is the direct result of Government policies, failure to invest enough in social and affordable housing and over-reliance on the private market to meet social and affordable housing need.  In short, Rebuilding Ireland, that is, Fine Gael's housing policy for the last four years, tacitly endorsed and supported by Fianna F&aacute;il, has abjectly failed.<\/p><p>We urgently need a new direction and at the centre of that new direction must be a human rights-based approach to housing.  The Bill I am introducing seeks to insert into the Constitution the right to appropriate and affordable housing as an obligation to eliminate homelessness.  This is not a silver bullet.  It does not guarantee every person in the State an automatic right to a free home.  It does, however, place an obligation on the Government to realise the right to housing and to eliminate homelessness progressively.<\/p><p>In 2014, the constitutional convention on social and economic rights voted by 84% to support inserting the right to housing into the Constitution.  Unfortunately, for five years the Government has ignored that recommendation.  The programme for Government has an ambiguous commitment to hold a referendum on housing and in the view of Sinn F&eacute;in this must be a referendum on a constitutional right to a home.  Inserting such a right, alongside a major and sustained investment in public housing on public land to meet social and affordable housing need, is key to ending our homeless crisis.<\/p><p>The time for prevarication is over; the time for action is now.  I commend this Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100600018#Q00900","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speech","time":1601997000,"counter":185,"content":"<p>Is the Bill opposed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100600018#Q01000","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1601997000,"counter":186,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100600018#Q01100","speaker":"1475"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1601997000,"counter":187,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1601997000,"counter":188,"content":"<p>Since this is a Private Members' Bill, Second Stage must, under Standing Orders, be taken in Private Members' time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100600018#Q01300","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1601997000,"counter":189,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be taken in Private Members' time.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100600018#Q01400","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1601997000,"counter":190,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Report of the Committee of Standing Orders and D\u00e1il Reform: Motion","time":1601997000,"counter":191,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100600018#Q01600"},{"type":"speech","time":1601997000,"counter":192,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThat, notwithstanding the Resolution of the D&aacute;il of 10th September, 2020, adopting the report of the Committee on Standing Orders and D&aacute;il Reform entitled &lsquo;Schedule of D&aacute;il sitting week until 22nd October, 2020, and changes to the Standing Orders of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann relative to Public Business&rsquo;, unless it resolves or orders otherwise, the D&aacute;il shall meet every Tuesday at 2 p.m. <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100600018#Q01700","speaker":"1475"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1601997000,"counter":193,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Ceisteanna \u2013 Questions","time":1601997000,"counter":194,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100600018#Q01900"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Administrative Arrangements","time":1601997000,"counter":195,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100600018#Q02000"},{"type":"question","time":1601997000,"counter":196,"qnumday":1,"qnumall":"[25398\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100600018#Q02100","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he will report on the work of the economic division of his Department.","asker":"1610","askee":"1458"},{"type":"question","time":1601997000,"counter":197,"qnumday":2,"qnumall":"[27098\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100600018#Q02200","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he will report on the status of the national risk assessment for 2020.

This work is focused, in particular, on the delivery of commitments in the programme for Government, for example, the development of a new national economic plan as well as co-ordination of issues which will cut across multiple Departments.<\/p>  <p>  The economic division supports the work of the Cabinet Committee on Economic Recovery and Investment, the Cabinet Committee on Housing and the Cabinet Committee on the Environment and Climate Change.  The division also leads Ireland's participation at the annual European semester process, liaises with the Central Statistics Office, CSO, and provides me with briefing and speech material on economic and related policy issues.  In addition, the division jointly leads work on preparedness for Brexit along with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and other divisions of my Department.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, the economic division is also responsible for publishing the national risk assessment, NRA, which has provided a high-level overview of strategic risks facing the country since it was first published in 2014.  Given the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic crisis and the priority attached to responding to the crisis within my Department and across Government it is not intended to publish an updated national risk assessment in 2020.  However, I intend that the national risk assessment process will resume for 2021.<\/p>  <p>  In doing so, the Department will consider any learning and examine options for further strengthening the NRA process including in light of the Covid-19 pandemic.  The intention is to evaluate how best the process can be used with a view to ensuring it can continue to play a role in identifying these strategic risks facing Ireland.  Given its role, the division works closely with colleagues in the Department of Finance and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and with colleagues in other Departments which have legal responsibility for specific policy areas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100600018#Q02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1601997000,"counter":202,"content":"<p>First, yesterday at the Taoiseach's announcement it was strongly reported that he was going to announce a new bank holiday.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100600018#Q02700","speaker":"1610"},{"type":"speech","time":1601997000,"counter":203,"content":"<p>Was I?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100600018#Q02800","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1601997600,"counter":204,"content":"<p>Yes.

What is to happen with the ban on evictions?  We are now in a different scenario from last week.  What is happening with the payment moratorium on loans and mortgages?<\/p>  <p>  The hospitality industry has a specific issue.  Last week, on Leaders' Questions, I asked the Taoiseach about sectoral requirements in the hospitality industry, the events industry, pubs and restaurants.  Obviously, the budget is coming up.  Tourism and hospitality businesses are being affected more than others.  I ask the Taoiseach to consider this.  <\/p>  <p>  On risk assessment, I know that the Taoiseach responded to me earlier on private hospitals.  The previous Minister for Health left with an agreement on ICU capacity and private hospitals sitting on his desk.  The current Minister never took it up and it is time he took it up or did something with it.  That buffer zone would give the public considerable security.  Obviously, there are issues with ICUs, but the two biggest risks which I want the Government to address in this pandemic are as follows.  The first is non-Covid healthcare.  The Taoiseach has until tomorrow to provide figures - at least I gave him a week's notice - on coronary care, cancer care, diagnosis and also how people are being treated versus last year.  The second risk, the real one, is how the Minister, despite what he announced in the winter plan, will get 12,500 staff into the system by next April.  That is the biggest risk.  I do not know how it will be done based on what I have heard so far.

Why are they getting satisfaction in some offices and not in the majority?  For example, the Intreo office in Drogheda will process the claims, but Intreo offices in other areas are not doing so.

The testing and tracing capacity has been significantly enhanced with an onshore laboratory capacity for 100,000 tests and 2,000 per day offshore.<\/p> <p>We are currently increasing capacity onshore for November and December and we will continue to have offshore capacity during the winter period.  As such, there has been a very significant ramping-up of the testing situation.  A total of 90% of our tests are completed end to end in less than three days, more than 91% of GP referrals get an appointment in less than 24 hours, more than 95% of people get the result less than 48 hours following the swabbing appointment and overall end to end, the period between the referral and the end of tracing median is less than two days.  There has been substantial progress and it is time to acknowledge that.  It is not where it was in March; it is far better.  There are higher volumes.  We are testing far more now than we did in the early part of the pandemic and that has to be accepted.<\/p> <p> On the hospital system, there has been a 30% increase in ICUs once the winter initiative is implemented: 25% since March and a further 17 as a result of the winter initiative.  Admittedly it will be challenging to get the staff but the funding has been made available.  It is the largest funding for a winter initiative ever in the history of the health service.  It is designed to try to increase capacity both on the ICU side and also on the general hospital side, to increase staffing and to release healthcare staff who had come to the rescue in the early phase of the pandemic back to their front-line services.  Substantial recruitment is under way and as I said earlier concerning contact tracers and swabbers, very significant progress is being made on that front.  No proposal was left on any desk on private sector capacity.  The HSE has been continually negotiating and that is ongoing.  There is a bridging agreement of &euro;25 million.  It has completed a new procurement agreement to deal with diagnostics and general services, and negotiations are ongoing about need in the event of a surge. <\/p> <p> The PUP was originally meant as a 12-week provision.  It has been opened to new entrants and, therefore, anyone who is laid off as a result of us going to level 3 will be able to avail of it; it has been extended out to April of next year.  The Government has to look at beyond April 2021 to make the PUP sustainable.  It also has to look at other social welfare recipients.  There are 213,000 people on jobseeker's allowance on &euro;203 per week and then there are carers and lone parents and the whole area of child poverty.  There is a range of payments across social protection that we have got to look at as well in addition to all of the other commitments.  Deputies are having an each-way bet.  On the one hand, Deputy McDonald talks about thousands being laid off in hospitality because of a Government decision.  Covid has forced that decision.

Of the &euro;11.4 million spent to date, &euro;4.2 million was on advertising in publications and &euro;5.8 million on broadcast advertising.  Since March, my Department has co-ordinated communications for the whole-of-government response to the pandemic and this necessitated expenditure on a broad range of targeted public information campaigns.<\/p>  <p>  The overall communications strategy for Covid-19 is based on a co-ordinated response that ensures maximum clarity for citizens, business and our wider community.  This aligns both with WHO and European Centre for Disease Control, ECDC, advice, both of which emphasise the importance of ensuring the general public is aware of the seriousness of the Covid-19 outbreak and, further, that a high degree of population understanding, community engagement and acceptance of the measures put in place are key in preventing further spread.<\/p>  <p>  It is also recommended that communications strategies should target different audiences and provide the rationale behind the measures, also outlining the necessity of putting a support system in place to provide essential services and supplies, for example, food and medication, and to monitor vulnerable individuals.  It was also necessary to run campaigns at each phase of the roadmap as restrictions were lifted.  The campaigns associated with the roadmap were aimed at giving people time to prepare so businesses could be ready to open.  Campaigns were developed to ensure businesses were aware of the broad level of supports being made available to them by Government and to raise awareness of the Return to Work Safely Protocol and the July jobs stimulus package which was focused on restoring confidence and investment in the recovery.<\/p>  <p>  More recently, public information campaigns have been run as restrictions were placed, and then subsequently lifted, in regions such as counties Kildare, Laois and Offaly and when counties Dublin and Donegal were placed under level 3 restrictions.  In all such cases, it is essential that citizens, business owners and communities are informed of the decisions being made by Government, and campaigns are developed and implemented to make the public aware of these decisions.<\/p>  <p>  In 2019, the spend included &euro;12,000 on online advertising and &euro;17,000 on video and radio production.  My Department paid for public information campaigns on budgets 2019 and 2020, public consultation notices for draft language schemes and for the V&oacute;t&aacute;il 100 commemorations.  There was also expenditure for advertisements relating to the recruitment of judges and the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, IBRC, Commission, which is an independent statutory commission that contracted services to manage their public relations responsibilities.<\/p>  <p>  In 2018. the &euro;1.6 million spend was across online, print and broadcast advertising and production costs.  This spend related to major cross-government public information campaigns that the Department funded centrally.  These campaigns included Healthy Ireland, Global Ireland, Project Ireland 2040 and the self-employed benefits campaign, aimed at ensuring self-employed people are aware of the new and existing benefits available to them. <\/p>  <p>  In 2017, the &euro;40,000 spend related to cross-government public information campaigns on Healthy Ireland and self-employed benefits.<\/p>  <p>  In 2016, the &euro;10,000 spend related to the Home to Work information campaign.<\/p>  <p>  A detailed annual breakdown of the advertising spend will accompany the reply to the questions.  The Department does not engage third party media monitoring services.  As part of the press office&rsquo;s normal operation, both traditional print and social media are monitored for content of relevance to the work of the Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100600020#S01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1601998200,"counter":225,"content":"<p>Under the previous Government, the decision was made that all online advertising would go through the Taoiseach's office.  Is that still the case?  What controls are in place to monitor Government spending?  Perhaps the Taoiseach will furnish us with a report on and breakdown of Government spending on this.  There is no doubt that there need to be controls.  A sum of &euro;2 million is large and I am concerned there might be another agenda at play.  We are all familiar with the CervicalCheck scandal, which was a shocking situation that happened in this country, and with the amount of coverage it received internationally.  Strangely, if one Googles the words \"cervical check Ireland\" one will note the first page of results omits any mention of the scandal whatsoever in any news reports.  The first page is all Government advertisements.  Now perhaps that indicates a very ambitious Government looking to advertise the services available but it is strange there are just enough ads on that page to push all news items to the next page.  Again I figured that there was probably nothing wrong here, but it is worth considering that these ads were still being run during the pandemic when there was a Government decision that those screening services would stop.  We had a full page of search-optimised adverts running right through the pandemic when women could not access those services at all.  Why did the Government continue to spend money on advertising when those services were not available?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100600020#S01400","speaker":"1504"},{"type":"speech","time":1601998200,"counter":226,"content":"<p>The Taoiseach ran out of time earlier but he might inform the House why he bottled the announcement of 21 December as a bank holiday.

What is he doing differently?How much less is he going to spend than his predecessor <i>pro rata<\/i>?  To date, in the 100 or days since his appointment what is that figure as a proportion?  He was quite critical and we have to continue his critical analysis now he is Taoiseach to see what the money is being spent on and whether there is oversight of it because some concerns are emanating about it.

I ask one thing of the Taoiseach, which I know he did not get to answer earlier.  We have to communicate to the public and get across the difference between bloody visors and proper masks.

There is a tendency for the Government to insult the intelligence of the public and not to believe in their wisdom.  In the end, these debates are forced out.  Last week, I organised a briefing about zero Covid at which it was argued that we a need a debate about strategy.  A week later, we are having a debate about strategy.  It has been forced on the Government but there is massive confusion.  Advice from NPHET says one thing, the Taoiseach dismisses it and the T&aacute;naiste absolutely rubbishes NPHET but where is the information and the evidence?

Likewise, in terms of the various levels we went to in Kildare and so on, various campaigns have to kick in on all media platforms in terms of what is allowed and not allowed, what the new regime and new restrictions mean, the business supports required in order that businesses can apply for restart grants, how to apply for rates relief, how to apply for various schemes that can support businesses and so on, as well as information for the public.  It has been quite comprehensive.  We need to continue with these information campaigns at all levels to make sure the members of the public are aware of their entitlements and what the restrictions themselves mean.  We will be giving a detailed breakdown on the spend and we will circulate it to Deputies.<\/p>  <p>  There is no control freak approach on issues.  It seems that the Business Committee meets on Thursday and, as I said earlier, every Tuesday there is a call for something to be added.  This seems to be the stock in trade and the norm on how it operates.  No matter what the Business Committee agrees on a Thursday, I can guarantee that on the following Tuesday when we open, there will be a demand for something else.  I have no issue with having debates on aspects of this but the Oireachtas participated in a debate on the plan, which allowed for a graduated response.<\/p>  <p>  We did not dismiss NPHET's recommendation.  The Government published a plan three weeks ago.  It has to take wider societal issues into consideration.  It has to take the economy and employment into consideration.  Of course, public health is uppermost.  The whole idea of the plan is that people could anticipate or expect that if we are at level 2 and things are getting worse, we might go to level 3, then to level 4 and then level 5.  Sometimes the virus may not respect that but everybody was taken aback on Sunday when there was a suggestion that most counties would move from level 2 to level 5 in one fell swoop.  It would have had enormous implications for many enterprises and businesses and many people working.  It would have been the lower paid and young people who would have suffered most if we had moved to level 5 in that way.<\/p>  <p>  At this stage, the Government has taken a view that we did not think it would be proportionate or the right course of action to go to level 5.

Its initial focus was on developing the July jobs stimulus.  The July jobs stimulus, a package of over &euro;7 billion worth of measures, was announced by the Government on 23 July.  It is designed to stimulate a jobs-led recovery and to build economic confidence, while continuing to manage the impact of Covid-19.  It includes measures to extend income and employment supports to affected individuals and companies, to help people get back into work, training or education, to build confidence among businesses and support them through the months ahead, to invest in job-rich infrastructure projects in every part of the country and to invest in areas of future growth like the green economy.<\/p>  <p>  Issues relevant to the transport sector can arise, as required, at a number of Cabinet committees, most notably the Cabinet committee on economic recovery and investment.<\/p> <p>They can also arise at the Cabinet committee on environment and climate change.

Instead, it turned a blind eye to the outbreaks in meat factories, ignored the calls for sick pay for workers and wound down the level of testing.  It took the decision to accelerate through the phases and to reopen the economy, under pressure of lobbying from businesses and for the image of the then Taoiseach, now T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Varadkar.  Unfortunately, the same approach of allowing the interests of private, short-term profit to stand before public health is being pursued by the Government.  Despite urging others to follow medical advice, the Taoiseach is not following the recommendations of NPHET.  What we saw last night from the T&aacute;naiste was disgraceful.  The result will be more outbreaks, more deaths and more lockdowns.<\/p>  <p>  Does the Taoiseach not accept that it is likely that the Government will be forced to go to level 5 in any case but later, for longer and after more deaths?  NPHET in its letter to the Government was clear that a gradual approach will not have a sufficient or timely impact.  Sometimes people say this is the Government putting the economy before public health.  It is actually only short-term profit being put first, however.

Martin in Blackrock, who I mentioned earlier, repeats his invitation for the Taoiseach to, in all seriousness, sit down with him, Eilish, Viv, Helen and others to talk to them about why they are there and what they expect of the Government to ensure they get just treatment.<\/p>  <p>  I cannot understand why the Government will not restore the pandemic unemployment payment.  There is no difference between now and March in terms of the bills, mortgages, financial pressures and so on facing people who have lost their jobs as a result of the pandemic.  How does the Taoiseach think people whose work has been stopped and whose income has been drastically reduced as a result of the pandemic are going to pay their bills?

It is not reasonable nor is it proportionate for the State to impose restrictions which keep people away from work.  That is what public health restrictions do.  They are a necessary intervention of last resort.  One can do that on the one hand and then cut the supports on which people rely on the other hand.  That is patently unfair.

The performing arts have suffered considerably in view of the fact that much of the work done by those in the sector is face to face with the public and audiences.  They were among the first sectors to close and will continue to experience difficult and challenging times long after other sectors have returned to work.<\/p>  <p>  A particular focus of my approach and that of my Department is to engage in continuous and extensive consultation with all stakeholders, including individual artists, arts organisations, representative bodies, producers and art practices.  This engagement is invaluable and has deepened my awareness of the challenges that artists, performers and organisations face, and of the important role they have played in sustaining us all in recent months.<\/p>  <p>  The Arts Council is the statutory body charged with supporting and developing the arts in Ireland.  It is statutorily independent in its funding decisions and I, as Minister, cannot intervene in this function.  The council received an initial allocation of &euro;80 million in 2020.  This has been increased by more than 30% to &euro;105 million to allow the council to address the crisis in the sector.  Among the measures introduced by the council are new and additional bursaries and commissions, including supports for freelance artists and those looking to develop projects on a collaborative basis.<\/p>  <p>  I have a background in music and performance and am acutely aware of the challenges being faced by artists and musicians across the country as a result of this devastating pandemic.  Many artists and musicians operating in the commercial sector have sought funding from the Arts Council this year.  The council provides funding to professional artists in all art forms and genres.<\/p> <p>It is important to note that the council has reported that to date in 2020 a very significant proportion of its grants to individuals were made to artists who had never before received Arts Council funding.  They represent people who would normally be fully employed in the commercial sector.<\/p> <p> I will turn now to the July stimulus package and give the House a description of the work which has been done over the past few months in rolling out the stimulus.  In the area of culture, creativity and the arts, the stimulus is designed to create opportunities for professional artists and creatives, and their support staff, through increased support for the Arts Council, live production, live performance and specific measures targeted at musicians.  A key objective of this funding is to provide enhanced support for freelance arts workers who have been impacted severely by the Covid-19 public health emergency.  The stimulus announced a new &euro;10 million culture fund to include increased funding for Creative Ireland to employ artists through the creative youth and creative communities programmes and funding to support the commissioning of artists to produce creative content for national broadcast and for Eala&iacute;n na Gaeltachta for new artists bursaries and art activities in Gaeltacht schools. <\/p> <p> Musicians and music performers across all genres face particular difficulties.  The music stimulus package, which is part of the culture fund, is a dedicated fund of &euro;1 million for musicians.  It involves three funding schemes designed to help sustain the popular and commercial music sector across a diverse range of genres, including rock, pop, hip-hop, indie, jazz, country and western and traditional and folk.  It is designed to stimulate areas of work which artists would usually fund with income from their own sources, including live event fees. <\/p> <p> The three schemes are targeted at professional musicians and their teams and will support songwriting camps, recordings and album releases.  The aim is to ensure Irish musicians, engineers, PR, media, agents, labels and publishers can continue to develop and share their work while Covid restrictions are in place.  The music stimulus package schemes are being managed on behalf of the Department by First Music Contact and there was an extremely strong interest in the call which had a closing date of yesterday.  Applications will now be assessed by an expert music peer panel. <\/p> <p> The additional moneys allocated in this job stimulus package includes an increase in the Arts Council 2020 allocation from &euro;100 million to &euro;105 million, some 40% higher than in 2019.  Among other initiatives, the additional moneys allow the council to increase to 164 the number of creative schools in the 2020-21 academic year.  This brings the total number of participating schools to 314 this year.  It also allows for an increase in the grants to each creative school from &euro;2,000 to &euro;3,100.  Consideration for diversity and inclusion within arts initiatives remains hugely important and all of the additional schools entering the programme have been selected from applicant DEIS schools.  Some 50 of the schools starting in creative schools this year have DEIS status.<\/p> <p> A sum of &euro;1 million in extra supports was made available to help key cultural organisations in receipt of annual funding from the Department to deal with the difficulties of operating in a Covid-19 world.  These organisations house collections of movable cultural heritage of national importance or are unique in the country and relate to matters of national interest.  They include Comhaltas Ceolt&oacute;ir&iacute; &Eacute;ireann, the Hunt Museum, Archbishop Marsh's Library, the National Print Museum and Foynes Flying Boat &amp;amp; Maritime Museum. <\/p> <p> Capital funding of &euro;6 million is available to accelerate the redevelopment and renewal of our national cultural institutions envisaged under the national development plan.  Over the coming 18 months, we will seek to complete the design and planning phases of a number of these iconic buildings with a view to commencing construction in 2021.  Highlights under this programme of capital investment include the reimagined and significant restoration of the National Library.  The National Archives redevelopment will see our valuable trove of State archive material rehoused.  Advanced design and planning works will commence at the National Concert Hall and at the Crawford Art Gallery to enhance this cornerstone building in a regenerated city plaza in Cork city.<\/p> <p> The additional capital in the July stimulus has allowed me to allocate funding to the Irish Museum of Modern Art to invest in a new collections management system, as well as to the National Concert Hall for the purchase of video infrastructure for ongoing high quality live streaming, a particularly innovative response to the crisis.  A sum of &euro;10 million was provided for a pilot performance and production support package to support the live performance and audiovisual production sector.  Of this, &euro;5 million was allocated to a pilot live performance support scheme.  <\/p> <p> I am conscious of the unprecedented nature of the challenge facing live performance promoters and producers, not least from a financial point of view, and the wider impact that has on the sector's ecosystem of freelance performers, technicians and creative artists, particularly those dependent on its visibility for their income and livelihoods.  It should also be noted that the live entertainment sector is worth an estimated &euro;3.5 billion annually to the economy and employs 35,000 people.  The pilot scheme is designed to assist and establish commercial promoters of live performances in music and theatre to provide employment to workers in the creative industries.  <\/p> <p> The scheme will help to de-risk the cost of preparing for new productions which may subsequently have to be postponed, cancelled or curtailed due to restrictions to safeguard public health.  The main objectives of the scheme are to provide employment opportunities in the ticketed performing sector, allow commercial organisers of live performances to commence preparations immediately and allow productions to go ahead in the near future, while also complying with public health protection measures.  This scheme has been developed in conjunction with the sector and will be managed directly by my Department.  There have been a significant number of applications which are being assessed at present and allocations will made on the basis of the number of people being employed.  I hope to announce the recipients of this funding in the coming weeks.<\/p> <p> The balance of the production support package was allocated to Screen Ireland, which put in place a pilot &euro;5 million production continuation fund for film and television projects to assist production companies with the uncertainties caused by Covid-19.  The fund will help to cover costs incurred where production must be halted as a result of an incident related to Covid-19 in circumstances not covered by other insurances.  The maximum made available to any one production shall be &euro;500,000.  The fund will enable independent Irish production activity to return as safely as possible and help retain Ireland's talented creative workforce as the industry recovers and adapts to the challenges of Covid-19.<\/p> <p> An amount of &euro;3 million was allocated to Screen Ireland's television drama fund to support the production of new Irish TV drama content in line with the Government's audiovisual action plan and building on the success of Screen Ireland's support of \"Normal People\" last year.  Last week, Screen Ireland announced details of the first tranche of this funding to five television drama projects with production set to commence in Galway, Cork and Limerick by the end of 2020, as well as funding for a number of joint development initiatives with RT&Eacute;, Virgin Media TV and TG4. <\/p> <p> I have given the House a very brief outline of the extensive work being undertaken by my Department and its agencies in the areas of the arts.  It will take me many hours to give Deputies a good understanding of the breadth and depth of interventions.  Perhaps Deputies may want to point to or ask for details in particular areas and I will be happy to oblige.  I will finish by alluding briefly to two task forces under way at present.  These are the arts and culture recovery task force and the night-time economy task force.  Their work and reports will inform the direction of Government policy for the medium term.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100600024#X00400","speaker":"1471","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1602000600,"counter":304,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Aire agus t&aacute; br&oacute;n orm as ucht an mhoill - bh&iacute; m&eacute; ag cruinni&uacute; Zoom leis an gCeann Comhairle.  Ba mhaith liom d&iacute;ri&uacute; isteach ar an athr&uacute; at&aacute; tar &eacute;is teacht &oacute; mhe&aacute;n o&iacute;che ar&eacute;ir.<\/p>  <p>  While we are not at level 5 shutdown, the arts and entertainment industries have once again been shut down in many ways unless people can avail of online opportunities.  For the vast majority of those in the arts and entertainment industries, online is not as feasible as it is for other sectors.  This is a sector that has been on its knees since it was closed down for the first time in March.  More than 5,000 workers in the sector having had their pandemic unemployment payment cut only a few weeks ago.  They are struggling to survive and have been let down by the Government which does not seem to have the urgency or a plan to deal with those who have no other outlet for income.  There are only cuts.  <\/p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in has called for a clear plan from the Government to deal with the crisis in the industry since March.<\/p> <p>I raised this with the then Government in the Covid-19 committee back in May and I have raised it with the Minister on a number of occasions.  I still hope that we will hear some news sometime of the PUP being restored to those in need of it at the rate it was prior to the cut a fortnight ago.  <br\/><br\/>Like many other Members, I am sure that the Minister has received many emails about the need to support the live events industry.  I congratulate those who have taken the time to share their experiences with us.  These are not just normal emails.  My office received 1,000 emails as part of a campaign organised by the Event Production Industry Covid-19 Working Group, EPIC.  It has highlighted the value of live events at &euro;3.5 billion as well as the plight of the 35,000 full-time and part-time workers who have been left behind and are out of work.  I congratulate EPIC and its campaign in galvanising the passions of thousands of people who would not otherwise write to politicians.  They have written to me and probably to others in this House and outlined some of the harrowing stories of the dire straits that they are in.  I have been trying to respond to every one of those emails over the past month and I apologise to those who I have not managed to get to thus far.  Due to there being so many of them, some were caught in the email spam and releasing them, I discovered, is not as easy as it should be.  <br\/><br\/>For instance, Adam from Ballyfermot says:<\/p><blockquote>\tJust been out of work for so long and trying to get by on &euro;350 a week and now &euro;300 is hard.  I've gone from working 60 to 70 hours a week to zero.  I've been in a job since I finished school and I am lost without it.  The events is more than a job for most of us.  It's a lifestyle and mine has been taken away from me. <\/blockquote> <p>Steve wrote to me, and probably to others.  He is from the band, The Stunning, whom many of us will remember, and we hope that we will hear from Steve and those in the band again in the future.  The Stunning were marking 30 years this year since their debut album.  He said:<\/p><blockquote>\tI have been a professional musician with my band The Stunning for over 30 years.  People in my industry have not worked since last March and I myself haven't gigged since December 28 2019.  We had a huge year lined up for 2020 with festivals booked all over the country, and it's the 30th anniversary of the band&rsquo;s debut album.  I'm also an actor and my last job I did with RT&Eacute; was last year.   <\/blockquote> <p>Jane from Blackpitts writes:<\/p><blockquote>\tI worked for the events and marketing agency in Dublin with 22 of the most hard-working people I've ever met.  Just before Covid we were experiencing our best quarter in years.  We had grown a solid client base and were expanding our offering with new staff and departments.  On March 15, everything stopped.  Clients pulled out of events planned and the phone stopped ringing.  30% of our staff were let go and the rest were put on part-time hours.  Thankfully, for the wage subsidy scheme, I was lucky enough to keep my job but with the support ending soon, I am terrified about my future. <\/blockquote> <p>It continues in the case of others.  Dan from Walkinstown says:<\/p><blockquote>\tI am stressed.  I am under financial strains.  I have borrowed and I am not sure I can pay it back.  I have been abandoned by the Government and the Department of Social Protection.  I and at least 35,000 others like me are part of an industry that has been destroyed,  \/this industry is one of the main reasons that our powerfully successful tourism industry is so loved by the people from around the world.  Our artistic output and nightlife culture are vital to the Irish economy and the lack of support is killing us.  It has already passed the point where it will not recover and return to what it was.  You must take action now.   <\/blockquote> <p>During a meeting I had with Mary Coughlan and the Musical Entertainment Alliance Ireland, MEAI, which represents 4,800 music and entertainment workers, she told us about someone she knows who is worried about not being able to afford to pay his rent on a reduced PUP and who is planning to sell his double bass as he sees no future in music after all of the years that he has put into honing his talents.  We also heard at that meeting of people living in sheds and cars because they cannot afford the rent anymore.  Others are very stressed about the banks and mortgages and are not getting any relief.<br\/><br\/>The funding that has been provided thus far has been welcomed by Sinn F&eacute;in but it is nowhere near enough and it is also confusing.  Even the funding announced by the Minister for some projects, it seems as if they are announced in June, announced again in July and announced again then prior to the budget.  We will probably hear of them again next week.  Clarity is needed on what has been announced and what will be announced so that we know whether such schemes as the &euro;5 million live performance scheme is the same as the &euro;10 million performance and production support scheme announced in the July stimulus package.<br\/><br\/>There are a number of issues.  We need to look to, and learn from, other countries.  In Germany, the self-employed artist is entitled to a 50% reduction, for instance, in insurance fees.  The arts there have received much more, proportionately, than in Ireland.  In March, the first thing that the government in Germany did was to provide a &euro;50 billion package for small businesses and the arts.  Their labour Minister intends to extend their version of PUP to artists until March 2022, not 2021.  We should at this stage start looking at the industries, including the arts and entertainment industry, which will be last to open.  The Minister acknowledged that in her contribution that it was one of the first to close, and possibly for many artists in that industry, will be the last to open.  That means that there has to be a different approach for this sector of society, especially if we are trying to rebuild our tourism industry in the future, and to give a lift to all those involved.  <br\/><br\/>Ba mhaith liom ar deireadh an deis a thap&uacute; chun tac&uacute; leo si&uacute;d at&aacute; tar &eacute;is cuidi&uacute; linn ar fad sa mh&eacute;id a dh&eacute;anann siad go dt&iacute; seo le linn na tr&eacute;imhse seo, ag d&eacute;anamh ceoil, dr&aacute;ma&iacute; agus gach rud eile ar l&iacute;ne agus at&aacute; ag tabhairt ard&uacute; spioraid d&uacute;inn ar fad san am deacair seo.

His family is steeped in the many different parts of the arts.  We have debated the arts on a number of occasions in the short life of this D&aacute;il.  It feels like we are going over old ground.  It is old ground, however, that is becoming more important and more severe for those who are unemployed and want to work again.  These people are looking for hope that there will be light at the end of the tunnel.  They will not have got much hope if they have been watching the &ldquo;Claire Byrne Live&rdquo; show last night when we saw our Deputy Prime Minister take our Chief Medical Officer and the entire board of NPHET to task.  When we see incidents such as that, it is an embarrassment to the State but it is especially hard for people in sectors that are going to be, as they say themselves, the last to open.  It is massively destabilising when one sees one of the major decision-makers in government engage in such personalised attacks.<\/p> <p>It is very destabilising and manifestly so for those in sectors that are on the edges of this pandemic.<\/p> <p> Very little has moved.  I listened to the Minister's contribution from my office and I am aware that funding is being given in a type of block, high-level format but the people in the sector who are most affected are not seeing it on a week-to-week basis.  Those who have to pay rent, bills, support their families and themselves, as well as those who want to live with dignity are not seeing that.  That is very worrying.  <\/p> <p> We should take this opportunity to state that there were issues with this sector prior to the pandemic that are being compounded by what is going on now.  The Theatre Forum review in 2019 of pay and conditions in the performing arts indicated that working conditions had not improved in the decade since the living and working conditions of artists report was published in 2010.  When parties were saying that they would keep the recovery going in the second half of the last decade when the economy was back up and running, that was not the case for some sectors and the arts was one of those sectors.  In a country that professes to value the arts and hold it dear to our hearts, as many of us do, that has not been reflected in the actions of the State.<\/p> <p> As we know, art and the arts sector travels extremely well to all four corners of the globe and is received very well.  We are viewed as a creative people and as a country that values its creative people but is that really the case?  When we look at what has happened in the past decade and the way it has been compounded by this pandemic, I am not sure we can over that statement with any credibility.<\/p> <p> On a day where it is indicated that the national minimum wage will rise by a mere ten cent, 72% of artists in Ireland were earning less than the national minimum wage before this pandemic hit.  One might ask what is the point in having a national minimum wage, if so many in a particular sector fall below that line.<\/p> <p> That brings me to the pandemic unemployment payment, which was very important payment for many workers and very important for people in the arts sector.  Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh spoke eloquently about the impact of the pandemic on a number of individuals.  I echo those sentiments.  The budget will be next week.  We need to see something that is a little more creative and targeted, and people in the arts sector will need to be included in that.  We must see the restoration of the pandemic unemployment payment.<\/p> <p> We are 100 days into the term of this Government.  I am not one for arbitrary targets and I acknowledge that the period of the past 100 days has been unique but those working in the arts believe that the first 100 days posed more questions such as whether it is worth it for them, if they should be breaking their backs in the hope that their sector will be allowed to recover and whether the Government will back them, their group, band, theatre group and industry.  I hope it will do so.  I am aware efforts have been made.  I am not here to simply say everything is desperate and the Minister is not doing anything.  I do sense that she is doing something but these workers need to be able to feel that in their pockets next week, the week after that and so on until this pandemic is over.  They are struggling to survive and pay their bills and they need help from the Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100600026#Z00200","speaker":"1564","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1602001800,"counter":308,"content":"<p> I was working on my contribution yesterday evening when everything changed with the announcement that we are to move to level 3 but I want to raise a few points because the entire nation hopes that we will move out of level 3 in the near future.  I am a Deputy from County Clare, which is the home of traditional music and dance.  Many groups involved in set dancing, Irish dancing and the other dance forms believe that they fall between two stools.  The different guidelines that came out in recent months do not necessarily lend to them restarting classes or dances.  We know that they cannot happen now because we are at level 3.  That is acceptable but when we get beyond that, we need to look at those dance forms.  I refer to lessons given in every school hall around Ennis and Shannon on a Friday afternoon.  That has been a way of life for people for many years and it has been taken by Covid-19, so to speak.  For many people, Irish dancing, set dancing and those other dance forms were their sport so I ask that during this period, that activity might be examined.  It does not fully fit within the theatre sphere.  For some, that form of arts is a form of sport.  It is what keeps them active and energised.  The Minister's Department might look at that as it engages with NPHET in the future.<\/p>  <p>  The artist residency scheme is a very successful scheme administered by the Minister's Department.  It gets artists into many schools throughout the country.  I looked at the figures for my county in recent years.  I do not know whether it was because of a low level of uptake or a low level of roll-out of the grant but only eight or ten schools benefited.  This is an ideal year to consider significantly increasing the number of groups that would benefit from that scheme.  This is a very tough time for artists.  Their source of income and the various ways they show their talents and wares have been hugely restricted.  This would be an opportune time to consider extending the artist residency scheme throughout the entire academic year to ensure that the artists of a county could hold various workshops in schools and invigorate the arts curriculum offered both in primary and secondary school.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding festivals, Clare has a number of very famous festivals, all of which have been cancelled.  That is not unique to Clare; it is happening countrywide.  The Lisdoonvarna Matchmaking Festival would have concluded last weekend.  The Willie Clancy Summer School normally takes place in Miltown Malbay in the month of July, and there is the Scariff Harbour Festival.  I mention those three but dozens happen in Clare.  To take the town of Lisdoonvarna, there is very little happening there at the moment.  There are many for sale and to let signs along the main street.  That one month in which the matchmaking festival is held buoyed up the entire town and gave it the financial adrenaline shot that carried them through many other months of the year.  As the Minister prepares for the budget next week I hope that the many festivals that have been cancelled, which are gearing up in the hope of doing something in 2021, might be given some support that would make such festival planning for the new year easier for them.<\/p>  <p>  The final issue I want to raise is tourism, which also comes under the Minister's Department.  A man in Clare, Sean Kilkenny, has a business which is an art form in itself.  He is very involved in equestrian activities.  I believe he met the Minister some weeks ago when she was in Clare.  He runs a jarvey business.  He has some beautiful horses that tour the county and show at many events.  He has often shown up at Bunratty Castle.  He brings colour and pageantry to the county.  He is one of the many business people who fall between the two stools.  I spoke about Irish dancing and set dancing but into which area does his business fit?  It is not farming.  He believes that business restart grants and all the supports that have been wonderful for businesses in the past few months do not fully fit his mix of business because having performed at various venues around the country and county, at the end of the day he has to feed 40 animals and therein lies another struggle.<\/p>  <p>  I thank the Minister and look forward to hearing what her Department will announce in the budget next week.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100600027#AA00200","speaker":"1519"},{"type":"speech","time":1602001800,"counter":309,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire inniu agus roimh an m&eacute;id a bh&iacute; le r&aacute; aici mar gheall ar an taca&iacute;ocht at&aacute; &aacute; sol&aacute;thar aici don earn&aacute;il seo.<\/p>  <p>  I spoke at length in the D&aacute;il recently about the impact of Covid-19 on the aviation and travel industry in Cork.  There is no doubt that the impact on the arts and culture sector has been just as detrimental and will last longer than that in many of the other sectors.  In 2020, the recession in the arts sector will be between 34% and 42%.  In terms of GDP, this is projected to cost between &euro;250 million and &euro;300 million.  Covid-19 is forecast to put between 1,500 and 1,900 arts jobs at risk.  I welcome that total funding for the arts and culture sector will increase from &euro;183 million to &euro;239 million, which is an increase of almost 30% this year.  However, this sector is one of the most vulnerable in that it is heavily reliant on public consumption and participation.<\/p>  <p>  I am a music lover.  I enjoy attending gigs and concerts in my home county of Cork every year.  I attend the Cork Jazz Festival.  The festival is one of the most iconic events of its kind on the national cultural calendar.  During last year's jazz festival, Cork received a cash injection of approximately &euro;35 million over a four-day period.  Cork Jazz Festival is not only a cultural event; it is big business for the hospitality industry in Cork and gives the city a significant boost, with the festival attracting approximately 40,000 visitors to Leeside.<\/p> <p>Like so many other events nationwide and worldwide, the jazz festival was cancelled as a result of the pandemic.  This year would have been the festival's 43rd year running, which is a testament to its founders and all the stakeholders, such as Cork City Council, Cork Business Association, F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Diageo, including Guinness.  I am delighted to see that Diageo is fully committed to continuing to support the festival because its importance to the local economy cannot be overestimated.  Those within the industry must be praised for reimagining their programming to serve an online audience.  The efforts made by many artists to adapt to and serve an online audience must be lauded but online substitutions cannot replace the live experience and they do not get away from the brutal reality facing arts and artists in Ireland.  Thankfully, the Government has acknowledged the reality facing the industry and has put additional supports in place.<\/p> <p> I welcome the establishment of the new task force for the recovery of the arts and culture sector, which was announced on 10 September.  With the budget imminent, I ask the Minister to review and refine existing supports and consider any further measures that may be required.  It is vital that the upcoming national economic plan provide a trajectory for the sector and its institutions so they may survive to the greatest extent possible in the years ahead.<\/p> <p> Chomh maith leis sin, teasta&iacute;onn uaim labhairt ar son na gcol&aacute;ist&iacute; samhraidh agus na mn&aacute; t&iacute; a chuireann seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; dochreidte ar f&aacute;il n&iacute; hamh&aacute;in le linn an tsamhraidh ach le linn na scoilbhliana acad&uacute;la.

The arts and events industry has been shut down since March.  I have listened to stories about how the affected have been dealing with the stress during this time and about how they do not see any future owing to the closure of their business.  Musicians are being forced to sell instruments and businesses are being forced to close shops for good as they cannot survive.  Some may believe it is just artists, musicians and DJs who are suffering from this crisis but the problem is much bigger.  What about the sound technicians, lighting and visual effects technicians, stage managers and stagehands?  The industry never needed State support in the past.<\/p>  <p>  Thousands of people have seen their livelihoods stopped, with no date set for a return.  Although they try to remain upbeat about the possibility of a gig being given the green light, some artists are really down and depressed, and it is their families who have to pick up the pieces at home.  It is the families who have to worry about the bills being paid, putting food on the table and preventing the mortgage from going into arrears.  They now have the extra burden of knowing Christmas is around the corner.  That is when most of the artists make their money.  Our musicians need to know we are here to support them and that the employment wage subsidy scheme payments and pandemic unemployment payments will be restored to the full amounts to help those most affected by the closure.  Arts Council funding does not cover artists or workers in previously unfunded live events and entertainment industries.<\/p>  <p>  The events industry has been hit the hardest.  It was closed in March of this year and those affected, who are highly skilled professionals, feel they have been forgotten by the Government and thrown to the side of the road.  While we seek to get the economy up and running again, the industry still does not have a return date, nor does it look like it will get one.  There seems to be more emphasis on ticket-touting legislation than on helping those most hit by the pandemic.  Our artists have worked in bars, clubs, theatres and venues and when they are in work, it creates employment, including for cleaners and bar and security staff.  It is important to remember the chain of workers associated with a simple gig.  The great joy and comfort the artists bring to people all over the country should not be forgotten.<\/p>  <p>  If it were not for the media printing what is happening to artists and the potential timelines for reopening events venues, artists would be completely in the dark.  We need to engage more with the industry - an industry that wants to work in a healthy environment and with safety restrictions in place but that cannot do so because the Government has it fully closed down.  If we stop those affected from earning a living, through no fault of their own, we should be able to compensate them and leave them in a position where they can at least survive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100600028#BB00200","speaker":"1506"},{"type":"speech","time":1602002400,"counter":312,"content":"<p>As time is limited, I will raise an issue that has not been raised by any of my colleagues across the Chamber.  On 30 June, the Arts Council advertised a tender for badly needed communications advice.  Many of the major agencies in the country applied in good faith.  The tender documentation stated the successful agency would commence work in August 2020.  Even though the assessment and evaluations must have taken place, the Arts Council sent out a notice last week stating it had terminated the competition without awarding a contract.  It gave a very strange reason that I and many others would be curious to understand in more detail, namely, that it was setting up a new communications group to produce a strategy for itself.  This is curious because the very first paragraph of the tender document, as initiated, states, \"Advise on and assist with the development and implementation of the Arts Council's public relations, public affairs and media relations strategies, particularly in the context of the Arts Council's 10-year strategy; design work plans for these activities, including the identification of stakeholders and pathways to interact with them; and, with the assistance of the Arts Council, review annually the delivery of the communications plan and devise recommendations for improvement.\"<\/p>  <p>  For reasons I shall outline as my contribution develops, I believe the Arts Council has acted in bad faith to such an extent that an independent investigation is warranted into the issue.  The inquiry should look for all the relevant papers and records.  If that does not happen, the Arts Council will be inundated with freedom of information requests on this matter.<\/p>  <p>  Agencies will have put a major effort into the very demanding tender application process.  It will have cost them well into the tens of thousands of euro in terms of the commitment of staff and production.  The agencies in question are all in the creative industry in these troubled times.<\/p>  <p>  The last body one would expect to mess around with small businesses is the Arts Council, which deals with creatives, artists and small groups.  What it has done, four months after the tender was advertised, is highly unprofessional and calls into question its board and executive.  It disrespects those who spent time on a very demanding tender.  At a minimum, they should be compensated for the time spent on the tender, which proved to be of no avail.  This raises the need for the matter to be investigated by somebody independent.  What went on in the Arts Council in this regard?  What happened since the tender was advertised in June?  What happened to the submissions made by the agencies who tendered?  Were they assessed?  Who assessed them?  Was there an independent person or persons among the assessors?  What have they to say about this?  What did the assessors find?  Why are the agencies being told only now?  Will the Arts Council use the agencies' ideas?  Is this just a free way to get the intellectual property and ideas of others?  Is this a proper way to do business?  What was the Arts Council's true reason for its actions?  Has there been any potential conflict of interest on the board or executive?  Did somebody not like the assessment?  A multitude of questions need answers, and that is why I believe the matter warrants an independent inquiry.<\/p>  <p>  If the Comptroller and Auditor General were examining this issue, his approach would be very technical and he would ask whether the Arts Council abided by the guidelines.  That is the approach that is needed in this inquiry.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform needs to be asked for his view.  As a chartered accountant, he might not be too happy to hear that the decision taken by the Arts Council to withdraw, after four months, a public tender that it advertised is adding to the very serious pressure already on small businesses.  He might feel he has to do something to investigate activity that appears to be so incredibly unprofessional that it warrants further investigation.<\/p>  <p>  The excuse given by the Arts Council for withdrawing the tender raises more questions because the first reference in the tender material is to the communications strategy.  That is not something new that has just happened.  To the bemusement and frustration of those creative agencies that made a great effort to put together a tender application, the excuse given by the Arts Council as to why the tender was withdrawn seems to be identical to the reason it was initiated in the first instance.  The only grounds for the cancellation of a tender are exceptional circumstances.  This hardly qualifies as such.  The Arts Council is tone deaf to artists and agencies and it should not be allowed to get away with what it has done to artists, and now agencies.<\/p>  <p>  Some local authorities have come under criticism recently for cancelling tender processes without good reason.  This, too, needs to be examined.  It underscores that the last thing one would expect from the Arts Council would be messing around with creative, indigenous small businesses at this incredibly precarious time.<\/p> <p>It is interesting to note that the three reasons set out by the Office of Government Procurement that State agents may cancel a tender do not include the fig leaf presented by the Arts Council last week.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100600028#BB00300","speaker":"1560","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1602003000,"counter":314,"content":"<p>It is important that we all recognise the devastation of the arts industry, including writers, performers, musicians, technicians, planners, participants and the wider community.  We have relied on the arts to soothe our souls.  Those who create and work in this space have faced more sacrifices than most.  In Carlow, we are fortunate to have the VISUAL Centre for Contemporary Art and The George Bernard Shaw Theatre, one of Ireland's leading contemporary arts spaces in Carlow town which opened in 2009 and comprises a beautiful gallery and performance area.  It is an incredible amenity.<\/p>  <p>  VISUAL houses a 335-seat theatre and the largest white cube gallery space where it produces a programme of commissioned and existing high-quality national and international contemporary arts and a host of performance of events in multiple disciplines, including theatre, dance, film, comedy, literature and music.  In terms of values, inclusion and collaboration is at its core.  The community in Carlow and Ireland have been gifted so much from this centre.  In its mission statement, VISUAL commits to identifying and removing physical, social and economic barriers to accessing its work and to support, foster and provide opportunities for arts participation in our communities.  However, a larger barrier to completing this work is a lack of funding.  The unprecedented and ongoing Covid-19 global pandemic has been a great disaster for Ireland's arts.  We need to examine ways to repair that damage to ensure that future generations get to enjoy all we have enjoyed.  <\/p>  <p>  Covid-19 has taken over our lives but it will not be with us forever.  We need to prepare for that brighter day, the day when the children cut class for the pantomime at Christmas, the day when a new writer launches a book to a massive audience, the day local groups open the curtain on their plays on opening night and the night artists see their curated work displayed for the first time.  These are times we have seen and, surely, times we will see again but they do not come free of charge.  I ask the Minister to consider putting in place a funding stream for VISUAL, one of Ireland's leading contemporary arts spaces.  VISUAL is an &euro;18 million development and a joint project funded by the local authority with a grant of &euro;3.17 million from the former Department of Arts, Sports and Tourism under the access programme.  Carlow County Council and the Arts Council have provided funding over the past few years but Covid-19 has affected the resources of all local authorities and the arts.<\/p>  <p>  The centre makes regular funding applications.  We can support it in its work by bringing it under the aegis of the Minister's Department and provide it with an allocation from arts funding.  This is important.  I extend an invitation to the Minister to visit VISUAL in Carlow when the level 3 restrictions have been lifted.  It is one of the most beautiful buildings in the town.  The service is provides to Carlow county and town and throughout the country is unreal but it needs funding.  I welcome the establishment of the task force mentioned earlier by the Minister, which is important.  I also welcome the 30% increase in the Department's budget, which now stands at &euro;239 million.  <\/p>  <p>  There is a particular area I am concerned about.  Over the past few months, I have been contacted by many artists and musicians.  I am not sure if the Minister is aware of The Backline, which featured on \"Nationwide\" two or three weeks ago.  I met them with the Minister of State, Deputy Malcolm Noonan.  These are musicians and singers based in Carlow-Kilkenny.  They are fabulous and they play online to support front-line workers.  The forum hosts online concerts most weeks.  They are exceptional.  When I raised the issue of funding for them with the Department and the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, I was told no funding stream is available to them.  This has created significant issues for me in my area.  These musicians and singers are very talented but they do not qualify under any specific funding scheme.  I hope the Minister saw them on \"Nationwide\".  If not, I will forward some clips to her of their online concerts.  We need to see how funding can be provided for them.  That is the reason I raised the issue of the task force with her.  I hope that funding will be provided for musicians performing online, who range from young teenagers to members of our older population.  The Backline meet all the criteria and they work with musicians from all around the country.  I ask the Minister to consider the provision of funding for them.<\/p>  <p>  I have also been contacted by many dance schools in my area.  While schools remain open, I am concerned that music and dance schools cannot open.  We must urgently review this because arts education is as important as reading, writing and arithmetic.  Dance schools, including Irish dance schools, have contacted me.  Again, the operators of these schools do not qualify for any funding stream while out of work other than the PUP.  I ask the Minister to consider providing a once-off payment to help musicians, artists and so on.  We have a great culture.  Arts is our culture.  We are proud of our musicians, singers and everyone else in the music business.  Now, more than ever, we need to support them.  We need to look after them.  I know from my dealings with them that some of them have mortgages they cannot afford to pay, they have families and they are under pressure.  <\/p>  <p>  I thank the Minister for being present  I know she will do her best in the context of the upcoming budget, but I ask her to take consider the groups that are in need of funding.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100600029#CC00200","speaker":"1511"},{"type":"speech","time":1602003000,"counter":315,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity speak about what is essentially a crisis in the arts, culture and entertainment industries.  The Minister is correct that more than 35,000 people are employed across a range of professions.  While much of this debate has focused on the front-of-house artists and performers, and rightly so, there is a panoply of people employed in these sectors, including producers, engineers, technicians, teachers, make-up artists, drivers, caterers, cleaners and administration staff.  We should never forget that broad range of workers whose livelihoods are dependent on these industries.<\/p>  <p>  There is also a lot of people who are not directly employed but whose livelihoods depends on large events, be they culture, arts, entertainment or sports.  Taxi drivers are probably the most obvious that spring to mind.  The &euro;3.5 billion in revenue generated in our economy every year cannot be over-emphasised.  The package of supports, particularly for certain sectors within this overall group of industries, is too small.  Many of these workers are on low and average incomes.  Some of the decisions, not taken by the Minister and her Department but by her colleagues, are having a disproportionate impact on these workers, including the cuts to the PUP and the wage subsidy schemes, lack of action, for example, on commercial rents or breaks for insurance policies for owners and renters of premises, stripping protections for those in the private rental sector and the failure to extend the mortgage payment holiday.  These are compounding since because of the public health restrictions, necessary as they are, people cannot go to work.  <\/p>  <p>  The biggest problem for the people in the industry with whom I have spoken is the lack of a roadmap.  Everybody knows that they cannot go back to work now but this is an industry which, in the main, operates 12 months ahead of the rest of us in terms of the planning of festivals, exhibitions, theatre performances, concerts, tours, etc..  The most frustrating thing for people involved in the industry is not only the lack of income support but the not knowing where they are going to be in six months or 12 months, not having clear targets and not having clear guidelines for where they may go.  While the Government has developed its living with Covid plan, people are saying it is unclear to whom they go to get clarity on when they want to organise events of certain types or at certain stages.  I urge the Minister not to deflect this to the task force to grapple with but for her and the Department to give industry some certainty and a roadmap and targets for the months ahead.<\/p>  <p>  It gives me no pleasure to say this, but there has been a lot of angry reaction to the Minister's claim that the &euro;5 million performance fund has been the product of consultation.  What I am hearing is that the sector does not feel it is being consulted enough.  I urge her, because I know it is her style as a politician, to engage with and listen to the people who will be recipients of this fund and future funds before final decisions are made.<\/p> <p> To conclude, the budget is coming up.  I know there are many demands and that the Minister is fighting with her colleagues for ever scarcer resources, but given the scale of this industry and its importance not just to the economic life of the State but also to the cultural and emotional well-being of people, I urge her to do everything she can to ensure this industry and its workers get every possible support in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100600029#CC00300","speaker":"1468","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1602003600,"counter":317,"content":"<p>The true history of the attitude of successive Irish Governments to culture, arts, music and events, and to the crews that stand behind them, is a history of lip service without tangible support.  That is most obviously reflected in the fact that we spend one sixth of the average spend across Europe on funding arts and culture.  The events and music sectors have never received a penny, essentially, and there was even no engagement until they began to get themselves organised in the last few months through groups such as EPIC, the event production industry Covid-19 working group.<\/p>  <p>  I sought the first debate in the House on arts and culture after the pandemic, and then requested that groups such as EPIC and the National Campaign for the Arts appear before the Special Committee on Covid-19 Response.  Since then, the level of lip service in the House to arts and culture has grown exponentially.  There is no doubt about that.  After the virtual silence about arts, culture, music and events, there has been a cacophony.  The level of lip service and rhetoric that has been expended in saying how much people love the arts and music and how much they contribute to our culture and society is almost a cultural event in itself.  Never have we needed them more than in the utterly grim situation we now face.<\/p>  <p>  However, lip service has still not been matched by tangible support.  In fact, apart from a few paltry million euro that was added to the funded sector, still bringing it nowhere near the European average expenditure on that, nothing has been given.  One million euro for music is just an insult, to be honest, compared to the contribution musicians make.  In fact, when one looks at the entire issue, the cuts the Government has imposed to the PUP and the wage subsidy mean it has given a little token and taken it all back.  The PUP payment and the wage subsidy are the payments from the Government that reach everybody in those sectors, that is, all the crew people, the musicians, artists, performers and all the people who have lost work.  It is the payment they all received.  Frankly, it was not enough and it was not tailored in such a way that they could do some work on top of it, if they were lucky enough to get a little work.  However, at least they all received it.  That is the thing the Government has cut.  All the groups representing arts, music and culture, including EPIC, the Events Industry Alliance and the National Campaign for the Arts, have asked the Government to restore and retain the PUP and income subsidy payments and, indeed, to allow people to earn a little above that.  That is the key issue.<\/p>  <p>  Beyond that, there is the question of whether the Minister will give grants to cover the ongoing costs of insurance, repayments and all the other ongoing costs people are still incurring even though there is no work for them.  Is the Minister going to give scaffolding funding for the reduced capacities, or no capacity, in venues?  That is the question.  So far, it has been lip service rather than tangible commitments.  Frankly, the engagements appear to be tokenistic and, according to some of the reports I am hearing, that is precisely what they are.  Of course, all those connected to the industry in indirect jobs, the 35,000 jobs and others beyond that such as in the taxi industry, are all asking the same questions as to how they will be able to pay their bills and rent and whether they will be able to survive.  One company involved in music wrote to me today.  It gives work to 300 musicians and asked twice for the wage subsidy, but was refused twice.  I do not know how it does not qualify.  It is unbelievable that it does not qualify for these schemes.  Let us stop the rhetoric and deliver the support.<\/p>  <p>  In contrast, there is one exception to all this - the film producers.  There is virtually no ongoing employment in the industry, but in the last number of years they have received &euro;668 million in grants, tax reliefs and so forth.  It dwarfs what the rest of arts and culture has received.  I believe in the film industry, but that is shocking when there are no jobs.  Let us support the artists, performers, crews and musicians.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100600030#DD00200","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1602003600,"counter":318,"content":"<p>I will bring it down a notch.  First, I am here to tell the Minister again what a great place west Cork is.  I take every opportunity to tell her that.  After listening to the other contributions, I am fully aware that west Cork is not unique in its richness of culture, music and arts, but the reason I raise it is that it is part of us.  It is important to everything we do.  We are not paying lip service, but genuinely and constructively are trying to contribute to and support an industry that is, undeniably, on its knees because of the global pandemic.<\/p>  <p>  Only a few weeks ago the arts industry was looking at innovative ways to get back up and running again.  It was considering the potential of socially distanced gigs and events.  In west Cork, socially distanced events were taking place quite safely and within the restrictions.  I attended a couple of them and it was amazing to hear live music being played again.  We realised what we were missing.  However, level 3 restrictions have come in and the industry's hopes have been absolutely dashed, as the Minister fully understands.  It tried to be innovative as well by moving online, but Facebook and the big corporations changed their licensing.  They make it more difficult at every corner the events industry takes in terms of trying to be innovative, change its approach and stream its music to the masses.  Facebook has changed its licensing agreement and has put up obstacles and challenges.  That puts extra pressure on us to intervene and give supports.<\/p>  <p>  Unfortunately, last night's news came like a hammer fist to an industry that was already on its knees.  People in the industry are scratching their heads as to where they will go now.  That is where the Government should intervene and provide supports.  I was delighted that the Taoiseach met and listened to members of the events industry in my constituency office in Clonakilty.  The Minister has met members of the events industry as well, including EPIC, and has given them a good hearing.  She is not just paying them lip service.  She is fully aware of their concerns and what has to be done.  However, we have to walk the walk.<\/p>  <p>  There are supports available.  The song writing and recording grant is being very well received.  I spoke to a couple of engineers who are getting work on the basis of that grant.  There will not be enough work to satisfy everybody, but it is a step in the right direction.  I hope the Minister will listen to a couple of innovative measures which I believe could be implemented.  First, as has been said, the fact that the events and music industry finds itself in such a unique position means that there should be measures or allowances whereby people in the industry can claim the PUP and take work when it becomes available.  If it is put through the books and they are taxed on it, that is fine.  At least, they will be able to stay in touch with the events industry and continue working.  That is one measure that should be considered due to the uniqueness of the industry.<\/p>  <p>  Second, there is the back to work enterprise allowance scheme.  Under the scheme, people who are on social welfare and are seeking to start their own businesses can claim payments for a two-year period and also take in income from their new business.  This could be applied to the events industry and allow people in the industry to take work where it arises.  Those are two examples whereby I believe we can intervene, although many others have been strongly suggested.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100600030#DD00300","speaker":"1545"},{"type":"speech","time":1602004200,"counter":319,"content":"<p>Like many of us, I suspect, when we heard the sad news of the passing of Derek Mahon over the weekend I went to the bookshelf and pulled out a book to reacquaint myself with some of his beautiful and lyrical work.  In reading &quot;An Bonn&aacute;n Bu&iacute;&quot; two lines jumped out at me:<\/p> <blockquote> \tthe whole unfortunate country frozen over <br \/><br \/>and your voice stilled by enforced sobriety --   <\/blockquote>  <p>Those words really strongly resonate with the country at the minute, coming into the winter with increased Covid restrictions.  Our towns and cities are increasingly locked down and quietened and how much we miss those stilled voices of our performing arts sector, who are among those most acutely affected by this pandemic and the public health measures it has necessitated.  While we know that Covid-19 has had a profound impact across all of our society it is true to say that some sectors have borne the brunt of the storm while others have been relatively sheltered.  Even within the arts community, there are those who have been able to continue their praxis &ndash; writers can write, painters can paint &ndash; but those within the performing arts have seen not just their income but their career progression and their artistic expression come to a dead halt.  It is not just the performers who have been impacted.  All the other professions that stand behind theatre, dance or live music, from sound engineers to set designers, are also at a standstill.  Venues and festivals have been doing their best to push water uphill.  The organisers of the Imagine Arts festival in Waterford, for example, were doing all within their power to have some live audience component in their upcoming programme, but the change this week in public health advice may well have put paid to those plans.<\/p><p>Two things come to me on this.  The first is that in processing and comprehending the emotional impact of the pandemic; the grief of lives lost, of relationships sundered and the legacy of anxiety and isolation, it will be to the arts community that we turn.  They are the lens through which we view ourselves as a society, and they are never so important as when society is in upheaval.  The second is that artists want to create.  While all workers should be rewarded for their work, for performing artists there is an impulse to perform that goes beyond the understanding of a traded wage economy.  I would ask the Minister to consider this resource, a most human resource, that currently stands as a &quot;country frozen over&quot;, and consider how their creative impulse can be harnessed in this changed reality.  There exists a great opportunity to leverage their skills and ability by using our funding of arts and culture in the coming months to commission, to record and to archive.  I refer the Minister to some of the past great projects such as the Doegen Records Web Project preserving sound recordings of native Irish dialects, or RT&Eacute;&rsquo;s &quot;Beckett on Film&quot; of 2001.  There have been times when we have chosen to invest in the national archive and to lay down for future generations a record of the current cultural or social context of our times.  The Minister should make this one of those times.  She should consider investing in composers, playwrights and performers during this period.  She should allow our creative artists to create and the supporting industries to support.  She should allow our social historians to record those stories and voices which may be fading away on our island.  She should allocate resources to the National Archives, both to organise what already exists and to add to that great store.  I doubt I will be alone in quoting Derek Mahon again to close, &quot;The sun rises in spite of everything&quot;.  At some future point, we will look back on this time of Covid.  With the Minister's help, and I know she has a massive interest in and deep understanding of this sector, let us hope that we will still have a functioning arts community that will help us to look back and make sense of it all.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100600031#EE00100","speaker":"1617"},{"type":"speech","time":1602004200,"counter":320,"content":"<p>Government politicians do not just dine out on their arts; some of them feast on them.  Hardly a speech has been made by a Taoiseach or Uachtar&aacute;n that has not featured lines from Yeats, Heaney or Beckett.  In their quiet times away from the camera, it seems some politicians believe such artists should go out and get a real job.  This is usually latent but lately it has been blatant.  It is as if years of learning, practice, discipline and finally performing as a musician, dancer, comedian or actor is not work.  We know it is not only work but is work that keeps the rest of us relatively sane.  So many of us have that special song we go to when times are tough, or lines from a story or poem that comfort us and lift our spirits.  Our arts exorcise the ghosts in our throat, to borrow from Doireann N&iacute; Ghr&iacute;ofa.  However, while some politicians feast on the arts our artists are facing a famine.  One would think we could do better for people who are worth &euro;3.5 billion a year to the economy.<\/p>  <p>  I did not realise quite how many outstanding artists we had living in north Kildare until they started contacting me over the last few months for help to keep going.  The cancellation of the Forever Young festival in Johnstown in Naas left hundreds of musicians, lighting specialists, organisers, sound engineers and caterers out of a job.  The same thing happened across the State.  In addition to artists, I have had countless constituents, organisers of dance schools and acting schools, and musicians all raising the sign for help.  I have tried to respond to everyone who has contacted me personally because they give so much and right now they are trying to survive on so little.  I have been glad to be able to tell them that Sinn F&eacute;in is to the fore in seeking the retention of the pandemic unemployment payment and that we have been calling for the reversal of the decision to scrap the temporary wage subsidy scheme and replace it, which would leave those workers, and they are workers, with &euro;50 a week less.  That is big money when one is living on the edge.  I have just finished a telephone call with Celine Garvey, who manages the Moat Theatre in Naas.  As it is a not-for-profit theatre, she cannot avail of grants from the Arts Council.  It is such a great amenity for the town.  We have had it since 1954 and cannot lose it in 2020.<\/p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in was out front battling for the live events and entertainment industry to be attended to by the Special Committee on Covid-19 Response.  While I accept that the sector has been heard from to an extent, the vast majority in the industry still face an uncertain future.  The supports that have been granted are welcome but fall far short of what is required to ensure the arts come out the other side of this.  We must value them in more than words and quotes.  They have given us a lot and it is time that we gave something back.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100600031#EE00200","speaker":"1585"},{"type":"speech","time":1602004200,"counter":321,"content":"<p>It has been a terrible year for people involved in the arts and the creative economy generally, with no end in sight to the suffering.  It should have been an amazing year in Galway, showcasing the best of what the region has to offer, not just in culture and arts but in the tourism offering too.  The Galway 2020 European Capital of Culture programme had been forecast to bring many tens of thousands of extra visitors and tourists from abroad to the west of Ireland and to pump many millions of extra euro into the local economy.  It is a perfect example of how the creative economy is such an important part of economic success and even survival of an area.  Of course, many events associated with Galway 2020 have gone ahead but in a very different way from what had been envisaged.  I wish them the very best in the rest of their endeavours for the rest of the year and into the new year.  I also extend good wishes to the organisers of Babor&oacute;, the wonderful international children's festival in Galway which got under way this week and runs until 18 October.  It is a mix of in-person performances and online events.  It has to be a struggle to put on such a festival in the middle of a pandemic but they have done a fantastic job.<\/p>  <p>  The arts and culture sector is likely to be among the last to recover when the coronavirus pandemic is over.  That is according to a report published by the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation in August.  The Focus on Sectors 2020 report on the audiovisual sector highlighted the fact that efforts to get film and television production back up and running would be complicated by social distancing requirements.  It also forecast a bottleneck in demand for film crews and services.  A particular problem it stressed was the inability to secure vital insurance for various projects.  According to the western audiovisual forum, the creative economy is estimated to be worth almost half a billion euro in counties Galway, Mayo and Roscommon.  It creates more than 7,000 jobs directly and indirectly.  The prediction is that losses as a direct result of the Covid-19 pandemic in these counties will be at least 25%.  In real terms, that is up to &euro;150 million lost to the region's economy and the jobs of up to 2,000 people lost or in serious jeopardy.  A report carried out by NUI Galway for the Western Development Commission a few years ago came to similar conclusions about the value of the creative sector, including everything from craft and culture to creative industries.  The report, which is published as part of a wider European study, stressed that the creative economy plays a strong role in the enhancement of the local economy in the western region.  In other words, this is not just about preserving and enhancing our cultural offerings.<\/p> <p>It is also very much about euro and cents and putting food on the table for thousands of families.  The NUIG report stressed that the creative sector can generate important social and cultural impacts.  These include a greater sense of community, the inclusion of marginalised groups, social interaction at creative events and regeneration of relatively deprived areas.  The creative sector can also play a key role in improving the image of an area and increasing its attractiveness as a location to live, visit or set up a business.<\/p> <p> A vital contribution to the growth of film and TV animation and creative documentary production in Ireland has been section 481, which provides a tax credit worth up to 32% of eligible Irish expenditure.  An additional incentive called the regional film development uplift has been in place for such projects outside the main industry hubs in counties Dublin, Wicklow and Cork in an effort to boost industry in the regions.  That provided an additional 5% credit on top of the standard rate for this year and last year.  The problem is that the regional uplift is due to be reduced to 3% next year and 2% in 2022.  In the dire circumstances the industry finds itself in, it is vital this regional uplift be maintained at its current 5% level.  I urge the Minister and the Minister for Finance to include that adjustment in the upcoming budget and finance Bill.  I hardly imagine there has been much take-up of the regional uplift or even the section 481 tax credit generally this year so such an extension will not cost the Exchequer much.<\/p> <p> It should be stressed that such aids and incentives such as this are not a one-way benefit.  There is a return for such money as was highlighted in a report commissioned by the Government two years ago entitled An Economic Analysis of the Audiovisual Sector in the Republic of Ireland.  The report showed that while Government support has played an important role in assisting the audiovisual sector to grow, the film tax relief delivers value for money on both the fiscal net benefit and economic benefit basis.  Every euro of section 481 outlays generated an average &euro;2.82 in economic net benefit for the economy and it returned a minimum of &euro;1.02 in tax revenue to the Government.<\/p> <p> I also support the budget submission of the western AV forum calling for the allocation of &euro;1 million for the Project Ireland 2040 national development plan in annual funding to the Western Region Audiovisual Producers Fund, WRAP.  The fund helps to sustain and promote regional audiovisual development across film, television, animation and games.<\/p> <p> As I said at the outset, it has been a terrible year for everyone involved in the arts and the creative economy but nowhere more than in County Galway, which had such a promising year in store.  I am aware there is a huge demand from all sectors for a share of the limited pie of the country's finances.  It is, however, an area that badly needs support and will be among the last to eventually recover as the Government has acknowledged.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100600031#EE00300","speaker":"1576","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1602004800,"counter":323,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for the opportunity to contribute on the arts and the impact Covid-19 has had on the sector.  I welcome the arts recovery task force that has been established to provide a detailed report on the issues facing arts in Ireland and wish it well in its goal of adopting a solution-focused approach.  I welcome that it will seek input from across the arts community recognising the diverse range of stakeholders within this area.  I hope this approach will best allow the arts sector to adapt to the environment we now find ourselves in and that no parts of the arts community will be left behind.<\/p>  <p>  The arts has been an enjoyable part of my life and has added immensely to the make-up of my community.  I have fond memories of learning music in my community in Youghal at our local Comhaltas Ceolt&oacute;ir&iacute; &Eacute;ireann branch of Bru na S&iacute;.  Organisations such as this are an integral part of the fabric of our society and we must always look at ways to allow them to operate in a safe manner during times of Covid-19.  Letting organisations such as this go will not only damage the organisations but the fabric of communities across the country.<\/p>  <p>  Study after study has shown that culture has an impact on how people perform within a society.  Individual cultural preferences shape how people respond to certain situations.  How much trust people have in these institutions of the State, how a person views the outside world and how open he or she is to change are only a few examples of the impact culture has on society.  Culture is hugely influenced by the arts and we cannot allow our society to become closed off from the rest of world or for it to be simply all work and no play.  Life without any sort of pleasure and enjoyment would be a dull life indeed and if we want or people to remain dynamic, open and trusting of the State we must sure the arts can continue to as great an extent as possible.  If we do not, it will make it much more difficult to be able to work together to overcome the challenges we face in light of Covid-19.  We must ensure that cultural aspects of our society are not lost indefinitely because of the pandemic.  The arts are an escape from the hassle of everyday life and are even more important in times of Covid-19.<\/p>  <p>  I spoke in this Chamber many times about the need to protect our mental health in times of Covid-19.  We need to look at the great work groups such as the RT&Eacute; National Symphony Orchestra can do to provide some uplift to people across country.  Boosting morale at times like this is hugely important and ensures there is public buy-in for measures that are in place.  We need to give people a sense of optimism that while today may be difficult, tomorrow will be better.<\/p>  <p>  I look forward to working with the Minister and her Department in achieving these goals and congratulate her on her appointment to Cabinet with responsibility for a Department in which I have much interest.

We are rich in the world of arts because we have produced so many important people who have made such an impact in Ireland.  I will give just one example off the top of my head of Cill Rialaig Arts Centre in Ballinskelligs.  It was the brainchild of Ms Noelle Campbell-Sharp who did great work with other artists.  She brought thousands of people to that area.  People have gone into a village that was derelict and falling into decay.  There are great people like Mr. Nicholas Brown, who is the chairperson of a local committee, and all the others who worked diligently in ensuring that excellent facility was there for past, present and future up-and-coming artists and people who need to go to a special place to use their brains in only the way they can.  We must support that type of work.  I compliment people such Ms Kate Kennelly, who was our arts and heritage officer in County Kerry for many years, and our local authority, Kerry County Council, for the excellent work it has done in promoting the arts.<\/p>  <p>  In all parts of the county, we have produced excellent people who have made a valuable and important contribution.  Even during times of difficulty, the financial recession and the present difficulties we have, it is terribly important that we continue to support artists and to remember that during the present crisis we have entertainers who used to entertain every night of the week.  Now they cannot perform what they are good at and we must support those people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100600032#FF00400","speaker":"1487"},{"type":"speech","time":1602004800,"counter":326,"content":"<p>I only have a short time but I could talk about this for the whole evening.<\/p> <p>Music, song, dance and our cultural artists are so important, and they have gone through a very tough time this year in Kerry.

I had the pleasure of playing for an elderly woman the other night, Hannah O'Shea, who is 105 years old and lives on the Lewis Road in Killarney.  She was absolutely delighted.<\/p> <p> I have seen music played for elderly people, some with Alzheimer's disease, in groups and have seen them tapping to the music.  They might be elderly, sick and suffering but when someone plays them a few tunes they start tapping to the music.  It really makes a difference.  The psychological well-being and mental well-being of people is so important.<\/p> <p> We must do something for the artists who are on their knees at present and have nowhere to get funding.  We must open up some avenues for them and ensure they get some social welfare payment because many of them are not getting it.  I could say much more about the importance of playing music, song, dance and storytelling.  All that kind of thing is so important, and I hope we do not lose it because of this pandemic.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100600032#FF00500","speaker":"1580","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1602005400,"counter":328,"content":"<p>I will be sharing time.  Working in the arts is probably the most precarious of precarious jobs.  The sector has been extremely hard hit by the Covid-19 restrictions.  The National Campaign for the Arts, NCFA, has said that 68% of its members have been relying on the pandemic unemployment payment and have been severely impacted by the reductions introduced last month and in July.  Many artists and those working in the arts make a living through a combination of self-employed income and PAYE income, probably through a part-time irregular job.  However, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection does not allow them to combine the self-employed and PAYE income for consideration in calculating the pandemic unemployment payment.<\/p>  <p>  A number of these workers whose payment was reduced to &euro;203 after the July reduction contacted me.  They had appealed on a number of occasions to the Department dealing with the PUP rerating.  One woman had been in contact about six times and she contacted me.  She had included her tax returns from 2018 and 2019.  On the same morning I received an email from the Department's PUP team stating that she was rerated back up to &euro;350, she got another email from the same team stating that she was refused again.  I made representations for about 12 of these workers.  Every one of them got rerated back up to &euro;350 after they had appealed about six times, which is a very high rate of cases overturned on appeal.  It would normally be about one or two out of ten.<\/p>  <p>  It is important for the Minister to step in and support these workers or else they will be absolutely decimated.  This will have an impact on them paying for mortgages, rent, electricity, food, etc.  If we do not back these workers up now, they will not back us up in the future and they will not thank us for it.  It is important for the Minister to intervene to do that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100600033#GG00200","speaker":"1569"},{"type":"speech","time":1602005400,"counter":329,"content":"<p>I have received hundreds of emails from constituents across County Donegal who are involved in the arts and the associated live events industry, pleading for assistance.  More importantly, they are looking for a simple recognition from the Government that their sector has been decimated.  However, the Minister should dispense with the usual bland lip service.  From talking to performers, I know the hardships they face in making a living in the industry at the best of times.  I am sure we have all seen the emails from the Music and Entertainment Association of Ireland, outlining the problems its members face.  Nearly 20% of them say they are facing a decline in their mental health.  Many have had to sell equipment or are in arrears with utility bills.<\/p>  <p>  One of the major flaws with the Government is its over-reliance on reaction to questions and appeals from the Opposition, bombarding us with a plethora of generalised information on what it claims it is doing.  Knee-jerk schemes for various things have been the order of the day.  It does this without any apparent consideration as to whether these much-trumpeted schemes are properly funded to achieve the aims set.  It never considers if these much-lauded schemes address the concerns or problems highlighted by the people they are meant to assist.  Once the Government has created a press release, it has decided the aim from the point of view of the Government.<\/p>  <p>  My message for the Minister is simple.  To start with she should speak to the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection to ensure the Covid payments are restored to the previous levels.  Based on the NPHET advice, we are nowhere near the end of the Covid crisis.  It was a mean-spirited, na&iuml;ve and premature to cut the payments.  If she achieves that, she will have done some good.<\/p>  <p>  She should look at schemes that will allow artists to produce content and put money in their pockets without reams of red tape because that is also a killer.  This should be disbursed at a national, regional and local level but we must ensure the level of funding available is tangible and the innovation of the arts sector might just surprise us all then. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100600033#GG00300","speaker":"1547"},{"type":"speech","time":1602005400,"counter":330,"content":"<p>I thank Deputies for their contributions to the debate.  I recognise that everyone who has contributed is as passionate about the arts as I am.  I looked across the House during the debate and I saw so many Deputies like me who have that background.  Many Deputies are steeped in a great wealth of arts and music and I recognise the real knowledge they have.<\/p>  <p>  I will try to respond to as many of the queries I can, given the time available to me.  I am acutely aware of the difficulties facing the arts, culture, audiovisual, live entertainment and events sector.  I have made it my business to meet the representative organisations across that sector to listen to their concerns and the proposals they have for alleviating the difficulties they face so that when we are designing schemes I am doing it having listened to the needs that are being pointed out to me.  I have done it in consultation with them, which is key.  There is no point in designing schemes unless consultation has happened with the musicians, performers and all those who work in the industry.<\/p>  <p>  I have had several meetings with the National Campaign for the Arts, the Event Industry Alliance, the Arts Council, Screen Ireland and the national cultural institutions.  Officials in my Department consult widely and continually with the sector and meet stakeholders on a regular basis.  I am aware of the issues and am committed to ensuring the Government provides appropriate supports.<\/p>  <p>  A number of Deputies raised the pandemic unemployment payment.  I am conscious that the changes to it and to the wage subsidy scheme affect the lives of thousands of artists and workers across the arts, culture and live entertainment sector in a devastating way.  I understand these supports are needed now more than ever.  I have raised these matters with my Cabinet colleagues in the context of the budget, recognising that there will be a long period in which we will have to live with the virus and the difficulties that raises, especially in the arts and culture sectors.<\/p>  <p>  Several Deputies mentioned the live performance scheme.  As I emphasised during Question Time last week, that is a pilot scheme of &euro;5 million to see if it would work and that would inform me in my negotiations on the budget.  It certainly did work because there was an enormous response to it.  That scheme was developed in consultation with the sector and with EPIC.  Over 100 applications have been received requesting funding amounting to over &euro;15 million when &euro;5 million was provided.  That really strengthens my case as I negotiate for bigger and better, and what is needed.  That is why it was a pilot scheme.  The main objective of the scheme was the provision of employment for the artists, the creative technicians and their support staff.<\/p> <p>Deputy Cathal Crowe raised the issue of Irish dancing.  As Minister, I have responsibility for both sport and the arts and my officials will examine the protocols for dancing.  He also mentioned artists in the community.  We have artists going into schools, which we called creative schools, and I agree with the Deputy that it is a wonderful initiative.  That is why we have expanded it this year.  It is a wonderful way of employing artists and letting them engage with and inspire children and young people.  We have an additional 164 creative schools this year.<\/p> <p> Deputy Gannon raised the Arts Council.  He is not here but he may appreciate that I am not privy to operational matters.  I give him a commitment that I will get back to him if he wishes to contact me or give the details to my officials.<\/p> <p> Deputy Grealish mentioned the regional uplift.  While budget 2021 is a matter for the Minister for Finance, I will take every opportunity at Cabinet to highlight the importance and value of the cultural and audiovisual sectors and the benefits of increasing investment in them.<\/p> <p> Deputy Guirke raised musicians and we are looking at a number of initiatives to support them especially.  I have met members of MEAI, and my officials are in ongoing engagement with them.<\/p> <p> I assure Deputy Boyd Barrett that I am far from silent on this issue and I think my Cabinet colleagues will attest to that.  We had a conversation last week about how passionate I am and I share the passion of so many Deputies who come from this background.  We are fortunate to have a world-class animation sector.  Due to the nature of the work, animation has largely been able to continue through the crisis by means of remote working.  Earlier this year, in response to measures introduced to curb the spread of the virus live action production was suspended.  This also has an impact on post-production and visual effects providers but since the end of June, this has started to recommence and I am pleased to note that within the period three productions successfully resumed and were completed.  The audiovisual sector provides important employment and training opportunities and, therefore, it is of significant importance to the economy, to those working in the industry and indeed to audiences that productions return.<\/p> <p> I will definitely look into Deputy &Oacute; Cathasaigh's suggestion to commission, record and archive.<\/p> <p> I completely agree with Deputy &Oacute; Broin's analysis of the events industry.  In particular, in my opening remarks I stated that it is worth &euro;3.5 billion and it is very difficult for this sector which has never had to engage with Government previously.  We are continuing that engagement and since he queried it, my officials did consult EPIC on the live performance scheme.  Some of the arrangements of the scheme were suggested by EPIC.<\/p> <p> Regarding the points made by Deputy Danny Healy-Rae, the dementia-inclusive live azure tours are delivered via Zoom and are available to people living with dementia, their families, friends and professional carers.  They are provided on a scheduled, monthly basis for individuals and are bookable on demand for nursing home groups.  The programme aims to make art galleries and museums around Ireland dementia-friendly spaces and the tours will be delivered in collaboration with the Alzheimer's Society of Ireland and promoted through the HSE Dementia: Understand Together network.  We know of the love both Deputies Healy-Rae have for music as they have brought it to the gates of Leinster House to celebrate their election.  As an island, we will not take one county dominating in our arts and music as all 32 counties can claim their artists, their musicians and their actors.  We are a country rich in such people and every county can claim greatness when it comes to that.  It is the beauty of our nation and one of the reasons we need to protect it.<\/p> <p> Deputy Boyd Barrett referred to a legacy of lip service being paid to the arts, musicians and actors.  We had this debate last week and I fully agree with him on that.  It is time to back that up with the supports that are needed right here and now.  We have felt their value through the very tough times but it is much more than that as jobs are on the line and I am very conscious of that.  As I said, there is no silence from me at the Cabinet table.<\/p> <p> I agree with Deputy O'Connor on the make-up of the task force.  I have appointed arts practitioners to the task force, including musicians such Mr. Martin Hayes, Ms Denise Chaila, Ms Eleanor McEvoy and Mr. Pearse Doherty.  All members will be consulted widely.<\/p> <p> I hope I have addressed all of the questions.  If there are outstanding issues, Members should contact me or my officials and we will definitely follow up on them.  I will conclude by referring to an interview with the assistant rector at Berlin State Opera, who is an Irishwoman.  In a recent interview she was quoted as saying that the arts are seen in Ireland as a luxury whereas in Germany they are seen as a necessity.  I have always believed that the arts are a necessity and always have done.  During some of our darkest and longest days in the early months of the lockdown, the arts rescued many people from depression and despair.  Many more of us were comforted, consoled and cheered by the inspiring performances from Irish artists, actors, singers, poets and songwriters.  It is time for us to now rescue them.  We cannot constantly have this one-way relationship with this community; they are much more valuable than that.  They are invaluable to us and our very heritage.  We need the arts like never before.  Arts and culture define us as a people.  They are at the heart of who we are as a nation.  That relationship has to change so it is not one way.  Supports are needed now not just to sustain it but to ensure it thrives.  That is the determination I am bringing to this portfolio.  It is the most challenging of times to be the Minister with responsibility for arts and culture but it is the right time to be here because I am acutely aware of the supports they need and I am determined to get those supports to them.<\/p> <p> Tuigeann gach duine san Rialtas go bhfuil na heala&iacute;ona riachtanach agus t&aacute; s&eacute; mar dhualgas orm a chinnti&uacute; go nd&eacute;anfar beart de r&eacute;ir briathar &oacute; thaobh taca&iacute;ochta de.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100600033#GG00400","speaker":"1471","continuing":true},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Ceisteanna (At\u00f3g\u00e1il) - Questions (Resumed)","time":1602006000,"counter":332,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100600034#HH00400"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1602006000,"counter":333,"content":"<p>Note: Ministerial and Departmental titles have been updated in the Question text in anticipation of the relevant Government orders to give legal effect to the Taoiseach&rsquo;s announcement in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 27 June 2020.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Priority Questions","time":1602006000,"counter":334,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100600034#HH00500"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"House Purchase Schemes","time":1602006000,"counter":335,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100600034#HH00550"},{"type":"question","time":1602006000,"counter":336,"qnumday":28,"qnumall":"[28829\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100600034#HH00600","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the status of the affordable housing plan.","asker":"1468","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","time":1602006000,"counter":337,"content":"<p>On five occasions in July after he was appointed, the Minister made a very public commitment to announce both the details, targets and regulations of his new affordable housing scheme in September.

The programme details a wide range of measures to be brought forward over the lifetime of the Government to firmly put affordability back at the centre of the housing system.<\/p> <p>This includes, for example, ensuring our local authorities are central to the delivery of housing solutions, the progression of State-backed affordable housing programmes and the development of a cost rental model that creates affordability for tenants.  These are things most of us would agree with.<\/p> <p> The Land Development Agency has also been tasked with working with Departments, local authorities, State agencies and other stakeholders, and it is assembling large and strategic sites to deliver social and affordable homes for rent and purchase.

As I have said previously, including in the House, I will outline these detailed plans in the autumn, informed by the budget 2021 process.  It is a firm commitment in the programme for Government.

My concern is that, on the basis of what he has been saying in the media recently, a large portion of what the Minister appears to be working on is not affordable housing.  For example, with regard to the comments at the weekend on extending the help-to-buy scheme at its higher rate into next year, while that is of benefit to the people who access it, although according to the Government's own report, 40% of those people who got that very generous subsidy did not need it, the scheme does not make houses more affordable.  It locks in unsustainably high prices.  I am also very concerned about what seems to be a shift towards a Government backed shared equity loan.  This is a secondary Government loan on top of very large and risky banking debt, again locking in unsustainably high prices and not delivering for modest income working families.  All I hear with regard to the serviced sites fund is possibly some tinkering around the eligibility criteria rather than the type of increase in capital investment we need.

There are other measures, including affordability measures, that help people buy homes, one of them being the help-to-buy grant that I have supported in opposition and in government.  The Deputy opposed the help-to-buy grant, which more than 19,000 people have used to get on to the housing ladder.  Many of these people would not have been able to do so without it.  We know there is an affordability issue and supply is key to delivering affordability.  This year will be very challenging on supply in the overall housing market.  We are looking at between 16,000 and 18,000 completions.  As demand grows and supply lessens, there will be acute affordability issues next year and measures will need to be taken to assist people.

It would be much cheaper than those purchased through help-to-buy or shared equity loans.  Likewise, increased capital investment is needed by local authorities to build genuinely affordable homes and sell or rent them at cost.  We should also stop using public land to sell unaffordable private sector homes.  The Oscar Traynor Road site is currently before Dublin City Council and 50% of the homes to be sold are at unaffordable open market prices.  That is not the best strategic use of the land in question.

The number of homeless children fell by over one quarter in the six months that the ban was in place.  That is why the ban was introduced in the first place, it is why the ban is needed now and it is why all of the major housing and homeless groups are calling for it.

The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform issued an update to the public spending code in October 2019 to include a requirement that, prior to seeking approval from the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to dispose of land and buildings on the open market, all non-commercial State bodies must first consult with the LDA in relation to the appropriate disposal of these lands.  This requirement will further be strengthened by a commitment in the programme for Government that any State lands offered for sale will automatically be offered first to the LDA.

Some of these properties are long-term voids that have been out of the market and out of use for over 12 months.  There will be a targeted approach to this.

The minimum income level was introduced to ensure the sustainability of the scheme.

As I pointed out earlier, it is key that the Land Development Agency is developing a model of housing which is social, affordable and cost-rental housing.  From the applications that have been received by the LDA, actions speak louder than words.  For example, the matrix for the applications in Shanganagh and D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council is that 34% are for social housing, 51% are for cost-rental and 15% are for affordable purchase.  The work we have to do in the Department is to deliver those schemes now to ensure there is sustainable housing and an increase in supply for social tenants and that this supply is on public land.  The kernel of the Land Development Agency's role is to deliver that.<\/p>  <p>  We must also prioritise the legislation to place the Land Development Agency on a statutory footing and ensure that this work is prioritised and carried out.  As I pointed out, there are currently nine sites under the control of the LDA on which it aims to deliver 3,600 homes.  The agency is partnering with a number of local authorities and working with them on the ground to ensure we make the best possible use of public land to deliver public homes.  The legislation will make clear the tasks the Land Development Agency will carry out to ensure we have sustainable tenancies in future for our citizens.

Of 500 homes in Killinarden, 100 will be fully private.  We have a housing crisis in this State.  The public, through the State, owns a limited amount of land.  The cheapest way by far to provide public housing to address the housing crisis is for the State to build on that land.

The LDA has told D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council that the rental units will cost &euro;1,300 a month, which is not affordable for many of the cohorts.  On the Central Mental Hospital site in Dundrum, the original proposition for the LDA was that 60% of the homes would be sold at open market prices.  If the Minister of State is saying that is no longer possible and that all the sites in which the LDA is involved will be solely social affordable rental and purchase homes, that would be a big shift and one that many of us may welcome.  Let us remember, however, that in O&rsquo;Devaney Gardens, which is a Dublin City Council rather than an LDA site, 50% of the homes will sell at prices of approximately &euro;470,000.  The so-called affordable homes will be sold for &euro;310,000, plus an equity stake of &euro;50,000, which amounts to &euro;360,000.  That is not affordable.  I hear what the Minister of State is saying and we will judge the legislation when we see it, but we have developments today where public land is being used for unaffordable open market price houses and allegedly affordable homes that are unaffordable.

The programme for Government, Our Shared Future, commits to reducing and preventing homelessness and provides detail on how the Government will approach it as a priority.  This year, we are seeing a reduction in the numbers of people in emergency accommodation.  That is to be welcomed.  Deputy Murphy's assertion that homelessness figures are rising is incorrect.  The statistics do not bear that out.  We have seen a slight increase in the homelessness rate among single adults.  We are watching that but what I must watch, in particular, is the number of people who have been homeless for a sustained period.  One of the issues that arises is the lack of availability of properties appropriate for single people.  That is why I issued, in early July, the call for housing, which involved asking each local authority, through the Housing Agency, to acquire properties, particularly focusing on those experiencing long-term homelessness.  I refer not just to single people, who are a concern, but also to larger families.  I apologise to colleagues who attended the meeting of the housing committee earlier if I am repeating myself because we went into this in a little detail.  Approximately 50 larger families have been homeless for four years because the requisite, appropriate properties have not been available to them.  I have again asked through the Housing Agency that we source such properties as a matter of priority to focus our efforts on those who have experienced long-term homelessness.  We also need to ensure that we prevent people from going into homelessness.  We need to ensure, therefore, a sustainable supply of public properties.  We must also ensure that people do not fall into homelessness itself.<\/p>  <p>  I thank the local authorities, the delivery partners and the Department for all their work this year on sourcing homes and dealing with the threat of Covid-19.  Significant numbers of individuals and families are exiting homelessness every week.  On 25 September, I published the monthly homelessness report for August.  It showed that a total of 8,702 individuals were in emergency accommodation, representing a decrease of 26 on the figure from the July report.  Indeed, the figures from August 2020 represent a decrease of 1,636 individuals, down 16% on the 10,338 recorded at the same point in 2019.  The August report also confirmed the lowest number of families reported in emergency accommodation since June 2016 and the lowest number of dependants recorded since February 2017.  That is not to trumpet a success because I will not be happy until the homelessness figures are driven down to the bare minimum.<\/p>  <p>  My Department also published details on the number of adults exiting homelessness to a tenancy on a quarterly basis.  Based on the information provided in the performance reports from the local authorities, the report for quarter 2 showed that, in the first half of this year, 3,033 adults exited homelessness into a tenancy.  This represented a 7% increase on exits over the same period in 2019.  There are, however, still too many households in emergency accommodation, many of whom I have visited since taking over as Minister.  I am committed to addressing this.<\/p>  <p>  One of the key measures we are implementing to resolve this crisis involves increasing the supply of housing.  To this end, the programme for Government commits to the increased supply of public, social and affordable homes.  In particular, we will increase the social housing stock by more than 50,000, with an emphasis on new builds.  In the short term, as part of the July stimulus I considered how we could use our existing properties better and get them back into use.  I refer to the void stimulus, the objective being to have 2,500 homes back in use this year.  A sizeable proportion of them will be for the homeless, which is to be welcomed.<\/p>  <p>  The programme for Government also recognises that many of those experiencing homelessness have additional support needs, which we have discussed this evening, and it includes specific measures to address these needs.  These include measures to help rough sleepers to enter sustainable accommodation, the continued expansion of Housing First, to which we are committed, with the focus on construction and acquisition of one-bedroom homes and, importantly, ensuring there are dedicated resources and funding to deliver the necessary health and mental health supports required to assist homeless people with complex needs.  I am working closely with my colleague, the Minister for Health, to make progress on the measures to be taken to enhance the health supports provided to homeless households, with a particular focus on Covid in the short term.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100600042#QQ00700","speaker":"1561"},{"type":"speech","time":1602011400,"counter":452,"content":"<p>The Minister was given five minutes to respond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100600043#RR00100","speaker":"1628"},{"type":"speech","time":1602011400,"counter":453,"content":"<p>I apologise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100600043#RR00200","speaker":"1561"},{"type":"speech","time":1602011400,"counter":454,"content":"<p>There are three questions being taken together and in those circumstances the Minister gets additional time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100600043#RR00300","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1602011400,"counter":455,"content":"<p>There are two issues, the first of which is the general homeless figures.

There is a particular issue which should not be lost, namely, the issue about the increase in homeless single adults.  The organisations involved are crying out about the crisis in this area.  Anthony Flynn of Inner City Helping Homeless says that winter is going to be a major issue for that organisation and that deaths will skyrocket.

families, carers and service providers have been stretched to incredible lengths, many to breaking point throughout the course of this pandemic;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the personal toll and long-term impact of the withdrawal of care and supports for people with disabilities, their families and their carers is deeply worrying;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; due to Covid-19, disability services that rely on voluntary fundraising to meet operating costs have been unable to do so;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; services are suffering from chronic underfunding which has resulted in unmet need exacerbated by Covid-19;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; reopened disability day services are operating at approximately 40 per cent capacity;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; service providers submitted their funding requirements to the Health Service Executive in mid-June; and<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the Government&rsquo;s allocation of &euro;10 million in additional funding to day services and home support services for disability service users is insufficient and will not meet the urgent Covid-19 related costs for service providers, community and home support; <\/blockquote>recognises: <blockquote> \t&mdash; that Ireland&rsquo;s ratification of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities requires progressive implementation; and<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the innovative and committed response of disability and dementia service providers in the delivery of care and support for people with disabilities and their families throughout this pandemic; and <\/blockquote>calls on the Government to: <blockquote> \t&mdash; provide the funding required to fully reopen day and other essential disability services to implement all Covid-19 related protocols; and<br \/><br \/>&mdash; provide the additional funding, resources and capital investment required to guarantee sustainable capacity within disability and dementia services.&rdquo; <\/blockquote>  <\/blockquote>  <p>I am sharing time with Deputy Funchion.  I am pleased to propose this motion, which has the support of all Opposition parties and most Independent Deputies.  This is a significant motion that demonstrates a collective acknowledgement of the disability and dementia funding crisis.  I commend my party leader, Deputy McDonald, on taking the initiative to invite all parties and Independent Members to come together on this issue, but it is disappointing that none of the Government parties responded to the invitation.<\/p><p>From mid-March, day services and respite services were closed, as were most other sectors in society.  This proved difficult for many people for a variety of reasons, but it is fair to say that people with disabilities were disproportionately affected.  Many service providers have told me how they have noticed since reopening that the people they care for have regressed over the past six months.  This sector, through no fault of its own, has been extremely slow to reopen, with most services not resuming until mid to late August or in September.  Day services such as training and education facilities are only operating at approximately 40% of the capacity before Covid-19, again through no fault of theirs.  I commend service providers on the terrific job they did both during the lockdown and since reopening.<\/p><p>I have consulted service providers and advocacy groups and they have identified a number of challenges that are prohibiting the full reopening of services.  These challenges are transport, accommodation, staff and Covid-related costs such as PPE.  The issues with transport are a result of the 2 m rule, which means that only a small number of service users can travel at one time.  Even if this is reduced to 1 m, it would still present a problem.  For example, a bus which could have carried perhaps 15 people before Covid-19 can now only transport a total of five people.  This means that either the number of buses or the number of runs by buses must be increased.  Either way, investment is needed to cover the cost of hiring another bus or asking existing buses to do additional trips.  Some service users are not being offered any form of transport and are depending on family members to bring them to the day services.  If that is not possible, they are unable to avail of services.<\/p><p>While some premises are sufficiently spacious to allow social distancing, many are not.  Funding must be provided immediately to enable services to acquire additional space, where necessary.<\/p><p>Staffing is a major issue.  As a result of distancing rules and to accommodate all service users, additional staff are needed in practically every service.  Some services have sufficient physical space to allow all service users to attend, but more staff are needed as those attending services will be placed in pods to comply with public health guidelines.  They also have the added burden of replacing staff who might have to self-isolate.  Many services have had to resort to employing agency staff, which has proven very costly.  The ongoing issue of section 39 pay restoration means that retention of staff is being impacted harder as a result of Covid-19.  People in residential units cannot attend day services so staff in those units must provide the day services as well.  Service users with underlying health conditions cannot attend services, so home supports should be provided to those people.  Again, staff will be the main problem.  There is also an urgent need for infrastructure, home care and community support for people affected by dementia.  Their sense of abandonment runs deep.<\/p><p>Every service has spent a substantial amount on PPE and sanitation.  Providers have not been recompensed for this, and have no idea whether they will be.  Business cases for Covid-related expenditure were submitted to the HSE in June.  The sector estimates the true cost of Covid-19 is &euro;120 million, but the Government has yet to provide any funding to meet this additional burden on services.  Respite care provision was suspended, too, and has only reopened on a much-reduced level recently, if at all.  People need a break.  For six months people with disabilities and their families have been trying to cope in what are sometimes impossible circumstances.  I also note the current inadequacy of the provision of personal assistant hours for people with disabilities.  This inadequacy must be addressed urgently.<\/p><p>I have outlined the immediate challenges facing the full reopening of day services and respite and community care.  Covid-19 will be with us for some time.  The necessary funding to allow the acquisition of additional transport services, accommodation, staff and other essentials must be made available immediately.  The Minister's meagre &euro;10 million funding announcement last week was met with shock and dismay by the disability sector.  I should not have to remind the Government that policy development and funding of disability services must be rights-based, as determined by the State's obligation under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD.  There are numerous reports on the implementation of what needs to happen, but very little has happened.  Immediate action is needed across all Departments to ensure accessible transport, a move away from congregated settings to suitable housing for independent living in the community, educational supports to allow people with disabilities have full access to education and more employment opportunities for people with disabilities.<\/p><p>I urge the Government to support the motion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100600044#UU00400","speaker":"1513"},{"type":"speech","time":1602012000,"counter":479,"content":"<p>I commend my colleague, Deputy Tully, on bringing the motion forward.  Unfortunately, people with a disability and their carers have been relegated to second-class citizens in this State.  In every sector there are delays, waiting lists and, in many cases, a complete lack of services.  It has become acceptable and the norm for people with a disability to have to fight for every service that others take for granted.  I refer, in particular, to schools, school places in autism spectrum disorder, ASD, classes and transport for both school and adult day services.  There is also the issue of the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, and the fact that schools have to battle for a handful of appointments every year and must try to pick the children the schools believe need the service most.  It is an impossible situation in which to be placed.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to draw attention to an issue in the Carlow and Kilkenny region with the provision of occupational therapy, speech and language therapy and physiotherapy, particularly for children.  There is an average waiting time of 18 months to two years for an appointment.  There are also long delays in assessments and often people are delighted when they finally get an assessment, thinking they will finally get their services.  However, in many cases, they must wait 18 months to two years for a follow-up service.  Many people tell me they are getting one appointment per year.  I stress that it is not due to the existing staff who are working in that sector.  I honestly do not know how they keep going and keep their morale up when all they see are growing waiting lists of children.  There definitely must be greater investment in this area immediately.  I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, specifically to examine the situation in Carlow and Kilkenny.  I was thinking about this earlier.<\/p> <p>There has been a lot of media attention recently on the appointment of special advisers and additional advisers.  When a need is perceived for such a role it can be filled immediately.  However, we are waiting years for occupational therapists, speech and language therapists and physiotherapists to help children in the Carlow and Kilkenny region.  <\/p> <p> I refer to the optional protocol of the UNCRPD.  We need to ratify this without delay as the only way the State is finally going to sit up and take action is because it will be forced to do so.  I appeal to the Minister of State because I feel that she wants to do the right thing here and I have seen some statements she has made since taking over this role.  I hope she will follow this up with action and do the right thing by all those with a disability and their carers.  They are totally exhausted and they need assistance, funding and investment.  The sector has been underfunded and has suffered from under-investment for years.  Covid has highlighted that and thrown it into stark contrast.  Now we have a situation where people are trying to reopen services.  If someone finally gets a place or a couple of hours of assistance, the next thing is a battle for transport.  There are major issues to be addressed.  I do not think anybody is looking for an overnight solution but people want to see that the issue is being taken seriously and services are going to be delivered.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100600044#UU00500","speaker":"1449","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1602012600,"counter":481,"content":"<p>I think there might be a misunderstanding with respect to speakers.

Thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  Here is what we know.  Since before Covid-19 arrived in Ireland, people with disabilities have experienced higher rates of discrimination than people without disabilities.  That discrimination is more likely to occur and be more serious.  People with disabilities are more than three times likelier to experience poverty and deprivation than people without disabilities.  Ireland has the lowest employment rate for people with disabilities in the EU.  People with disabilities are less likely to attend further education.  An estimated 1,300 plus people with disabilities under 65 are being inappropriately accommodated in nursing homes.  I say &quot;estimated&quot; because the HSE has not been able to provide me with the actual figures yet.  It took Ireland over ten years to ratify the UNCPRD, and the Government still has not ratified the optional protocol.  Carers and voluntary organisations do incredible work out of love and dedication and receive very little assistance for filling a gap that the State should have filled and can fill.  Disability health and support services were already underfunded, and were due to be cut by a further &euro;20 million earlier this year by the then Government.  I could go on.  The work of bodies such as the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, Inclusion Ireland, and the Disability Federation of Ireland let us all know how disgracefully people with disabilities and their families are treated by the State.<\/p><p>It is fair to say that the group most profoundly impacted by the pandemic is people with disabilities.  That is on top of all the existing issues I mentioned, and now Covid-19 and the Government&rsquo;s response have added considerably more challenges.  Day services have been closed for months in many cases and some are still closed, leading to regression, isolation and distress for people as well as additional hardship and a lack of respite for their families and carers.  As in other sectors, contacts between services and people moved online in some cases.  However, Inclusion Ireland research shows that many people with disabilities cannot use or do not have access to IT equipment.  There are increased rates of anxiety and loneliness.  The nearly 3,000 people with disabilities residing in settings of ten or more people have been put at unnecessary risk by the State during the pandemic due to their living arrangements.  School and college students with disabilities have additional needs that were not adequately addressed by the online systems.  Many people with disabilities who work in hospitality and other industries either lost their jobs or cannot attend work due to health concerns, which affects not only their income but their independence and personal dignity.  Disability services staff, medical therapists and dentists are among those who have been redeployed to contact tracing, which has seriously affected the capacity of the State to provide essential services.  Furthermore, for workers in this sector, the inequalities between section 39 and section 38 organisations have been highlighted, with section 38 employees being eligible for Covid sick pay while section 39 employees are not. <\/p><p>This is the cumulative reality for people with disabilities in Ireland.  Before Covid people faced innumerable hurdles which have been magnified during the pandemic.  Our challenge and our job is to immediately respond to these issues.  This sector needs the resources to ensure a range of supports is provided to enable everyone to live dignified, independent lives.  The impact of Covid continues to resonate for people with disabilities.  Here is just a snapshot of issues I have been contacted about in the past week.  A young man who cannot access speech and language therapy in west Cork has to travel almost two hours to the city, including stops because he cannot be in a confined space for too long, to get 30 minutes of vital therapy.  People in west Cork need to be able to access therapeutic services locally.  It is completely unreasonable and, to be honest, outrageous to expect people to travel two hours for 30 minutes with a speech and language therapist.  An occupational therapist highlighted the chronic lack of hoists and other supports without depending on the physical strength of family members or carers, which in any case is not advisable.  As a result, one family is unable to travel more than 20 minutes from home due to toiletry needs.  With the easing of restrictions during the summer, the rest of us could travel around but families like this one remained in a <i>de facto<\/i>lockdown. <\/p><p>While the addition of outdoor dining has saved many small caf&eacute;s and restaurants, a lack of consideration for people with disabilities in mobility or those with visual impairments has resulted in new and additional barriers.  A woman with a visual impairment contacted me to highlight this issue as it creates uncertainty and erodes independence.  In towns like Bandon, seating has been put on reclaimed street space so that it leaves the footpaths free, which is great.  These matters were highlighted during Make a Way Day two weeks ago.  Any actions from national or local government need to be implemented through a disability lens to ensure basic mistakes like this do not arise.  There are countless other examples I could give from across west Cork and beyond from people who have contacted me since I was elected.  The common thread in all these stories is a State that is unwilling to accept its responsibility to address the needs of all citizens and residents. <\/p><p>The motion rightly calls for funding to fully reopen day and other essential disability services and to guarantee sustainable capacity within disability and dementia services.  This responds to the calls from people with disabilities.  They are the experts and we have to listen to them.  The Government prioritised the opening of schools and colleges in roadmaps and &quot;living with Covid&quot; documents.  It needs to do the same for people with disabilities.  We need healthcare services locally at the point of need, therapeutic supports in schools and training centres, vastly improved accessibility in transport and towns, and to see an immediate move from congregated settings to community-based housing.  We also need to properly pay medical and support staff, including carers, and provide employment opportunities for people in all communities. <\/p><p>Funding is central here.  The State outsources its responsibility to charitable organisations and the goodwill of communities.  However, the weakness of this model has come to the fore since fundraising capacities have collapsed, with an average loss of 40% in income for members of the Disability Federation of Ireland.  These losses are even more significant for small to medium community-based disability organisations that rely so heavily on fundraising when they should be able to rely on the State.  These organisations need those funds matched, at the very least, to maintain services.  They will need even more to be able to operate under Covid protocols and to develop innovative approaches to providing services.  For example, CoAction West Cork, a support service for children and adults with an intellectual disability and-or autism, needs money to recruit, retain and fully pay its staff.  The Government will need to invest in CoAction and other smaller organisations to cover the full costs of Covid expenditure in disability services. <\/p><p>An issue I have raised before, and will continue to raise, is the shameful lack of appropriate housing.  Article 19 of the UN convention guarantees the right to live independently in the community with a range of in-home, residential and other community support services, rather than in institutions.  Successive Governments have failed to ensure this right is provided for.  In west Cork it is practically impossible to access independent supported living.<\/p> <p>Ordinarily, this is a breach of people's rights but during Covid-19 this puts people, some of whom have underlying medical complications, at greater risk.  This is not a symptom of the pandemic but of poor policy decisions and priorities over decades.<br\/><br\/>As Dr. Frank Conaty of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission outlined to me at the Special Committee on Covid-19 Response last July: <\/p><blockquote>\tIt is not the pandemic that has caused this, but the pandemic is giving rise to greater risk for people in these congregated settings. ... The fractures in the policy architecture we now see this pandemic showing up have always been there, but it is clearly within our gift to address and correct them. <\/blockquote> <p>The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities is the means by which many of these issues can be addressed and I look forward to working with many Deputies on the Committee on Disability Matters when it is formed.  A rights-based approach is absolutely essential.  However, in the meantime, the Government must commit to providing the funding and resources necessary to support people with disabilities and their families in living with Covid-19, and with dignity. <br\/><br\/>Almost 70 Deputies from across the Opposition benches are behind this motion.  I thank Sinn F&eacute;in for enabling us to do this.  Deputies from across the political spectrum may not agree on many things but we are all united on this and I find it hard to believe the 80-plus Deputies in government do not agree with us.<br\/><br\/>People with disabilities and their families deserve more and are also entitled to more.  It is their right and is a right the Government must fulfil.<br\/><br\/>The pandemic has been hard on everyone.  It has brought suffering, loss, unemployment and upset but a disproportionate burden has been placed on people with disabilities and it is essential we do everything we can to lighten that burden.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100600045#VV01100","speaker":"1525","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1602013200,"counter":492,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 1:<\/p><p>To delete all words after &ldquo;D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann&rdquo;

<br \/><br \/>&mdash; since the onset of Covid-19 the focus of service providers has been to mitigate its immediate impact on the disability community and the World Health Organization (WHO) anticipates that Covid-19 will be with us for a further 12-18 months; <br \/><br \/>&mdash; the implementation of Covid-19 restrictions has led to the reduction and suspension of services for both children and adults across disability services and while these restrictions have been introduced as protective measures, they have resulted in significant stress for individuals with disabilities and their families; <br \/><br \/>&mdash; the reintroduction of services is now underway, as detailed in the Health Service Executive&rsquo;s (HSE) roadmap to reopening services, in line with public health guidance; <br \/><br \/>&mdash; since the outset, the HSE Community Healthcare Organisations (CHO) and disability service providers worked collaboratively with families using creative and innovative models of care to support service users where the need was greatest; <br \/><br \/>&mdash; the Government is very aware of the impact of the pandemic on people with disabilities, their families and their carers; <br \/><br \/>&mdash; children&rsquo;s services, respite services and adult day services are all resuming, having been reimagined and redesigned to be delivered in line with new guidance published by the HSE; <br \/><br \/>&mdash; health and social care responses to the current public health emergency are under continuing review, including specific measures such as those to support vulnerable people; these available supports may change over time and the HSE is aware that the needs of people with a disability and their families will also change over time; and <br \/><br \/>&mdash; in line with the Government's Resilience and Recovery Framework (2020-2021): Plan for Living with Covid-19 (Plan for Living with Covid-19), the HSE regards the provision of disability services as essential to maintaining a response to people with a disability, in the same way that schools and creches are, and importantly, the Government&rsquo;s intention is that disability services will remain open at each level of the Plan for Living with Covid-19, subject to public health guidance, including the prevention and management of Covid-19 related infection;  notes that:   \t&mdash; the HSE have consistently worked to engage with individual service providers throughout 2020 citing difficulties in service provision and sustainability due to historical financial deficits and new financial challenges, and the requirement for disability service providers to achieve a financial efficiency target of 1 per cent of their budget in 2020 has been removed; <br \/><br \/>&mdash; substantial additional funding has been allocated to the Health Estimate Vote to meet the costs associated with the implementation of the measures outlined in the National Action Plan in Response to Covid-19 (Coronavirus), and the HSE have put measures in place to address both the financial and non-financial challenges of disability service providers in dealing with Covid-19;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; investment in disability services is significant with an overall budget for disability services exceeding &euro;2 billion in 2020; <br \/><br \/>&mdash; the financial implications of measures taken to mitigate Covid-19 infection are matters which the Department of Health will continue to keep under review in conjunction with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, as the situation evolves; <br \/><br \/>&mdash; children&rsquo;s disability services will continue to progress in all areas, and all CHOs are putting appropriate arrangements in place to resume assessment of need and intervention therapy services in line with public health guidance; guidance documents have been circulated by the HSE to all CHOs to support clinicians in decision making regarding disability assessments in the context of Covid-19 and support the return to more normal levels of service provision for children with disabilities and their families, and funding of &euro;7.8 million has been provided to the HSE specifically to reduce the current backlog in the assessment of need, which will help reduce waiting times both for the assessment and for any therapeutic services required; <br \/><br \/>&mdash; adult day services reopened throughout August and September at 40 per cent of their pre- Covid-19 capacity and to augment this, on Monday 28th September the Minister for Health and the Minister of State with responsibility for Disability, announced that &euro;10 million is being made available in 2020 to support the resumption of day services and enhanced home support services for disability service users and that this funding is being drawn down from the National Action Plan in Response to Covid-19 (Coronavirus); <br \/><br \/>&mdash; of this, &euro;7.5 million will increase disability day services by one day a week for over 14,000 adults, however, capacity in day services will remain at a reduced level; the guidance developed to support the resumption of adult day services has had to take account of social distancing rules which has meant that there is a reduced number of people in each service location and the HSE is committed to maximising the support that can be provided within these restrictions; this involves a balancing of protective measures with as much available access to day services as possible, and the full year cost of continuing these services in 2021 of &euro;30 million will be sought as part of the Estimates process; <br \/><br \/>&mdash; residential services for people with disabilities have continued throughout the pandemic and new guidance issued at the end of September in respect of visits to residential care facilities reflects the different levels of the Plan for Living with Covid-19; as with previous guidance, this emphasises that such facilities are the home environments of individuals residing there and as such the importance of maintaining family connections with loved ones from a holistic person-centred approach; <br \/><br \/>&mdash; respite is an important support mechanism for many families and short-stay residential and emergency\/residential respite began to reopen from July to August as the first stage in a three-phase plan, and activity is now increasing for the next two phases &ndash; the September to November phase and then the December 2020 to February 2021 phase; <br \/><br \/>&mdash; the allocation of additional funding to disability services is only part of a range of complex barriers to the full resumption of disability services; challenges include the physical limitations of the buildings available and the continued restrictions imposed by social distancing guidance, and the HSE is building increased capacity for day services, including building refurbishment to provide extra space and access to community building and facilities; <br \/><br \/>&mdash; a key commitment in the Programme for Government is the implementation of the National Dementia Care Strategy, which aims to improve how we provide care for people living with dementia, and that in line with the Programme for Government commitment to expand the dementia advisor service on a nationwide basis, an additional 10 dementia advisors are being recruited this year with support from the Sl&aacute;intecare Enhanced Community Fund; <br \/><br \/>&mdash; there has been a continued focus on meeting the needs of people living with dementia who were impacted by the suspension of day care services during the Covid-19 pandemic; <br \/><br \/>&mdash; the HSE, in collaboration with the Alzheimer Society of Ireland, has developed a range of initiatives and resources to ensure that people living with dementia stayed safe, well and connected during the crisis; <br \/><br \/>&mdash; the Government&rsquo;s approach to meeting the terms of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD) is one of sustained and on-going improvement, and work is continuing on the reforms needed for an optimum level of compliance with the UNCRPD's requirements; and<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the Programme for Government also commits to the development of an implementation plan to coordinate implementation of the UNCRPD, and furthermore, the Programme commits to work with other parties in the Oireachtas through an Oireachtas Joint Committee to assist in monitoring and implementing the provisions of the UNCRPD, and work will commence on the development of an implementation plan shortly; and commits to:   \t&mdash; a continued whole of government approach to improving access to and quality of services for people with a disability in line with the HSE&rsquo;s Transforming Lives Programme and the National Disability Inclusion Strategy 2017-2021; <br \/><br \/>&mdash; preparation of Ireland&rsquo;s Initial State Report to the Oireachtas Joint Committee, which is at an advanced stage of drafting and, in addition, the consultation phase on the State Report is being planned; key to this is the involvement of, and consultation with, persons with a disability on the State Report; <br \/><br \/>&mdash; the ongoing establishment of A Disability Participation and Consultation Network which will move Ireland towards meeting its obligations under the UNCRPD to consult and actively involve persons with a disability and their representative organisation, and one of the first tasks for this Network will be to partake in the consultation process on the Initial State Report; <br \/><br \/>&mdash; the full implementation of the Sustainable, Inclusive and Empowered Communities: A Five-Year Strategy to Support the Community and Voluntary Sector in Ireland 2019- 2024, which sets out a long-term vision for communities in Ireland and a general direction of travel for Government policy in relation to the community and voluntary sector for the coming years; <br \/><br \/>&mdash; strengthening the State&rsquo;s relationship with the voluntary sector through meaningful participation in the new dialogue forum between the Department of Health, relevant health agencies and representation from voluntary organisations in the health and social care sector; and <br \/><br \/>&mdash; moving to a population-based planning approach to service delivery, in line with the Sl&aacute;intecare vision, based on demographic and geographic considerations that reflects both the health and social care needs of those within our population, including those who require specialist disability services; this will afford the opportunity to prioritise and design the health and social care services that need to be developed for each region, so the population can get the right care, in the right place, at the right time in line with Health Information and Quality Authority standards and available resources.&rdquo;  <\/blockquote>  <p>I thank the Deputies for raising this motion in the House.  Although I will be opposing the motion as it is set out this evening, I welcome the chance to restate the Government's commitment to supporting people with disabilities and their families, particularly, at this time when we are dealing with the consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic and the current restrictions it causes.<\/p><p>I wish to start by acknowledging with sincerity how difficult the last few months have been for people with disabilities and their families.  The impact of Covid-19 on their lives has been and continues to be significant.  I am aware that families across the country have had their routines upended.<\/p><p>Covid-19 has presented a huge challenge for disability services.  While we all want our services to return to pre-Covid levels, the collective aim of the Department of Health, the HSE and the service providers must be to restore services in a safe way.  Tonight, I wish to outline the significant work that is under way to achieve this.<\/p><p>The HSE provides and funds a range of day services and rehabilitative training.  We engage with approximately 19,000 adults with disabilities in almost 1,000 locations across the country.  These services are essential for adults with disabilities and their families who avail of them.<\/p><p>As the House will be aware, because of Covid-19 the majority of disability services closed in March.  They have now reopened.  They have not, however, resumed at the level at which they had been pre-Covid.  The impact of social distancing inevitably limits the number of people who can be present in any service, as well as the numbers in community settings. <\/p><p>I can completely understand the intense frustration of the day service users and their families at this moment.  The fact that day services have not resumed to pre-Covid levels is far from ideal.  My office has been inundated with queries about adult day services.  The main question people ask me is when services will increase.  Answering the question has been my absolute priority since taking office.  I was pleased last week to announce that &euro;10 million is being made available in 2020 to support the resumption of adult day services and enhance home support for people with disabilities.  Of this funding, &euro;7.5 million will increase the level of day services by one day a week for over 14,000 adult day service users.  <\/p><p>The resumption of day services has been a welcome and hugely necessary development for service users and their families.  The additional day of service it will provide is a step in the right direction.  It will improve the situation for people using day services, and their families, as we face into tougher winter months.  Ongoing challenges we face are things like the physical limitations of the buildings available and the continued restriction of social distance guidance.  The HSE is building increased capacity for day services and will maximise the support that can be provided with these restrictions.<\/p><p>The allocation of additional funding to day services is only one way of addressing the complex barriers to the full resumption of services.  Children's services, respite services and adult day services are all resuming.  They have been reimagined and redesigned to be delivered in line with the new HSE guidance.  Crucially, the Government's intention is that similar to schools and cr&egrave;ches, disability services will remain open at each level of the resilience and recovery framework subject to public health guidance.<\/p><p>Residential services for people with disabilities have continued throughout the pandemic.  Approximately three quarters of those in disability residential care live in group homes in the community.  The remainder are in congregated settings or campus settings where there are ten people in a group.  Smaller settings have proven to be safer when it comes to Covid-19.  Other protective factors are a shared proactive response to the public health teams and service providers working together.<\/p><p>People in disability services are, on average, younger than those living in nursing homes but they do not have an average number of people with clinical conditions.  Those conditions could increase their vulnerability to serious illnesses if affected.  Sadly, 13 people living in residential disability services have died due to coronavirus.  There have been no further deaths since early summer but that does not allow for complacency.  We owe it to our vulnerable family members to observe public health guidance to keep this figure as low as possible.  We must also remember that these residential facilities are people's homes.  We must not and nor should we forget the importance of maintaining family connections with loved ones from a holistic person-centred approach.<\/p><p>The Government recognises that there is a need to address the financial sustainability issues facing the disability sector and is committed to publishing the disability capacity review.  We also intend to use the recent research into the cost of disability to individuals and families to properly inform the direction of future policy.  However, moving forward towards a more sustainable model of service provision will also mean finding out what factors are causing sustainability challenges and I encourage disability service providers to work with the HSE to address these underlying issues.<\/p><p>Investment in disability services is significant with an overall budget for disability services exceeding &euro;2 billion in 2020 with additional funding allocated to meet the associated costs of dealing with Covid-19.  The HSE has consistently worked to engage with individual service providers who are having difficulties in service provision and sustainability due to historical financial deficits and new financial challenges.  The House may recall that over the summer, I asked the HSE to relieve section 38 and 39 disability service providers of the obligation to achieve the 1% cut.  This was to ease the burden of service provider challenges in the context of Covid-19, which was worth &euro;20 million to the sector.<\/p><p>I do not underestimate the scale of these challenges and I have previously acknowledged the commitment of these services in supporting and protecting those with a disability who attend health and social care settings.  When I addressed the House last month, I mentioned during statements on disabilities that my colleague, the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, and I had asked that the establishment of the proposed Oireachtas joint committee on disability matters be prioritised.  I am pleased to note this will happen soon and that our colleague in this house, Deputy Michael Moynihan, has been appointed Chair.  I know he will be an excellent and dedicated Chair.  I advocated for the establishment of such a committee.  I believe it is our responsibility as public representatives to hear from people with disabilities, their families and their advocates.  Legislation and policy must be sculpted with their input.<\/p><p>I have heard and absolutely understand exactly why this motion is here before us tonight.  I understand and feel the frustration of the families, their advocates and the service users.  It is also, however, important to realise that when I took office last July, all these services were closed.  We have slowly and within guidance worked with the Department and the HSE to ensure the services could open up and keep people protected.<\/p> <p>I have travelled around the country.  I started in St. Joseph's in Charleville where I discussed respite in Cooleens House.  I travelled to Wexford and Kilkenny.  I have been in Galway.  I have been around, and I have been listening.<\/p> <p> Deputy Tully is right.  The same issues of staff, transport and accommodation come up repeatedly.  However, we could not turn on the switch overnight to ensure this happened because we needed to have staff and find the accommodation that meets HIQA requirements.  For it to work it needs to be done on a piecemeal basis, which is happening.  To be fair, the providers have worked with the HSE and the Department.  I spoke to the chief executive of the HSE, Paul Reid, yesterday and I now understand that I will no longer have to rely in respite units to be isolation hubs.  They are being stood down and the HSE will use the &euro;5 million to ensure we have isolation hubs and that we no longer need to draw on valuable respite services to ensure that people are protected.<\/p> <p> When the &euro;20 million saved by scrapping the 1% cut, the &euro;10 million for reopening services and the &euro;7.8 million to tackle the assessment of needs backlog are added up, I have secured a &euro;37.8 million investment in the sector since I took office 98 days ago.  That is far from small money.  Everyone in the House knows the disability sector is the poor cousin in health.  I fought for every euro of that &euro;37.8 million for the families, the services users and the providers, and especially for the children who are awaiting assessments of needs.  This is a clear demonstration of the Government's commitment to the disability sector and a tangible example of my commitment to fighting for people with disabilities during my time in this office.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100600046#WW00200","speaker":"1484","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1602013800,"counter":494,"content":"<p>I will share time with Deputy Sherlock.<\/p><p>I thank the Minister of State for her contribution and I thank the Deputies who tabled this joint motion.  I must comment on the way the Minister of State finished.  I know she is a formidable person.  I like her style and I compliment her on getting the &euro;37.8 million.  However, it says a lot about the Government that she had to fight so hard to get it.  If the Government was going to prioritise people with disabilities in the way in which it should, she should not need to fight as hard as she did.  Fair play to her.  She is unique.  It is obvious that the Government does not place a priority on disability in the first place if it took that level of fight to get it.  I give my best wishes to the new committee that has been established, members of which are here tonight.<\/p><p>As the Minister of State knows, I have spoken about his subject many times since the start of this D&aacute;il.  I have probably spoken more about it than any other topic because I have been fighting for people with intellectual disabilities, about which I am passionate.  We live in a republic and the best way to show that we live in a republic is by looking after those who are most vulnerable during this pandemic.  The simple fact is that those who are being given day services were just let down.  I understand residential services were protected, but day services and respite are gone.  They lost the will because they were forgotten about.<\/p><p>On numerous occasions I have spoken to the Minister of State about Philip Kelly, who is not a relation and who lives here in Dublin.  He is my friend.  He is 29 and has Down's syndrome.  He used to beg me to come in here and talk to &quot;the boss&quot;.  At the start it was the then Taoiseach, the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, and then it became the current Taoiseach, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin.  Then he met the Minister of State on the bridge by the convention centre and now she is the boss to get him back to his day services.  He gets four hours twice a week.  After I leave here, I will ring him and talk to him because he is watching now.<\/p><p>I have spoken to many families who are watching tonight to see if the Minister of State can deliver more in next week's budget.  That is why this motion is so timely.  It is not sustainable for Philip and all the other people who deserve the services.  They are thankful for the &euro;10 million and the total of &euro;37.8 million.  They need capital funding because their buildings are too small.  They need PPE and they need many more buses.  They need them now.  We live in a republic.  They cannot be discriminated against.  They are the most vulnerable.  They were left at the bottom of the pile and it is not bloody well acceptable.  We need to have Covid protections, but we also need to provide services for our most vulnerable and particularly day services.<\/p><p>I do not have much time, but I want to make two more points.  I spent some years on the Committee of Public Accounts and was also my party's spokesperson on health.  The situation with section 38 and section 39 organisations is not sustainable.  The Covid pandemic is a disrupter, but this was not sustainable before the pandemic.  All the main organisations are in serious trouble.  We need a plan that goes beyond the term of the Minister of State and lasts for a decade.  We outsourced all these services for the most vulnerable people in this country to private organisations and now we will need to take them back.  What is going on is not sustainable.  These organisations are beginning to fall over.<\/p><p>I refer to a newspaper article today.  It is not because it was written by a Labour man but because his passion for disabilities is more important to him than being a Labour man.  If colleagues read one article tonight, they should read Fergus Finlay's article on St. John of God's in today's <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>.  It is not because his daughter is there; in fairness to him he has been passionate about this for many years.  We cannot have &euro;155 million given out in services for 2,709 people.  This organisation owns considerable property that we all know about.  There are issues with workers which we all know about.  After years of giving out secret payments with 11 people getting more than &euro;180,000 a year - to give balance because the State cannot always deal with everything - it has decided that it now wants to throw all the services back on the State.  We heard a lot this week about frightening people and this frightens people.  The reason they are in that position in the first place is we outsourced it all.<\/p><p>There are two issues.  First, the Minister of State needs to have a hell of a week.  I congratulate her on the &euro;37.8 million.  However, it says an awful lot about the Government that she needed to do what she did.  She needs to have one hell of a damn week because these people cannot be let down.  We need capital and current funding.  Second, all of us need to make a plan for the State to take back control and ownership of disability services for people who are vulnerable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100600047#XX00200","speaker":"1610"},{"type":"speech","time":1602013800,"counter":495,"content":"<p>I express our sadness at the passing of Dr. Martin O'Donnell of Charleville, father of Deputy Kieran O'Donnell, our colleague in the House.  Dr. O'Donnell was one of the founders of the Charleville and District Mentally Handicapped Children's Association, which was the forerunner of St. Joseph's Foundation as we know it today.  I was particularly heartened to hear the Minister of State tonight mentioning Cooleens House and St. Joseph's Foundation.  I take some solace from her speech that she is very much aware of St. Joseph's Foundation and its work, thanks in no small part to the late Dr. Martin O'Donnell and his team.  A lovely article in the <i>Limerick Leader <\/i>today contained a quote from a local who said that the late Dr. O'Donnell brought children out of the attic in 1968.  We are still here tonight discussing these issues, which may be an indictment on all of us.<\/p> <p>There has never been a greater consciousness around these issues and around ensuring we can advocate for people and continue in the spirit of a man who was truly respected, who had great passion and compassion for the people he served as a GP.  The article speaks of the 50th anniversary celebration of St. Joseph's Foundation where it is said that he remembers Dr. O'Donnell saying the highlight of his career working with those with special needs was when it was recognised they could get their first holy communion.  We have come a long way since then but we have a long way to go.<\/p> <p> I recognise the Minister of State's integrity.  I note that Deputy Michael Moynihan, who will chair that committee, is also present.  We can do good work and we are already seeing an evidence base for an increase in resources.  That is plain for everybody to see.  This is a non-partisan issue.  If we can continue in the vein of people such as Dr. O'Donnell, we will do some good work.  I am particularly heartened that the Minister of State mentioned Cooleens House.  That is evidence she is across that specific issue in north Cork and is cognisant of the impact of the loss of respite care and the effect it is having on, for instance, the 33 people who use it in the context of Cooleens House.  I pay tribute to Dr. O'Donnell and his family, to Mrs. O'Donnell and their five children and offer condolences to our colleague, Deputy Kieran O'Donnell, on his loss.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100600047#XX00300","speaker":"1514","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1602014400,"counter":497,"content":"<p>I also offer my sympathies to Dr. Martin O'Donnell's wife, Veronica, to his daughters and sons and to Deputy Kieran O'Donnell.<\/p>  <p>  In 1968, Dr. Martin O'Donnell was one of the co-founders of the St. Joseph's Foundation in Charleville.  Today I heard many stories of him going from house to house looking for funding to open a place for people to go.  The first place they went was the parochial house in Charleville.  I have been involved with St. Joseph's for many years and I was one of the people who helped them get Liskennett Farm in Granagh.  It has an equestrian centre for people to come to and was built in a forest of 80 acres.  It is absolutely fantastic.  What St. Joseph's Foundation have stood for in our area is huge.<\/p>  <p>  St. Joseph's has a lot of houses throughout the country, in counties Cork, Kerry and Limerick.  What they do is unbelievable but they need supports and funding to go forward.  Everything has now changed for them.  People who could previously go to the likes of Liskennett in Granagh cannot go there now because of the restrictions.  Before the pandemic, some of them could travel there in a bus but now they cannot.  They have small minibuses with six or eight seats and they cannot do this with social distancing.  It is heartbreaking because it is an absolutely fantastic facility, run by fantastic people.  One group we have got to look out for in all this is the volunteers.  Dr. Martin O'Donnell was one of the co-founders of the St. Joseph's Foundation in 1968.  These people volunteering their time and effort.<\/p>  <p>  More than 1,250 carers in Ireland are over the age of 70, with 400 aged over 80.  Capacity in day services has lessened due to social distancing, which impacts centre-based day services.  People with disabilities were identified as high risk by NPHET.  Services responded extremely quickly and kept the numbers extremely low but this meant restricting day services and providing support in residential settings.  The National Federation of Voluntary Service Providers said it is now providing 40% of pre-Covid care.  Most people are getting between two and three days of day services per week.  Due to the fact that capacity in day services has lessened to meet the regulations, it is not possible to accommodate the pre-Covid numbers in centre-based day services.  How many people using disability services are prevented from working because of an underlying condition?  We have seen people working in shops and in the restaurant in St. Joseph's Foundation.  Everyone is working together like a community.  However, because of their underlying conditions they no longer have that service and they cannot go out and meet other people.  What is there for them?  They have not been able to work and there is no alternative in place for them.  This is very difficult for them and their families.<\/p>  <p>  I will conclude by mentioning Dromcollogher and District Respite Centre.  It comes under the same regulation as nursing homes.  It has been in contact with the Minister of State.  It needs to be open, it needs funding and it needs to expand so it can cater for people in need of respite.  It has even converted an office to make extra room for respite care.  Again however, many volunteers are raising funds for this and we need the Minister of State's help.  I wish Deputy Michael Moynihan very well as committee Chairman.  I know he and the Minster of State will do their best to help and that their hearts are in the right place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100600048#YY00300","speaker":"1499"},{"type":"speech","time":1602014400,"counter":498,"content":"<p>I apologise for not being here for the earlier slot.  I was not aware I was speaking in that slot as there was some confusion over the speaking arrangements for tonight.  On foot of all that I ended up with two and a half minutes extra so I will have to try to fill that time as well after preparing for two and a half minutes only.  I will try to make it up to five minutes now anyway.<\/p>  <p>  I am happy to contribute on this motion because it is very important.  It is with a sense of pride that I support it but I do so with sadness as well.  I feel pride because this is a vitally important motion and it is important that my name and signature is on it.  I thank Sinn F&eacute;in for offering the motion to all Opposition Members to sign.  The sadness is due to my having spoken about disability services 23 times in the previous D&aacute;il.  I spoke then with the help of an activist who has since died without seeing the full implementation of the UNCRPD.  Perhaps it was naivety as well.  We will probably end up speaking about disability services 23 times in this D&aacute;il and 23 times in the next D&aacute;il and, unfortunately, we will still be in the same situation.  That is sad.  It is no reflection on the Minister of State.  She will do the best she can with what she has but as a State and as a Government overall, we do not give people with disabilities the respect they deserve.<\/p>  <p>  Sadly that has been seen with the implementation of UNCRPD which was ratified by Ireland 17 or 18 years after it was introduced.  That is an absolute disgrace and we should all be ashamed of ourselves that that is the situation we got into.  The previous Minister gave many perfect and great excuses as to why that happened and why the wait was necessary and all of that kind of stuff.  I do not believe it was necessary.  If we had been serious about it we would have adopted and ratified the convention on the very first day and then worked to implement it.  Instead we said we would ratify it and then dawdled along implementing it and every time it was raised we perhaps got a little more until eventually we got to a situation where it could be implemented.  That is sad and we should not have to do that.  Hopefully, we will get to a situation in this D&aacute;il or in the next where we do things because they are the right thing to do, not because they will cost money or impact on the budget.<\/p> <p>We should do them because as a society they are the right thing to do.  It would make a huge difference if we get to that.<\/p> <p> The motion speaks about the impact Covid is having on services and it is impacting hugely on people with disabilities and disability services.  As the Minister of State and all of us in the House know, it is having a huge impact.  With regard to the wider dispute in recent days with NPHET and everything else, how we deal with Covid will have a huge impact and it will have an ongoing impact on people with disabilities because at the rate we are going, sadly, we will be dealing with Covid and going into and out of lockdowns for the next three or four years.  Will we be sitting here during that time waiting to see whether the Government will get disability services back up and running?  I do not think we can wait that length of time.  It is important that we do not do so and that we get ourselves together and do this now.  They are depending on us to provide the services and we are not doing it.  That is sad.  I hope we will get beyond that and that we provide the services.<\/p> <p> How we treat our weakest members is a sign of us as a society.  People need our support to lead their fullest lives and that is all the motion is talking about.  What we are doing at present is restricting these people from being able to get the most out of life that they can.  We do not have to do this and it does not have to happen.  I hope the Minister of State will deal with it on her watch and that it will not move on to the next Minister of State and we will not have to stand here in the next D&aacute;il speaking about the same thing.  I hope it will not come to that.  This falls on the Minister of State.  We will try to make sure it happens.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100600048#YY00500","speaker":"1547","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1602015000,"counter":500,"content":"<p>I apologise to the Minister of State.  I did not hear her opening comments because I was at a meeting.  I thank Sinn F&eacute;in for tabling the motion and making it an all-party effort.  It is absolutely imperative that we discuss the UNCRPD and its full implementation, particularly given the huge impact on disability services that Covid-19 has had.  As Deputy Pringle just said, we signed up to the UN convention and 11 years later, only after long hard campaigning by disability activists, with protests every couple of months two years ago by various disability, activist and advocate groups, the Government was eventually forced, and it really was forced, to do what it should have done 11 years earlier and ratify the UN convention.<\/p>  <p>  Even when the Government was dragged kicking and screaming to ratify it, it left out the critical part, which was the optional protocol.  I do not know whether this was discussed earlier and whether the Government has given a commitment that it will adopt the optional protocol.  I will not say the UN convention is not worth the paper it is written on without the optional protocol but it is not far off it.  That is the thing that really forces accountability on the Government and gives a mechanism to people with disabilities to hold the Government to account as to whether it will ensure real equality at every level for people with disabilities, who are clearly denied this at a whole range of levels, whether transport, employment or education.  In just about every sphere of life equality is not a tangible reality.<\/p>  <p>  When I think about things that have happened recently in a campaign in which I have been involved with St. Mary's Telford on the Merrion Road, it is shocking that the Government is allowing them to happen.  The Sisters of Charity have just decided to get rid of a convalescence centre nursing home for people with disabilities and effectively turf out women, some of whom suffered at the hands of the Sisters of Charity, who have lived there for 60 years with visual impairment and disability.  They were just told their homes are going.  They have waged a massive campaign and the Sisters of Charity are now speaking about leaving them for a little while but essentially they have been told to get out.  This is funded by the HSE with taxpayers' money but because it is the Sisters of Charity they can do this for reasons unknown.  The Government is just saying it is not its affair.  It is just not on that this should be allowed to happen.<\/p>  <p>  I should mention St. Monica's Nursing Home in Belvedere Place.  I do not know it as well.  The workers there have just been dumped and are not getting paid proper redundancy.  It is shocking.  In recent days, I received a letter about St. John of God.  I do not know whether this issue has been raised.  Disability services should be publicly delivered and not delivered through religious organisations but as it happens St. John of God delivers pretty much all of the intellectual disability services in my area.  It is stating they are all going.  Such is the level of underfunding from the HSE that there will be no services.  They will just have to walk away.  At the bottom of it are the austerity cuts that were imposed back in 2008 and the years afterwards.  It has never really recovered from them or the failure of the Government to provide the funding.  There is the threat to St. Joseph's dementia care in Shankill, which nearly went under other than big campaigning.  That is just not on.  We are not putting the resources into make equality a reality.<\/p>  <p>  I think about my friends Sean O'Kelly and Bernard Mulvany who run the Access for All campaign to ensure that lifts on the DART line are fixed.  A bit of extra money has been given but there is still a long way to go to ensure access to the DART.  We have a lot more to do so let us get a commitment on the optional protocol and let us actually put the resources in to make equality for people with disabilities a reality.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100600049#ZZ00200","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1602015000,"counter":501,"content":"<p>Covid is brutally exposing existing vulnerabilities in individuals but also in our society as a whole.  This is very true in terms of our disability services and the effect the coronavirus is particularly having on people with disabilities.  The pre-existing conditions are there for all to see with regard to the brutal facts of the treatment of people with disabilities in the State.  There are close to 650,000 people with disabilities in Ireland and their poverty rates are 10% higher than the average in the EU, with Ireland among the five worst European countries.  Ireland has the lowest employment rate for people with disabilities in the entire EU, 20% lower than the EU average.  People with disabilities have double the average rate of homelessness, with 27% of the homeless population having a disability.<\/p>  <p>  All of these are the consequences of ideology and of underfunding, underinvestment over decades and a model based on the hollowing out of public services and, in reality, giving responsibility to private organisations.  These are partially funded by the State and then have to fundraise themselves because the funding they get is inadequate as opposed to the State taking responsibility itself.  Coronavirus hit along with all of the restrictions we know about and as a result services almost came to a total stop.  They have been partially restored and now they are approximately 40% of what they were, which is completely inadequate.<\/p>  <p>  There are many issues.  Disability services are in crisis and I echo the point made by Deputy Boyd Barrett on Saint John of God services.  That is not our model but the fact that it is speaking about withdrawing entirely and transferring responsibility back to the HSE because of continuous underfunding speaks to the level of crisis that exists.<\/p> <p>A particular point was drawn to my attention by a constituent, Lorraine, about a meeting that the National Federation of Voluntary Service Providers had with the Minister of State looking for extra necessary funding in light of Covid.  I understand &euro;10 million was granted.  I heard the Minister of State say that this was &euro;10 million on top of this money and that money.  These are the people who know which resources are needed.  From their point of view, it is completely inadequate.  Lorraine told me that this shortfall is concerning and that words fail her in terms of dealing with it.<\/p> <p> I pay tribute to those campaigners who have fought and continue to fight on the issue of disabilities and dragged this State to sign the UNCRPD.  I also pay tribute to groups such as Enough is Enough representing carers who have enough troubles in their lives without having to fight for the very basic services to which they should be entitled.  They are responsible for coining the slogan \"Nothing about us without us\".  That is the model of disability services and assistance we need in the State.  It is based on independent living, along with the right of people to choose the care and assistance most appropriate to them.<\/p> <p> As Deputy Boyd Barrett asked, will the Minister of State ratify the protocol to give people the right to complain about breaches of the UN convention and to take legal action on that basis?  Will she commence the full Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act and the Education (Admissions to Schools) Act fully to ensure equal access to education and health services for people with disabilities?  Will she increase the disability allowance?  Will she provide assistance for carers?  Will she, at a minimum, suspend the reviews of carer's allowance until the impacts of Covid-19 have been fully considered or at least for a year?  Will she raise the basic rate of carer's allowance?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100600049#ZZ00300","speaker":"1628","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1602015600,"counter":503,"content":"<p>I am delighted the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, has been appointed to this area of responsibility.  She is colleague of mine in the Galway East constituency.  She has taken on a role in which, from her own experiences she knows well, there are many challenges.  I also look forward to working with the chair of the disabilities committee, Deputy Moynihan.  I look forward to working with all in a proactive way to ensure we make changes that will improve the lives of people.<\/p>  <p>  The programme for Government states what it will do about disabilities.  There are two particular funding streams involved.  There is the capital funding stream required to provide facilities for our people with disabilities and their families.  We also have to look at the fact that there is a growing demand, whether we like it, from two particular streams.  First, there are more cases of young children coming forward with more diagnoses.  We then have older people who are caring for a special needs person in their family.  These parents are getting older and are in need of care themselves, meaning they are trapped.  We need to have a two-pronged attack to deal with these issues.<\/p>  <p>  We need to make sure facilities are in place.  I congratulate the Minister of State on the amount of funding she is putting into service.  However, I term that as reactive funding.  We need to ensure we have funding to provide for what is needed, as well as for emergencies.  We must be doing that on a multi-annual budget basis.<\/p>  <p>  No Member will disagree with any of this debate tonight.  However, we need to get the funding in place and get over the barriers involved.  Transport was mentioned earlier.  In our constituency, we had five families who needed to find their own way to disability services every day.  That issue has been resolved temporarily until next Christmas.  That is not the way, however, we should be treating children who need day services.  We must ensure we deal with this in a way that is truthful with ourselves, with the families involved and the people who need the help.<\/p>  <p>  We know the effect of Covid on many people.  I know for sure that in my constituency office since Covid arrived, we have had more people contacting us, reaching out and crying for help because they were completely stuck.  We left them stuck.  I regret that we have done that as a society and we have left them to fend for themselves.  We need not ever do that again.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State must ask the Minister for Finance why he has suspended the primary medical certificate scheme.  I know a legal case had been taken.  I questioned the Minister here several weeks ago about this but he did not tell me he had suspended the scheme.  I have people who are in need of the scheme.  We need to expand the scheme to help people.  As the Minister of State knows from living in rural Ireland, not everybody is living beside a service.  To be able to access a service, one needs to have a car adapted but there is a huge cost in that.  There is a scheme in place and we should get on with it.  It is one of the biggest indictments that the Minister has actually suspended this scheme.  If that is the policy, we are going no place fast with all the nice talk we have about disabilities.  That issue needs to be rectified as a matter of urgency.<\/p>  <p>  I thank Sinn F&eacute;in and all the other parties which co-signed this motion tonight.  It is an act of solidarity with people with disabilities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100600050#AAA00200","speaker":"1482"},{"type":"speech","time":1602015600,"counter":504,"content":"<p>A few days ago I watched a heart-breaking RT&Eacute; report in which a couple said that they did not know what would happen to their special needs daughter if they died before her.  They said no parent ever wants to bury their child but the reality is that they dread what would happen, not if but when, they cannot simply manage.  That is an experience for many families across the country.<\/p>  <p>  Another person emailed my office in recent days to inform me that the early intervention services for their three-year old son are non-existent.  They explained their son is non-verbal and is not walking.  They feel the lack of disability services is having a huge impact on his well-being.  The early years of a child are so important, even more so for a child with a disability.<\/p>  <p>  It is not acceptable that highly skilled therapists have been redeployed to Covid-19 testing.  I understand that move in the initial stages may be necessary but six months later it is unacceptable.  This is a big waste of training skills and experience.<\/p>  <p>  Another woman I know with Down's syndrome with whom I have been working used to have full-time day services.  They disappeared for many months.  The services have now returned but it is two days one week and three days the next.  I know another two women in my constituency who have Down's syndrome but are only getting six hours a week.  Another woman who is in residential care has no services provided.  There is no stimulation, development or interaction.  All of these services have either collapsed, disappeared or are working under par.  This is wrong.<\/p>  <p>  Right through the summer, my office was inundated with parents who, because of the Covid restrictions, had a son or daughter who was not getting the services they needed.  They saw significant regression in their children's abilities and engagements with the rest of the world.  For any individual, that is a difficult situation in which to be.  For a parent watching this happen, it is incredibly heart breaking to have to experience it, as well as the physical demands the extra care they have to give takes as well.<\/p> <p>What I could never understand in this process is that we could get our hair cut in this country and be in the physical space of a hairdresser, yet a person with a disability who needed to be in the physical space of a therapist, consultant, doctor, nurse or somebody working with Prosper or any of these fine organisations could not be in such a space.  It did not make sense that such essential services were being denied while other people could get other simple services such as getting their hair cut.<\/p> <p> An issue I have raised over the last six months right through this crisis is that the Government have made decisions to reorientate resources in this country away from the health services towards Covid.  It did that on the blind and, at the outset, in response to a crisis that nobody knew how big, difficult and dangerous it was going to be.  It was a fire that was rolling across Europe in our direction.  It was a natural response back then but during the summer from July, August and September onwards, there is no doubt in my mind that we could have reapplied and reorientated those services back to where they needed to be and that simply did not happen.  It still has not happened and there is a radical cost to that.  What really drives me nuts is that the Government has made no effort to measure that cost in any way.  The British, in fairness to them, have done significant studies with regard to the physical and mental health costs and the costs with regard to disabilities and the health services.  In their view, the non-Covid costs could far exceed the Covid costs by the end of this.  It is only when you have that level of evidence that you can make evidence-based decisions.  Right now, we are not making evidence-based decisions with regard to the orientation of resources.<\/p> <p> I welcome the motion that has been tabled and I appeal to the Minister to support the motion with regard to extra funding in the first instance and to make sure that when we take services away, we know the damage and cost it is doing in order that we can bring those services back in time for the families that need them.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100600050#AAA00300","speaker":"1504","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1602016200,"counter":506,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to address this important issue here this evening.  One judges any state and any government on how they deal with people with mental, physical or any type of intellectual disability.<\/p>  <p>  In the county I represent, we have a very worrying event happening now, as the Minister of State knows, with St. John of God Community Services notifying the HSE that it will be withdrawing the work it has been doing.  I thank St. John of God Community Services for the work it has been doing for many years, taking care of this sector of society and these very important people.  It has been running facilities throughout the country such as, for example, St. Mary of the Angels, which I would call a centre of excellence for dealing with people with every different type of disability.  I compliment every one of the workers who has been there past, present or future.  They have given great service.  They are local people drawn from the community and it has been a vocation for them to take care of what I would call special people.<\/p>  <p>  St. John of God Community Services has said it will withdraw services this time next year.  Between now and Christmas, the HSE should discuss with that group the financial difficulties that have been ongoing there for a long time, as well as a way forward.

If we elected representatives are to be relevant at all, we must ensure we do everything possible for people, whether young or old, with physical and mental disabilities.  In County Kerry at present - it is likewise around the country but we know about our own county - many day care centres that were closed because of the coronavirus are now only 30% open and that is not good enough.  The parents of these children are under savage pressure.  The home carers, whether they are brothers, sisters, fathers or mothers are under pressure.  I have met many of them going back many years and they are great people for seeing after their children but they are under pressure when they get over 70 years of age.  I know some that are moving towards 80 and their worry is what will happen their child when they pass on or who will look after the child.  We are short of respite places for these children and when the parents are getting old, they do not know what will become of their child.<\/p>  <p>  The coronavirus has disrupted so many families.  These special children need physiotherapy, language therapy and speech therapy.

It is very sad.<\/p>  <p>  We are in trouble with primary care certificates.  They are not being processed.  We also have issues with early intervention for children with disabilities and home carers.  Home carers are not being looked after at all and we must recognise them.

I would be very supportive of that and grateful if that could be looked at.<\/p>  <p>  As for day care services, it is of concern to many families of adults with intellectual disabilities that day care services are still not fully open.  I know the Minister of State is doing her best with that and I commend her on the work she is doing.  People have told me that they could not cope if these services were to be shut down again.  It had a negative impact on the well-being of adults with disabilities.  They asked me to raise with the Minister of State the plea that there would not be a full shutdown of this service in the future because people regressed and those adults and their families need every support they can get.<\/p>  <p>  We ratified the UN convention, and that was the most positive development in this country for a while.  I ask that that be matched with actions.  For example, Ireland has the lowest employment rate for people with disabilities in the EU.  It is almost 20% lower than the EU average of 50.8%.  The poverty rates for people with disabilities are 10% higher than the EU average.  Ireland ranks among the worst five countries in Europe.

Family carers, many of them elderly, have been providing supports to people with complex needs at home - including providing personal care to their adult sons and daughters - for over six months due to the reduced capacity in services, and are now at breaking point. <\/blockquote> <p>He was shocked that the Government allocated just &euro;10 million for the remainder of this year, a fraction of the funding required to provide services for people with disabilities.<br\/><br\/>This is at crisis point.  The Government will spend almost &euro;25 million on ministerial advisers over its lifetime but cannot commit to delivering for people with disabilities.  It will give approximately &euro;20 million per year to the European Space Agency but cannot give the same commitment to our disability services.  The new National Children's Hospital will cost &euro;2 billion, at least &euro;1 billion over budget.  The overrun due to complete mismanagement will likely run into hundreds of millions of euro, yet, at the same time, the Government fails to support those with disabilities.  The rural broadband scheme was originally estimated at &euro;500 million but will cost &euro;3 billion over 25 years because of completely dysfunctional management.  The overrun will eat into the budget for disability services.  Those examples make it clear where the Government's priorities rest.  Those priorities are certainly not on the side of Ireland's 643,131 people with disabilities.<br\/><br\/>I will mention services in west Cork, which are absolutely shocking.  I twice approached the Minister of State prior to the summer recess and told her I would like to speak about the services and see where changes could be made.  She did not get back to me.  I understand she is busy, but she must not take her eye off the ball when it comes to west Cork.  The services there are shocking.  Parents throughout the constituency, from Kinsale to Mizen Head and up to Castletownbere, are pleading with me.  Their children are losing services or have lost services and Covid-19 is being blamed for everything.  It cannot be blamed for everything and certain services could have survived.  Hubs were being opened in Drimoleague and efforts were being made to open another hub in Schull and places like that.  Those involved in opening those hubs needed the assistance of the Minister of State.

There is also a need to provide additional funding that is required to guarantee sustainable capacity within disability and dementia services.  I thank Sinn F&eacute;in for facilitating this motion.<\/p>  <p>  I listened to the Minister of State and know she is genuine in the efforts she makes.  She reminded us that when she took office, all services were closed.  I recognise that everything cannot be done at once.  However, we all know these are unprecedented times and unprecedented actions need to be taken.  Resources need to be put in place to support the most vulnerable in our society.  We all know that Covid-19 has been especially harsh on people with disabilities and their carers.  The Minister of State and the Government, therefore, have a responsibility to deliver in the upcoming budget.  I know that there are competing demands and that both Ministers of State, Deputies Rabbitte and Butler, will fight for this sector but the response of the Government will tell us a great deal about how we value people with disabilities and their carers.<\/p>  <p>  Some &euro;10 million has been allocated to date.  The Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, spoke of the &euro;20 million that was saved because the 1% levy was scrapped.  What in God's name does it say about our State that we were looking for 1% efficiency from a voluntary sector that, before the arrival of Covid-19, was stretched beyond its means?  The sector relies partly on fundraising and wholly on volunteers and voluntary boards.  Its staff, as section 39 workers, are still in 2009 and 2010 pay scales and most of them do not receive increments.  I know that the Minister of State is not personally responsible for this, but to look for a 1% cut in the first place was scandalous.<\/p>  <p>  I know that the &euro;10 million was fought for hard but the National Federation of Voluntary Service Providers was shocked at that amount.  Inclusion Ireland recognised that it was a fraction of what is needed.  As the Ministers of State will be aware, Family Carers Ireland today launched The State of Caring 2020 report dealing with pre-Covid times, and another report, Caring Through Covid: Life in Lockdown, was published previously.  The two reports should be required reading for every person in this House.  More than that, they should inform decisions taken in the upcoming budget.<\/p>  <p>  The reports make harrowing reading in places.  One carer described Covid as \"a lockdown within a lockdown\".  Pre-Covid, 23% of carers had already seen a decrease in the level of services offered to their loved one in the past year and now 43% fear that normal services will not be restored after the pandemic.  This does not surprise me because I remember reading the initial HSE guidelines on restoration of services, which referred to a reduced quantum of services.  That kind of verbiage strikes fear into the hearts of family carers who have fought long and hard to get these day services up and running in the first place.<\/p>  <p>  My time is limited but before I finish, I want to remember two tireless disability advocates who have died in the past few years and who taught me so much during my 15 years in the European Parliament.  They are Donal Toolan, with his easy smile and razor-sharp intellect, and Martin Naughton, who took no prisoners.  Those two tireless advocates helped me to recognise that life for people with disabilities is not a dress rehearsal; it is their one and only life.  We, in this House, have a duty to support them and their carers to live that life.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100600052#CCC00700","speaker":"1605"},{"type":"speech","time":1602016800,"counter":515,"content":"<p>I thank Sinn F&eacute;in for tabling the motion and involving all of us.  I have no doubt that the Minister of State's heart is in the right place and I do not doubt her bona fides because I have attended meetings with her.  I look at this motion, which is short and signed by 68 Deputies, if my maths are correct, and it asks for very little.  It simply asks the Government to provide the funding required to fully reopen day and other disability centres, subject of course to complying with Covid-19 guidelines and requirements.  The Minister of State could not possibly disagree with that.  It also seeks to provide the additional funding, resources and capital investment required to guarantee sustainable capacity for people with disabilities and dementia.  How could she disagree with that?  She does not.  I see her nodding.  I am not sure what happens to Deputies when they sit on the ministerial side of the House.  I am not being smart when I say that.  I know the Minister of State's bona fides.  Here we have a three and a half page reply, putting an amendment to a motion that is simply saying we should reopen services and provide adequate funding.  I begin to doubt the bona fides of the Government when I see that type of reply.  I wonder why is it necessary.  I would appeal to women to do it differently, to be honest.  I appeal to the Minister of State to stop being captured by Department speak.<\/p>  <p>  This is so simple.  It is not simple to implement, but the motion itself is simple.  Let us join together as women, while absolutely including the men, and provide services that the Minister of State knows are not there on the ground.

There is a little bit of self-congratulation in it about the funding.  I congratulate her on the funding but would congratulate her more if she put it in context.<\/p> <p>The Oireachtas disability group pre-budget submission puts it in context.  It is two pages and very simple to read.  It tells us that 13% of those in receipt of carer's allowance are aged over 70.  Can one imagine that?  They are doing the hardest work with the least amount of pay.  Some 643,000 people in Ireland are involved and the figure will increase by 2026.  I will not read out all of the figures, but they are there.  The submission outlines the specific things that are required.<br\/><br\/>The speech from the Minister of State makes me wonder what is going on and who has done an analysis of how many centres have been closed.  I have asked these practical questions, as have other Deputies.  She has not told us how many centres there are in Galway, how many have and have not reopened, why they have not reopened and what is necessary instead of me giving anecdotal evidence. <br\/><br\/>I refer to people who are caring for loved ones at home.  I think of somebody near where I live in Galway.  The person has no respite.  The Minister of State was probably sending emails about respite before she took office.  What is she going to do about that?  She will have our full support.  Let us have an analysis of the problem in the first place.  What is the scope of the problem and what do we need to do to deal with that as women who see things differently?  I hear my colleague laughing, but there are very good men in the world.  I would be delighted if they worked with us and I wish Deputy Moynihan the best as the new Chairman of the committee. <br\/><br\/>Deputy Alan Kelly referred to what Fergus Finlay wrote about the outsourcing of services.  I ask the Minister of State to read it.  I would like if she had referred to it in her opening statement because it raises serious questions.  Services are in crisis and are being handed back with problems.  The amount being paid in salaries in excess of &euro;100,000 and the problems that have been identified mean that services that are not making money are being handed back to the State.  Property and services that are making money are not being handed back.  The HSE internal review was not referred to by the Minister of State.  We are again reliant on newspapers like the <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>and <i>The Irish Times<\/i>to tell us these things. <br\/><br\/>The HSE is carrying out an internal review and told us that the current model for the provision of services for people with disabilities is not sustainable.  I will finish up.  I will not go over time because I am always giving out when I am in the Chair.  Will that report be published?  Can the Minister of State please give us the date of the publication of the capacity review she referred to?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100600052#CCC00800","speaker":"1577","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1602017400,"counter":517,"content":"<p>I am delighted to contribute to the debate.  I would like to acknowledge, and offer my sympathies to, the family of Dr. Martin O'Donnell in Charleville, whose son, Kieran, is a Member, and his wife Veronica.  Dr. O'Donnell set up what is now St. Joseph's Foundation in Charleville, which the Minister of State visited in July.  It is his legacy.  He gave his time to setting up the section 39 organisation that is St. Joseph's Foundation.  We should pay tribute to him and many others around the country who gave valiant service to the community and voluntary sector to provide services for those with disabilities.  Services 50 years ago were primitive and it was difficult to get funding and break into a world that was kept behind the curtains.  We salute him.<\/p><p>By saluting him, we have to accept that a deadly crisis is facing the disability sector and people with disabilities of every kind.  I am honoured that D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann has appointed me to chair the committee on disability matters.  A raft of issues need to be dealt with.  All I can tell the House is that I will give it my all, whether that relates to dementia or disabilities.  In each and every aspect, I will give it my all and try to bring as much light as possible into the challenges that are facing the disabilities sector. <\/p><p>Many articles in the <i>The Irish Times<\/i>and the <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>refer to funding.  The State has offloaded the need for services to section 39 organisations and has completely under-resourced them over the decades in terms of providing people with disabilities with proper services.  Young children are waiting for assessments.  People are waiting for occupational therapy or speech and language therapy, which are currently non-existent in the public sector.  Parents are waiting years for proper services. <\/p><p>Adult service users attend many fine facilities for which people have fundraised voluntarily around the country, such as the Cope Foundation and St. Joseph's Foundation.  Such organisations have been underfunded.  We have to accept that what the State is providing at the moment, through all of its funding models, including the HSE and everything else, is not delivering properly.  We have to get to the bottom of this and be brutally honest with ourselves and say that there is a monumental challenge. <\/p><p>If we are to be a proper Irish Republic we have to make sure that people with disabilities are looked after from the cradle to the grave, as Dr. Martin O'Donnell often said when he spoke about St. Joseph's in Charleville.  We have to ensure that we have the best possible services available.  There has been little political argy-bargy in this debate.  Everybody who has spoken is genuine about moving this issue forward.  <\/p><p>All of us know in our professional work that parents are looking for guidance.  One person dropped in a letter to me yesterday.  It was being circulated to public representatives to make sure that the voice of the disability sector was raised at the Cabinet table and highlighted prior to the budget.  There was no name on the letter, but at the top it stated, &quot;Please help&quot;.  <\/p><p>I congratulate the Minister of State on what she has done to date.  I saw at first hand her compassion and determination when she visited Charleville in July.  I ask her to make sure over the next couple of days that, to put it as bluntly as I can, the cage is rattled as hard as possible to get the most money for services so that they can be restored and families can get what we in this Republic should be giving them.  I will do whatever I can as Chair of the new committee.  I am deeply honoured to have been appointed and I will take it on to the best of my ability.  I will do whatever I can.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100600053#DDD00200","speaker":"1456"},{"type":"speech","time":1602017400,"counter":518,"content":"<p>I thank Deputies for raising these important matters and giving me the opportunity to speak on them.  I would also like to congratulate my colleague, Deputy Moynihan, on his appointment as Chairman of the new committee that has been formed.  It is very important that we put a significant emphasis on the disability sector.<\/p>  <p>  There is no doubt that this has been an extremely difficult time for people and their families.  We all share a common desire to have the best possible policies and services for all children, adolescents and adults with disabilities.  Personally and as Minister of State, I want everyone with additional needs to have access to the necessary supports in every aspect of their lives to enable them to achieve their full potential, maximise their independence and lead fulfilling lives.<\/p>  <p>  There has been an awful lot of talk today about carers.  I hosted an online round table with carers three weeks ago.  It was supposed to be a much bigger event, but we had to reduce it.  I heard from carers, including dual carers who are looking after children with intellectual disabilities, and a parent.  I heard from carers about Covid and mental health issues.  <\/p>  <p>  In my remit as Minister of State with responsibility for mental health and older people, I met the Minister, Deputy Heather Humphreys, today to discuss carers in terms of the budget.  It does not technically come under my remit.  The care of carers does, but the finances involved do not.  It is very important to put that on the record.<\/p>  <p>  Disability services are provided in many types of settings across many organisations throughout the country, and in the age of Covid-19 these organisations have to adapt and do their best to ensure that services can continue to be provided.  I would like to acknowledge the commitment of these services over the past seven months to supporting and protecting those with a disability who attend health and social care services.<\/p> <p>The Government is committed to strengthening the State's relationship with the voluntary sector and to the full implementation of its five-year strategy to support the community and voluntary sector in Ireland.  The strategy sets out a long-term vision for communities in Ireland and the general direction of travel for Government policy with the community and voluntary sector for the coming years.<\/p> <p> On Deputy Connolly&rsquo;s question, the Minister of State, Deputy Rabitte, has asked me to say that she also wishes to see the disability capacity review published as soon as possible.  We need reform and funding throughout the disability sector.  She asked me to acknowledge the Deputy&rsquo;s contribution.  <\/p> <p> My colleague also spoke earlier about the resumption of day care services, in particular, and I will outline the work under way to support the resumption of other services for people with disabilities.  As has been said, respite is a crucial support mechanism for many families.  Short stay residential emergency-residential respite began to reopen between July and August as the first stage in a three-phase plan.  Activity is now increasing for the next two phases: September to November phase and December to February 2021.  <\/p> <p> On children&rsquo;s services, all CHOs are putting appropriate arrangements in place to resume assessment of need and intervention therapy services in line with public health guidance. Additional funding of &euro;7.8 million has been provided to the HSE specifically to reduce the current backlog in assessment of need.  This funding will help reduce waiting times both for the assessment and for any therapeutic services required.  The &euro;10 million announced by my colleagues, the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, and the Minister of State, Deputy Rabitte, last week to support the resumption of disability services included &euro;2.5 million to provide 210 intensive support packages for children and young people with significant support needs.  These packages will help these children and young people with complex high support needs to remain living with their families and this investment will go some way to alleviate some of the pressures and stress on people with disabilities and their families.<\/p> <p> I appreciate that the reduced capacity in day services caused by Covid-19 is a considerable challenge and is far from the level of service that we would like to provide.  However, services must continue to operate under public health guidance and the safety of all service users is paramount.  The resumption of day services has been welcomed by service users and their families and this package of &euro;10 million provided to enhance disability services is but a first step on the road to increasing capacity and expanding levels of service for service users.  <\/p> <p> Turning to the UNCRPD, we cannot allow the current situation to divert us from continuing our work in improving the lives of people with disabilities and significant cross-departmental work is under way in this regard.  We are committed to a continued whole-of-government approach to improving access and quality of services for people.  The recent programme for Government also commits to the development of an implementation plan to co-ordinate the implementation of the UN convention.  Work will commence on the development of this implementation plan shortly.<\/p> <p> The situation we now face is one that requires our fullest attention.  I assure all that the Government will remain focused on providing the best services we can, while keeping the health and well-being of people with disabilities as our utmost priority.  Once again I thank all for their time and valuable contributions regarding these most important matters.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100600053#DDD00300","speaker":"1614","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1602018000,"counter":520,"content":"<p>Stewarts Care in Palmerstown is in my constituency.  I have an aunt who is a long-term resident there.  Over the years I got to know many of the service users.  In my previous role as the Mayor of South Dublin, I invited the communities service users council to the mayor&rsquo;s reception, which was a fantastic day.  It is no surprise to me that several day service users have contacted me with concerns that the services have either stopped or have been really diminished.  This does not only apply to Stewarts Care but people with intellectual disabilities also experience mental health challenges as they struggle without the service they once relied upon pre-Covid-19.  The structure and supports that they relied upon for their individual personal development have disappeared overnight.  Not only were these structures taken away from the service users, they were also taken away from their carers.  There was no respite for their carers.  Family carers who are often elderly have been providing support to people with complex needs at home, including providing personal care to their adult sons and daughters for over six months due to reduced capacities in services.  They are now at breaking point.  These carers need a break.<\/p>  <p>  The second point I want to make is on St. John of God community services, which has announced the transfer of its services to the HSE.  Currently, they provide services to 8,000 people.  It also employs 3,000 staff and has a number of volunteers on more than 300 sites across the State.  I raised this issue with the Minister for Transport, Deputy Ryan, on Questions on Promised Legislation and asked that the Government formulate a plan so that the people who use St. John of God's do not experience a diminution in services.  I also seek clarification that those employed by St. John of God will retain the same terms and conditions in their contracts.  The Minister, Deputy Ryan, agreed to send me the Government&rsquo;s response and I am still waiting for that.  I subsequently wrote to the Minister, and submitted questions to the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, but I still have no response.  The Government silence on this issue seems to be deafening.  The 8,000 service users, the 3,000 employees and the volunteers of St. John of God need answers and clarifications.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100600054#EEE00300","speaker":"1469"},{"type":"speech","time":1602018000,"counter":521,"content":"<p>The Minister of State announced &euro;10 million for disability services.

Since the election I have been contacted by several people who are experiencing serious issues in access to housing, healthcare and disability services.  It has been truly appalling.<\/p>  <p>  Just last week, I again raised the issue of transportation for service users with the Minister for Transport.  These issues cannot be allowed to continue and Covid-19 must not be used as an excuse for services to be reduced and curtailed beyond recognition.  We have many exceptional groups throughout our State that work closely with people with disabilities to further their call for equal rights.  One particular group in my home county of Clare is the Clare Leader Forum.  I commend it on the great work it has been doing for many years now, battling away without adequate funding for the sector.  I also commend the work of family carers, which they continue to put in, day in day out, particularly during Covid-19 without the respite services being available to them.  These people are the backbone of our care system.<\/p>  <p>  The UNCRPD is an important, key convention that Ireland ratified in 2018 after 11 long, frustrating years.  It is very welcome that we finally now have a committee to oversee the implementation of the convention of which I am a member.

The Ministers of State, Deputies Rabbitte and Butler, and Deputy Moynihan are just as aware as any of the rest of us are of the circumstances that people with disabilities or dementia and their families are in.  They have been informed of the difficulties that they face daily.  We all know that tea and sympathy is just not what they need; they need action.  It is time to do the right thing.  I welcome the fact that a commitment has been given to keep day services open despite what Covid-19 level we are on.  That is of great importance.  I am aware that safety is also paramount.  The reason so many of the services are in difficulty is because they are adhering strictly to the guidelines to keep all of the service users and their staff safe.  People with disabilities feel, and not for the first time, that they are the forgotten people in this State.<\/p> <p>It is not for the first time that they are the forgotten people in this State.  The &euro;10 million allocated last week was met with dismay, disappointment and disbelief by some people within the sector.  Others would have said that they have got used to it and do not expect anything different; they expect to be forgotten.  Funding was made available to open the schools, and rightly so, but it has been suggested that a similar amount of funding, &euro;120 million, is needed to cover the cost of Covid-19 and open services fully.  If we were to rate our country, and this was raised a few times by other speakers, on the way it treats its most vulnerable citizens I believe we would be fairly low down on that scale, and that is all of us together.<\/p> <p> I am sure the Minister of State is familiar with the facts on disability in the country, many of which have been alluded to in the debate, but we have more than 640,000 people with disabilities.  That number is expected to rise by 20% in the next five years so we need to ensure that the services provided for people with disabilities are in place to meet their needs.<\/p> <p> We also have the lowest employment rate for people with disabilities and it is 20% lower than the European average.  I meet parents who tell me that their son or daughter who is on the autism spectrum has qualified in college but when they apply for a job, which they are highly qualified for on paper, people do not want to employ them.  We need to do more to secure employment for people with disabilities and ensure that the quotas within the public service are met.  There are incentives for employers to hire people with disabilities, of which they may not be aware.  We need to make them more aware of those incentives.<\/p> <p> It is time to fund properly the services and supports for people with disabilities.  Initially, it would be to fund the shortfall in the Covid funding for services but there needs to be a change in focus in the way supports for people with disabilities are provided.  The optional protocol was mentioned several times in the debate.  That needs to be adopted and implemented.<\/p> <p> Many reports have been commissioned on the way rights for people with disabilities could be guaranteed but they are gathering dust.  We know the right way forward but it has not been implemented.  It has to be acted upon.<\/p> <p> The Minister of State mentioned that the results of the capacity review will be published soon.  Is that imminent?  It is very important that we know the shortfalls in terms of what is needed.<\/p> <p> The Minister of State has tabled an amendment to the motion.

I will give a couple of examples.  First, I welcome the DART+ Maynooth&ndash;Dunboyne line.  There is no doubt that the rail transport system for the whole community along that line will be transformed.  I did not receive a single email, telephone call or submission in opposition to the project.  There is considerable support for it.  The benefits of the DART line will certainly be significant but, as with all major infrastructural projects, there will be a major impact on communities.  Some impacts will be significant and others less so.  With regard to a number of estates along the new DART line, the impact on the associated communities, families and homes will be significant.  The most impactful measures will be the closure of the Coolmine level crossing and Irish Rail's preferred option, that is, building a bridge between St. Mochta's estate and Riverwood.<\/p>  <p>  Let me give to examples.  During my recent review of the documentation, I noticed that the option of going under the Coolmine crossing was ruled out because of the height of the canal.  However, when I asked those concerned to consider a lock system, I was really surprised to hear it was not proposed to the consultants and that if I put in a submission, it would be considered.  I am not an engineer but I believe the whole community is a wee bit puzzled because the consultants did not consider a drop-lock or similar system used on canals across the world.  This really needs to be considered.<\/p>  <p>  Another major issue was the consultation process itself.  I acknowledge that Irish Rail has, following strong representations from many in the community, extended its deadline for the consultation process twice.  The latest extension is until 21 October.  However, we are to be subject to level 3 Covid restrictions for a number of weeks and it looks very likely that these will continue for some time beyond 21 October.  This means that only those who are tech savvy can take part in the process.  It also means that it will not be possible to engage in the essential type of consultation processes that would normally take place between Irish Rail, Deputies, councillors and communities, with organised public meetings at which large maps, hard copies of relevant documentation and detailed plans would be made available.  We cannot overstate the importance of being able to look at hard copies of a map and plans and call a person over to ask him or her what something is, where such a line goes or where a certain road leads to, for example.  It is important that we get this wonderful project developed and on-stream as quickly as possible, but not at any cost.  Once the preferred options are chosen, there will be no way back for the people, except through the High Court.<\/p>  <p>  On behalf of the hundreds of people, especially those who are not tech savvy - including some older people and others who are unable to use Zoom or have meetings on Teams and who will be very much affected - I ask the Minister to ask Irish Rail to hold off until we can have physical meetings and are able to look across a table at those proposing the project so the community can ask the officials the hard questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100600056#HHH00300","speaker":"1476"},{"type":"speech","time":1602018900,"counter":534,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for the opportunity to address this issue.  The short answer to the question is \"Yes\" in that every option regarding level crossings on the new DART+ line to Maynooth should be given due consideration.<\/p>  <p>  I will start by taking the opportunity to update the House generally on the progress of the DART+ programme.  The programme for Government commits to a fundamental change to the nature of transport in the State.  If we are serious about delivering the type of change we need, we will need big, transformative projects such as DART+.  That is not to minimise people's concerns about possible impacts or to dismiss their views about particular aspects but it is to make a clear statement of policy support for DART+ and such projects.  I have heard the Deputy support DART+, which I very much welcome.  I hope and believe that support is given by every Member of this House.  People want to see this project built.<\/p>  <p>  For those who are unaware, DART+ will effectively double the capacity of the existing network.  It will see the introduction of DART-level services on the Maynooth-Dunboyne, northern and Kildare lines, providing a sustainable, reliable and frequent service across much of the greater Dublin area.  If we want to see more people make the switch to more sustainable modes of transport, we must see big projects such as DART+ succeed.<\/p>  <p>  I was delighted to be able to launch the public consultation on DART+ over the summer and I look forward to seeing progress made on the project during the lifetime of this Government.  I recognise that major projects such as this can have impacts that not everybody will welcome and I absolutely recognise that the issue of level crossings, as in this instance, has to be considered carefully owing to the potential impact.<\/p>  <p>  Among the documents published as part of the public consultation process is a preliminary option selection report.  It sets out in detail the approach taken when considering level crossings.  At the very basic level, the general approach is to consider a long list of possible options and then, using multi-criteria analysis, sift through them to create a shortlist of the preferred options for detailed consideration.  Therefore, for each level crossing, the report details a range of options to be considered.  For some level crossings, up to nine or ten options can be set out, and the pros and cons of each is described.<\/p>  <p>  I understand that, during the public consultation process, some residents suggested there were options ruled out that should have been brought forward for detailed consideration.  While I will leave the detailed options analysis to the experts, I believe it is clear that level crossings are a constraint in introducing the type of high-frequency train services we are seeking to introduce with DART+.<\/p> <p>The reality is that if we were to keep the level crossings, service frequency would be severely restricted, causing traffic difficulties in the area.  I would like to think that we can all agree that the issues need to be tackled somehow, even if there may be disagreement on some of the detail of the how.<\/p> <p> This initial consultation process is scheduled to close later this month, having been extended, as mentioned by the Deputy.  Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann will then consider submissions received and decide upon the preferred route.  During the statutory planning process, members of the public will again have an opportunity to make their voices heard.  Next year, I expect Government approval of the preliminary business case for what will be the largest ever investment in our railway network and I look forward to the support of the House as we look to improve this important public service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100600056#HHH00400","speaker":"1465","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1602019500,"counter":536,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.  I am a little disappointed in that there is no commitment to ask Irish Rail to hold off until that meeting can be held.  I accept that we are not living in normal circumstances, but this is important.  This is a major project and we cannot get it wrong.<\/p>  <p>  I would like to mention a couple of things.  The Fingal County Development Plan 2017-2023 includes two local objectives.  I worked on that plan, and that work commenced in 2014-2015.  The objectives are to preserve the existing pedestrian or vehicle right of way at Coolmine level crossing and to prohibit any road bridge across the train line at the canal and Riverwood station court.  There are a number of questions being asked by myself and by local people.  For example, how do we encourage people to make submissions to county development plans in good faith and tell them that their voices matter and will be heard?  How do we encourage councillors - this applies also to strategic housing developments and other legislation that is being brought in that overrides the county development plans - and convince people to spend hours, often days, on county development plans when they can be overridden?<\/p>  <p>  There is another issue I would like to raise.  We need to create a level playing field for local communities versus large organisations, be they State or corporate in nature.  The webinar was held by Irish Rail engineers and experts.  They have the funding, a budget of &euro;2.6 billion, to hire the best minds in the country.  What do the people have?  They have nothing but their own resources.  They have no expertise and they cannot call on expertise unless they can pay for it.  In terms of the strategic housing development at the Brady's Castleknock Inn site, people spent thousands of euro to get professional help.  Will the Minister give consideration to the provision of funding for communities like Riverwood, St. Mochta's and others along the DART railway line, and in respect of strategic housing developments, to enable them to get the professional help that the other side always has?  The latter have deeper pockets than the people.

It is important to allow close contact and detailed debate.  Unfortunately, that is not possible in the current environment.  To be honest, I would be very wary about a lengthy delay with this project.  It is vital that this service is developed.  We do not know for how long the Covid restrictions will apply.  If we were to put off the planning or consultation processes until the end of the restrictions, that could have an impact on a range of different projects.  I am nervous about that, although I understand the intention and from where it is coming.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy is correct that there may be some people who do not have as easy access to webinars and so on.  I wonder what do they have.  In the context of this particular project and in the area of Coolmine where the problem arises, it seems to be on one of the level crossings, where the proposal for a road bridge over the crossing has serious potential consequences for local residents.  The Deputy is raising this matter tonight.  His three constituency colleagues have not been shy in coming to me, each in turn, saying that they have views on the matter.  As public representatives, it is at this time we can fulfil that role in a particular way when it is possible for us to have access to the webinars and to the information.  If there are proposals, be that a new lough as suggested by the Deputy or other options - as I said in my initial response I do not think we should be ruling out options at this stage, we should be looking at all options - perhaps the public representatives, councillors and Deputies, in this particular instance have a chance to represent their constituents, as the Deputy is doing and as his three colleagues have done already, directly with me, and make that case to Irish Rail as part of the consultation process.  I think that would be the most appropriate further help the Deputy could give.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100600057#JJJ00300","speaker":"1465"},{"type":"speech","time":1602019500,"counter":538,"content":"<p>Can we have a conversation about putting in place funding for professional help for local communities?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100600057#JJJ00400","speaker":"1476"},{"type":"speech","time":1602019500,"counter":539,"content":"<p>I think that is a very good idea.

This put an end to a rail link that joined towns across south Wexford to Waterford city, as well as supplying heavy rail infrastructure to two major ports, Belview and Rosslare Europort.  Since the closure of the line, advocates for its reopening have kept a close eye on the fate of the Barrow Bridge, which is a 650 m span that links County Kilkenny and County Wexford over the River Barrow.  A central part of that bridge can open to allow shipping traffic to access New Ross.  Keeping the mechanism of that bridge functioning and in good order has always been seen as essential if this line is ever to be brought back into active use.<\/p>  <p>  I was dismayed recently to receive a copy of a letter sent by the National Transport Authority, NTA, to the South-East On Track group.  The letter states that the Barrow Bridge is to be maintained in the open position allowing marine traffic to traverse unencumbered, reflecting the fact that as there is no railway service on the line, it is entirely appropriate that right-of-way be given to the marine traffic.  On further questioning from the South East On Track group, the NTA confirmed that the agreed arrangements in respect of the closed Waterford to Rosslare line do not include weed spraying or vegetation treatment programmes.  This was previously done on an annual basis and so it cannot have been a huge draw on CIE's resources.  This sounds to me very much like a plan to abandon the line.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, there have been strong indications from the chief executive officer of Wexford County Council that his preferred use of the rail line is for it to be converted to a greenway.  Waterford greenway is the best-in-class exemplar for how a greenway should be designed and delivered.  It has been a huge boost for the local economy in Waterford city, Dungarvan and Kilmacthomas.  However, I am not of the view that greenways should supplant strategic heavy rail infrastructure, particularly that of this level of importance.  I have noted with interest the Minister's recent emphasis on the future importance of rail freight.  This is particularly pertinent in the case of the Rosslare line.  Taken in its entirety, potentially from Foynes to Rosslare Europort, this line links two tier 2 ports, Rosslare and Belview, and a tier 1 port in Foynes with the major population centres of Waterford, Limerick and Clonmel.  This strategic link will only become more important in the context of Brexit, with increased shipping traffic likely to emanate directly from Europe, rather than taking the land bridge route across the UK.  Belview and Foynes should be considered in the longer term as sites suitable for the development of offshore wind technology.  Both are deep water ports with access to development land and heavy rail infrastructure.<\/p>  <p>  It is also worth noting - I stand open to correction on this - that Rosslare is the only point at which,other than through the Phoenix Park tunnel, the Heuston and Connolly lines converge.  In terms of the potential for the line to operate as a commuter service, I have previously been vocal on the need for common-sense timetable changes that will cater to population centres in south Tipperary, allowing residents of Carrick, Clonmel, Tipperary and Cahir to commute either to Waterford or to Limerick for work or study.  The same logic applies to south Wexford, with towns like Bridgetown and Wellingtonbridge standing to benefit significantly if their local train line terminated at a newly built integrated transport hub in Waterford city.<\/p>  <p>  I note as well the commitment in the programme for Government to examine the development of national tourism trails linking our ferry ports and rail network.  A reopened Rosslare-to-Waterford line would allow for the development of a sail, rail and trail offering, which would allow European tourists, to see our greenway the green way, if I may coin a phrase.<\/p> <p>I ask the Minister to review immediately the NTA's new maintenance agreement with Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and revert it to pre-September 2020 status so the line remains a viable piece of infrastructure, pending further review.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100600057#JJJ00700","speaker":"1617","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1602020100,"counter":543,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for the opportunity to address this issue.  As most Members are aware, rail services on this line ceased in 2010 under an agreement made between the National Transport Authority and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann.  A number of improvements were made to bus services at the time to ensure continued public transport connectivity.  Undoubtedly, some people are fearful that the decision to maintain the Barrow Bridge in the open position means a point of no return as to whether services might ever return again on this closed line.  Equally, I do not wish to give false hope regarding the imminent return of services.<\/p>  <p>  The decision to maintain the bridge in an open position is a pragmatic one, based on the fact that the line has now been closed for ten years.  While the line has been closed, the port of New Ross remains open and the position of the bridge reflects the need to ensure easy navigational access to the port.  I am informed that up until recently there was a requirement for four full-time Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann staff to be on site to open the bridge to allow ships sail to and from the port, which probably strikes most people as a little odd, to say the least.<\/p>  <p>  Ten years after the decision to close the line, a number of revised arrangements have been agreed between the National Transport Authority and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann relating to the line.  These arrangements include obligations to review level crossing surfaces each year, reviewing the boundary protection along the line each year and conducting bridge inspections every two years in line with Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann's technical standards.  In addition, the agreement between the NTA and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann requires a general review of the line to be undertaken annually.  The purpose of the review is to assess the overall condition of the line so as to be able to provide a current status assessment of the infrastructure each year.  The revised arrangements also provide that the Barrow Bridge be maintained in an open position.  This means that the previous requirement for four full-time staff manning the bridge, with no services, is removed.  Furthermore, the design of the mechanism is such that it can easily be reversed if rail services resume at some point in the future.<\/p>  <p>  At a practical and pragmatic level, I hope the Deputy can understand the reason behind the decision to maintain the bridge in an open position.  At a broader level, I do not doubt the Deputy's wish to see rail services running again on this line.  I hope he can see that this decision does not fundamentally run counter to that at some point in the future, if that were to be decided.  There are those who wish to develop the route as a greenway and build upon the work already undertaken or under way in the south east to create a cluster of attractive greenways spanning the region.<\/p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the position regarding the Barrow Bridge.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100600058#KKK00200","speaker":"1465"},{"type":"speech","time":1602020100,"counter":544,"content":"<p>I am afraid it feels like a point of no return.  It is something that has been closely monitored by people with an interest in this route over the years.  It feels a little like a managed decline.  I am also worried that we will end up tearing out an excellent and strategic piece of infrastructure with a view to developing a greenway on it.  We have a EuroVelo route which has been developed by Wexford County Council and runs from Rosslare Europort to the Ballyhack ferry, which transports people over onto Passage East and into Waterford.  It would be a much better use of resources to develop that EuroVelo route to a higher standard and to develop a corridor from Passage East into Waterford city, which would also be an important commuting corridor along the Dunmore road.  Significant funding, some &euro;58,000 if I am correct, has been allocated for the design phase of this greenway.  I am open to the concept of side by side but the Barrow Bridge would make side-by-side development of a greenway route very difficult.<\/p>  <p>  When we think about rail infrastructure in general, and the Minister is conscious of this as well, we should be mindful that while there is a significant cost to upgrading and maintaining this route, it is certainly a fraction of what it would cost to build this infrastructure from scratch.  We should not be aiming towards a managed decline of infrastructure.  Heavy rail bridges such as this can discharge freight capacity as well as commuter capacity.  It can be moved to low emissions or zero emissions relatively easily compared with haulage traffic.  I am anxious that we have a review of this route in the short to medium term to consider how we can make it practically viable for people, not just commuters but also freight and tourist traffic that will be emanating from Rosslare Europort.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100600058#KKK00300","speaker":"1617"},{"type":"speech","time":1602020100,"counter":545,"content":"<p>I had a meeting with Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann last week and raised the specific issue of the future of Rosslare Port because it is owned by CIE and Irish Rail.  I was raising it in the context of a wider review that Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann is commissioning on the future of rail freight in this country.  I believe there is an opportunity for the expansion of rail freight.  At present, only 2% of freight is carried by rail.  That is a small fraction of what the average is across Europe.  While some argue that the distances here are not long enough, the rest of Europe is saying it wants to switch to even greater volumes of freight traffic.  With new technology coming on stream, the possibility of revived rail freight is a real prospect, and-or the other use of other rail lines for commuting, tourism or other purposes.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy's instincts are right.  We should not write off the possible return of lines which are currently underutilised or, as with this line, effectively closed for the last ten years.  There are particular difficulties in Rosslare because it is a roll-on roll-off port.  In the discussions I had with Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, I asked if it was thinking of the possibilities to vary or adapt that in the long term in developing the port.  There are difficulties in that regard, but we have to wait and see what is in the report of its review of the future of freight.  It is also influenced by the fact that the Port of Waterford has lift-on lift-off facilities at Belview and has rail freight capabilities.  That would influence the decision.<\/p>  <p>  The issue of this line is similar in a way to the discussion about the western railway corridor in terms of the question of whether one has a greenway or keeps a rail asset.  I do not disagree with the Deputy's suggestion that it is possible, potentially, to have both.  We will have to make a decision in that regard in the context of a wider network review.  It is not just this section of line, but seeing how we can integrate networks, which is what I hope to do.  I commit to doing further work with the Deputy and other Deputies in the Waterford and Wexford region to examine what possibilities there might be.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100600058#KKK00400","speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Swimming Pool Programme","time":1602020100,"counter":546,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100600058#KKK00500"},{"type":"speech","time":1602020100,"counter":547,"content":"<p>Is &iacute; an cheist at&aacute; faoi chaibidil agam anocht n&aacute; an baol m&oacute;r at&aacute; ann nach mbeidh an linn sn&aacute;mha poibl&iacute; i nGaillimh oscailte ar&iacute;s tar &eacute;is na Nollag.

It is a fantastic swimming pool.  I must declare a conflict of interest as I use it every weekend.  It helps to keep me semi-sane and semi-fit.  It was announced at the end of September that the pool was going to close at the end of that week.  I reacted by calling it crass stupidity that a local authority would allow a public swimming pool to close because of funding.  This public swimming pool broke even in the last number of years.  No public swimming pool makes a profit and few of them break even.  This pool needed money due to Covid-19 and the difficulties experienced by every public swimming pool in the country.  The management in the city council said it was not in a position to give it money and that the swimming pool would have to close.  As a result of pressure from councillors, which originated from the people and the users of the swimming pool, the council relented and gave over &euro;200,000 to enable it to remain open until Christmas.  However, it pointed out that the money was coming out of next year's budget, it could not continue and it would not be in a position to fund it.<\/p>  <p>  I do not expect miracles, but I expect a commitment from the Minister and the Government that, regardless of what happens, we are not going to close public swimming pools or public libraries.  They are essential services.<\/p> <p>I note that Ireland Active, which represents leisure, health and fitness associations, welcomed the July stimulus of &euro;2.5 million to enable swimming pools with public access to remain open because of the high energy costs and the difficulties complying with Covid.  It seems this is not available to the local authorities.  In any event it is a small amount of money given the number of swimming pools.  I understand again from Ireland Active that this fund will be administered by Sport Ireland.  The Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin, made a very positive announcement on this and acknowledged the challenges facing swimming pools.  We have got a reprieve until Christmas in Galway because of pressure but the same challenges apply to all the other public swimming pools.  Can the Minister of State please do an assessment of what is necessary to keep our public swimming pools open and put a package in place?  I understand 300,000 adults at a minimum use swimming pools every year.  It is the sport with the second largest number of participants.  It does not make sense on any level to allow swimming pools to close, not to mention that in the middle of all our difficulties we have great problems with obesity and lack of exercise.  There should be a positive programme to encourage people to use the swimming pools while complying with the Covid restrictions.  I ask for confirmation tonight that this closure is not going to be allowed to happen, not just in Galway but anywhere.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100600058#KKK00600","speaker":"1577","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1602020700,"counter":549,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for giving me the opportunity to outline today the importance of Government funding of local authorities, with a particular focus on the spend of Galway City Council and Galway County Council, and also to reflect on the serious impact Covid-19 is having on local authorities' expenditure and on their cash flow.  The funding system that applies to local authorities is a complex one, as authorities derive their income from a variety of sources including commercial rates, charges for goods and services and funding from central Government.  Central Government funding of local authorities similarly presents a complex picture, with transfers coming from a wide range of Departments and offices, not solely from my Department, for a variety of purposes.  It is the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport that has responsibility for the funding of swimming pools.  Also, local property tax, LPT, can be used by local authorities to support the provision of local services which benefit citizens directly including parks, libraries, leisure amenities etc.<\/p>  <p>  My Department recognised that cash flow support was critical to local authorities in order to ensure the services they deliver, including required subventions to swimming pools, could be maintained.  It was decided to bring forward a number of payments due from the Department, where possible, throughout 2020.  Specific advances were made to both Galway City Council and Galway County Council in respect of LPT and also each local authority's individual payroll and public service pension reduction allocation.  In fact, all of the LPT allocations for 2020, amounting to &euro;516.8 million in total, have been paid to all local authorities at this stage.  Local authorities have been advised to capture all related costs in their financial systems to aid future financial analysis of the impact of Covid-19 on the local government sector.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is engaging with representatives of the local government sector and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on the financial challenges facing local authorities as a direct consequence of the pandemic, in terms of additional costs incurred as part of the local government response and declines in local authority income streams.  These matters are under active consideration.  In order to support the sector generally, I will ensure my Department continues to keep local authority income, expenditure and cash flow under review and will continue to work with all local authorities, both collectively and individually, including on issues being raised by Galway City Council and Galway County Council.<\/p>  <p>  In the programme for Government, Our Shared Future, the Government places a strong emphasis on swimming, cycling, walking and running, which are especially suitable for all generations.  I am also mindful of recent comments by my colleague, the Minister for Finance, who commented on the importance of swimming pools remaining open during and after this pandemic, though he also advised a huge intervention is required and it may be that we will not be able to meet every need.  I hear the significant case the Deputy has put forward in connection with the swimming pool in question and I know that the Department is reviewing the case with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  We have a great need to be met in the local authority sector between a collapse in goods and services income, the commercial rates income being significantly compromised and also in terms of the collection of income streams in the sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100600059#LLL00200","speaker":"1595"},{"type":"speech","time":1602020700,"counter":550,"content":"<p>I welcome the positive nature of the last two paragraphs of the reply, which refers to the acknowledgement in the programme for Government of the importance of swimming among other activities and the comments of the Minister for Finance.  I do not have the time to go into the finances of both local authorities.  I think it is accepted that they are the lowest funded in the whole of the country.  That is a separate problem.  In addition to that we have Covid.  We had a Zoom meeting last Friday.  Zoom meetings are never very good for interaction but it was good in the sense of getting a presentation.  The manager conveyed to us that the financial situation in Galway city is dire.  He said there has been no certainty at all from the Department in respect of the payment of rates and the absence of money.<\/p>  <p>  I am not going to go into that but I am going to use my minute to highlight another irony.  We are putting money into opening up pubs, and rightly so, as we need pubs and we need to ensure staff have jobs.  However, the irony cannot be lost on the Minister of State that while we are opening up pubs with the help of public funds, we are closing down public swimming pools.  There is something seriously wrong with that logic given the programme for Government and the essential nature of swimming pools.  On the announcement of the stimulus package, in his last two minutes the Minister of State might clarify if that was specifically for private bodies such as hotels and leisure centres and not for public swimming pools.  It is very ironic if we are going to keep private swimming pools open once they have some limited access to the public while we close down the public swimming pools.  It was literally closing down.  The staff were called in and told it was closing down the following week.  It was simply as a result of pressure that we kept it open until Christmas.  I still do not hear the Minister of State saying that we are making a commitment to keeping our public swimming pools open because they are an essential service on so many levels.

We are very clear that the local authority sector has achieved so much over the last number of years and indeed through Covid-19 in the way it rolled out the community call in a few days, for example.  Local authorities responded to serious emergencies in terms of storms and floods.  I can assure the Deputy of that.

We have also committed to accept 36 unaccompanied minors in need of international protection from Greece and I was pleased that the first group of eight such minors arrived in Ireland last June.  As I mentioned, the Government has decided to accept another group of four unaccompanied minors as part of this overall commitment.

Extra sailings planned for next year include those from Rosslare to Cherbourg and Cork to Roscoff.

There are issues with scheduling and the timelines involved.  Getting product to and from mainland Europe takes longer on direct ferry routes.  There are issues with the logistics of this, particularly for fresh and perishable goods that need to get to the market quickly.

We continue to stand in full solidarity with Greece and Cyprus on these issues.  The only way in which disputes concerning maritime boundaries in the Aegean Sea and the wider eastern Mediterranean will be resolved is through political dialogue.  I commend the German Government, in particular, on its efforts to mediate in this dispute.  France has been very involved as well.  I discussed this issue last week with my German counterpart.

Of course, within the European Union itself, where we should be giving leadership by example to the rest of the world, we have had huge difficulty in agreeing a collective approach towards virtually anything to do with migration, quite frankly.  In recent weeks, the European Commission has introduced a new proposed pact on migration and asylum, for which it hopes to be able to gain support throughout the European Union.

We have contributed to international pressure that has prevented Israel from moving ahead with plans to annex large parts of the West Bank in the summer.  We have been active at UN level and have been involved in multiple resolutions.  We have been very active at EU level and we continue to be.  Only last week I spoke to my German counterpart on what has been described as the Amman Statement where France and Germany met with Jordan and made a statement following that meeting reinforcing EU support for a two-state solution and a rejection of annexation and breaches of international law.  We remain in the middle of this debate and continue to try to shape an EU response towards equality of treatment of both Israelis and Palestinians in a way that can lead to a negotiated solution both sides can live with in security and statehood.  That is what we will continue to do.  We are far from toothless in this area and I can assure the Deputy that we are doing much more than simply expressing criticism.  What we cannot do is breach international law ourselves or try to do something that is outside the remit of the Irish Government in trade sanctions or limiting trade.  I have explained that to this House on many occasions and this position comes directly from the Attorney General.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100600068#UUU01000","speaker":"1457"},{"type":"speech","time":1602026100,"counter":657,"content":"<p>Since January there has been a 55% rise of structures targeted with demolitions or confiscated in the occupied territories and a fourfold increase in the number of displaced people.  While all these statements are being made, the situation continues to get worse.  In east Jerusalem, 24 structures were demolished last month.  It just goes on and no action is taken.  There are no consequences.  Is it any wonder that Israel believes it can do what it likes?  The Minister and Europe keeps talking to Israel, expressing concern but there are no consequences.  In reality, it believes it has the green light to do what it likes because there will be no consequences.  The only reason apartheid South Africa was eventually brought down was because there were consequences for running an abhorrent regime but there are no consequences for Israel.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100600068#UUU01100","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1602026100,"counter":658,"content":"<p>As I have said, if we had this debate last June people would have predicted that in July Prime Minister Netanyahu would have moved ahead with annexation of parts of the West Bank, and possibly even the Jordan Valley.  That did not happen because of international pressure.  The perception was that Israel had been given the green light to do that and it did not.  It was talked out of doing so by powerful allies of Israel but also by very direct messaging from the European Union, in which Ireland was very much involved in the debates on the Middle East peace process at that stage within the Foreign Affairs Council.<\/p>  <p>  I agree with the Deputy that in many instances Israel acts with impunity.  It continues to impinge on Palestinian lands and Palestinian rights in a way that is illegal.  We have to continue to highlight that and maintain pressure but we also have to talk to Israel and maintain a relationship that can result in a negotiated outcome at some point in the future.  It will not be resolved by protest alone.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100600068#UUU01200","speaker":"1457"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1602026100,"counter":659,"content":"<p>Written Answers are published on the Oireachtas website.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1602026100,"counter":660,"content":"<p>The D&aacute;il adjourned at at 12.30 a.m. until 10 a.m. on Wednesday, 7 October 2020.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
