The Estimates for my Department, passed by both Houses as part of budget 2017, include an allocation of &euro;80 million for the horse and greyhound racing fund.  This will be distributed in accordance with section 12(6) of the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act 2001, with 80%, some &euro;64 million, going to HRI, Horse Racing Ireland, and 20%, some &euro;16 million, to Bord na gCon.<\/p><p>To allow my Department to provide the moneys allocated in budget 2017, it is necessary to comply with the technical requirement under section 12(13) of the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act, to increase the cumulative limit on the amount payable from the horse and greyhound racing fund by &euro;80 million to &euro;1.118 billion.  This is achieved by way of the regulations submitted to this House today.  The aggregate limit on the horse and greyhound racing fund has been increased in this manner in 2004 and from 2009 to 2015, inclusive.<\/p><p>It is estimated the Irish bloodstock industry provides 14,000 jobs and contributes almost &euro;1.1 billion to the economy.  In 2015, bloodstock export sales rose to &euro;268 million in what was a remarkable year for the Irish bloodstock industry.  Ireland holds a distinguished position in the thoroughbred racing world, being the largest producer of thoroughbred foals in Europe and the fourth largest in the world.  Approximately 40% of the EU output of thoroughbreds and 11% of the total worldwide are produced in Ireland.<\/p><p>The greyhound racing sector is also an important driver of employment and economic activity in both rural and urban areas.  A report by the economist Jim Power in 2010 estimated the greyhound industry employed over 10,300 people and contributed an estimated &euro;500 million in economic output to local economies around tracks which have a wide geographic spread.  As part of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to the sector, its overall objective is to ensure the horse and greyhound racing industries achieve their maximum potential and, in so doing, contribute to economic and social development.<\/p><p>I will shortly be bringing forward the heads of a greyhound industry Bill to ensure the principles of good governance and regulation are clearly and unambiguously laid down in primary legislation.  In broad terms, the Bill will seek to provide a statutory framework for improved governance, tighter regulation and stronger powers to deal with breaches of the racing code.  It will also address issues identified in a report authored by the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine in January 2016, as well as those contained in both the Indecon report and the Morris review of anti-doping and medication control.  This Bill will strengthen the greyhound industry and give it the powers to deal with issues of regulation in a more effective way.<\/p><p>Without doubt, Horse Racing Ireland and Bord na gCon face significant challenges as they work to grow and develop the horse and greyhound industries in an extremely competitive market segment.  The &euro;80 million allocation is vital to help secure rural jobs and sustain rural communities.  Given that these two industries have footprints in many parts of rural Ireland, I am confident it is the goal of all of us here to realise fully the contribution of these sectors to the Irish economy, employment and the social and cultural fabric of the country.  Accordingly, I ask Deputies for their support to ensure Horse Racing Ireland and Bord na gCon receive the funding provided for in budget 2017 and that the very important role of these industries and the economic activity generated by them are sustained into the future. I commend this regulation to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121400003#A00050","speaker":"1356","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1481713500,"counter":8,"content":"<p>There are nine speakers and the business has to conclude in 40 minutes so I ask Deputies to be as prompt as they can.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121400004#B00200","speaker":"1332"},{"type":"speech","time":1481713500,"counter":9,"content":"<p>Fianna F&aacute;il supports this motion.

The &euro;80 million is money well spent.  We have a bloodstock industry which is the envy of many countries around the world.  We are also one of the leading countries in the greyhound business and are the envy of many countries.  We see that 25 years ago London had 26 dog tracks, but come March there will be no dog tracks left there.  We have to see what we have here and while everything has not been done perfectly in the past while, we recognise the great importance of our industry and the significant contribution these two industries make to our economy as a whole.  While we are contributing &euro;80 million, we have to recognise the revenue that is coming back into the Exchequer from these two industries, which is not insignificant.<\/p>  <p>  Will the Minister of State look at the position of track bookmakers in regard to levy and taxation?  Track bookmakers have come under increasing pressure in recent times.  The number of track bookmakers at dog racing and horse racing has declined very significantly.  They are an integral part of the industry.  The atmosphere and entertainment value of the industry depends greatly on having track bookmakers present.  Legislation needs to be changed to allow these track bookmakers to operate on a level playing field with the larger operators which are multinational companies.  The one cap fits all method of taxation and levy will not work into the future for track bookmakers, so change needs to be made.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121400004#B00300","speaker":"1350"},{"type":"speech","time":1481713500,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I, too, welcome this motion.

The figure is in the region of 24,000 people, both directly and indirectly, and that is of huge value to the rural economy.<\/p>  <p>  I refer specifically to the greyhound industry because the challenges for the industry are very significant.  The Minister of State will be aware that a recommendation from the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine on the greyhound industry was published in January.  We need to move on that and we need to implement the legislation.  I welcome that the Minister of State will be briefing interested members on the legislation at 6.30 p.m. with a view to having it in place early next year.  We need to restore public confidence in the greyhound industry by ensuring there is correct governance in Bord na gCon.  The testing procedures for greyhounds should be adhered to strictly in order that people have confidence that the industry is clean and well run.  We also need to ensure there is value for money in the very welcome funding we are giving and that the industry rewards the Government's commitment to it.  Both industries are estimated to be worth &euro;1.1 billion to the economy.  Our investment of &euro;80 million is well rewarded, but there is still very much a need to restore public confidence in the greyhound industry and the confidence of the people who work in the industry.  There are many small owners who are in it for the love of the sport and who need the backing of Bord na gCon and the legislation the Minister of State is about to implement and brief us on this evening.  While the funding is welcome, there is a lot of work needed in the background.  The Minister of State has my support in getting that over the line in order that we can look forward to the industry having a bright, profitable future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121400004#B00500","speaker":"1321"},{"type":"speech","time":1481713500,"counter":12,"content":"<p>The horse racing and greyhound industries not only have economic benefits but also bring great enjoyment to hundreds of thousands of people in Ireland every year.  I have no wish to restrict the growth or development of these industries, although I have serious doubts about the funds dispersed by Government to Horse Racing Ireland and Bord na gCon.  Every time this funding is discussed, I hear about the thousands of jobs in the industry, but sometimes I wonder about the quality of these jobs and whether they are counted as whole-time equivalents as they are in the HSE, schools and other State bodies.  How many real jobs are there?  Bord na gCon claims there are 10,300 people employed in the greyhound industry.  I would love to know where these people work and the basis of the claim that the industry contributes &euro;500 million to the economy each year.  I am told by dog breeders and trainers that the greyhound industry is in crisis and will disappear within the decade if radical reform does not take place.  According to Horse Racing Ireland, the horse racing industry employs 14,000 people and contributes &euro;1.1 billion to the economy.  With two such healthy and vibrant industries, why does the Exchequer have to hand out such an amount of money?  Why does horse racing prize money, in a sport populated by very rich owners and trainers, have to come from an Exchequer which cannot pay for the basic medical needs of our senior citizens, for instance?  We cannot always make those simple comparisons but for this amount of money - &euro;80 million - there has to be clear and demonstrable benefits to society and our economy.  Along with that, there must be strict adherence to corporate governance and transparency in all financial aspects of the industry.  The excessive salaries and expenses being drawn down in both organisations is beyond the realm of reason and the decisions about where to spend Exchequer money will have to be examined.<\/p><p>It was confirmed to me at the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine that almost &euro;3 million of taxpayers' money would be spent on the redevelopment of Galway racecourse, mainly on the construction of a champagne bar.  There was a time when the people at the Galway races were happy to drink their champagne in a tent but now it seems the taxpayer has to pay for the construction of a bar for them.  Is this value for money in the context of the economic hardship so many people are suffering throughout the country?<\/p><p>Horse Racing Ireland has been in the news over the past six months due to the manner of the reappointment of its chief executive officer for a third term.  I am led to believe that the irregularities in the appointment of the CEO have continued for more than a decade, according to correspondence released by HRI and reported in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>last Saturday.  I have raised this matter before in the House and representatives of the board of HRI attended a meeting of the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine to inform us about this appointment.  At that time, the chairman admitted quite openly that the appointment was against Government guidelines, that the CEO's salary had exceeded the Government cap and that the latest appointment was made without even a gesture towards open competition.  It was suggested that the board had no option as the CEO had accrued rights with a contract of indefinite duration.  This state of affairs suggests either extreme incompetence or, more probably, an intentional lapse to provide the CEO with a contract of indefinite duration allowing this situation to transpire.<\/p><p>The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and the board of HRI, it seems, feel that this was acceptable behaviour.  When I raised the matter in the House with the Minister, Deputy Creed, asking if, considering the blatant disregard for corporate governance displayed by the board of HRI, he would consider reviewing the amount of money the Exchequer was providing to it, he referred to my misgivings as &quot;a fit of pique&quot;.  Somebody needs to have a fit about it.  I still have not been given any justification for the way this appointment was allowed, except that it seems it does not matter because they say the right man was appointed for job.<\/p><p>The House must exercise more vigilance regarding appointments and funds and the way in which they are expended and distributed throughout these two industries.  It would be more appropriate for less Exchequer funding to go to prize money for big races, and more to other sectors of the industry such as point-to-point racing, harness racing and programmes for better breeding and husbandry, incentivising small breeders to improve their stock.  It is hard to understand why there is resistance on Government benches, and presumably among Fianna F&aacute;il Members, to increasing betting tax so the industry can be more self-funded.<br\/><br\/>Anyone who takes even a casual look at the way in which the greyhound industry is run would have to be alarmed.  We have had various reports and inquiries, such as the Morris report into doping in the greyhound industry and the Indecon report into Bord na gCon which found more disregard for corporate governance and people outstaying their terms on the board.  The Oireachtas joint committee published a report highlighting serious flaws in the running of the sector.  The integrity of the greyhound industry is in tatters, mainly due to the seemingly <i>laissez-faire<\/i>attitude to the use of performance enhancing drugs.<br\/><br\/>The Greyhound Board of Great Britain warned owners, as late as 2014, of the dangers of buying dogs from Ireland and urged all trainers to exercise caution and due diligence in assessing the drugs status of dogs they might purchase from Ireland.  The use of artificial insemination, AI, straws from dogs who are more than two years deceased is illegal, yet this rule is continually flouted to the detriment of the quality and renewal of the breeding stock.  This is a terrible state of affairs and it seems as if the Government turns a blind eye and does not enforce the necessary discipline and governance on the sector.<br\/><br\/>What is the rationale for the expenditure of this money?  The House deserves more than a shrug from the Minister and should demand action to reverse this.  Bord na gCon has failed to do its job.  The recommendations of Morris, Indecon and the agriculture committee have not been implemented.  The Government tells us it is preparing new legislation.  There is already legislation to deal with these irregularities and it is not being used.  Under these circumstances, I cannot support the funding allocation to these two bodies and I will call a vote on the matter.  It is outrageous that this money is being spent in this way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121400004#B00600","speaker":"1345","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1481714100,"counter":14,"content":"<p>The horse and greyhound sector plays an important role throughout Ireland.  It is an important contributor to the economy of rural Ireland and the enjoyment and recreation of rural life, and it supports thousands of jobs.  However, the figure of 10,500 jobs in the greyhound industry is more than questionable and does not stand.  Jim Power's report was produced six or seven years ago.  Let us come into reality.<\/p><p>Given that &euro;80 million has been allocated to the two industries, of which &euro;60 million goes to the greyhound industry, it is important we acknowledge that it is taxpayers' funds which have been granted despite many competing demands across society for limited resources.  The taxpayer is entitled to expect and get top value for money for this significant investment.  I support the allocation of these necessary funds and recognise their importance.  However, surely the aim of the industry is to reach a point at which it is less dependent on public funds and becomes self-financing.  Representatives of the industry routinely tell us about the circular return of tax money collected from the betting industry.  However, it is incorrect.  Much of the betting industry is generated through a melee of other sports such as soccer, rugby and darts.  Horse racing is one of the smaller contributors.  Let us not cod people with lies.<\/p><p>I support Deputy Jackie Cahill in his point about all bookmakers being treated the same.  They should be classified on the basis of turnover.  Small bookmakers and offshore bookmakers are gone from the high streets.  They have disappeared like nobody's business.  Any bookmaker with a turnover lower than &euro;2 million should be classified differently from the likes of Ladbrokes and BoyleSports.<\/p><p>HRI must ensure a value for money audit is undertaken without delay and assure people that any hiccups in corporate governance are fully addressed.  We do not need any further spectacles regarding appointments at the top or elsewhere.  All contractual issues should be fully complied with and should be airtight so Government policy is fully recognised as it is laid down and lessons are learned from the debacle we have witnessed.  HRI must ensure adequate funding is provided to small racecourses throughout Ireland, such as Kilbeggan, Roscommon, Limerick, Sligo and Ballinrobe.  This is the sport of kings, but it should not be for kings.  It is time to get away from it.  There is an old saying that one stops rubbing fat to the fat pig's bottom.  Too many people are getting well off.  It is time to get it down to the very grassroots.  They wanted to bring in point-to-points under the regulation.  I stopped it, and I am very proud of that.<\/p><p>IGB is to receive more than &euro;280,000 per week from the taxpayer this year.  A plethora of reports have pointed out significant concerning issues and shortcomings in the industry, which has alarmed many of the stakeholders.  The Indecon report, the Morris report and an excellent report by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine under the excellent chairmanship of the Minister of State, Deputy Andrew Doyle, shone a light on significant issues in the greyhound industry in a number of areas, including integrity, doping, medication and general governance.<\/p><p>The heads of a new Bill for the sector will be ready to go in the new year, and the sooner the better.  Hopefully, it will give us all, particularly the stakeholders in the industry, an opportunity to turn over a new leaf and tackle once and for all the use of prohibited substances and ensure welfare objectives are examined and maintained and regulatory controls are strengthened.  It is timely to update the legislation.  The current legislation was introduced in 1958, almost 60 years ago.  No wonder things run out of control.  We have two extremes.  We have no regulation, or we regulate things out of existence.  There is no such thing as a happy medium.  This is a major fault.  Bureaucrats then get in and regulate things out of existence.  When all this is addressed, there will be a renewed confidence in the industry.<\/p><p>The stakeholders are very concerned about the future, particularly in the dog industry.  The old figure of 10,500 employed in the industry is bandied about.  We need full answers, not incomplete or half-baked answers.  IGB must be forthcoming in addressing shortcomings and listening to concerned voices when they raise issues.  They should not always question the motives of people when they raise issues.  People such as Deputy Martin Kenny and others raise issues with the best of motives and I take no issue with them.  The Minister has the national greyhound consultative forum which brings together all the stakeholders.  It should not be just another <i>pro forma<\/i>talking shop.  It should have teeth and strong powers of recommendation, which IGB should hear.  IGB listens only to what it wants to listen to.  It comes here and presents us with fairy tales.  This must stop.  There is money there and IGB must account for it in a proper and efficient way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121400005#C00200","speaker":"1370"},{"type":"speech","time":1481714100,"counter":15,"content":"<p>The motion will allocate &euro;80 million of public funds to the horse and greyhound racing industry for \"business, financial and development plans\".  It increases the cumulative limit in funds to over &euro;1.1 billion.  We understand 80% will be allocated to horse racing and 20% to greyhound racing.  These funds are linked to the revenue received from the gambling industry and excise duty on off-course betting.  This is a toxic link.  It gives an incentive and a massive boost for the promotion of gambling, one of the most parasitic industries.  Some reports estimate that 30% to 35% of the industry's profits come from problem gamblers.  In other words, it is an industry that destroys people's lives.  This link ensures profit is put at the core of the horse and greyhound industries, therefore providing incentives for cruel practices and corruption.<\/p>  <p>  In recent years, there have been many scandals in the greyhound industry.  As part of its anti-doping programme, IGB has reported that 1% of samples tested positive last year.  This is only the tip of the iceberg.  Pharmacology experts, vets and many in the industry treat those official figures with understandable scepticism.  IGB's Morris report on doping has identified severe problems with anti-doping measures in the greyhound industry.  The report found the national greyhound laboratory does not have facilities to test many of the drugs used to dope greyhounds.<\/p>  <p>  Another major scandal in the greyhound racing industry is that of the dogs behind the scenes that never make it to the tracks.  It is estimated that approximately 10,000 greyhounds retire from racing or, as is more common, are born but never make it into racing.  Approximately 1,200 were homed last year, leaving 88% with an unknown fate.  It must be investigated.  We have had high profile cases of dogs being cruelly killed with little or no consequence for those caught.  In 2014, there were only 15 investigations into welfare incidents in the industry.<\/p><p>It is clear that the IGB and the Government is turning a blind eye to the cruelty that exists.  Furthermore, we see attempts by the top of the industry to establish new markets in east Asia, China in particular.  It is clear that exports to Macau and those involving any states with poor animal rights records and no proper protection for animals should be banned.  We have argued for this and will continue to do so in debate on the legislation due on the question of the greyhound industry.

Only for animal welfare campaigners this practice would still be going on.  Then there are the greyhounds who do not make the cut and who are abandoned and left to the rescue shelters to be looked after.  How much of the &euro;16 million will go to the animal rescue centres?  This is an industry in which attendance is down, sponsorship is down and support is down.

There was the most recent savagery in Rathdowney Coursing Club in County Laois, where the 78 hares in the compound were killed by dogs.  This is not an isolated incident.  There are other such examples and independent evidence to support it.  The coursing gangs illegally capture hares and use them to blood greyhounds.

The idea of giving taxpayers' money to Bord na gCon, an organisation which oversees the barbarism of hare coursing, is absolutely abhorrent.  We know from the scandal that engulfed Horse Racing Ireland earlier in the year that the organisation is incapable of handling public money.  We must ask ourselves why we are doing this.  Why is a salary of &euro;247,000 for the CEO of Horse Racing Ireland, way above the pay cap, being sanctioned?  When the scandal broke in the autumn, the excuse given was that Mr. Kavanagh had a contract of indefinite duration, but the lobbying started long before there was even a whiff of his first contract.  The documents revealing correspondence back to 2003 are very serious not only for the industry, but also the Department.  It seems incredible that in 2010 the Department accepted HRI's contention that Mr. Kavanagh was covered by the transfer of undertakings directive, TUPE, when he was not.  He had voluntarily left the Turf Club in 2001 to apply to become the first CEO of HRI, so TUPE did not even exist or apply in this case.  The Department surely could have queried this.<\/p>  <p>  The issue before us is the fact that in the period 2001-16, &euro;1.3 billion has been given to the horse and greyhound racing industries.  This is some amount of public money to be given to two commercial enterprises which base themselves on the exploitation of animals for profit - not only animals, but also people.  There is a scandal much more significant than that which engulfed the CEO of Horse Racing Ireland earlier this year.  I refer to the scandal of the working conditions of people in the industry, which are not only illegal and immoral, but also potentially criminal.  The idea of our sanctioning a cent of public money for these organisations is utterly abhorrent.  Stable staff are treated in complete breach of the Organisation of Working Time Act, which is being ignored.  The vast majority of these people never get two days off in a row, they never get a full weekend off unless they are on holiday and they are not paid for the travel involved in their work.  Given the number of hours they are forced to work, it is very likely many are paid less than the minimum wage, which is not only illegal but also a criminal offence.<\/p>  <p>  I put the House on notice that come early next year when we return I will call for investigations into this industry way beyond what we have seen already.

Everyone who owns a pony for hunting must have a horsebox, veterinary aids and tack.  We cannot be like Sinn F&eacute;in and just deny that this is happening at all.  Our own people create this industry.  It is the big part of the industry I have many issues with.  I also have many issues with what is happening in the horse racing industry.  Conglomerates such as the one in my area have done great work and are recognised all over the world for their prowess in the racing industry.  However, why do they need Government support and the generous tax regime Charlie Haughey introduced in his day to stimulate the industry when they can buy up every parcel of land that comes up for sale in Tipperary, Limerick, Waterford, Cork, Kilkenny, Kildare and beyond?  They are not leaving a living for anybody else.  We cannot support an industry that takes the lifeblood out of our communities, which is what is happening in the bloodstock industry.  The same is happening in other parts of the country.  I have called for legislation in this regard.  The Minister of State spoke about legislation due next year.  I ask him to consider this issue in the legislation.  He has failed to do so in the Finance Act or in any other legislation.  We do not have a land league.  We do not have anybody to protect ordinary small farmers who want to extend their farms to survive and to keep up with quotas, costs and the necessary investment.  They can no longer buy a cottage acre; they now resort to buying the cottages with the acres.  They want a landscape free of anybody else.  Nobody is allowed to live or support anything else.<\/p>  <p>  I support Deputy Daly's call for an examination of the wages paid in the industry, the pay below minimum wage and the other issues.  I have previously met both staff and industry representatives during lobbying of the previous Government on this issue.  I understand that racing is normally a weekend event, but I asked them why they must have flexi hours and so on.  We need openness and transparency and we need this to be investigated properly.  We need to support the small trainers, small bookies and ordinary small families that handle the greyhounds and bed the horses.  They have a little luck and bravery and get a little satisfaction out of the sport and love and want to protect it.<\/p>  <p>  We must also consider animal cruelty.  Last year, we could not have our national coursing open in Clonmel because all the hares had been killed by marauding gangs of people whom the animal rights campaigners do not want to tackle at all.  These marauding gangs are the same people to whom we talk about giving ethnic status in the very near future in this House.<\/p><p>The individuals to whom I refer went out with terriers and lurchers.  They had videos of the killing of hares.  Up to five and six dogs with no muzzles were going after a hare.  That is what happened to the industry and that is what is happening because of the gangs to which Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan referred.  This is not happening where regulated coursing meetings are held because the representatives of the Irish Coursing Club are present, and rightly so.  Moreover, vets and officials from the Department are also present, and rightly so.<\/p> <p> We want a regulated industry and we want to protect it.  However, we cannot have people terrorising homes.  When people ring the Garda, they are threatened and told that they will be burnt out or that their fences will be cut down.  All the hares were killed by dogs, including lurchers and terriers, accompanied by gangs of men in vans.  They put up videos on Facebook featuring the hares they had captured and killed using five or six dogs.  That is not sport; that is animal cruelty at its worst.  Animal rights people, including some Deputies, do not want to know anything about that.  These people have protection and are above the law.  That is where the problems have to be weeded out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121400006#D00400","speaker":"1347","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1481715300,"counter":21,"content":"<p>On behalf of the Green Party, I wish to add my voice to those of Deputies who have already spoken and raised real concerns about the development of the horse racing, horse breeding and greyhound industries in Ireland.  This is not out of disrespect or a dislike for the people involved in those industries.  They have a significant role in Irish society and the business world.  Sometimes, however, we have to regulate business for the sake of its protection and long-term future.  For too long, this House and a succession of Governments have sought to turn a blind eye and have been unwilling to address the real problems that exist.<\/p>  <p>  In recent times we have seen scandals emerging relating to exports of Irish greyhounds to the UK.  Internationally, questions have been asked about the doping of animals, animal treatment, over-breeding and animals being sent to China.  These questions have raised a range of different animal rights issues, which, I believe, we cannot ignore.  It is in the interests of people with an interest in dogs and horses that we set the highest standards and get matters right.  No one can argue that this exists in the country at present.  Let Ireland be one of the best countries in the world for breeding horses and dogs.  If it is to become such a country, then let us ensure the highest possible animal welfare and industry standards.  I do not believe such standards are currently in place.  For that reason, we will oppose the motion and support the vote that will be called by others.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121400007#E00200","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"speech","time":1481715300,"counter":22,"content":"<p>As there are no other speakers and as the time has elapsed, I am required to put the question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121400007#E00300","speaker":"1332"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1481715300,"counter":23,"content":"<p>Question put.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1481715300,"counter":24,"content":"<p>In accordance with Standing Order 70(2), the division is postponed until the weekly division time on Thursday, 15 December 2016.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121400007#E00500","speaker":"1332"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Statute Law Revision Bill 2016: Order for Report Stage","time":1481715300,"counter":25,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121400007#E00600"},{"type":"speech","time":1481715300,"counter":26,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That Report Stage be taken now.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121400007#E00700","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1481715300,"counter":27,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Statute Law Revision Bill 2016: Report and Final Stages","time":1481715300,"counter":28,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121400007#E00900"},{"type":"speech","time":1481715300,"counter":29,"content":"<p>As there are no amendments, we will proceed to Fifth Stage.

Rents have been soaring across the country.  We know from various surveys, particularly the most recent <i>daft.ie<\/i>survey, which related to the third quarter of 2016, that there have been extraordinary increases in rent inflation.  The annual rate of rent inflation was 11.7% last year.  This was the highest increase recorded since 2002.  Up to 2013-14, Dublin was the major driver of national rental inflation.  Other areas have caught up dramatically since 2012-13.  Some extraordinary increases were recorded last year.  There were rent increases of 14.4% in Cork city, 12.5% in Cork county, 13.27% in Limerick, 10% in Galway, 13% in Waterford city, 15% in Meath, 13% in Kildare, 15% in Louth and 10.6% in Wicklow.  I have itemised those increases to give people a sense of the scale of rental inflation across the country, including key urban areas and commuter belt areas, over recent years.  There is a need to bring these increases under control and bring clarity to this situation.<\/p><p>We acknowledge that there have been changes in recent months.  The possibility of increasing rent supplement was resisted for many years until the confidence and supply agreement between Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael resulted in such an increase, despite misgivings in Fine Gael, as well as increases in payments under the housing assistance programme.  We also acknowledge that there has been a long struggle in relation to rent certainty and clarity.  The Labour Party tried to bring that about when it was a member of the last Government, but it failed to get a breakthrough.  It must be acknowledged that there seems to have been strong resistance in Fine Gael to any idea of a rent cap or rent clarity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121400008#G00200","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1481715600,"counter":38,"content":"<p>Fianna F&aacute;il voted against it three times.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121400008#G00300","speaker":"1239"},{"type":"speech","time":1481715600,"counter":39,"content":"<p>Legislation, rather than simplistic motions to play to the stage and to the Gallery, is needed for rent clarity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121400008#G00400","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1481715600,"counter":40,"content":"<p>We proposed legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121400008#G00500","speaker":"1309"},{"type":"speech","time":1481715600,"counter":41,"content":"<p>I make these points to acknowledge that there has been change within the Fine Gael Party regarding the idea of rent clarity.

This situation is unprecedented.  It has been around for a very long time.  Particular aims are set out in the Minister's comprehensive, targeted and focused rental strategy programme, which is the first intervention in the housing market here to be made by any Government.  A great deal of discussion is going on with Deputy Martin's spokesman, whom I heard speaking this morning and at other times about the three issues Deputy Martin has just raised.  The Minister, Deputy Coveney, has responded to the three issues in question.  Deputy Martin will be aware that the Minister for Finance has set up a working group on the taxation issue.  In this year's budget, the Minister, Deputy Noonan, said he intends to increase the deductibility limit in respect of landlords until it gets to 100%.  He set out the timescale for that.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Martin also asked about contiguous areas of the cities of Dublin and Cork, which have been included in the Minister's proposals.  It is clear that this will be assessed on the basis of local electoral areas by the Residential Tenancies Board.  The Minister, Deputy Coveney, is confident that the areas in question can be extended.  He will have an answer to that question by February, by which time he will have received the board's assessment.<\/p>  <p>  The decision to set the cap at 4% was made for a number of specific reasons.  First, there is a need to ensure there is a reasonable rate of return on investment so that there is no spike effect at the end of the period of the designation.  In other words, a lower limit could have the effect of storing up a sudden upward correction for tenants after three years.  Second, the Government previously endorsed a limit of 4% per annum on a rolling five-year basis as a reasonable rate of return in the target portfolio set out in the ISIF investment strategy report, which was published in 2015.  Third, the level we have chosen is 20% lower than this country's long-run annual rent increases over seven decades.  Fourth, the maximum allowed inflation in rental pressure zones will be less than half of the current rate of annual rent inflation nationally.  It is below the allowed rental inflation in a number of other countries where rents are indexed, including Germany, where rents may be increased by a maximum of 20% over a three-year period;-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121400008#G01800","speaker":"1245"},{"type":"speech","time":1481715600,"counter":54,"content":"<p>Go raibh maith agat, a Thaoisigh.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121400008#G01900","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1481715600,"counter":55,"content":"<p>-----New York, where increases of 7.5% per annum are allowed until maximum rent is reached; Sweden, where rents can go beyond an agreed price ceiling up a maximum of 5%; and Switzerland, where rents can be increased to ensure there is a return, with nominal rates of return of approximately 6%.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121400008#G02000","speaker":"1245"},{"type":"speech","time":1481715600,"counter":56,"content":"<p>The Taoiseach will have to use the next minute for the extra information.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121400008#G02100","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1481715600,"counter":57,"content":"<p>This is a really important issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121400008#G02200","speaker":"1245"},{"type":"speech","time":1481715600,"counter":58,"content":"<p>I know it is.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121400008#G02300","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1481715600,"counter":59,"content":"<p>I hope that through consultation, we can manage to get it through.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121400008#G02400","speaker":"1245"},{"type":"speech","time":1481715600,"counter":60,"content":"<p>The Taoiseach will have another opportunity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121400008#G02500","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1481715600,"counter":61,"content":"<p>I stress that the 4% limit has been set by the Government for very specific reasons.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121400008#G02600","speaker":"1245"},{"type":"speech","time":1481715600,"counter":62,"content":"<p>The Government has left it very late in terms of the consultation and the publication of the amendments.

The Minister, Deputy Coveney, is quite willing to continue to discuss with the Fianna F&aacute;il spokesperson the issues surrounding landlords, taxation in respect of the geographical areas and how that can be implemented expeditiously, and the very strong reasons for striking a balance which is structured and directed to help tenants and continue the supply of housing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121400009#H00900","speaker":"1245"},{"type":"speech","time":1481716200,"counter":72,"content":"<p>Go raibh maith agat.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121400009#H01000","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1481716200,"counter":73,"content":"<p>It clearly does not interfere with new houses or the elements to provide supply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121400009#H01100","speaker":"1245"},{"type":"speech","time":1481716200,"counter":74,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Adams.

Yesterday, I raised with the Taoiseach the Government's ill-thought-out proposals on the rental sector.  I focused on two elements, namely, the absence of rent certainty and the Government's failure to deal with the difficulties - or even acknowledge the difficulties - faced by families in rented accommodation outside of the cities of Dublin and Cork.  I did so because these are the two big failures with the Government's proposals but also because, like other Deputies, we did not have any sight of its propositions.  That is the way the Government does business.  The media was briefed and the document, complete with glossy brochure and all the other PR accoutrements, was launched outside the D&aacute;il Chamber.  This Government has produced more reports and press releases on housing and homelessness than it has built homes - that is the record of the Government.  Deputies, who actually have the responsibility to vote on these measures, were kept in the dark about the detail.   Now, contrary to the Taoiseach's protestations, he is rushing it through.<\/p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in's housing spokesperson, Deputy Eoin &Oacute; Broin, tabled 90 amendments on Committee Stage, including one on rent certainty.  Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael voted it down once again.  We have tabled more substantive amendments today but the Government does not want any of them.  All the bad old practices that marked the Government's previous term are being carried through into this term.  The Taoiseach cannot even rely on Fianna F&aacute;il on this one, or maybe he can.  Part of Fianna F&aacute;il's play-acting at being an Opposition party - the party of verbalised republicanism, the party which caused the crisis - is that every so often it has to engage in a sham fight with the Government.  All the while, the 700,000 citizens in the private rented sector are being fleeced.<\/p>  <p>  When we first brought these issues of homelessness, families in mortgage distress, the absence of social housing and the exploitation of families in the private sector to the Taoiseach's attention three or four years ago, he refused to act.  He said it is clear that \"interference in the market ... is not something we should do.  While people are calling for what they call clarity on rent certainty, if we interfere in the wrong way, we will make matters worse.\"  In fairness, the Government has interfered in the market - that is what it did yesterday.  It has not quite abandoned its ideological position but it has set aside the principle in an inadequate way which, to use the Taoiseach's own words, has made matters worse.  The people it has made matters worse for are the 700,000 citizens in that sector.  They cannot afford the thousands of euro the Government proposals demand of them.  I appeal to the Taoiseach to do the right thing, the proper thing, namely, introduce rent certainty, not rent punishment, and link rent increases to the consumer price index.  That is the only solution that will adequately tackle this crisis.<\/p>  <p>  Cr&iacute;ocnaigh m&eacute; &eacute; ar an uair a chuir t&uacute; amach.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121400009#H01300","speaker":"1330"},{"type":"speech","time":1481716200,"counter":76,"content":"<p>First, Deputy Adams has not read this document.  It is not ill-thought-out at all.  It is the result of intensive discussions, negotiations and presentations in recent months.  Some 500 submissions were sent to the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government and they have been very carefully scrutinised.  Of course, the starting point is the rental pressures in Cork and Dublin but that does not exclude other areas, and these are defined by sustained rental increases over a period that are above the national average.  The RTB is being given extra resources to enable it to define those and by February it will have an answer to those questions of where rental pressure zones should be endorsed by and sanctioned by the Minister.<\/p>  <p>  This year, 2016, 17,000 social housing units will be provided, not all new houses, but including returned voids, others that have been renovated and so on.  Deputy Adams' idea seems to be that he wants to shut down supply entirely.  He wants the Government to provide everything for everybody.  He wants to have a cap right across the country which would simply stifle progress entirely.  What is involved in this rental strategy is one of the five pillars of the comprehensive housing strategy provided by the Minister.  It presents the opportunity for tenants to understand that their tenancies can continue.  At the same time, it also ensures that there is a reasonable rate of return for private property let into the rental market and does not interfere with new houses or second-hand dwellings that are extensively renovated, even within rental pressure zones.<\/p>  <p>  The fundamental issue is a supply problem.  Due to the fact that the supply is not there, the rental situation has been exacerbated.  We understand and appreciate the great difficulty that thousands of people have in respect of increasing rents in tenancies.  That is why the Government is intervening here and is only doing so after very careful analysis of the conditions that should apply.  The Fianna F&aacute;il Party raised a number of issues and these are being discussed.  I hope this House will see fit to let this legislation through this week, which will benefit thousands of people who are tenants in houses and who have a legitimate fear of or concern about rent rising.  At the same time, it will not stultify supply of housing, as Deputy Adams would.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121400009#H01400","speaker":"1245"},{"type":"speech","time":1481716200,"counter":77,"content":"<p>The Taoiseach says that the supply of houses is not there.

It was staggering to hear of the increasing numbers the centre is feeding and it was heartbreaking to listen to the stories of individuals and families who are engaging with the centre.  We know the situation is worsening.  We also know of the difficulties facing those with a disability and in our health service.  We live in a very unequal society yet we live in the so-called developed world and can imagine what it is like for those living in the developing world.  A major driver of this inequality is the economic, financial and tax policies of governments.  What kind of society do we want to live in?  If we want a fairer more equal society then, strange as it may seem, we have to apply morality and ethics to taxes and finance.<\/p>  <p>  Last Monday, there was a very damning analysis in the report by Oxfam which puts Ireland in a list of 15 countries that are tax havens.  While the Minister for Finance is very dismissive of the report, we have to take it seriously and consider it.  Oxfam and other non-governmental organisations are highlighting tax injustice which has repercussions for our societies.  Tax injustice comes from businesses, multinationals and corporations avoiding and evading tax.  Over the past 30 years, the net profits posted by the world's largest companies more than tripled in real terms from &euro;2 trillion to &euro;7.2 trillion but that increase was not matched by a rise in corporate income tax returns.  If we are serious about eliminating poverty, we have to have an efficient, well thought out and fair tax system.  That means examining the taxing and profits of companies and large corporations because if we do that countries have more to invest in public services such as housing, education and health.  Developing countries are up to three times more vulnerable to the negative effects of our tax policies than are the rich countries.  It is calculated that they are losing $100 billion yearly as a result of this tax avoidance.  Our role and reputation on the sustainable development goals will be completely undermined unless we commit in real and practical terms to the principle of tax justice which means a fairer world for everyone.  <\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach gave a commitment to hold a conference and high level meeting on tax in early 2017.  I would like to see a real adequate space for tax justice with the voices of those active in this area, who see the effects of the tax policies of the developed world impacting on us and on the developing world.  There has to be an input from those tax justice people and a commitment to the principle of tax justice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121400010#J00800","speaker":"1291"},{"type":"speech","time":1481716800,"counter":86,"content":"<p>The report published by the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, yesterday showed that those on lowest incomes benefited most from the budget.

The Oxfam report includes Ireland's 12.5% rate as one of the factors in saying that this country is a tax haven.  I reject that and strongly refute this characterisation of our tax rate.  The 12.5% is fully in line with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, OECD, and international best practice in having a low rate and applying it to a very wide tax base.  The 12.5% rate is available only on trading profits where there is a substantial activity in Ireland and our corporate tax policies are designed to attract real and substantive operations to Ireland.  We have not been and never will be a brass plate location.  The Deputy is aware that we got rid of the stateless and the \"double Irish\" concepts.

On budget day the Minister for Finance published an update on Ireland's international tax strategy which highlights our continuing efforts in this regard.

Deputy O'Sullivan quite rightly refers to the need for tax justice.  Another way to look at this might be enlightened self-interest in that if we do our bit for global taxation, it will make for a stronger reputation for Ireland and a stronger investment in Ireland.  As the Taoiseach knows, Oxfam has ranked Ireland as the sixth-worst tax haven in the world.  It would be easy to dismiss Oxfam's report as unfair, misleading or alarmist.  However, it is not alone.  In 2013, Ireland was singled out as a tax haven by the US Senate committee on homeland security.  In 2015, the UN special rapporteur on extreme poverty reported that, when lists of tax havens are drawn up, Ireland is always prominent among them.  Just a few months ago, Brazil added Ireland to its list of tax havens.  I agree with the Taoiseach that Ireland is absolutely not a tax haven.  However, there is a growing international perception that we just might be.  That is damaging our international reputation, but it could do far worse.  Our international trade treaties are predicated on us not being a tax haven.<\/p>  <p>  Oxfam has levelled three charges at Ireland.  The first charge is that our corporation tax rate is too low.  With the greatest of respect to Oxfam, I would suggest that that is none of its business.  That is entirely within the competence of this country.  The second charge that Oxfam levels is that Ireland facilitates large-scale profit sharing.  Several years ago, that would have been a very reasonable charge.  However, I agree that considerable progress has been made in recent years.  The third charge that Oxfam levels at us is that we offer tax incentives to certain sectors that allows them to avoid paying tax.  On this point, unfortunately, Oxfam is absolutely on the money.<\/p>  <p>  In recent years, we have seen the creation of new suite of investment funds for property investors.  Some of the investors are domestic, but they are mainly foreign.  These include real estate investment trusts, qualified investment funds, Irish collective asset management vehicles, and now, most recently, Irish real estate funds.  Until a few years ago, property companies paid tax on their profits, just like other companies in Ireland.  Almost every OECD country applies that principle.  Ireland does not anymore.  Using these new vehicles, big foreign landlords can pay no tax in Ireland on massive profits.  Critically, they do not have to file publicly accessible accounts.  We do not know what level of taxes are being avoided, we do not know what profits are being offshored and we do not know what rulings these funds have received from the Revenue Commissioners.  What is worrying is that the OECD lists four criteria for tax havens, and in Ireland, foreign landlords now meet three of those four criteria.  I have two questions.  First, does the Taoiseach agree that property companies in Ireland should pay taxes on the profits they make in Ireland?  Second, does the Taoiseach agree that investment funds availing of tax avoidance mechanisms in this country should have to file publicly accessible accounts?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121400011#K00100","speaker":"1230"},{"type":"speech","time":1481717400,"counter":92,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Donnelly for his comments and question.  I acknowledge his assistance with the Finance Act and other matters, particularly with section 110, which the Deputy raised and to which some changes were made and brought about in this House.  I recall the comments that were made at the US Senate committee indicating that Ireland was alleged to be a tax haven.  That was later disproved and commented upon.  I am aware of the action taken by Brazil.  Ireland is not the first country that that has been applied to.  We reject that as well.  In respect of the Deputy's comments on the international trade treaties, corporation tax is a matter for each individual country.  National competence is enshrined in the European treaties.  The Deputy is right that this is Ireland's business.  In respect of the profit-sharing issue the Deputy raised, he also referred to the third charge which was about tax incentives to avoid paying tax.  There was an appeal lodged by the Attorney General on behalf of the Government in respect of a finding or ruling made by the European Commission in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  Irish collective asset management vehicles, or ICAVs, as they are called, are one of a range of legal structures which regulated collective investment schemes can take.  Others include investment limited partnerships, common contractual funds, unit trusts and investment companies.  Of these, only the investment companies are obliged to publish their accounts in accordance with the Companies Act.  ICAVs are still obliged to keep proper books of accounts that must be audited and be made available to persons who have a right to inspect the accounts, including the competent authorities for investment funds, which are the Central Bank of Ireland and the Revenue Commissioners.  Failure by the directors of an ICAV to ensure this happens is subject to very serious consequences, including the possibility of prosecution and administrative sanction.  I have also noticed that ICAVs are subject to additional layers of regulation that most other companies are not.  These are not only additional domestic rules but European rules that also apply to such structures under the requirements imposed by the undertaking for collective investment of transferable securities, UCITS, directive and the alternative investment fund managers, AIFM, directive.<\/p>  <p>  In the Finance Act, the Minister for Finance also made changes to the taxation of Irish funds that hold Irish real estate.  Irish real estate funds must deduct a 20% withholding tax or certain property distributions to non-resident investors.  The legislation there addresses the concerns raised regarding the use of fund vehicles to invest in Irish property.  The Finance Act also introduced legislation to address concerns that had been raised by Deputy Donnelly in respect of the section 110 regime whereby some investors minimise their Irish tax liabilities on Irish property transactions.  This will close off the unintended use of the section 110 regime for Irish property transactions.<\/p>  <p>  The Irish funds industry is obviously a key part of the internationally traded financial services sector, often referred to as the IFSC.  Some 12,500 people are employed directly and indirectly, both in Dublin and in a number of locations throughout the country.  There is some &euro;2 trillion of assets under the management of funds in Dublin.  The sector services a further &euro;2 trillion in assets domiciled elsewhere.  This area of IFSC remains by some margin its biggest sector of employment.  Clearly, the funds may be structured in different ways, as the Deputy has pointed out.

I acknowledge the very significant moves by the Government in the Finance Act on companies under section 110.  What is interesting about the Project Eagle accounts is that Cerberus has moved about half of the assets out of section 110, because section 110 companies have to file publicly accessible accounts.  The only reason vulture funds were shut down was because Deputies in this House, journalists and Senators were able to see them and raise this issue.  They could not hide the amount of tax that was being avoided.  However, about half of what came under section 110, hundreds of millions of pounds of assets, has been moved out of it.

That legislation will ensure the Irish tax base is appropriately protected, where Irish funds are used to hold Irish real estate.  The key feature, as the Deputy knows, is that an IREF is a fund in which 25% or more of the value of the fund is made up of Irish real estate assets.  Any rental income or development profits earned by that IREF will be included in the calculation of its profits.<\/p><p>Capital gains will be included in the calculation of profits unless the asset is held for five years or more, except where the investor can influence or control the IRF.  Where an IRF makes a distribution, non-resident investors will be subject to a withholding tax of 20%.<\/p> <p> I am not saying that everything has been done here in terms of dealing with the issues that Deputy Donnelly raises.  I do not have the details regarding Cerberus, as mentioned by him.

To implement these commitments, however, there must be a full quota of nursing staff.  Today there are 3,500 fewer nurses employed by the HSE than in 2009.  There are shortages in most specialised areas.  The HSE is spending &euro;1.2 million on agency nurses per week instead of making real efforts to fill the vacant positions.  There are no real incentives to attract Irish nurses home to work in Irish hospitals.  In the past two to three years, up to 20,000 Irish nurses applied for certificates to work abroad.  This in an alarming reality in our health service today.<\/p>  <p>  Nurses are working overtime, are not being replaced when on leave and are expected constantly to meet increased demands with fewer staff.  The Government and the HSE seem detached from this and are not tackling the issue.  Last August a report was prepared on the crisis in emergency departments.  It recommended recruiting 200 additional nurses to cope with the extra patients in emergency departments who were waiting for admission, but not one nurse has been recruited.  The Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, will launch the HSE service plan today which will read like a work of fiction unless practical measures are taken to address what is, by any yardstick, a substantial manpower crisis in our health service, particularly in nursing where there is an acute shortage.  That shortage is now impacting on the quality of care and the delivery of services to patients.  It is quite staggering.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121400012#L00600","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1481718000,"counter":104,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Martin for his question.

The HSE has recruited 500 staff for each of the past two months and before that.  Of the most recent 500, 160 were nurses, 180 were community therapists and professional health care workers and 73 were medical posts.  We have difficulties in some areas because of viruses and other illnesses which have led to a shortage of staff.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome that the HSE announced today that it will host a further open recruitment event on 28, 29 and 30 of this month for nurses and midwives from all disciplines who are interested in working in the Irish health service.  This will target nurses returning home for Christmas.  There will be walk-in interviews on each day.  This will be the first in a series of career day events for nurses throughout 2017.  The Deputy will also be aware that the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, restored the incremental credits to trainee nurses.  When they emerge from training, they are offered permanent jobs.  Recruitment is a challenge, admittedly.

The Taoiseach will recall that the previous administration established a regulator for the national lottery.  Part of the thought process at that time was that, in time, the lottery regulator might well become the gambling regulator.  We need to have an authoritative body with strong legislative powers to deal with gambling and especially the growing propensity of people to gamble incredible amounts of money online.

It is surprising, therefore, that we do not have a fixed date for the commemoration to honour the victims of the Great Irish Famine and its survivors.<\/p><p>The Irish Famine poses an uncomfortable stain on the legacy of British imperialism.  While the potato blight was a natural aberration, Ireland's people, who were utterly subjugated and whose land and resources were mercilessly exploited, were incredibly vulnerable and suffered far more than any other people who suffered famines in Europe at the time.  The scars of the Famine are still visible throughout the countryside, physically in the ruined cottages and on lonely ridges where the blighted potatoes were left unpicked.<\/p><p>However, the lasting consequences of the Great Hunger was the massive depopulation of this country where more than 1 million people died and a million people were forced to emigrate.  These are conservative estimates.  This country has still not returned to its pre-Famine population level.  It is estimated that halfway through the 19th century 9 million lived on the island of Ireland.  By 1861, this had fallen to 4.4 million.  That population decrease continued until the 1960s.<br\/><br\/>The legacy of emigration still exists.  The sad fact is, because of the start of emigration during the Famine, we still have emigration as a defining characteristic of the Irish population and we still see its effects in rural areas today.<br\/><br\/>The language shift from Irish to English was compounded by the Famine, and those who lived throughout the Famine knew that if they had to go to America or to England, they would have to use the English language to survive.  That language shift was enhanced by that brutal pragmatism forced by the Famine at the time.<br\/><br\/>The dearth of Irish poetry and music from the era will testify to the utter horror that befell the Irish people.  The following is an extract from one of the few songs that exists from this time, &quot;Amhr&aacute;n na bPr&aacute;ta&iacute; Dubha&quot;, written by M&aacute;ire N&iacute; Dhroma when the worst effects hit Ring in Waterford:<\/p><blockquote>T&aacute; na bochta so &Eacute;ireann ag pl&eacute; leis an ainnise,<br \/><br \/>Buairt is anacair is pianta b&aacute;is,<br \/><br \/>Leana&iacute; bochta ag b&eacute;iceadh is ag screadadh gach maidin,<br \/><br \/>Ocras fada orthu is gan dada le f&aacute;il.<br \/><br \/>N&iacute; h&eacute; Dia a cheap riamh an obair seo,<br \/><br \/>Daoine bochta a chur le fuacht is le f&aacute;n,<br \/><br \/>Iad a chur sa phoorhouse go dubhach is glas orthu,<br \/><br \/>L&aacute;n&uacute;ineacha p&oacute;sta is iad scartha go b&aacute;s.<br \/><br \/>Na leana&iacute; &oacute;ga th&oacute;gfaid&iacute;s suas le macnas<br \/><br \/>Sciobta&iacute; uathu iad gan trua gan taise dh&oacute;ibh:<br \/><br \/>Ar bheag&aacute;n l&oacute;in ach s&uacute;p na hainnise<br \/><br \/>Gan m&aacute;thair le freagairt d&iacute;bh d&aacute; bhfaighid&iacute;s b&aacute;s.<\/blockquote><p>The response to the Famine by England was at best indifferent and at worst utterly inhumane.  Public works were established in order that the impoverished and weakened men would labour at building useless roads, follies and other pointless projects for pitiful sums of money.  Irish ports did not close during the Famine for exports and it is a matter of historical fact that millions of pounds worth of Irish food, including grain and even butter, were sent for export while hundreds of thousands were literally left starving to death.  I am not deliberately being emotive on this issue.  These are matters of fact.  While myths abound with regards to the Great Hunger and how it could happen under Britain's watch, some have speculated that it was an attempt at depopulation or a manner to quell dissent by the obliteration of the poorest cottier class.  No doubt the Famine painfully impressed upon the generation of O'Donovan Rossa that self-determination was a matter of life and death.<br\/><br\/>We need a fixed memorial day to remember the Great Irish Famine, to remember the human cost and consequences of neglect, to remember the effects when an economic imperative is prioritised and to recognise the dark shadows of colonial might.  Most of all, a fixed day of remembrance would honour those victims and survivors of the Great Famine and allow us to remember what our ancestors lived through.<br\/><br\/>It is an Irish tragedy, but with global significance.  There is a plaque on the Dublin Mansion House honouring the Native American Choctaw tribe who contributed so generously to the Famine victims.  It reads: &quot;Their humanity calls us to remember the millions of human beings throughout our world today who die of hunger and hunger related illness in a world of plenty.&quot;  There are 800 million such people around the world today.  Let us fix this day of national commemoration in order that we can remember those who suffer today, as those in this country did once.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121400013#M03400","speaker":"1235","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1481719200,"counter":144,"content":"<p>Is the Bill opposed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121400014#N00400","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1481719200,"counter":145,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121400014#N00500","speaker":"1338"},{"type":"speech","time":1481719200,"counter":146,"content":"<p>It is not being opposed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121400014#N00600","speaker":"1245"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1481719200,"counter":147,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1481719200,"counter":148,"content":"<p>Since this is a Private Members' Bill, Second Stage must, under Standing Orders, be taken in Private Members' time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121400014#N00800","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1481719200,"counter":149,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be taken in Private Members' time.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121400014#N00900","speaker":"1235"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1481719200,"counter":150,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1481719200,"counter":151,"content":"<p>Before we move to the next Bill, I take the opportunity chun f&aacute;ilte a chur roimh iadsan as Col&aacute;iste Loreto i mBaile na nGall&oacute;glach i nD&uacute;n na nGall.

To broaden choice and rights, Fianna F&aacute;il seeks an end to compulsory retirement of persons at the age of 65, whether in the public or the private sectors, and to make it unlawful to require a person to retire at or above the age of 65 unless there are clearly specified grounds justifying such compulsory retirement, such as competence and performance.<\/p><p>Fianna F&aacute;il believes that we should do what we can to recognise the potential of our ageing population to contribute to and enrich our society in many diverse ways given their talents, experience and wisdom and the many years of healthy life expectancy which, happily, most can enjoy.

It is extremely important that one sees a sense of urgency from the European leadership at the European Council meeting about the crisis and the role of Russia in Aleppo.  What is taking place is incomprehensible.  It is also instructive that Russia is seeking to withdraw from the International Criminal Court.  The sole reason, of course, is to avoid being accountable to the only international body capable of holding people responsible for war crimes.  The blanket bombing of hospitals and humanitarian convoys and the extraordinary scenes this morning of children being brought out by their parents and families, one of the children with an intravenous, IV, drip still attached, are harrowing, and there is a sense that the world is turning a blind eye.

Does the Taoiseach regret the very hard line the EPP has pushed not just in countries such as Ireland but also in Italy?  Italy is one of the largest economies in the European Union.  The efforts of its previous government to create a situation where, for example, it could avail of Mr. Juncker's plan to have a public investment programme basically foundered on the rocks of EPP intransigence, and particularly the intransigent attitude of Chancellor Merkel and the German Minister of Finance, Mr. Sch&auml;uble.  Now Italy, one of the core European countries, is facing an unknown future of populist politics.  We have seen what happened with Mr. Trump in the United States and with other issues in different countries.  The Taoiseach is a prominent member of the EPP and is one of the longest-surviving Prime Ministers in that group.  However, the EPP appears to be hell-bent on destroying the concept of a European Union based on solidarity, economic progress and supporting countries when they encounter difficulties.  Has he had discussions on the future of the three large and prominent Italian banks, which are now in dire circumstances?  There are issues with the bail-in.  Unlike the debates in this House previously, the slogan now from many of the ultras is to save the bondholders, particularly the junior bondholders, because so many of them are ordinary Italian savers.

When the Taoiseach's contribution is included, it means that we have two minutes each.  That does not work.  I appreciate that this new way of doing business means we are dealing with topical issues but we do not have sufficient time to listen to the Taoiseach's response because he does not have sufficient time to deliver it or to elaborate on issues.<\/p> <p> In moving on to my questions, I ask the Leas-Cheann Comhairle to be indulgent with me.  We will be having pre-European Council meeting statements later.  Llike the Taoiseach, I want to raise a few issues at the next European Council meeting, the first of which is the case of Ibrahim Halawa.  Yesterday was Mr. Halawa's 21st birthday.  We should send very hearty belated birthday solidarity greetings to him, l&aacute; breithe shona duit.  Yesterday was the 17th time his trial has been postponed.  I know the Ceann Comhairle is leading a delegation, of which we will be a part, and we support that.  However, I note the President of the European Parliament, Martin Schulz, has written to the Egyptian President to express his concern about the case.  I ask the Taoiseach not only to raise it at the Council meeting but to seek in advance the support of other EU Heads of State to ensure Ibrahim's release.<\/p> <p> The situation in Syria in general and in Aleppo is shameful.  It is desperate to sit watching this on our television screens in our living rooms.  The claim by the Russian enjoy to the UN that no one is going to harm the civilians is incredible.  It is unbelievable.  This siege has been a shameful episode in international politics and we should be firm in our opposition to all the forces, the Russians, the French and the Americans.  Any forces that are operating there should not be doing so.  We need a political solution.  I again ask the Taoiseach to raise this issue.  There is an opportunity to do something positive in the middle of all the horror. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121400015#O01700","speaker":"1330","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1481720400,"counter":187,"content":"<p>I agree with the Deputy that this is not satisfactory.

I submitted the letter in respect of the digital single market, which has been going on now for 30 years, and with which we need to deal.  On the question of whether the EU-27 member states can meet legally, it is not the European Council that is meeting, rather it is 27 members of the European Council.  The 27 are meeting informally and not as the European Council of 28 members because Britain is still a full member until it leaves.<\/p>  <p>  I agree with Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin that what is happening in Aleppo is savagery beyond contemplation.  I am not sure, given all the discussions we have had at European Council meetings all over the world, in Geneva and everywhere else, whether the issue here relates to whether the United Nations, as a world body, should be reformed and perhaps given greater influence to intervene.  This is a complex operation in the context of Russia being supported by Iran and Hezbollah supporting Assad.  Aleppo has been the scene of humanitarian crimes and war crimes, and I strongly believe we should and will prosecute where possible in that regard.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Burton made an extraordinary assertion that because the European People's Party took a very strong line, Italy decided to vote against a referendum on the Senate.  That was a constitutional issue, not a verdict on the European Union.  While I am very much acquainted with the former Prime Minister, Matteo Renzi, and supported him on many of his issues, clearly, there were other reasons the Italian electorate decided to vote down the referendum.  Mr. Gentiloni comes from the same stock as Matteo Renzi and has set out to place a very steady hand on the tiller.  I would point out to the Deputy that in Austria the people - at the second attempt - voted for an independent Green candidate, that the Government of the Netherlands lost a vote on a referendum on Ukraine, that Spain had two elections before it could form a government and that Britain has its own result on Brexit, which I respect.  Therefore, the Deputy cannot say that the European People's Party is responsible for the demise of Italy.  I would be the first to say that in terms of the recession that occurred in the European Union, the European Central Bank might have acted differently in the context of what happened in America.  However, we have moved from that point to where we are now.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Adams commented on matters that I support in the context of the horrific scenes we have seen in Aleppo, with men, women and children being butchered in a savage fashion in 2016.

The primary focus of the visit was to emphasise and promote Ireland&rsquo;s attractiveness as a location for investment and trade and to communicate Ireland&rsquo;s priorities in the context of Brexit and other recent significant international developments.<\/p>  <p>  In Palo Alto, I spoke at a reception attended by approximately 250 Enterprise Ireland clients and representatives from the west coast business community.  I used that opportunity to promote Ireland as a source for world leading information technology products and services, referencing the success of many Irish companies both in the Silicon Valley region and across the United States.  I emphasised Ireland&rsquo;s attractiveness as a location for US firms and delivered key messages about Ireland&rsquo;s economic progress and the importance of immigration reform.  I also met representatives of a number of Enterprise Ireland clients who were exhibiting their products at the event.<\/p>  <p>  I also met that afternoon with George and Jackie Donohoe, whose daughter, Ashley, and niece, Olivia, lost their lives in the Berkeley tragedy in June 2015.  Also present was Celine Kennelly, executive director of the Irish Immigration Pastoral Center.  In advance of my first visit to the region since the tragedy occurred, I also met the Irish-based families of those who were killed and injured in the tragedy, including some of the injured themselves, in Government Buildings on 24 November.  In renewing my condolences, I expressed my admiration for the work the family had done in driving Senate Bill 465.  I assured them that the Government would continue to do what it could to support improvements in US building regulations in order in order to prevent such a tragedy ever occurring again.  I paid particular tribute to consul general Philip Grant for the way he conducted his business on behalf of our country arising from that tragedy in Berkeley.<\/p>  <p>  On Thursday, 1 December, I visited Apple Headquarters where I met Tim Cook, the chief executive officer, along with a number of other senior Apple executives.  We discussed the company&rsquo;s substantial investment in Ireland.  Mr. Cook highlighted Apple's ongoing commitment to Ireland, including the company's current expansion plans, noting that it is on target to create 1,000 additional jobs here.  We had a brief discussion regarding the European Commission&rsquo;s decision on the Apple state aid investigation.  I noted that Ireland had already submitted a very strong appeal to the General Court of the European Union.  Mr. Cook noted the company&rsquo;s intention to lodge its own appeal in due course.  The remainder of our discussion focused on global political developments and policy challenges, including Brexit.<\/p>  <p>  Following this, I addressed the San Francisco Bay Area Economic Council, an influential group of leading Bay Area companies, which was hosted by Facebook at its headquarters.  I used this opportunity to underline the strength of both Ireland-US relations and Ireland-California relations.  I updated the council on Ireland&rsquo;s economic progress, reiterated Ireland&rsquo;s attractiveness as a location for investment, highlighted our highly skilled workforce and our focus on innovation and our strong commitment to EU membership.  While at Facebook I also took the opportunity to meet some of Facebook&rsquo;s many Irish staff working there.<\/p>  <p>  I travelled to New York where on Friday, 2 December I had a series of business engagements, including individual meetings with existing and potential investors in Ireland.  Once again, I used these opportunities to promote Ireland&rsquo;s attractiveness as a location for foreign direct investment and emphasised our firm commitment to EU membership.<\/p>  <p>  I had a series of engagements at Bloomberg, including a meeting with Bloomberg chairman, Peter Grauer, and a number of their client companies, a live broadcast interview and a meeting with the chief executive officer, Mike Bloomberg.  Discussions covered a wide range of topics, including Brexit, the future of the EU, the implications of the US election, international taxation, globalisation, the rise of populism and Northern Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  I also attended a Partnership for New York City event where I met and spoke to a group of approximately 30 leading New York business people on broadly similar topics to those covered at the Bloomberg events earlier, including Brexit, the US election, the future of the EU, corporation tax, the investment climate and foreign direct investment opportunities in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  Later that day, I was also glad to participate in the announcement of a strategic partnership between Enterprise Ireland and Northwell Healthcare, one of the leading health care providers on the east coast of America.<\/p><p>This partnership is expected to result in significant opportunities for Irish companies in the US health care sector.<\/p> <p> That evening I attended a reception attended by approximately 300 Irish-American political, business and community leaders, including immigration reform bodies, hosted by the Consul General, Barbara Jones, at the Irish Consulate in New York.  In my address, I spoke about Ireland&rsquo;s economic progress, Ireland-US relations, the challenges and opportunities arising from Brexit, the Government&rsquo;s ongoing commitment to the Northern Ireland peace process and immigration reform.  I also spoke about Ireland&rsquo;s successful programme of 1916 commemorations.  I emphasised the Government&rsquo;s commitment to culture and heritage and was pleased to announce an additional &euro;1 million in funding from the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs for the Irish Arts Center and $265,000 from the immigrant support programme for the Irish Repertory Theatre.  I was also pleased to be able to announce the granting by the US Department of Transportation of a permit to Norwegian Air, which will facilitate new direct flights between Ireland and the USA.<\/p> <p> As the focus of my trip was engagement with business leaders, I did not have detailed political discussions on immigration reform or the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, TTIP, during this visit.  However, as I previously indicated, I raised immigration reform and our economic and trading interests with both President-elect Trump and Vice President-elect Pence during my phone calls with them following the US elections.<\/p> <p> I believe my visit was successful in further developing the strong links between Ireland and the United States as well as promoting Ireland&rsquo;s priorities in the context of Brexit and other global developments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121400016#P01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1245","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1481721000,"counter":207,"content":"<p>There are eight minutes left to this question and five Members offering.

In terms of the discussions with Prime Minister Muscat, the Syrian situation, which has now worsened, is an unfolding human tragedy that is now becoming indescribable even for people who are there.  Malta is in the heart of the migration crisis, although many of the people who are coming across the Mediterranean are actually not from the Syrian crisis.  They are coming mainly from the horn of Africa and sub-Saharan Africa.  These are real issues we need to address.

I will take the point the Deputies raised in a different forum.<\/p><p>Deputy Brendan Howlin raised the question of sub-Saharan Africa.

People from Egypt are beginning to cross the Mediterranean, which is also a source of serious concern in addition to the people coming from Mali, the Horn of Africa and Libya.Europe is working with five African countries on compacts.  The aim is to work with them to give people an opportunity to have a life, a career and economic opportunities.  If the population of Africa doubles over the next 25 years, the explosion in migration could be very serious.  Europe, working with countries in their home place, may have a better impact than having to deal with serious numbers of migrants later.<\/p><p>I hope the explanation I gave to Prime Minister Muscat and others results in their being fully <i>au fait<\/i>with the circumstances that apply in Ireland regarding the Border, the peace process, which everyone supports, and what we need for it in the future.

The agenda includes a discussion of the current migration situation; security; a range of economic and social development issues including youth; and external relations, specifically the Dutch ratification of the EU association agreement with Ukraine and the situation in Syria.  Russia is also likely to be discussed.  I have asked the Minister of State, Deputy Breen, to address the foreign policy issues in his closing remarks.<\/p>  <p>  The December European Council will be followed by a separate meeting of the 27 Heads of State and Government, without Prime Minister May.  This will be the first opportunity since June for a substantial discussion in this format about Brexit and our plans for what lies ahead.  Ireland, as we all know, stands to be most affected by the UK's withdrawal from the EU and that issue is discussed regularly in the House.  The meeting in Brussels on Thursday evening is likely to focus on the mechanics and timing of the negotiations from the EU perspective.<\/p>  <p>  In June, the 27 Heads of State and Government agreed that the European Council will provide overall political guidance for the negotiations and that the Commission will lead on the technical discussions.  As Deputies will recall from previous discussions in the House, Mr. Michel Barnier, the head of the Commission task force on Brexit, visited Ireland in November.  He and his team are very aware of our concerns arising from Brexit, including regarding Northern Ireland, the peace process, the common travel area and our deeply entwined economic and trade links with the UK.  There has been good ongoing engagement on these issues at official level.<\/p>  <p>  I expect tomorrow night&rsquo;s discussion to touch upon the process whereby the European Council&rsquo;s guidelines for the negotiations will be agreed once the UK has triggered Article 50.  This will allow for an orderly commencement of the negotiations.  Our discussions tomorrow are also likely to restate the principles we agreed in June, namely, that there can be no negotiation without notification, that the UK remains a member of the EU with all the responsibilities that implies, and that the Single Market and four fundamental freedoms are indivisible.  I do not anticipate a detailed discussion about the future of Europe, otherwise known as the Bratislava process.  This will be the focus of discussions at a separate meeting of the 27 in Malta in February, before the process concludes in March to coincide with the 60th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome.<\/p>  <p>  The European Council will begin earlier than usual at 12.30 p.m. with a meeting with President of the European Parliament, Martin Schulz.  There will then be a short update from Slovakia's Prime Minister, Robert Fico, on the implementation of decisions of the European Council.  The President of Cyprus is also expected to provide an update on developments in his country's ongoing reunification talks.<\/p>  <p>  Turning to the agenda, Heads of State and Government will begin by returning to the migration and refugee situation which is still very much a priority for the EU.<\/p><p>The Commission is expected to give an update on progress on a range of EU measures, including relocation and resettlement, the EU-Turkey statement and the partnership frameworks or &quot;migration compacts&quot; with third countries.  A discussion is also expected on reform of the common European asylum system.  Many of the EU measures are having a positive impact.  The number of people attempting to cross the Aegean has reduced substantially since the EU-Turkey statement was agreed in March, and this is to be welcomed.  Estimates from the International Organization for Migration show that there were more than 865,000 arrivals during the eight months before the EU-Turkey statement and a little more than 22,800 during the eight months thereafter.  However, other routes remain extremely dangerous, and far too many people are still risking their lives attempting to travel to Europe.<br\/><br\/>The migration compacts aim to ensure coherence between EU migration policy and its external and development policies.  These were discussed at the October European Council.  Overall, we welcome the development of the migration compacts and their focus on working even more closely with countries of origin and transit as well as with countries hosting large numbers of displaced people.  We support efforts to build on existing progress and policies.  The first countries the compacts are being developed with are in Africa, and Ireland is supportive of the intention to make swift progress on the external investment plan in order to boost investments and job creation in these partner countries.<br\/><br\/>Although we are far less exposed to the full force of the migration and refugee crisis because of our geographical location and our non-participation in certain justice and home affairs measures, we continue to contribute to the EU response.  As the House knows, the Government decided voluntarily to opt into measures and take in up to 4,000 persons in need of international protection under the resettlement and relocation programmes.  There has been a good response to resettlement, that is, taking people from outside the Union.  To date, 507 people have arrived in Ireland, mostly from Lebanon, and we are almost on course to meet our target of 520 by the end of the year.<br\/><br\/>On relocation, that is, taking migrants who have already arrived in Greece and Italy, progress has been slow.  There have been some positive developments recently and 109 people have now come to Ireland from Greece.  The T&aacute;naiste and the Minister, Deputy Zappone, visited Greece this week.  Arrangements are being made for more people to start coming here, and it is expected that there will be a further intake before the end of 2016.  Thereafter, the plan is to increase the pace and receive up to 1,100 people by September of next year.<br\/><br\/>We have provided &euro;42 million in response to the crisis in Syria since 2011 and we now pledge to bring this to &euro;62 million by the end of the year.<br\/><br\/>Over the course of 2015 and 2016, Irish naval vessels have rescued 15,621 migrants in the Mediterranean.  <i>LE Samuel Beckett<\/i>concluded operations on 5 December.  On behalf of every Deputy and the people of Ireland, I commend the exemplary service of our naval personnel and thank them for their courage and professionalism.  Consideration of a further deployment in 2017 will take into account a number of factors, including the ongoing situation in the Mediterranean, the overall EU response, the demands on the Defence Forces, overseas commitments and available resources.<br\/><br\/>Regarding security, the European Council will consider the implementation of the EU global strategy, the Commission's Communication on a European Defence Action Plan and EU-NATO co-operation.<br\/><br\/>These issues are of keen interest to the Irish people.  We have a proud tradition, upheld by Governments from all sides of this House over many years, of military neutrality and non-participation in military alliances.  This is subject to constitutional provisions and is protected in the treaties of the European Union.  All of us intend to preserve this.<br\/><br\/>Tomorrow, the EU Heads of State and Government will hear from the Secretary General of NATO, Jens Stoltenberg, before considering the matter of EU-NATO co-operation.  This follows the statement on co-operation agreed in June, which took on board Ireland's specific concerns.  Similarly, the EU global strategy reflects some of Ireland's key concerns.  It commits the EU to promoting peace, prosperity, democracy and the rule of law.  It has a positive focus on the Middle East peace process, disarmament, gender, the UN and the importance of multilateralism more generally.  The strategy recognises the need to invest more in conflict resolution and tackle the root causes of instability.  This involves using a mix of EU policies coherently to support international peace and economic development and help build state and societal capacity on governance, rule of law and human rights.<br\/><br\/>The Commission's Communication on a Defence Action Plan was published at the end of November.  It examines how European industry can provide the capabilities required for the EU's peacekeeping and crisis management activities and ensure more effective and responsive common security and defence policy, CSDP, missions.  We will consider these proposals very carefully.  The EU common security and defence policy is an integral part of the Union's common foreign and security policy.  It provides the Union with an operational capacity to undertake missions outside the EU for peacekeeping, conflict prevention and strengthening international security in accordance with the principles of the UN Charter.  Our approach has been constructive and realistic.  We are a strong supporter of initiatives, through the CSDP, which improve the capacity of the Union to contribute to international peace and security, particularly in support of the UN.  We support co-operation with international partners where this adds value and contributes to the achievement of these objectives.<br\/><br\/>The follow-up to the EU-NATO joint declaration made in Warsaw, the implementation of the EU global strategy and the proposals in the defence action plan have no implications for Ireland's neutrality.<br\/><br\/>The European Council will also look at a number of issues under the heading of economic and social development and youth including the European Fund for Strategic Investments; energy union; the Youth Guarantee, the youth employment initiative and European Solidarity Corps; and, most importantly, the Single Market and Digital Single Market.<br\/><br\/>The Council will welcome last week's agreement by Finance Ministers to strengthen and extend the European Fund for Strategic Investments, and hopefully negotiations with the European Parliament can now be concluded quickly.  While the impact of EFSI in Ireland remains modest at this point, we support strongly the further development of what is a key building block of the investment plan for Europe.  The new Dublin office of the EIB, which I opened last Friday, should also provide further complementary support for project development in Ireland, building from the experience gained in tackling investment bottlenecks across Europe.  The role of an enhanced EFSI in mobilising a stronger pipeline of SME finance will be very significant for Ireland, including in the context of the unique challenges we face on foot of the UK decision to leave the EU.  More generally, we are not yet in Ireland at the vanguard in deploying EIB financial instruments to tackle investment bottlenecks.  I want to see us make much better use of the enhanced lending volumes and risk capacity now available to the EIB, including through next year's mid-term review of the capital plan.  I expect this to be quite significant.<br\/><br\/>We also have a keen interest in fighting youth unemployment and are supportive of the proposals in this regard.<br\/><br\/>We welcome the renewed commitment on energy union to promote energy efficiency actively as the most important means of achieving our shared climate and energy goals.<br\/><br\/>There will also be consideration of Single Market and Digital Single Market issues.  I have spoken many times in this House on the priority we attach to completing this and the advantages for all of us in properly establishing the Digital Single Market.  We have been active in generating support for an ambitious approach by the Commission.  The Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation co-signed a letter last month highlighting the need for decisive action on services.  I am leading an initiative in respect of the Digital Single Market in advance of this week's meeting and will be joined by 15 member states in my letter to President Tusk reaffirming the importance of maintaining strong political momentum in this regard.  This work builds on that of the Minister of State, Deputy Dara Murphy, in co-ordinating a core group of digitally advanced countries.<br\/><br\/>I will leave the Minister of State, Deputy Breen, to respond to the debate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121400019#S01000","speaker":"1245","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1481722800,"counter":248,"content":"<p>This week's summit has a wide agenda but few substantive decisions to consider.  It is more a summit about reflecting on problems than tackling them.  Part of this is inevitable because of the state of uncertainty which the European Union will be in until there is some idea about what future relations with the United Kingdom will look like.  Beyond this important fact, there is unfortunately also the reality of other issues being allowed to drift because of division and a lack of solidarity.<\/p>  <p>  The first item on the agenda is the ongoing migration crisis in the Mediterranean.  Monday night's documentary was a powerful reminder that our absolute priority must be the humanitarian duty to help those desperately in need.  In \"The Crossing\" we all saw the magnificent work of members of our Naval Service.  We should be immensely proud of them and their continuing the tradition of &Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann in representing us all as part of an international community.  Having helped more than 15,000 people, their mission is clearly an absolutely essential one which we must continue to support.  Every one of the people helped has a personal story of why they would undertake such a dangerous and desperate journey.  There is no single cause of this migration and there is no single answer to it.  Fundamentally, though, there is a common thread of escaping danger or intractable poverty.  Different types of repression, including rising fundamentalism, are bringing different societies beyond crisis point.  Europe does not realistically have the capacity or the resources to provide the stability and opportunity which these societies need.  However, there is much more it can do.  Currently, Syria's development aid is limited and we have no strategy equal to the scale of the challenge.  More and more resources are being directed to managing the impact of migration and relatively little to addressing the core causes.<\/p><p>It is long past time for a more urgent and ambitious strategy to deal with the causes of large-scale migration on the southern and eastern Mediterranean.  We cannot realistically have a policy of no control of migration but we can and should have a more generous approach to help those who may believe that leaving their homes is their only option.  In north Africa, the current development agreements are small and not fit for purpose.  What we need is effectively a Marshall aid plan for north Africa but what we have is little more than a sticking plaster.<\/p> <p> The situation in respect of Syrian refugees is even more serious because the entire crisis is directly caused by the actions of certain states.  We are nowhere near providing refugees with the basic facilities required for camps in the region.  Without these, they will continue to seek refuge elsewhere.  The people of Syria want to live in their own communities in peace and freedom.  They are not what are termed \"economic migrants\".  They are refugees from a cruel and still-escalating conflict.  The root of this conflict is a regime that will not recognise the human rights of the Syrian people and a world power which has decided that it must use its extraordinary military muscle to defend non-democratic regimes.<\/p> <p> ISIS is a barbaric group which has waged genocidal war against Christians and many Muslim groups in the region.  It has no legitimacy and defeating the group should be a focus for international co-operation.  However, one country has decided that its priority should be to aid the Syrian regime to destroy democratic opposition and to terrorise millions of people into submission.  ISIS is not in Aleppo, yet large sections of that city have been blanket bombed with critical civilian infrastructure, such as hospitals, repeatedly and deliberately targeted.  It is a sad reflection on current realities that many parties and politicians in different countries are eager to turn a blind eye to this.  If they react at all, it is to try to down play specific responsibility and to search for the quickest way to return to the anti-western rhetoric which is their core business.<\/p> <p> We should note Russia's stated intention to withdraw from the International Criminal Court.  The reason is to avoid being accountable to the only international body capable of holding people responsible for war crimes.  The fact that Ireland is the only country in the world which has written co-operation with the ICC into its constitution is something of which we should be proud and we should be a voice defending the role of the court.  Syria is part of the wider crisis in relations with Russia and therefore part of what has to be discussed at this summit.  We should be alarmed at the current push by some countries to legitimise what can only be described as constant aggression by Russia.<\/p> <p> Let us be clear about what is going on.  For a number of years Russia has seen its interest in undermining public faith in democracy as a system.  It has been an active supporter of extreme right and left parties in many European countries.  For example, it has close ties to the neo-Nazi Jobbik party in Hungary, the Freedom Party of Austria and the Golden Dawn party in Greece.  It has provided an acknowledged loan of &euro;9 million to support the sinister National Front party in France.  Nigel Farage has long played a starring role in the Russian state-controlled media.  On the far left, many parties are directly linked with Russia, including the communist parties in Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s European Parliament group, while many more politicians are at the least fellow travellers.  The coalition of interest between the far right and far left is, as it has always been, directed against the democratic centre.  We can see this in the non-stop attempt to avoid criticising Russian actions and claims that this is really the fault of others.  The recent campaign to support Mr. Trump by undermining his opponent for president should cause us all to stop for a moment and consider the scale of the threat now being targeted against democracy.  I find it incredible that we can hear voices in this House raging angrily against Mr. Trump but remaining silent on the undeniable campaign to assist him.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121400020#T00200","speaker":"1224","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1481723400,"counter":250,"content":"<p>He is supported by Russia.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121400021#U00200","speaker":"1308"},{"type":"speech","time":1481723400,"counter":251,"content":"<p>If that does not represent hypocrisy and double standards, then I do not know what does.  The situation in Ukraine will be discussed tomorrow.  The attempt by some to lift sanctions and basically allow Russia to bear no responsibility for its actions must be opposed by Ireland.  What clearer signal to a return to the 1930s could there be than to allow a large and aggressive country to get away with annexing territory.  At a recent meeting of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade, some Deputies made it clear to the Russian ambassador that we are not willing to sit quietly as these actions continue.  The chairman, Deputy Brendan Smith, ensured that this was a forum where the lies and disinformation would be challenged.  I note the contributions of Deputy Se&aacute;n Barrett and Senator Ivana Bacik.  In contrast, once again, Sinn F&eacute;in has shown that it will not defend a country that has been invaded and partitioned by a neighbour.  Deputy Crowe said that the European Union and the United States were equally to blame for Russia's actions, something Deputy Adams did not feel the need to repeat on his recent fundraising trip to America.  The closest Deputy Crowe could come to challenging Russia was to say that the travesty of a so-called referendum in Crimea was not in line with good democratic norms.  It seems that Sinn F&eacute;in is now trying to present the situation in Crimea as an act of self-determination rather than the invasion and partition which is was in reality.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121400021#U00300","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1481723400,"counter":252,"content":"<p>Deputy Martin should have repeated the rest of my comments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121400021#U00400","speaker":"1309"},{"type":"speech","time":1481723400,"counter":253,"content":"<p>Let us all note that today there are prisoners in Russian jails whose only crime was to fly a Ukrainian flag.  The Tarter minority organisations and media have been systematically repressed.  There are no political or media freedoms in Crimea.  The separate identity of the region is being destroyed.  There can be no normalisation or lifting of sanctions while Russia maintains this aggression and the policy of promoting separatism in eastern Ukraine.<\/p>  <p>  Separately, it is obvious that we need to dramatically step up procedures for protection democratic processes in Europe.  We have been given a warning and we must act.  I do not see this as being linked to the scheduled discussion on security and defence at the summit.  Co-operation on civil protection and policing is welcome and its expansion is delivering real benefits for all countries.  However, there is no compelling reason to change provisions concerning defence and external security.  Exiting treaties provide a strong enough basis for action while still respecting the different traditions of a number of member states, including Ireland.  The provisions are in place for co-operation based on the principles of solidarity and defence of core democratic values.  We do not need another military alliance and we do not need to waste time which could be usefully spent on other more needed reforms to the operations of the Union.<\/p>  <p>  The discussions on Brexit will be informal and it is not clear that anything substantive will be considered.  It appears there will be little more than an update on matters already understood.  In recent weeks, Fianna F&aacute;il has set out in some detail our approach to what we believe should be Ireland's policy in these negotiations.  It is transparently obvious that we will not and should not try to conclude a side deal with Britain in advance of the wider discussions.  We will not join them in this potentially disastrous decision and our priority has to be to ensure the Union of which we are a member can work.  In truth, the bulk of our bilateral relations with Britain will have to be defined through the overall negotiations.  For a start we must insist that the unique situation of this island, North and South, be reflected in post-Brexit arrangements.  We will feel the impact more than any other part of the European Union and this must be addressed.  We need to help the industries and communities worst hit and this means we need to secure permission and support for targeted assistance with diversification and market replacement.  We must also demand that the particular situation of Northern Ireland be addressed through a special status.<\/p>  <p>  Post-Brexit Northern Ireland will contain the largest concentration of EU citizens outside of the European Union borders.  The right to Irish citizenship, which conveys the right to European Union citizenship, is fundamental to our Constitution and to a serious of international commitments.  For the sake of clarity, we will vote against any deal which seeks to alter this right in any way.  Northern Ireland residents must retain their right to full EU citizenship and, equally, they must not be forced to choose between Irish and UK citizenship.  As the Taoiseach will clearly have some form of discussion with the UK Prime Minister, Mrs. May, tomorrow, he should make a point of raising with her a concern about the unilateral and unacceptable approach to the EU-related provisions of the British-Irish Agreement and Northern Ireland Act.  The UK Government has no legitimate right to unilaterally change the importance of EU law to the Northern Ireland settlement.  Any amendment must be negotiated and must not conflict with the provisions voted on in free referendums on this island.<\/p>  <p>  This is a dark and challenging moment for Europe.  It faces assertive enemies from outside and opposition from populist movements within.  This is not a time for timid action.  We need clarity and determination to move forward.  We need a spirit of solidarity.  We need leaders who understand that we cannot afford to move back to business as usual.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121400021#U00500","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1481723400,"counter":254,"content":"<p>Deputy Gerry Adams is next and he is sharing time.

In discussing the awfulness of the war in Syria, he mentions us in his prayers for the conversion of Russia.  We have no truck for Russia or for any of the big powers.  We are clearly against aggression of all kinds, unlike Teachta Martin, who seems to be in support of some of the forces engaged in Syria.  All of them should cease their violent actions.  Through the Taoiseach, we should raise these issues at the European Council meeting.  We should be putting these issues on the agenda.  The meeting is of key strategic importance because, although it is an informal meeting, it is primarily about the Brexit process.<\/p><p>The only thing that is clear at the moment is that the day is approaching when the British finally get around to making clear what they are going to do.  We do not think the Irish Government is properly prepared for these discussions.  We hope that a document we launched last week, The Case for the North to Achieve Designated Special Status within the EU, will inform the Government's negotiating position in the EU.  I have sent copies of the document to the Taoiseach and other leaders in the D&aacute;il.  Essentially, we are arguing for an Irish solution to an English problem.<\/p> <p> I remind the House that the Scottish First Minister told the Seanad recently that these \"unprecedented times require imagination, open minds and fresh thinking\".  We need to think and act on an all-island basis and in Ireland's interests internationally and nationally.  We can be sure that the British Government will be standing up for Britain's national interests.  Therefore, the Irish Government needs to be doing exactly the same thing, but in an unprecedented way across the entire island.  We cannot let our economy, our rights, our protections and our peace agreements to become collateral damage during the negotiations.<\/p> <p> The Government has a habit of getting bad deals in the European Union.  That cannot happen again on this issue, which is too vital for the people of this island to be short-changed in respect of it.  That is why we are arguing for a collective focus on securing the entire island of Ireland within the EU, in line with the democratically expressed wishes of the people in the North.  We talk all the time about the need to get the consent of the people in the North, which is something I agree with.  This is an example of the people in the North saying \"No\" and not giving their consent to leaving the EU.  I ask the Taoiseach to bring this message to the Council and to the informal meetings of Heads of State and Government on Thursday evening.<\/p> <p> The Speaker of the Catalan Parliament has been summoned to appear before the Spanish High Court in Friday, 16 December.  She is to be prosecuted for allowing a Parliamentary debate and a vote on Catalan independence.  The Spanish state considers this public figure to be guilty of a crime because she facilitated a public debate on an issue of huge importance to Catalan and Spanish citizens.  I ask the Taoiseach to raise the prosecution of the speaker of a democratic legislative body for facilitating a debate because it is putting at risk the democratic standards that people everywhere hold dear.<\/p> <p> I join everyone else in commending the amazing efforts of the Defence Forces in rescuing 15,600 refugees.  That is the size of a small county town.  The members of the Army and the Navy richly deserve the European of the Year award.

The Italian people rejected a referendum on constitutional change on 4 December last and the Government of Matteo Renzi subsequently resigned.  On the same day, an independent candidate just about beat a far-right candidate in the Austrian presidential election.  As Deputy Adams has mentioned, the Spanish authorities are threatening to prosecute the Speaker of the Catalan Parliament for facilitating a debate in that democratic legislature.  The EU has responded to the growing anger about its democratic deficit and its economic failures with further federalisation and reductions in member state sovereignty.  This can best be seen in the unprecedented attempt to ram the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement through the European Parliament and provisionally apply it before member state parliaments have had the chance to debate the agreement and vote on it.  I am conscious that there was no real debate on it in this Chamber.  The EU's approach to these issues can also be seen in the move to create a standing European army and to increase military spending among EU member states.  This is happening at a time of huge cutbacks in public and social spending.<\/p><p>I am conscious that the Council will be meeting against the backdrop of the failure of Europe and the world to stop the bloodshed and the slaughter of innocents in Aleppo.  When the Taoiseach speaks at the Council meeting, he has to send a message that conflict cannot be disconnected from migration.  It is clear that the two issues are linked.  If a particular part of the world or a particular country is being bombed, people will flee from that area to safer areas where no bombing is going on.  In this case, people believe safety is to be found in Europe.  There is increasing anger among citizens about the failure to do anything to tackle adequately the challenges associated with the migration problem or to step up to the plate to resolve conflicts like that in Syria.<\/p><p>Sinn F&eacute;in firmly opposes the new attempts to introduce a common consolidated corporate tax base because these plans are not the solution.  The EU <i>status quo<\/i>cannot continue.  The European institutions need a serious wake-up call.  They must take on board the growing disillusionment among voters.  Sinn F&eacute;in has constantly highlighted the glaring democratic deficit at the heart of the EU.  As we know, recent polls have shown that trust in the EU is continuing to fall.  At this week's EU Council meeting, the Taoiseach should demand real reform and not just a tinkering around the edges.  We need to build a progressive, prosperous and social Europe that respects sovereignty.<\/p><p>Yesterday was Ibrahim Halawa&rsquo;s 21st birthday.  He spent it in jail.  He should have been celebrating this important day with his family and friends, but instead he learned that his trial has been adjourned yet again.  This was the 17th postponement of his mass trial to date.  Ibrahim Halawa has spent 40 months, or 1,214 days, in prison as Egypt continues to disregard its obligations under Egyptian and international human rights law.  His trial has been rescheduled for 17 January 2017.  The Taoiseach needs to call President el-Sisi and state that the Irish Government is seeking Ibrahim Halawa's release under Law 140.  Rather than writing another letter, the Taoiseach should pick up the phone to speak directly to President el-Sisi.  Article 155 of the Egyptian constitution allows President el-Sisi, with the approval of the Egyptian cabinet, to issue pardons to prisoners.  President el-Sisi has used Article 155 four times in 2016, resulting in 859 prisoners being released.  The most recent pardon focused on 82 young prisoners.  The Taoiseach needs to explore this option because what is happening to this young man is unacceptable.  I ask the Taoiseach to raise Ibrahim Halawa&rsquo;s case formally at this week's European Council meeting if the opportunity arises.  I expect him to do so informally as well.  The plight of this young man needs to be put on the record.  We are calling for the release of this citizen of Ireland and Europe.  This is an example of something useful that can come out of the meeting.<\/p><p>I will conclude by stating my concerns about the continued assassinations and intimidation of human rights defenders and community activists in Colombia.  While we all welcome the new peace agreement in Colombia, it must backed up with protections for civil society and political activists.  Seventy human rights defenders have been killed in Colombia so far in 2016.  This marks an increase on last year's figure.  Thirty-one of these murders have happened since the entry into force of bilateral ceasefires on 29 August last.  Ireland and the EU have pledged to support the peace process in Colombia.  One of the priority issues must be to provide robust protection for all of these activists.  I ask the Taoiseach to raise what is happening in Colombia at this week's meeting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121400022#V00200","speaker":"1309"},{"type":"speech","time":1481724000,"counter":260,"content":"<p>I hope the Taoiseach will take on board a small number of proposals in advance of this week's European Council meeting.

Much of the focus of the Brexit debate to date justifiably has been on the impact on the Border, but I am of the view that it is also time for us to look very carefully at the economic planning required.  The CEO of Enterprise Ireland spoke at the event last night and she rightly pointed out that she needs a plan for the worst possible Brexit.  While we do not want to contemplate that this might be the reality, we must plan for the worst and, whatever then arises, it is prepared for.<\/p><p>We know that Brexit might provide opportunities for us and this too must be considered.  We also know, however, that some sectors will be particularly vulnerable, in particular where 70%, 80%, 90% or, in one or two cases, 100% of the sectoral export is to the UK.  Sectors such as agrifood and tourism are obviously vulnerable.  Much of our work will rightly be focused on helping protect employment in these sectors but, in a hard Brexit scenario, we know we will not be able to protect these sectors fully.  We need to be planning now for the expansion of tools such as the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund to help people diversify either in terms of the products they are producing or at least the markets they are targeting.  The criteria for that fund were expanded during the crisis and I believe they could be expanded once more to support those who face a loss of employment in the event of a hard Brexit.  The Taoiseach might confirm whether he agrees with this approach and whether he will be raising it at a European level.<\/p><p>More broadly, for all of its flaws, and those in this House could recount many such flaws, the support of the Irish people for the European project remains strong, in my view.  However, that should not be taken as agreement with those who argue for more Europe as the solution to the current malaise.  Those of us who champion the European Union must also be at the forefront of reforming it.  A Europe that drifts further from meeting the expectations of our people cannot hold, as we have seen again and again in election contests and referenda across the Union.  I have argued for some time that we need to make greater investment in our societies in order that what we deliver as politicians can begin to match the legitimate expectations of our people.  We need to make investments which can be felt by people across Europe, investments that make a noticeable difference to the quality of the lives of our people, such as investments in hospitals and nursing homes, in roads and trains, in schools and sports centres, and in so much more.  All of these are, in truth, investments in our people.<\/p><p>In my judgment, these policies will help us to meet the challenge of rising populism.  Too often over recent years the belief that only populist politicians have answers to public fears has gone unchallenged.  We must meet this challenge to democracy by providing people with real and workable solutions.  We are too constrained from achieving that objective by some of the strictures of the Stability and Growth Pact and the fiscal rules.  In the main, this is because the rules require of our states that we measure fiscal performance but there is no requirement to measure social performance.  Why do we have a set of rules that measures our debt-to-GDP ratio but we do not have a requirement to monitor basic poverty levels routinely?  Why do we focus on fiscal medium-term objectives but not on the health of our environment or of our people?  As we speak, the rules that govern the European Union are forcing governments, including our own, into inactivity.  We are constrained from spending money, even money that we ourselves have, at a time when people across this Continent are crying out for government action.<\/p><p>My party is beginning two pieces of work in this area.  Domestically, we have drafted a genuine progress indicators Bill, which we will publish early in the new year and which I hope will have the support of all sides of this House.  It will require, as a matter of law, that we publish a national set of indicators each year which would be much broader than simply the size of our economy.  By looking in the round at social progress and at the state of our environment, as well as the health of our economy, we can better measure whether Government is serving us well.  This is because social progress is what matters to our people.  I believe this is an important initiative.<\/p><p>Even with the best will in the world, however, I accept that Ireland could not achieve real social progress on its own.  The European rules that currently prevent additional capital expenditure need to change.  Ten days ago I raised this issue with the leaders of social democratic parties across Europe at a Party of European Socialists, PES, leaders meeting.  We agreed at that meeting to a sensible process which it is hoped will lead to real change.  At my suggestion, a group of social democratic economists and fiscal experts will meet early in 2017 to draft a set of proposals to modify the Stability and Growth Pact, including the fiscal rules.  These changes will not undermine fiscal discipline but should add an urgency to investment in our societies and place the monitoring of our social good on an equal footing with the monitoring of the strength of our economies.  To prevent Brexit contagion from spreading across our Continent, this is the sort of action we need to take.  I would encourage the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance to begin a similar process with their Christian Democratic colleagues, and Deputy Martin might do likewise with the liberals in the EU.<\/p><p>On Syria, we are continuing to watch as a human tragedy unfolds before us.  A deal, struck too late, that would have allowed the besieged people of Aleppo to escape seems to have been ignored.  Throughout yesterday, the bombardment of that benighted city continued.  UNICEF reported that &ldquo;many children, possibly more than 100, unaccompanied or separated from their families, are trapped in a building, under heavy attack in east Aleppo&rdquo;.  It is hard to disagree with the UN spokesperson who described a &ldquo;complete meltdown of humanity&rdquo; in the city.  The appalling situation in Syria has continued to shock us but, in truth, our shock matters little.  As a Union of nations, we have failed the people of Syria.  We have failed to adhere to any notion that we have a responsibility to protect them.  Faced with a Syrian dictator backed by Russia and Iran, the West has been reduced to pleading that the carnage might stop.<\/p><p>The US ambassador yesterday said:<\/p><blockquote>Are you truly incapable of shame, is there literally nothing that can shame you?  Is there no act of barbarism against civilians, no execution of a child that gets under your skin, that just creeps you out a little bit?  Is there nothing you will not lie about or justify?<\/blockquote><p>The continuing bombardment of Aleppo today may be our answer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121400023#W00500","speaker":"1353"},{"type":"speech","time":1481724600,"counter":266,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith, who is sharing time with Deputy Paul Murphy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121400023#W00600","speaker":"1311"},{"type":"speech","time":1481725200,"counter":267,"content":"<p>Aleppo was once a symbol of the democratic resistance to the Assad dictatorship in Syria.  I visited Aleppo in 2011, just before the revolution began and before a very nasty civil war and proxy war by many regimes broke out.  In the souk in that beautiful city, I met members of the Palestinian community and of the gay community, young people who were very brave, impressive, happy and hopeful for the future.  Today, Aleppo is buried under rubble and in a pool of blood and Assad's troops are going house to house butchering anyone who is left alive.  The only way Assad could succeed in this butchery, torture and abominable war was with the help of Russian military intervention.  We live in a world where the great powers increase conflict to divide the world between them for their own influence, and for monetary and economic greed.  Saudi Arabia and Qatar funded various jihadist groups throughout Syria to increase their influence and the USA tried to find moderate opposition groups so that it too could gain leverage in the region and over the country.  Russia is an alliance with Iran and sought to shore up its own influence and turned this conflict into a dreadful sectarian war, a brutal war that has been fuelled by various imperial powers.  Aleppo is a warning to everyone that barbarism will rise when imperialist powers try to carve up the world between them and this may indeed happen again.<\/p>  <p>  Western powers do not have clean hands.  All across Europe, arms have been traded into Syria in a very serious way.  Calls for western intervention do nothing to lessen the harm or the horror.  We know this because we have the recent legacy of Iraq.  What is happening in Aleppo today would remind one of what happened in cities such as Falluja.  Western intervention is not the solution.<\/p>  <p>  A total of &euro;1. 2 billion worth of arms trade goes from Europe into the Middle East.  It is amazing to see the statistics and graphs on this.  The biggest recipient of those arms is Saudi Arabia, which is totally engaged in the conflict in Syria, a country that has received approximately &euro;829 million worth of arms in the past two years.  The weaponry is horrific.  We are talking here about weapons that can kill by shooting, bombs, tanks and planes that can drop horrible explosives on communities.  How do we respond to this?  We can sit here and cry - I sometimes do feel like crying when I think of those young people - but that will not achieve anything.  The European Union should shut down the arms trade and that &euro;1.2 billion worth of arms to the Middle East should end immediately.  Instead of investing &euro;5 billion in a fund for more arms, weaponry and hardware in an EU defence fund, we should put that money into opening the borders and bringing into Europe the 2.3 million people stuck in camps on the Turkish border as a result of the dreadful deal the European Union did with Turkey.  We should tear up that deal Immediately and open the borders, not just for the people in the camps in Turkey who are cold and desperate as winter marches on but also for the tens of thousands now fleeing Aleppo and the surrounding areas.  If we do anything at all, we have to think about how to deal with refugees.  Instead of turning the Mediterranean into a graveyard and dealing a historic blow to human rights, we need to reverse the process.  Turkey has broken international law by sending refugees back to Syria.  There is evidence of the latter.  The deal to which I refer should be torn up Immediately.<\/p>  <p>  If we do not do as I suggest, we are saying \"Happy Christmas Syria\", \"Happy Christmas Aleppo\" in the most cruel and inconsiderate way.  We in the European Union are in breach of human rights law if we do not open our borders.  I wonder where those young men and women are now.  Are the at the bottom of the Mediterranean?  Are they locked up in torture chambers?  Are they in the grave or under a pile of rubble?  Millions like them are being neglected by Europe, which remains the wealthiest region on the planet.  Shame on Europe.  We have a lot for which to answer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121400024#X00100","speaker":"1367"},{"type":"speech","time":1481725200,"counter":268,"content":"<p>I will not add much to what Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith has said about Syria and Aleppo, except to also express my horror and revulsion at and condemnation of what is happening in eastern Aleppo as we speak and of the responsibility of the Assad forces, backed up by Putin, for the execution of civilians and the torture and the horror taking place.  Unfortunately, what is happening does not represent some turning point in the war or a basis for peace.  It is a further descent into complete horror across the country, which is breaking up and for which responsibility lies with Assad, Russia and all the imperialist powers that have intervened.  It highlights the fact that capitalism and imperialism offer nothing for the people of the Middle East apart from endless conflict, abuse and theft of their resources.<\/p>  <p>  There is a continuous trend on the part of Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, not based on fact, to say the far left supports Putin who, in turn, supports Assad.  I do not know if the Deputy does not listen to what we say and to our condemnation of what is happening Aleppo.  I suspect this is a deeply cynical, dishonest attempt to connect us with Russia.  On 20 October, when I think he was present, and listed seven occasions when, in the European Parliament, I had condemned Putin but could not find one occasion when any Fianna F&aacute;il MEP had done so.  I asked him to revert to me on the matter but he did not do so.  There are no examples.  He does this because it suits him politically.  It is deeply cynical to use what is happening in Aleppo to take a cheap shot at his political opponents on the left.  It is also because he does not want to talk about the other atrocities happening in the world right now such as, for example, in Mosul.  I have not heard him condemn the role of the US in Mosul, where civilians are also being killed.  Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin continues to go along with the drumbeat which dictates that we need further militarisation.<\/p>  <p>  The draft conclusions for the European Council meeting tomorrow, of which I have a leaked copy, show that tomorrow's meeting represents another step in the drive towards a European army.  Jean-Claude Juncker said just about a month ago that we have to do this ourselves, which is why we need a new approach to building a European security union with the end-goal of establishing a European army.  That is under way.  Brexit, Trump and Aleppo are being used as excuses for further militarisation.  There is a proposal that the European Council would agree with the defence conclusions and the joint EU-NATO declaration.  All of those are aimed at further militarisation and war.  The establishment of the European defence fund of &euro;500 million a year will be invested in research in arms and &euro;5 billion for procurement.  EU military headquarters, permanent structured co-operation, deeper integration between the EU and NATO will be established.  What is happening is clear. <\/p>  <p>  I thank those from Ireland and other countries responsible for saving thousands of lives in the Mediterranean.  They are to be saluted.  We must also consider the reality, which is not the fault of those people but of the EU governments and of the way this world is run, that over 4,500 people have so far died in the Mediterranean while attempting to make their way to Europe.  More have died this year than died last year, when the figure was just over 3,500.  They are fleeing war, conflict and the impact of imperialism.  What is the EU's response?  What does it propose to discuss tomorrow?  To use the example of the Turkey deal, one of the most disgusting things the EU has ever done - it has a done many disgusting things - the EU's response is to say that it will call Turkey a safe country, give it &euro;3 billion and turn a blind eye to its human rights abuses if it allows itself be used as an open-air prison camp for refugees.  That is what is happening.  The EU did not just do a deal with Turkey, it has now expanded it and said that it is the model for compacts with five African countries of origin or transit.  Let me refer to the deals with Libya and other countries.  At present, there are migrant detention centres operating in Libya in which conditions are horrific.  These centres are paid for with European money in an externalisation and militarisation of European borders.<\/p><p>It is like Trump paying Mexico to build borders and prison camps on Mexico's southern border.  We are right to condemn Trump and criticise his racist policies.  However, fortress Europe continues to do exactly that right now for refugees escaping horror.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121400024#X00200","speaker":"1308","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1481725800,"counter":270,"content":"<p>I wish to cover a couple of areas in my five minutes to contribute.  When it comes to Syria, language fails to describe what is happening there.  I do not think we have the language that could convey the depth of the suffering, devastation and anguish of Syrian people.  In a way, it is a war that has nothing to do with the ordinary people of Syria.  The way in which it has developed has left ordinary people behind.  Many years ago, I too had the opportunity to visit Damascus, which is a very rich, cultural and diverse city.  When we think about the history of Syria, it is considered the cradle of civilisation.  Again, there is a richness of culture and diversity.  When we see what has happened in Syria, it is as though it has been taken over by politics and a power play between a number of forces backing one side or another, whether it is Shi'ite, Sunni or some other force.<\/p><p>There are many powers, such Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Russia, the United States and countries in Europe, that are involved in this civil war.  It has come a very long way from that initial very peaceful protest in the name of democracy.  It is obvious that there has been no interest in a political solution.  A military solution was on the agenda to see who could bomb who out quicker.  We think particularly of the trauma endured by children.  All the countries involved sit at the United Nations.  It raises very serious questions around the efficiency and effectiveness of the UN.  Europe is also at the UN.  However, it is as though we have now come to accept the unacceptable.  I believe that Europe's voice at the UN must be stronger in its relationships with those countries with whom it has business and diplomatic relations.  At the very least, there must be a strong voice for the protection of civilians and combatants, for the respecting of the rules of war, for safe passage, and for free and safe access to all areas for UN staff.<\/p><p>I acknowledge our Government's opening political dialogue with Cuba.  If we have not done so already, Ireland is about to sign the EU-Cuba political dialogue and co-operation agreement.  I believe it is positive for both Ireland and Cuba.  We have a special relationship with Cuba, its society and its economy.  Hopefully, we will have more positive trade relations between the EU and Cuba, including Ireland.  EU support is vital in order that the progress made by President Obama and President Ra&uacute;l Castro, with a major role played by Pope Francis, is not undermined or undone.  I believe that the EU's voice was not strong enough on the banking issues of Cuba.<\/p><p>On the issue of tax, I return to the exchanges from Leaders' Questions today and the Taoiseach's agreement that there would be a space for voices advocating for tax justice at the high-level EU meeting, rather than just the representatives of the <i>status quo<\/i>.  We had a very good Brexit conference and I would like to see something similar.  We are all concerned about Ireland's reputation and the good name we had in terms of our untied aid.  We are trusted in the developing world.  So much of that stems from the work of our missionaries over 100 years.  Ireland is a country that countries in Africa and other places want to do business with and, therefore, we have a responsibility to be a leader on tax justice here and at EU level.  There is a policy process going on at the moment in Brussels to introduce public country by country reporting.  I understand we are not opposed to it in principle, but we are not vocal and strong enough in support of it.  We need to be more proactive.<\/p><p>I share the concerns of the speaker of the parliament of Catalonia, Ms Carme Forcadell, who was summoned to court this Friday for allegedly disobeying and perverting the course of justice by allowing the pro-independence roadmap to be put to a vote last July.  This is a serious undermining of democracy.  At EU level, I ask that Ireland express concerns over the prosecution of Ms Forcadell.<\/p><p>The EU and EU countries that have diplomatic relations with countries that are not respectful of human rights or in which there are human rights abuses should use all avenues in their power to address these issues.  I refer in particular to the murder on 12 November last of an environmental and human rights defender, Mr. Jeremy Barrios Lima, in Guatemala City.  He had worked with Tr&oacute;caire's partner organisation, CALAS.  It is a very dangerous environment in these countries to be a human rights defender and to look after and try to protect the indigenous people and their right to land.  Some of these land grabs are being carried out by corporations and multi-nationals who have bases in Europe.  Europe could be a stronger voice in promoting human rights.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121400025#Y00200","speaker":"1291"},{"type":"speech","time":1481725800,"counter":271,"content":"<p>I am not sure how many attempts have been made by different elected Members over the years to enshrine neutrality in the Constitution.  The Sinn F&eacute;in Bill on 24 November was the most recent.  Prior to that, a Bill was tabled by Deputy Mick Wallace on 18 December 2014.  That Bill was defeated at Second Stage at a time when a RED C poll showed that 78% of the population agreed that Ireland should have a strong policy of neutrality.  Both attempts, and all other attempts before that, have failed, primarily because the Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il parties, or indeed the Labour Party when its vote counted, did not support any of these Bills.<\/p><p>Why do Deputies keep trying?  The answer is that these efforts on our part reflect the opinion of the majority of people.  They reflect a long and proud tradition of neutrality going back to Wolfe Tone and to the 1916 Rising and Proclamation.  If that is what the people want and that is our tradition, then why does each Government continue to vote against any change that would enshrine this concept in our Constitution?  Clearly, neutrality is not a concept the Government wishes to see enshrined because leaving the <i>status quo<\/i>in place provides it and every other Government with much more elasticity with which to define Ireland's neutrality, depending on the needs of the circumstances and on who one's friends are at a given time.<\/p><p>This elasticity allows each Government to do many things, and I will only mention some of them.  Since 2002, it has allowed Shannon Airport, a civilian airport, to be used by more than 2.5 million US troops to go to and from war zones in Iraq, Yemen and Syria.  On average, 500 troops per day pass through this civilian airport.  They are only the numbers we know about.  That figure does not include military aircraft operated directly by the US military.  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade will not divulge this information.  As a result, we are relying on concerned individuals and groups such as Shannonwatch.  It is extraordinary that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade tells us that these military aircraft are not involved in military operations when it will not divulge any information about them.  On average, military aircraft land in Shannon twice a day.  Last month, Shannonwatch photographed six military aircraft in one day.  Last year, 600 exemptions were given to military aircraft to land at Shannon and 700 exemptions were given for aircraft to carry weaponry by the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.  The Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport itself paid &euro;2.5 million last year to the Irish Aviation Authority, which was a reimbursement of costs incurred by the authority for aeronautical communications, etc.  What are these troops doing, I wonder, if they are not on military operations?<\/p><p>The elasticity concept of neutrality also allowed Ireland to join a European Defence Agency in 2004 and to make contributions to a European defence fund.  The elasticity allows submarines to dock in waters.  In the past month, a foreign submarine, allegedly one from NATO, docked in Horgan's Quay in Cork.  There were armed personnel on Horgan's Quay in Cork.  What permissions were granted by whom and for what?  The elasticity allows exports of dual-use components.  I could go on but the message is clear on what is happening with this concept of elasticity.  The irony and scandal is that all of these decisions made in our name allowed us no input whatsoever.  That is in complete contrast to Article 10 of the much-lauded Lisbon treaty, which states that every citizen shall have the right to participate in the democratic life of the union and that decisions shall be taken as openly and as closely as possible to the citizen.<\/p><p>With regard to this upcoming meeting, I do not have much hope, but I do hope that the Minister of State might hear what we are saying and what we represent.  We are being beseeched by the people of Ireland to stand up as an independent country with an independent foreign policy to be promoters of peace in the world.  The irony is that the policy that we have followed along with Europe has led to a much less safe world.  Some 65 million people worldwide are displaced by war and 24 people per minute are forced to flee their homes as a direct result of military conflicts.<\/p><p>One out of every 113 people globally is now either a refugee, asylum seeker or internally displaced person, and of these, 51% are children.<\/p> <p> This is not what the people of Ireland are asking for.  As I have said, they are beseeching us to stand up and be a voice for peace in the world.  We have joined a Europe that is going increasingly in a military direction.  The European Parliament on 22 November last backed plans to create a defence unit, but not once have we had an input into any of these decisions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121400025#Y00300","speaker":"1316","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1481726400,"counter":273,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak today.  One of the most immediate issues facing the European Union is the result of the recent Italian referendum, coming as it does on the back of the Brexit referendum result.  We seem to be stumbling and fumbling along, unsure of ourselves.  We have seen heavy-handed attempts by EU leaders, powerful people, to threaten our nearest neighbours.  They have questioned what the British have done and urged them to revisit the issue.  Only now is the seriousness of the situation gradually sinking in but the potential damage that Brexit may do to us has not fully sunk in yet.  It has created a climate of uncertainty and added to the sense that the European project itself could be spinning out of control.  The referendum was presented to the Italian people as an effort to reform the workings of Government but the people saw it differently.  They interpreted the proposition before them as an attempt to increase government power at the expense of the regions and the rights of the ordinary citizen.  Like it or not, that is the way people feel about Europe now.  They feel that they are being excluded and left on the margins.  There is a huge disconnect with the powers that be.  We saw that for ourselves with the financial crisis.  What did we get from the EU?  Nothing but disdain and being told what we should and should not do.  The EU allowed the money to be shovelled in here but took no responsibility for the actions of the European banks.<\/p>  <p>  This is a common theme running through much of the so-called debate on Europe at the moment.  There is so much mistrust regarding the true agendas of national governments and the direction that Europe is taking that it has changed the political landscape across the Union.  We are not immune to this in Ireland and how could we be?  We must learn from Brexit.  We must learn to find ways to listen to the people and not to dismiss their concerns as mere populism.  We can all say that and we have seen that across the globe.  If one takes a different view, if one is not on the big merry-go-round of European and US trips, that does not mean one is being a populist and just having a go.  Having said that, we must find a way of striking a balance between listening to the people and making difficult but necessary decisions.  That is a very delicate and difficult balance to strike but we must try to do so.  When people trust their governments, this is more easily achieved.  The Italian referendum, the Brexit result and the election of President-elect Donald Trump have shown us that when people do not trust their governments, even good ideas are defeated.  When the people lose faith in their governments, then the governments cannot bring the people with them.<\/p>  <p>  The Irish Government is going over and back to European summits.  What will the Taoiseach be doing about Ibrahim Halawa who marked his 21st birthday in awful conditions in prison in Egypt?  What recognition are we getting from the EU for the work we are doing through our missionaries, NGOs and pioneering people?  What recognition are we getting for the tremendous but harrowing work being done by our Navy?  I saw a documentary on the work of our Navy in the Mediterranean on Monday night last.  The risks being taken by our personnel are spectacular.  The documentary highlighted the difficulties they experience when trying to rescue migrants at sea.  They must try to keep them calm and assure them that they are there to help, such is the level of fear.  The migrants are so desperate that they have left their country on boats that do not even have enough fuel to bring them 50 km, not to mention a four-hour trip.  The documentary highlighted the false hope and the abuse of trust by those who put them on those makeshift boats.<\/p>  <p>  I visited a refugee camp myself in Lebanon and know that people will take any risks to get away rather than stay in a situation of hateful persecution.  What we are seeing in Syria, with the continual bombardment of Aleppo, is beyond words.  No words could even begin to describe the horror of that situation, but Europe has stood idly by.  What have we said as an independent country?  What attempts have we made to bring this issue to the fore and to ensure respect for the so-called normal rules of war?  What is going on in Aleppo is savage.<\/p>  <p>  There has been very little debate on these issues in this House.  I have tried to raise the issue of the Middle East and the wipeout of Christianity and other minority Muslim sects from the region.  Anyone who does not conform is just being wiped out.  I note that Fianna F&aacute;il has tabled a motion on the Yazidis.  While I acknowledge that the Yazidis are being persecuted, so too are Christians.  I cannot understand Fianna F&aacute;il's unwillingness to include Christians in its motion.  Why the cherry-picking?  No human being deserves to be treated in such an obnoxious fashion.  The Middle East will be destabilised for generations to come.  It is horrific to see what is going on in Aleppo and to consider the arms trade, the way the USA is supporting Saudi Arabia and the Russians are continuing with their bombardment.  It is the most awful civil war.  I know that ISIS must be tackled but surely not this way, with the slaughter of innocents, of children, house by house and on the streets of Aleppo.  The people of Aleppo could not leave.  They had no chance because to try to leave would have posed an even greater risk.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Katherine Zappone, to the Chamber.  I know that she and the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, visited refugee camps in Greece in recent days.  Seeing is believing.  I was only in a refugee camp once, in Lebanon, but I will never forget the fear and terror in the eyes of children.  I will never forget the stories they told.  Most were there with nobody only a grandparent, their siblings and parents having been slaughtered or dragged into the conflict.<\/p>  <p>  We are standing idly by.  As a so-called neutral country, we are not even having proper discourse and debate on these issues.  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Shane Ross is the man with responsibility for the munitions passing through Shannon Airport.  We need to be questioning much more what is going through that civilian airport.  We do not ask enough questions but simply sign letters.  I know that the current Minister does not just do that and I compliment him on that.  I have spoken to him about issues like this and I know he takes them seriously.  The Cabinet needs to take them more seriously too.  We need to know the destinations of all the US military planes and what is on board them.  I know that Shannon Airport is in the constituency of the Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Pat Breen, and we all want to see the airport doing well, but not at any cost.<\/p>  <p>  I look forward to hearing from the Ministers for Children and Youth Affairs and Justice and Equality about the situation in the refugee camps.  We must thank the NGOs, the peacekeepers and the reporters who risk their lives to report the true horror of what is going on.  They are being failed by us when we do not act on that horror, when we do not bat an eyelid at the persecution that is going on.<\/p>  <p>  I referred earlier to the wiping out of Christians and other sects.<\/p><p>Under the dictators people had freedom to practice their religion with impunity.  There was some sense of normality in the region but united coalition forces have bombed the hell out of the place and what is there now?  Nothing but unadulterated bedlam, war and terror regimes.  It is a far more unstable, dangerous and troubling place for future generations than has been the case for decades.  I am not condoning dictatorships but people had some sense that they were able to go about their lives, cherish whatever faith they believed in and create some semblance of normality for their children, but now there is unadulterated chaos.  I am disappointed we have not had any meaningful debates on that in the House.  I am disappointed with Fianna F&aacute;il also regarding its difficulty in including Christians in its forthcoming motion.  I do not understand the party's difficulty in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121400026#Z00200","speaker":"1347","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1481727000,"counter":275,"content":"<p>I listened to all the Members who spoke with passion and emotion regarding Syria.<\/p>  <p>  I am pleased to conclude these statements in advance of tomorrow&rsquo;s meeting of the European Council.

There was a consultative referendum in the Netherlands last April which opposed Dutch ratification.<\/p>  <p>  In order to address the concerns raised during the referendum, the Dutch Government is now seeking a decision of the Heads of State or Government of the 28 EU member states meeting as the European Council, which provides legally binding assurances.  These assurances include confirmation that the agreement is not the first step to EU membership and clarification of what it does or does not entail.  The decision is not seeking to alter the substance of the agreement itself.<\/p>  <p>  This agreement is of vital significance and it is therefore important that a solution is found to allow the Netherlands to ratify it.  Failure to do so would cast doubt on the credibility of the EU as a stable partner for countries in the eastern neighbourhood.  For these reasons, we would wish the EU to be as supportive as possible and we intend to approach the matter in that spirit.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland, together with its EU partners, remains very concerned at the ever-worsening situation in Syria.  We have been shocked and outraged at the appalling scenes of suffering in Aleppo where the excessive, disproportionate and indiscriminate use of military force constitutes a clear violation of international law, as outlined in the genuine contributions by speakers this afternoon.<\/p>  <p>  Our concerns have been directly conveyed in the clearest terms to the Russian authorities, given their role as a key supporter of the Assad regime.  It is disheartening to note that however the conflict mutates in the near term, there is likely to be neither improvement nor meaningful resolution in the short term.<\/p>  <p>  The October European Council held a broad strategic debate on the relationship with Russia in all its aspects.  It was agreed that it remains a strategic goal for Ireland and the EU to have a strong stable partnership with Russia into the future.  However, we must be frank about the current realities and the situation as it presents itself today.<\/p>  <p>  There has clearly been a marked deterioration in relations between Russia and the EU over the past number of years.  The conflict in Ukraine has come to be the central defining issue, although there are also grave concerns over Russia&rsquo;s role in the Syrian conflict.<\/p>  <p>  There has been no major change in policy by Russia or any indications that it is seeking to improve its relationship with the EU.  That is regrettable, but it is quite simply the fact and it cannot be ignored.<\/p>  <p>  EU Foreign Ministers agreed a set of principles in March to guide our relations with Russia and these remain the guiding points for our current relationship.  In line with these, Ireland believes there is merit in seeking a selective engagement with Russia on foreign policy issues and specific sectoral areas of interest to the EU.  However, we are clear that any resumption of dialogue should be gradual and should be used by the EU to seek a change in Russian behaviour.<\/p>  <p>  As I said, the fragile security situation and the conflict in eastern Ukraine remain of paramount importance.  Two years on from the signing of the first Minsk agreements, we are still calling for a stable ceasefire.<\/p>  <p>  The path for a resolution of the conflict is set out in the Minsk agreements.  The EU has been very clear and consistent in linking the economic sanctions imposed in 2014 to the complete implementation of the Minsk accords.  The decision to impose such measures on Russia has come with negative consequences.  The EU has suffered in terms of trade volumes, but that underlines the seriousness with which the EU regards Russia&rsquo;s actions in destabilising eastern Ukraine.<\/p>  <p>  The sanctions are intended to encourage Russia to use its influence to help ensure the full implementation of the Minsk agreements.  Criteria for amending the sanctions are clear and provide the sole basis upon which future decisions and assessments are made.<\/p>  <p>  We have repeatedly made clear that the EU will never recognise Russia&rsquo;s illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014 and that has to remain an important principle in our approach.<\/p>  <p>  Despite these negative elements, the EU still needs to look to its values and to act in accordance with them.  For example, it is of great importance that the EU maintains its support for civil society in Russia, which continues to be vulnerable.  The shrinking space for independent civil society and the ongoing harassment of human rights defenders, journalists and opponents is deeply troubling.<\/p>  <p>  As I said, we desire a strong and stable relationship with Russia over the long term and that goal will once again guide our thinking at the European Council discussion this week.  However, we do not expect any significant change in the EU&rsquo;s approach to its relationship with Russia at the present time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121400027#AA00200","speaker":"1272"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Ceisteanna - Questions (Resumed) - Priority Questions","time":1481727000,"counter":277,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121400027#AA00400"},{"type":"speech","time":1481727000,"counter":278,"content":"<p>I intend to stick rigidly to the clock.

There are serious practical and logistical issues that must be worked out in conjunction with the National Transport Authority so the scheme can be rolled out fairly and safely.  They hope to pilot the scheme from mid to late January for about four weeks and then implement it in full.  This is to ensure that all concerns around identity, danger of fraud and misuse, and user friendliness for those eligible can be addressed.  I can share a bit more information in that regard, as well as a reply to the Deputy's second question, the next time I take to my feet.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121400032#FF00600","speaker":"1358"},{"type":"speech","time":1481730000,"counter":340,"content":"<p>Will the Minister indicate if the pilot scheme, to be rolled out after the four weeks, is for all the children or is it just for a group of the children?

I will go into a little more detail on some of the issues, as explained to me by the DRHE.  With regard to identity and fraud, or misuse of cards, the cards must be used only by those who are eligible and each user must, therefore, be registered and the cards not transferred to someone else.  There are some data protection concerns.  The DRHE needs consent to have homeless families' details of individual children so as to estimate age, location, likely usage and the distance from hotel accommodation to school.  Much of this can be addressed through information contained with consent as when the five Leap cards were issued.  The system must also be user friendly.  A system for topping up cards, including the amounts, which is normally done at source by card buyers, means that from an administrative point of view a judgment needs to be made.  Some 90% of homeless families reside in the Dublin area.  This is about helping as many people as possible and as quickly as possible so it will be rolled out through Dublin initially.  In the Deputy's area of the mid-west, I understand there are 22 homeless families and I suggest that if children of families need to use public transport to get to school, an application should be made to the community welfare officer.  I would be happy to lend my support to that application.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121400032#FF00800","speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Completion Programme","time":1481730000,"counter":342,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121400032#FF00900"},{"type":"question","time":1481730000,"counter":343,"qnumday":33,"qnumall":"[35149\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121400032#FF01000","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"when she will publish a new school completion strategy to further improve school completion rates particularly in disadvantaged areas; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1298","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","time":1481730000,"counter":344,"content":"<p>My question to the Minister follows from a commitment in the programme for Government to publish a new school completion strategy to further improve school completion rates and especially in areas of disadvantage.

Improving attendance and participation in education is a key priority for me, particularly regarding vulnerable children.  The programme for Government, as the Deputy said, commits to publishing a new school completion strategy to further improve school completion rates, especially in disadvantaged areas.  My Department will work closely with the Minister for Education and Skills in developing the new strategy.  We will prepare it in the context of the Government programme commitment to a new action plan for educational inclusion to secure good educational outcomes for all children, especially those at risk of educational disadvantage.<\/p>  <p>  The ongoing review of the DEIS programme, which targets supports to schools and students in the most disadvantaged areas, will inform the development of this strategy.  I hope to progress the school completion strategy in the latter half of 2017.  In the meantime, Tusla is working on improvements to the governance and operation of the school completion programme.  I believe the programme is a vital response in securing improved educational outcomes for those who are at risk of early school leaving.  The ESRI's report on the programme in October 2015 pointed to the effectiveness of the service but emphasised the need for organisational reforms.  Tusla has been working on these in order to strengthen its operation.  For example, an unemployment audit was carried out and its findings are under currently consideration.  These improvements will form a valuable backdrop to a new school completion strategy.  I want the strategy to recognise possible alternative provisions where students are not suited to mainstream education and we will also need to respond to the needs of children from ethnic and minority groups with low school completion rates, including the Traveller and Roma communities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121400032#FF01200","speaker":"1358"},{"type":"speech","time":1481730000,"counter":346,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.  I appreciate the fact that she has given a timeframe for the strategy.  I encourage her to engage in as broad a consultation process as possible.  The school completion programme to date has been successful but it does not mean we can be complacent and that there are no new challenges.  It is worth noting that the most recent figures available indicate that about nine out of ten students complete second level education.  Unfortunately, particular problems arise in the DEIS schools where one in five students do not complete school.  I hope that the focus of the new programme will look specifically at DEIS schools.  It is interesting, when one looks at the DEIS schools, that the gap between DEIS and non-DEIS schools in getting to students to junior certificate is only 3%.  Some 94% complete their junior certificate in DEIS schools and 97% get to junior certificate in non-DEIS schools.  When they get to the leaving certificate, however, there is a 10% gap.  The review needs to focus very strongly on that period from junior certificate to leaving certificate.  Those students who do transition year are also more likely to complete their schooling compared with those who do not do transition year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121400032#FF01300","speaker":"1298"},{"type":"speech","time":1481730600,"counter":347,"content":"<p>The Deputy's suggestion that the consultation process should be as wide as possible is helpful.

Those reviews are with Tusla and my Department and they will need careful consideration.  The funding implications are also critical and need to be examined based on the evidence and the recommendations of the reviews, the differences in percentages, as the Deputy identified, the transition from junior to senior level and the evidence that it is clearly a very good programme that needs to be supported, but that should be done in light of careful consideration of the reviews that have taken place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121400033#GG00100","speaker":"1358"},{"type":"speech","time":1481730600,"counter":348,"content":"<p>I specifically ask the Minister to ensure we would go a little further with the new programme.  It is not sufficient that students complete their schooling at leaving certificate.  We need to review where they go after that and how they are equipped to take up work or to go on to third level.  That is important.  We all know that fewer students going to UCD and the other universities come from disadvantaged areas and DEIS schools than come from more affluent areas.  The challenge is for us to address that in conjunction with school completion.  The issue is not only the rate of completion but that we raise the standard right through that level to give students equal opportunities.  If a child is coming from a DEIS school or a disadvantaged area, their expectations starting out should be equal to a child coming from a advantaged area in terms of access to third level being an opportunity for me.  Unfortunately, that does not always seem to be the case.  They get to leaving certificate but do not seem to transition in the same way, and that needs to be the next step of school completion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121400033#GG00200","speaker":"1298"},{"type":"speech","time":1481730600,"counter":349,"content":"<p>I completely agree with the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121400033#GG00300","speaker":"1358"},{"type":"speech","time":1481730600,"counter":350,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121400033#GG00400","speaker":"1298"},{"type":"speech","time":1481730600,"counter":351,"content":"<p>That is a very progressive recommendation or insight.

It is probably best if I just read out a letter I received from the school principal, signed on behalf of the school's board of management, because it best outlines the issues facing the school.<\/p><blockquote>Dear Mr. Cullinane,<br \/><br \/>The Board of Management and the school community of Garranbane National School require your assistance in approaching the Department of Education [and the Minister] on our behalf, to request that they grant full funding for the development of a safe school at Garranbane.<br \/><br \/>On the 16<sup>th<\/sup>May 2012, under the Prefab Rental Replacement Scheme, Garranbane N.S. received a grant for a standalone extension consisting of 4 x 80m<sup>2<\/sup>, 2 x 25m<sup>2<\/sup>and 2 x 16m<sup>2<\/sup>permanent rooms.  Since then there has been several setbacks in proceeding with this build.<br \/><br \/>Initially Waterford County Council refused planning, this was as a result of objections lodged.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la finally granted conditional planning permission to the school in 2013.  The total cost of the project [...] is proposed to be &euro;1,385,769.16.  This greatly exceeds the Department of Education approved funding.  The overrun in costs is due solely to the imposition of the conditions as set out by An Bord Plean&aacute;la.<br \/><br \/>The total funding approved [...] is &euro;718,226.00 [which means the shortfall] is &euro;667,543.16.<br \/><br \/>The BOM, staff and parents are very concerned, as in four years there has been no progress on the build and to date we have not received funding.  We are situated in a unique hazardous unsuitable site for any school, on the fork of a road on a hillside between the N25 and a narrow local road the site of many traffic collisions.  Our school currently presents numerous health and safety issues.<br \/><br \/>-  In June 2014, the school was informed that there were major exceedances of lead in the water supply, even after a five minutes' flush.  As it was the BOM belief that major work was soon to begin on the school, an external temporary drinking water tap was installed on the school grounds and no other structural work was done to the pipes.  This single tap provides the only drinkable water on the school grounds for a population of more than 200.<br \/><br \/>-  Asbestos hazards were found present throughout our school, in a report published in 2003, thus warning signs are posted throughout the school [...]<br \/><br \/>-  The main building was built in 1939 containing two classrooms.  The enrolment at that time was approximately 100 pupils, our current enrolment is 196 [...] <br \/><br \/>- The sewage system that was installed at that time does not function adequately to cope with the increase in enrolment [...]<br \/><br \/>-  Several of our prefabs have leaks in the roofs and mould, mildew and mushrooms growing around the corners of ceilings.  They are draughty and cold in winter and overheat in summer and yet children are expected to work in these conditions.<br \/><br \/>-  One of the larger prefabs has several holes in the floor, where the floor has collapsed and which has had to be patched up temporarily to avoid injury.<br \/><br \/>-  The staffroom catering for 14 adults and visitors is a converted cloakroom, extended in 2004 by the Board of Management.<br \/><br \/>-  There are no cloakroom facilities in the main building.  All coats are kept in small classrooms which makes movement around classrooms limited with such large pupil numbers, causing dampness\/mildew, again [...] unsatisfactory for all children but especially those with asthma\/chest conditions.<br \/><br \/>-  Toilet facilities are inadequate and out-dated.  In the main building 6 toilets cater for 100 children.  Continuous problems with blockages [...]<br \/><br \/>-  The school is not accessible by wheelchair.<br \/><br \/>-  All footpaths, playgrounds and pavements are cracked and broken [...]<br \/><br \/>-  The school is situated on a hillside and the forty-two steps up to school have no hand rails presenting a safety issue for all school users especially special needs children.<\/blockquote><p>The Minister will be able to understand from the letter all the problems with which the school must deal daily.

He is absolutely right that this project has had a very troubled history.  I have had discussions with his constituency colleague and my ministerial colleague, Deputy John Halligan, about the situation.  The school was selected for inclusion in the Department's prefab replacement scheme in 2012, as Deputy Cullinane said.  The approval was for four mainstream classrooms and four ancillary spaces to be delivered by way of a stand-alone structure on the site.  The commensurate level of funding for a project of this scale was sanctioned.<\/p>  <p>  The project was devolved for delivery to the board of management, which appointed a consultant to design and deliver the project.  This was therefore a devolved project intended to speed up the process but, as the Deputy knows, the difficulties then ensued.  A critical role for the school authority in a devolved building project is to ensure both adherence to the scope of the approved work and the cost control for the approved spend.  Failure in either area inevitably leads to delays.  External matters outside the board of management's control, such as the need to obtain planning permission and all that this may entail, will also impact the timelines for delivery of the project, which is exactly what happened in this case.<\/p>  <p>  While there were issues with adherence to the approved scope of the works, the planning permission process was particularly difficult due to the nature of the site and with traffic management issues on and extraneous to the site.  This resulted in at least one request for further information from the local authority to the board of management that the Department is aware of.  Overall, this process took much longer than is usual and further difficulties were to ensue in that the planning permission granted was subsequently appealed to an An Bord Plean&aacute;la by third parties.<\/p>  <p>  An Bord Plean&aacute;la eventually granted planning permission but attached onerous planning conditions to a range of issues including site works, traffic management, pick-up and set-down areas, car parking, etc.  The school's proposals to deal with these issues were to be agreed with the local authority before the project could proceed.  This involved another piece of significant work for the project.  For example, another range of surveys were required to be carried out on the site such as geo-technical surveys, the cost of which were met by the Department.  Interactions were also necessary with the local authority to develop and agree the proposals.<\/p>  <p>  When proposals were ultimately agreed with the local authority, the cost estimate for the project almost doubled from the original cost approval.  Accordingly, the Department sought details of the proposals in question and spent some time obtaining satisfactory explanations.  In the meantime, the school tendered the project, seeking additional funding based on the tenders received.  In the absence of satisfactory responses to the cost escalation, the Department was not in a position to approve the funding uplift.  That tender process is now out of time under public procurement procedures and is defunct.<\/p>  <p>  Having received satisfactory explanations for the cost overrun in more recent times, the Department is now prepared to allow the project to be retendered and it has informed the school of this in writing, with clear instructions on how to properly complete the process and the junctures at which it must interact with the Department throughout the process to ensure that it runs smoothly.<\/p>  <p>  The matter is now in the hands of the school.  The Department is committed to the delivery of the project and strongly urges the board of management to focus its energies and resources on putting the retendering process in train as quickly as possible so that the project can go to site as early as possible in the new year.<\/p>  <p>  In the intervening period, the school may apply for emergency works funding to deal with any access issues it might have at the school, provided this work will not be aborted when the main project is delivered.  This is a matter for the board to discuss with its consultant, bearing in mind that the rate and pace of delivery of a large-scale project for the school rests firmly with the board of management.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121400037#LL00700","speaker":"1293"},{"type":"speech","time":1481733000,"counter":425,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister's reply.

Maybe this happened after that date.  I will refer back to the school to find out, but contact would be welcome.  I assume this would still cause a delay, but the question then is the difference between the actual cost and the initial cost.  Is the Minister saying that when a school retenders, it can now do so for the actual cost of carrying out the works, which I think is &euro;600,000 more in this case?<\/p><p>Is that the position?

The scope is the same as for the original works.  Obviously, as the tender proceeds, the Department will have to be satisfied with the way in which the tendering process is being conducted and so on, as I outlined in my earlier reply.

This compares with an average daily total of 400 in previous years.  Today's figures would not cater for the necessary cover for Tallaght, let alone the whole country.<\/p>  <p>  The shortage of substitute teachers has been a matter of grave concern to principals throughout the country since the October mid-term break as well as to teachers.  Indeed, we now have teachers offering to come in under the weather, as it were, rather than having a class broken up and distributed among the other classes in the school.  This poses particular difficulties for teachers in one, two and three-teacher schools.  It is especially difficult in smaller towns and cities and rural areas.  It is a serious headache for principals.<\/p>  <p>  One principal described the situation to me.  She said that recently she had three sick colleagues and another was on a pre-arranged course day.  All three absent teachers were on certified sick leave.  She made more than 20 calls to her own personal list of substitutes but no one was available.  She eventually sourced a teacher through the INTO SubSearch facility, but that teacher was on her way to a medical appointment with a sick parent.  No substitutes were available through the Irish Primary Principals Network TextaSub facility.  This resulted in two of the classes being distributed throughout the school, with one class having 39 children for the day.  She also had to use two the learning support staff to cover these classes on the day, resulting in potential disruption to children with special educational needs.  That principal set out clearly the difficult effect that lack of substitution arrangements or facilities can have for people.<\/p>  <p>  The shortage of substitutes is having a serious impact on teaching principals as they are increasingly unable to avail of the principal release days.  Such days are vital to them for administrative and leadership planning roles in their schools.  This is a consequence of the lack of substitute cover.  It is also impacting on the ability of teachers to participate in continuing professional development for the same reason.<\/p>  <p>  There is a real danger that the substitute shortage will quickly have an impact on learning outcomes.  We are all rather proud of the OECD programme for international student assessment report and the standings published earlier this week.  They show that we have improved to become the third-best performing nation in the world in terms of reading.  This move was initiated by my now retired colleague, the former Minister for Education and Skills, Ruair&iacute; Quinn.  Classes of up to 40 children on a regular basis will rapidly undermine this progress.<\/p>  <p>  The reality is that the current situation is directly related to the issue of pay equalisation.  Teachers are being actively recruited by Middle Eastern countries, even from the teacher education sections of our universities.  Teachers from large urban areas are especially concerned at the high cost of living in comparison with their now reduced pay.  Like staff in the medical sector, we are now in danger of losing a generation of teachers who have been educated at the considerable expense of taxpayers.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister urgently needs to consider the establishment of a national and regional supply panel, such as those in operation in other countries.  This would give substitute teachers and schools some degree of certainty in respect of their positions.  I am keen to hear the response of the Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121400038#MM00400","speaker":"1253"},{"type":"speech","time":1481733600,"counter":430,"content":"<p>I am aware that some schools are experiencing difficulty in recruiting adequately qualified substitute teachers.  I am committed to examining all possible means of addressing that issue.  In overall terms, however, the Department has no evidence of a recent or current shortage of primary teachers.  There are many different variables that affect the supply and demand for teachers in our schools, such as the number of new graduates, the number of retirees, Government policy on the pupil-teacher ratio and so on.  Deputy Burton is aware of these factors.<\/p>  <p>  In 2015, a one-year reduction in the number of newly qualified teachers graduating from the higher education institutions materialised due to the reconfiguration and extension of the programme of initial teacher education from three to four years.  This may have contributed to a reduction in the supply of teachers at primary level.  A little over 3,500 graduate teachers registered with the Teaching Council last summer.  Another important factor to take into account in this area is that the entire thrust of policy under the previous Government, in particular the relevant Ministers at the time, Mr. Quinn and Deputy O'Sullivan, was to ensure that to the greatest extent possible young teachers at the start of their careers, including unemployed teachers, were given priority when it came to recruiting substitute teachers.  Obviously, that is putting some pressure on supply.  In recent years, with the improving economic environment, we have been able to step up the pace of recruitment of teachers.  This September we recruited 2,260 new teachers.  Next September we intend to recruit 2,400, more than double the number possible in recent years.<\/p>  <p>  The Department considers it important that the supply of teachers with the required qualifications is adequate to meet demand at primary and post-primary level.  The Teaching Council Act gives a specific statutory role to the Teaching Council to advise in that respect.  The council has been asked to consider the matter of teaching supply.  The council has set up a technical working group.  The working group is examining a series of issues.  The aims of the working group include developing and piloting a model of teacher supply that would seek to ensure a sufficient supply of teachers to meet demand; formulating advice on teacher supply for consideration by the Teaching Council; considering the analysis of data held by the council and the Department in developing the pilot model of teacher supply; and generating policy recommendations on teacher supply for consideration by the Teaching Council.  In parallel with that reform, the relevant education stakeholders were consulted regarding the emerging recommendations during the process.  Feedback from this group was considered by the working group in its deliberations and in the development of the final report.  I expect the report to be published in due course.  The report includes recommendations specific to the supply of teachers.  I expect the Department to be in a position to progress consideration of the report in the near future.<\/p>  <p>  I will specifically ask that the issue of substitute supply be examined in that context because of emerging difficulties.  We will look at various suggestions that might ease the short-term pressure.<\/p>  <p>  The question of whether a panel will be established was put forward.  At the moment there is a good network that uses rapid website communication.  As the Deputy rightly pointed out, it is not always successful.  Whether the Department could improve on that would be an issue that would have to be considered.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121400038#MM00500","speaker":"1293"},{"type":"speech","time":1481733600,"counter":431,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his reply.  A sense of urgency and an acceptance that this is a problem is required.  It is a disturbing issue for school principals and management.  It is especially difficult if a number of teachers become sick or if, in the longer term, a number of staff become pregnant and require maternity leave.  The INTO has been looking for a national and regional supply panel.  Such a facility would have to operate regionally with the use of social media or some other information technology-based contact base.  It is possible to have a rapid flow of information to and from school principals to the panel in their area.  The problem is especially acute in smaller schools where there is a teaching principal, as opposed to an administrative principal in a larger school where that principal does not have to teach as well.<\/p><p>There are real problems in such schools if one or more of the teachers is missing.  While it can be exciting for kids for a day or two when two classes are put together, the kind of uncertainty this generates is not great from an educational planning perspective.  In fact, it can be a sign of the total absence of planning.  I appreciate that the Minister is in the hands of the Teaching Council to some extent.  I am disappointed by the slow development of the final report which the Minister has said he expects \"to be published in due course\".  Would it be possible to put a timeframe on this?

All of the people who attended the meeting, which was organised by the local priest, Fr. Moore, and a community activist, Robert Duggan, are interested in restoring safety along this stretch of roadway.  There were ten white crosses behind the backs of those who addressed the packed audience at the meeting from the main table.  Fr. Moore referred to the roadway in question as the \"valley of death\".  When this road was being designed and constructed between 1995 and 2002, when it opened, there were constant difficulties with the National Roads Authority, NRA, as it was at the time, and the engineer on the project.  Those who raised matters with regard to the road, including the local radio station, were often challenged legally so that they would stop doing so.  This happened to me as a member of the local council at the time.  To this day, nobody has officially opened the road.  Everyone in this House knows that when money is spent on a road, some politician will cut the tape.  I have nothing against that.  Even though this road was funded through the NRA, it is the road that nobody wanted.<\/p>  <p>  Every effort to get the NRA, and now Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport to look at the road has failed.  Money was allocated for an overpass on this stretch of road in 2012.  Everyone has been demanding such an overpass since the road was originally designed, but those responsible have still not given in and provided it, despite many deaths and numerous accidents.  Most of the accidents on this stretch of road are recorded by the local garda&iacute;, but others are not even reported.  This notorious piece of road, where two roads go into one, is the worst piece of engineering one will ever see.  The firm line of wire going down the centre of the road is a danger to motorcyclists and pedestrians, as we heard the other night.  Local people and others who want to travel in a certain direction on the road have to travel in the opposite direction so that they can turn back.  It is unbelievable that such a road was funded and constructed by the NRA.  If the NRA had taken account of the issues it ignored at that time, we would have a different, safer road now.  It was only when a local farmer, Donal Norris, drove his cattle down this road that the NRA was forced to provide a safe underpass.  He should not have had to encounter such difficulties as he sought to achieve his rights.  It was absolutely shocking that he was treated in such a way by a State agency.<\/p>  <p>  We are looking to the future now.  We are asking for a complete redesign of the roadway in question.  The redesign must take account of every single turn off the roadway and every single safety issue that has been raised with regard to it.  We are asking for funding to be made available immediately in order that overpasses can be provided and the necessary work can be done.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121400039#NN00400","speaker":"1248"},{"type":"speech","time":1481734200,"counter":436,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for observing the time limits.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121400039#NN00500","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1481734200,"counter":437,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy McGuinness for raising this important Topical Issue matter.

I intend to tell the Deputies at tomorrow's meeting that I am planning to ask Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, to respond to them and to report to me on this road purely in terms of safety.  I think that is the case Deputy McGuinness has made.  I hear many pleas for roads projects on Topical Issue matters, but it is unusual for me to hear such a compelling case from a safety perspective.  If the statistics mentioned by the Deputy are right, and they may well be, I think this should be looked at.

Perhaps the road is not as bad as the Deputy has suggested, but if it is that bad, he deserves to get a serious and considered response.<\/p>  <p>  As Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, I am responsible for overall policy and funding in relation to the national roads programme.  The planning, design and implementation of individual national road projects is a matter for TII under the Roads Acts 1993 to 2015 in conjunction with the local authorities concerned.  The assessment and prioritisation of individual projects are matters for TII in the first instance, within its capital budget, in accordance with section 19 of the Roads Act 1993.  Therefore, decisions relating to the N24 are operational matters for TII.  As I have said, I will ask TII for a direct response to what the Deputy has had to say.  The capital plan that was published in September 2015 outlined the Government's proposed transport investment priorities to 2022.  The transport element of the plan was framed by the conclusions reached in my Department&rsquo;s strategic investment framework for land transport.  This report highlighted the importance of maintaining and renewing transport infrastructure and making targeted investments to address particular bottlenecks and critical safety issues.  The capital plan provides &euro;6 billion for investment in the roads network in the period to 2022, with &euro;4.4 billion earmarked for the maintenance and strengthening of the existing extensive network throughout the country and &euro;1.6 billion earmarked for new projects.<\/p>  <p>  Allowing for the commitments relating to public private partnership projects, the balance available for new projects within the available capital envelope is limited.  As Minister, I have to work within the annual allocations set out in the plan.  In this context, the capital plan provides for a gradual build-up in capital funding from the current relatively low base towards the levels needed to support maintenance and improvement works.  It will take some years under the capital plan to restore steady-state funding levels for land transport.  There will have to continue to be a focus on the maintenance and renewal of infrastructure.  There will be a significant ramp-up in funding from 2020.  This will facilitate the construction of the road improvement projects included in the plan.<\/p><p> While available funding is not sufficient to address all the demands for improvement schemes, including schemes such as the upgrade of the N24, by the end of the plan period, I expect that capital funding for the road network will be back up to the levels needed to support maintenance and improvement works in the future.  On the possibility of additional funding within the plan period, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform indicated in his budget speech that he is bringing forward the capital plan review.  There is a strong case for additional funding for the transport sector, which I will make robustly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121400039#NN00600","speaker":"1213","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1481734800,"counter":439,"content":"<p>I must interrupt.

This is an issue that has gone on since 1995, right through the course of the design and building of the road in question.  It is so dangerous that, as I said, 500 people attended the meeting that was held.  I am asking the Minister whether he will come and examine that stretch of roadway.  In a contribution made earlier by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, in respect of a parliamentary question, she said that she indicates her priorities to Tusla.  I am asking the Minister, Deputy Ross, in the context of his priorities, which are safety on our roads and representation for local communities, whether he will agree to say to Transport Infrastructure Ireland that he wants the funds allocated to this project.<\/p>  <p>  Before he does that, will he come to visit the stretch of roadway involved so he can see for himself the plight of the local community and the desperate need for the road to be redesigned?  It is not good enough to have an analysis or a report.  We know what has happened.  The Minister should listen to the local community and respond to it by ensuring that safety is restored by investment in the road.  These are local people who use the road every day going to school or to work in Clonmel and Carrick-on-Suir, as well as others who use it by way of connection along the route.<\/p>  <p>  The money was there for an overpass and it was emphasised at the meeting to which I refer that had that money been spent when it was allocated in 2012, it would have relieved some of the issues.

I am disappointed that the senior Minister is not here but I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne.<\/p><p>In mid-November, the Fianna F&aacute;il spokesperson on health, Deputy Kelleher, made two impassioned speeches in this House following a meeting with members of the Scoliosis Advocacy Network who are campaigning very actively on behalf of their children and other children.  Deputy Kelleher read a number of case studies into the record of the House and I want to update the Minister of State on one of them.  Mary, whose name has been changed to protect her identity, was diagnosed at age ten in May 2013 with a 40&deg; spinal curve at Mullingar General Hospital.  She was referred to Our Lady's Children's Hospital Crumlin for urgent review by a specialist.  She was obliged to wait 11 months before she could see a consultant.  During this 11-month wait, Mary's curve deteriorated from 40&deg; to 90&deg;.  At that point, she required urgent surgery to halt the progress of her spinal curve.  In fact, she required two significantly invasive surgeries and would need to have some of her ribs removed.  This was due to the long wait and the deterioration in her condition.  She finally made it to theatre 17 months after her diagnosis for her first surgery and her curve was well over 100&deg; at that point.  Unfortunately, Mary now finds herself back on a waiting list for surgery to correct a failed fusion and there is no date in sight for this procedure.<\/p><p>Last week the Kilkenny scoliosis advocacy group wrote to update me on Mary's case and explained the following:<\/p><blockquote>The pin which had become dislodged months ago has now moved and become septic.  This child should not have been left wait months and months for this surgery.  The fact is that the only way our children can access surgery is when they are in fact in a health crisis.  This is shameful and of course we will be highlighting it with Minister Simon Harris.  Before I left Our Lady's Children's Hospital Crumlin with my son after his surgery, I was told if a rod breaks or dislodges its ok.  Don't present to Our Lady's Children's Hospital but go to a GP.  This advice is totally unacceptable but indicative of the service our children are receiving.  There has been a normalisation and acceptance of poor care and after care by teams involved in our children's care.<\/blockquote><p>I am not going to stand in the House today and play politics with this issue but I have promised these women face to face that I will continue to raise these issues on their behalf.  I understand the Minister has visited many hospitals around the country since taking over a very difficult brief, and that he is taking on his Ministry with determination and vigour, which is encouraging.  However, these women are acutely aware of the current situation facing those on scoliosis waiting lists and this is a very damming assessment.<\/p><p>I acknowledge that commitments have been made for new theatres in Crumlin but the crux of the issue is that the longer we wait for policies to be implemented, the more children will be subjected to severe, long-term and, in some cases, irreparable damage while they wait.  July 2017 has been stated as a timeline for the recruitment of additional consultants and for various policies to be implemented but we must be able to speed up this process.  I have also heard statements about the difficulties surrounding recruitment but we must implement a more imaginative approach to attracting staff, particularly theatre nurses, on a short-term basis for these specific cases.  We could recruit paediatric theatre nurses and additional consultants for several months to ensure extra capacity in the theatres in Crumlin to address this issue.<\/p><p>I am interested in hearing the Minister of State's thoughts on this potential strategy and I would like to ask her what progress has been made in reducing waiting times since we raised these issues one month ago.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121400040#OO00900","speaker":"1368"},{"type":"speech","time":1481735400,"counter":448,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Aylward for raising this matter.  I am pleased to take this opportunity to update the House on scoliosis services.  Long waiting times for scoliosis surgery are not acceptable, and the Department is working closely with the Health Service Executive, HSE, to address services pressures, particularly in Our Lady's Children's Hospital Crumlin, which is the largest provider of scoliosis surgery for children and young people.<\/p>  <p>  Additional funding of &euro;1.042 million was allocated under the 2015 service plan to increase capacity at Crumlin, and further resources of &euro;0.987 million were allocated under the 2016 service plan for orthopaedics and trauma to address service needs in Crumlin.  The HSE is actively working with the hospital to advance the development of orthopaedic services, including spinal surgery services, which will have a positive effect on access for scoliosis patients.  All patients on the waiting list are clinically triaged by a consultant as to their acuity and surgeries are carried out in order of clinical priority and waiting time, in order to provide an equitable service.<\/p>  <p>  The number of consultant orthopaedic surgeons at Crumlin has increased by 1.5 whole time equivalents.  The construction of a new orthopaedic theatre in Crumlin has been completed.  This new facility will provide capacity for additional scoliosis activity in 2017.  However, the use of this theatre is dependent on the recruitment of additional theatre nurses.  While the hospital continues to successfully recruit nursing staff, balancing this with attrition rates, maternity leave and sick leave continues to present a challenge.  The Children's Hospital Group is exhausting every recruitment and retention avenue available to it, including international recruitment, and is proactively working on nurse recruitment to support the opening of the new theatre.<\/p>  <p>  In order to improve access in the short term, the HSE winter initiative 2016-17 includes &euro;2 million provided specifically for surgery for scoliosis patients.  To date under this initiative, 54 patients have been treated, have received appointments for treatment or been removed from the waiting list through clinical validation.  This includes nine additional patients who have had their surgery at Crumlin and eight who have been given treatment dates.  In addition, 23 patients have had surgery, or are scheduled for surgery, at Blackrock Clinic.  Crumlin is continuing to work through a capacity plan to schedule patients that do not meet the age and clinical criteria for surgery in another hospital.<\/p>  <p>  In an effort to address inpatient and outpatient spinal orthopaedic waiting lists at Tallaght hospital, an additional half-time consultant was appointed in late 2014.  In 2015, some &euro;1 million was provided by the HSE to fund 100 degenerate spinal surgeries at Tallaght.  An additional consultant is due to also start work at the hospital in July 2017.<\/p>  <p>  The Department will continue to work with the HSE and the relevant hospitals to ensure improvements in access to spinal surgery.  The Children's Hospital Group is engaging with the scoliosis advocacy groups on developing a partnership approach to the design and planning of services for children with scoliosis.  This provides an opportunity for them to work with hospitals and consultants in the design and planning of paediatric scoliosis services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121400041#PP00100","speaker":"1307"},{"type":"speech","time":1481735400,"counter":449,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for her response and I hope she will appreciate that I am not trying to be political in any way, shape or form on this particular issue but we must do everything we can in the coming weeks and months to shorten these waiting lists.

This is life-changing surgery and access to the surgery is the crux of this issue.  We must get the theatres adequately staffed to increase the capacity and reduce the waiting times.

If they are treated at that stage, it will save money on major surgery later on.  More money should be put into early diagnosis and treatment for these children before the situation becomes critical.  In Mary's case, she was left for 12 months and her curve went from 40<sup>o<\/sup>to 100<sup>o<\/sup>degrees before the surgery was carried out.  If that child had been seen when the curve was at 40<sup>o<\/sup>, it would have saved a lot of money for the State and a lot of pain for the child.

The same Taoiseach, together with the Ministers, Deputies Humphreys and Donohoe, only last week launched a cultural Ireland initiative, a plan focused upon and emphasising the importance of arts, culture and music for the next five years, with an emphasis on children learning music from the age of five onwards notable in its objectives.<\/p><p>The Taoiseach reminded us in that keynote address at NUIG that many of those who sacrificed their lives to establish our political freedom were writers, poets and musicians.  They were artists who were motivated as much by cultural concerns as anything else.  If the Taoiseach is correct, and I believe he is dead right in this matter, then, to date, we politicians have let down the artistic community of Ireland in a big way, and none more so than the Irish musical community that we are representing today with this Bill.  Why?  It is because in the Ireland of 2016, 100 years after musicians like Eamonn Ceannt made the ultimate sacrifice and died for the country's cultural independence, Irish music, of all genres, is no longer deemed worthy to be played on Irish radio during daylight hours.  I am here to urge the representatives of all parties to help me bring back Irish music from night-time to prime time on our airwaves from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m.  If we are serious about protecting our musical culture rather than paying lip-service, the only way it can be achieved is through legislation.<\/p><p>A common concern among the politicians who attended the musical community&rsquo;s lobbying day for a music quota in this building at the end of September was that the amendment Bill that I am seeking to introduce might contravene EU competition law.  However, this is not so.  The EU, believe it or not, sanctioned an Irish music quota as far back as the 1990s, soon after Mr. Niall Stokes took over the chair of the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI.  That was at a time when, according to Mr. Stokes, &quot;very little Irish music was being played on Irish radio and in particular on the big independent stations&quot;.  He succeeded in winning the support of the board of the BAI for the introduction of a 30% Irish music quota.  However, when the independent Irish radio sector got wind of Mr. Stokes's initiative, it made a complaint to the European Commission that the measure was anti-competitive.  It is hard to believe that a body of Irish broadcasters would mount a campaign against their fellow citizens working in music, but it is on record that this is what happened.<\/p><p>In a hard-hitting article published in <i>Hot Press<\/i>magazine and covering an Independent Broadcasters of Ireland, IBI, conference that took place in 2008, Mr. Stokes outlined how he and the chief executive of the BAI, Mr. Michael O&rsquo;Keeffe, who still holds that position, engaged in detailed negotiations with Brussels and prevailed on the basis of a cultural exception.  Mr. Stokes wrote:<\/p><blockquote>It took some persuasion, but it was accepted eventually by the EC that music was an essential part of Ireland&rsquo;s culture and its national resource - and therefore that it was valid to put measures in place to protect it.  And\u00a0we agreed a definition with the EC of what constituted Irish music.<\/blockquote><p>The acceptance by the EU of the wording that Niall Stokes, Michael O&rsquo;Keeffe and EU officials hammered out for what constitutes Irish music back then demonstrates beyond a shadow of a doubt that the EU is not opposed to the principle that Ireland is entitled to introduce legislation to protect our musical culture.  Though there is no clear reason given in Mr. Stokes's <i>Hot Press<\/i>piece of 2008 for why the amendment was not implemented.  The remainder of his article offers stark clues as to who may have been responsible for ensuring that the introduction of an Irish music quota back in the 1990s did not take place.<\/p><p>  Referring to a <i>Hot Press<\/i>-run Irish music seminar that took place in the RDS in October 2007, Mr. Stokes described a shocking moment when the then head of Today FM, Mr. Willie O&rsquo;Reilly, pointed an accusatory finger at Niall and criticised him for seeking to introduce a 30% quota for home-grown music on Irish radio, suggesting that a far more reasonable position had been advanced by Mr. Dave Pennefather of Universal Music, who had asked that 5% of air time be devoted to Irish music.  The staggeringly low value that the then head of the Irish division of one of the world&rsquo;s largest international record companies put on Irish music, and the endorsement of it by the leading independent Irish radio sector boss, may explain why a little further on in the same article, Mr. Stokes wrote, &quot;In the early 1990s, the big urban commercial radio stations were playing as little as 3% Irish music&quot;.  Mr. Stokes&rsquo;s condemnation of this figure is blistering,  &quot;It amounted to nothing short of a scandalous disregard for Irish music&quot;.<\/p><p>If a one-time chairman of the board of the BAI can be outraged to this extent by the manipulating ways of the independent Irish radio sector in collusion with multi-national interests, and be outwitted by them, then surely this is a clear indication that nothing short of legislative change in this area has to be implemented in order to enshrine the principle in law.  lf the House does not believe that things are as bad as they are for Irish music of all the genres - including rock, pop, indie pop and everything else - then it should take what Mr. Louis Walsh, the Svengali of Irish popular music, had to say recently when he observed that it is a scandal that one of the Dublin stations to be most recently granted a license plays no Irish music at all.<\/p><p>  The bottom line for commercial enterprises such as independent radio stations and the multinational powers that feed and shape them is monetary profit, but they cannot be allowed to run roughshod over a nation&rsquo;s culture in the pursuit of high ratings and advertising revenue.  That is where the Government comes in.  As elected representatives, it is our duty to protect and nourish the creative spirit of our citizens.  As the Taoiseach has rightly admitted, &quot;we have utterly failed them in this regard&quot;.  Even if the French had not shown us the way, and we all know what they have done, we Irish are operating at a complete disadvantage compared with all our European counterparts because radio audiences throughout Europe still have an appetite to hear a high percentage of their music in their mother tongues.  This automatically translates into air time and placement on playlists for their musical communities.  The most recent statistics for Ireland show that that a mere three Irish acts registered in the top 50 songs played on Irish radio in recent years.<\/p><p>Let us look at the Canadian system.  It is one of the best regimes for promoting and supporting indigenous artists' music and recordings.  The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission, CRTC, requirements deriving from the Broadcasting Act of Canada mean that radio and television broadcasters must air a certain percentage of content that was at least partly written, produced, presented or otherwise contributed to by a person from Canada.  The percentage of air time devoted to Canadian music increased from 25% to 30% in the 1980s and to 35% in 1998.  They use the MAPL, system to define and identify Canadian content.  Some exemptions apply in genres with a limited number of recordings, for example, jazz.  We could do the same thing here.  We could have a quota.  If we got to 30%, we would be absolutely thrilled, but we are not getting to that.  The percentages in Canada must be met between 6 a.m. and 6 p.m. rather than during off-peak hours.<\/p><p>MAPL is an acronym for the criteria involved: &quot;M&quot; stands for music that must be composed entirely by a Canadian; &quot;A&quot; stands for artist, and the music or lyrics must be performed principally by a Canadian; &quot;P&quot; stands for performance, and the musical selection must consist of a performance that was recorded wholly in Canada, performed wholly in Canada or broadcast live in Canada; and &quot;L&quot; stands for lyrics that are written entirely by a Canadian.  There are special cases in which a musical selection may qualify and they are set.  The final criteria was added in 1991 to accommodate Bryan Adams's album, &quot;Waking Up the Neighbours&quot;, which unusually did not meet the Canadian content, CanCon, standard, despite every track being co-written and performed by a Canadian artist.  Adams had recorded the album mainly in England.  Although some recording work was done in Canada, no track on the album qualified under the MAPL criteria.  Adams also collaborated on the writing of the album with British record producer, Mr. Robert John Lange, with both being credited as co-writers of words and music of every cut on the album.  As a result, no song on the album featured either music or lyrics written entirely by a Canadian.  Therefore, none of the songs on the album qualified under the MAPL criteria.  All of this meant that no track on the album qualified under what were the existing CanCon rules.  Had Adams and Lange simply agreed to credit one party with 100% of the music and the other with 100% of the lyrics, all of their collaborations would have counted under the CanCon rules.  However, the Canadians got over that and devised a solution.  That is the last time what I have outlined happened.  The system in question could be introduced in this country.<\/p><p>A nation is surely defined by its culture.  It is difficult to fathom why we Irish have allowed one of our greatest cultural assets, our music and song, to be effectively banished from our prime-time radio airwaves in recent decades.  It happened gradually and that is why we did not notice it, but happen it did.  That is why the Irish music community has come here to support the introduction of legislation that would underpin an Irish music quota for commercial, State-owned or State-backed Irish radio.  RT&Eacute; is involved in this as well.  It would bring Irish music of all genres back to our airwaves.<\/p><p>Let us look back to the 1960s and 1970s.  We are acutely aware of the music and artists that were promulgated during those halcyon days, with a plethora of sponsored programmes including those of Val Joyce, Brendan Balfe, Harry Thuillier, The Waltons and the Top 10 Show.  All of that was on our national radio.  Why do we not bring back those sponsored programmes to RT&Eacute; Radio 1?  They were daily promoting and supporting the latest artists that produced Irish records of all genres, including Joe Dolan and the Drifters, Brendan Bowyer, the Dixies, The Freshmen, Big Tom, Foster and Allen, Margo, Se&aacute;n &Oacute; S&eacute;, Fiddler's Green and many hundreds more.  Their song and music was heard in every home throughout the State.  Just one incident comes to mind.  My late mother listened assiduously to these programmes throughout the day as she did her housework.  She learned the words of one song.  I remember it well.  It was called &quot;Gentle Mother&quot;.  At her knee, we learnt the words of that song.  That goes to show how radio can influence and disseminate music and song.<\/p><p>We appreciate the great value that mainstream popular music and culture has worldwide.  We realise the great bonding effect that popular music and culture has had among nations throughout the world.  We are strongly of the view that the legislative enactment of an Irish music quota will enhance rather than diminish our contribution to the vitality and purity of worldwide culture.<\/p><p>During the course of this campaign, I have been extremely lucky to make contact with hundreds of musical artists, composers and managers, many of whom were people to whom I would have listened or about whom I would have read.  I include in that Steve and Joe Wall of The Stunning, an iconic rock band of some fame.  A few minutes listening to them was instructive and educational.  It demonstrates that our focus is on all genres and types of music.<\/p><p>There were various campaigns over the years to promote Irish musicians and their music but it all fell on deaf ears, apart from some great disc jockeys and shows that were committed to playing Irish music, mostly after 7 p.m.  The situation has worsened.  Steve Wall's words echo precisely what hundreds of other artists, many of them in the Gallery tonight, in all genres of music have relayed to me and confirmed as fact.  People have told me of their experiences.  I am reflecting what fellow musicians have told me, young and old, established or trying to get into the business, about how difficult it is to get out of the traps.  Weasel words, half truths or downright lies should not be used to shield us from the reality.<br\/><br\/>One radio station told a member of an indie pop band that I know very well that his band would be excluded by my Bill but nothing could be further from the truth.  His father rang me and was very upset but nothing could be further from the truth.  That just goes to show what has been said about this legislation.<br\/><br\/>Steve Wall said that between The Stunning and The Walls, he has spent thousands of euro making records in this country.  T. R. Dallas said that one would not see change from &euro;15,000 by the time one has paid the studio, sound engineers, musicians, graphic designers, pressing plants and printers.  Once a recording is made, artists usually hire the services of a public relations company to present the single to radio stations.  It is at this point that artists need guts of steel.  After all the money that is spent on recording and public relations, the PR company prepares and aggregates a weekly update showing the response from radio stations.  <br\/><br\/>We must explain to those running radio stations that Irish musicians are spending their hard-earned money in this country and not just on all of the services listed above.  They also incur considerable expenses when they go on tour.  They must pay for van hire and fuel, hire a crew, pay their wages and provide food and accommodation.  T.R. Dallas said that he would usually pay five or six people when he goes on tour.  When the Michael English dance band goes on tour, 15 people are involved.  That is 15 wage packets and 15 people with jobs.  Air play is the key to putting bums on seats and enabling music venues to open on Wednesday or Thursday nights, employing additional staff.  Air play creates jobs.  Steve Wall explained this to one radio station executive who had never considered it before but the station still did not play his single.  <br\/><br\/>Steve Wall also acknowledged that the late 1980s into the 1990s was a great time for Irish music, mainly thanks to 2FM which played copious amounts of Irish music.  Indeed, 2FM was the only show in town and Irish artists were all over the airwaves.  They were also all over television during that time.  We must acknowledge the efforts of Niall Stokes and the compelling case he makes.  However, his calls have fallen on deaf ears which is why we are here tonight.  Some Irish artists are afraid to speak out for fear of burning bridges.  These are the facts emanating from the mouths of Irish musicians who, by any standards, have been successful in their chosen genres.  It should be acknowledged that many musicians are here tonight and many more have supported the campaign for the implementation of this legislation, including Phil Coulter, Johnny Sheahan, Mick Foster, Tony Allen, Tom Allen, Peter Mooney, Danny Mc Carthy, Johnny Duhan, Frank Kilbride, Bernard Newman, Ollie Kennedy and a host of others.  They have stated that their careers are nearly behind them but they are here tonight so that young musicians will have a future.  They want to see the development of the next U2, Phil Lynnott, Christy Moore, Paul Brady or the Dubliners.  I see that Deputy Ciaran Cannon, another good musician, is also in the Gallery.  Phil Coulter said that if he wrote &quot;The Town I Loved So Well&quot; or &quot;Scorn Not His Simplicity&quot;, Paul Brady wrote &quot;The Island&quot; or Johnny Duhan wrote &quot;The Voyage&quot; today, they would not get out of the traps.  <br\/><br\/>Deputies are going to vote against this legislation tonight and by doing so they will ensure that the next generation of Irish musicians will not get out of the traps.  I do not want to hear their mealy mouthed weasel words, suggesting that the legislation is regressive.  Why not let the Bill go forward to Committee Stage to be sorted out?  They are afraid because a few radio stations contacted them.  Let us be honest about it and tell the truth.  <br\/><br\/>There is a particular onus on RTE, as our national broadcaster, to ensure that Irish music and artists are promoted, particularly as it is in receipt of millions of euro from the television licence fee.  RTE must be included in the legislation.  I will acknowledge that in the past 12 months, Ryan Tubridy has given a number of acts good exposure on &quot;The Late Late Show&quot;.  Of course, he is a quick learner.  When the tribute to Big Tom was broadcast, the programme had an audience of 1 million.  Likewise, 1 million people watched the All Ireland Fleadh Cheoil on television.  The fleadh was held in the beautiful town of Ennis and attracted over 300,000 people.  Clearly, there is an audience for these acts and events when they are televised or broadcast.  RTE will be included in this legislative amendment, notwithstanding what those who are against it would say.  I have a copy of the Broadcasting Act 2009 in front of me and I know the section that is relevant.  If my Bill needs an amendment to ensure that RTE is included, then I will amend it.  <br\/><br\/>I am not claiming that the Bill is foolproof or perfect.  I accept that agreeing a definition of Irish music presents a challenge but that challenge could be met in committee.  This Bill should be referred to committee but cowardice prevails and bureaucrats are winning the day.  That issue and others could be addressed by the collective wisdom of all our legislators.  The people in the Gallery this evening are very disappointed.  I am of the view that the Minister would like to support this Bill but he has been stymied.  To say that I am disappointed is an understatement.  However, my disappointment pales into insignificance when compared to the level of disappointment among musicians and artists at the attitude that has been displayed by the Government and by Fianna F&aacute;il.  If Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies look at the Gallery tonight, they will see a number of their own loyal supporters, top class musicians who are shocked.  They cannot believe that Fianna F&aacute;il will not support this Bill.<br\/><br\/>I acknowledge that some of the regional radio stations are working hard and playing a pivotal role in the promotion of Irish music.  Indeed, I have no doubt that for every hour of music they play, at least 20 to 25 minute is devoted to Irish acts.  As Tom Allen said to me, out of every ten records, they should play three or four that are Irish.  I must pay credit to Tommy Marren, Paul Claffey and Gerry Lennon from Midwest Radio, Albert Fitzgerald, Will Faulkner, Joe Cooney and Paddy Duffy from Midlands Radio and Joe Finnegan, Frank Kilbride and Martin Donohoe of Shannonside Northern Sound.  I am of the view that the implementation of a quota would present no difficulty for those radio stations.  I spoke to some of the aforementioned presenters who wrote letters to various Deputies.  <br\/><br\/>There are also excellent broadcasters in our national radio station, including Fiachna &Oacute; Braon&aacute;in from the Hot House Flowers, who has an encyclopaedic knowledge of music, and John Creedon, but their shows are on too late at night.  The music must be played between 6 a.m. and 6 p.m. or between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m.  That is what is done in every other country but we are too cowardly.  It is a shame.  The prime time hours between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m. is the right time to broadcast programmes that boost Irish artists across all of the genres.  <br\/><br\/>Many independent radio stations contacted me about the fact that RTE is not included in the Bill.  In my view, RTE is clearly caught by the legislation which only amends the principal Act of 2009 and section 114, subsection 2(a) is instructive in this regard.  That said, I am prepared to amend the Bill so as to put the issue beyond doubt.  <br\/><br\/>The disappointment among musicians is palpable.  These people are going out and creating employment.  At least 15 wage packets are generated by the likes of Nathan Carter, Michael English, Foster and Allen and others.  It is a big industry.  Stephen Travers, a former member of the Miami Showband, told me that there are 8,000 to 10,000 jobs involved here.  Do Deputies have any concept of what is involved?  Bands like the Miami Showband burst onto the scene because we had a radio station promoting them in the 1960s and the 1970s.  There was &quot;Spotlight&quot; magazine and all sorts of avenues for promotion which I recall very well.  We must give Irish musicians a chance again.  I urge the Minister to allow the Bill to go forward to Committee Stage.  We can deal with any issues that arise there.  The Minister can bring forward amendments, get the advice of the Attorney General or of senior counsel if he likes.  Deputy James Browne is an eminent barrister and he knows this can be done.  I am surprised that he is here tonight to argue against it because he knows it is possible.  He comes from a county with a great musical and cultural tradition and that is what this Bill is about.  <br\/><br\/>These musicians will be in demand.  When Deputies want to organise a charity event, the very first port of call are these Irish musicians and they respond.  If a place has gone on fire or a building needs to be restored, they are there.  When there are Christmas parties for the elderly in hospital, they are there.  They are not looking for any money.  They do it because they love it.  They do it for the love of the music.<br\/><br\/>I appeal to the House to allow the Bill to proceed to Committee Stage.  Let us work on it together.  I am not omnipotent and do not have any divine right, to be straight.  The Minister, Deputy Naughten, comes from a great area and Brendan Shine, who is next door to the Minister's own bailiwick, is behind this legislation.  If the Minister looks at the back of <i>SHIP<\/i>magazine he will see who is supporting this Bill.  There are 10,000 people affected by this.<\/p><p>The Minister should give them a chance.<\/p> <p> Every independent radio station gets a licence and the aspiration is that it would play 30% of Irish music.  How many of them play the required 30% of Irish music?  How is that measured?  The 30% could be played at 3 o'clock in the morning.  We all know it is a joke.  We should correct the anomalies and amend the legislation to make sure it is better legislation.  I propose the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121400042#TT00600","speaker":"1370","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1481737200,"counter":464,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Penrose for publishing this legislation.

There were meetings with the then Minister, Alex White, on this in the past and the issue consistently has been to try to come up with a satisfactory and workable definition.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy is proposing the introduction of a 40% quota for Irish music to be played by Irish radio stations.  The definition in the Bill is extremely vague and I do not believe it would assist the Irish music industry if introduced; rather, because of its vagueness, I believe it is likely to exclude a range of types of music written by Irish musicians.  It would also be unworkable from a practical regulatory point of view.<\/p>  <p>  The wording refers to musical composition that relates to some distinguishing element of the culture of the island of Ireland.  Who is to decide what those distinguishing elements are to be?  For example, will it encompass electronica music such as techno, ambient or downtempo?  Furthermore, in a multi-cultural society such as we have now, how should we treat music written or enjoyed by those Irish citizens of African, eastern European or South American heritage?<\/p>  <p>  I fully recognise the efforts that Deputy Penrose has made in attempting to come up with a useful definition.  For instance, he has tried to avoid the pitfall of setting a definition based on nationality or residence which would be in breach of EU law on the grounds that it would discriminate against other European artists.  The introduction of a quota along these lines was attempted previously by Niall Stokes, as referenced by Deputy Penrose, and was rejected by the European Commission.  The definition was then replaced by one that was so vague as to make it unworkable.  That is the same situation that would arise if Deputy Penrose&rsquo;s Bill was enacted.<\/p>  <p>  The current system, where stations volunteer Irish music commitments in their programme policy statements, was introduced to avoid this problem.  This system works well, and while I believe there is room for improvement, I do not believe Deputy Penrose&rsquo;s proposal would lead to any improvement.  RTE is the biggest supporter of Irish music and artists in Ireland.  Irish artists and musicians receive significant support across radio, television, orchestra and online platforms.  A number of shows on both TV and radio are dedicated to the air play of Irish music.  In the case of commercial radio stations, they already have a 30% Irish music quota as part of their licence agreement with the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI.  Many of these stations play over and above that particular percentage.  Editorial independence is essential to ensure diversity and the imposition of a quota representing a certain type of music is not workable.  Independent radio stations are reliant on commercial revenue and their business plans are guided by audience levels.  Stations broadcast what their audiences wish to hear and if they did not, audiences would switch to other stations resulting in decreased listenership and thus reducing revenues and potential job losses.<\/p>  <p>  The quota in France is frequently raised in this debate.  It should be noted that this quota requires air play of music in the French language.  A similar quota for Ireland would require that the music played was in the Irish language.  That would be too restrictive and contrary to the purpose of Deputy Penrose's Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121400044#VV01900","speaker":"1234"},{"type":"speech","time":1481737200,"counter":482,"content":"<p>Who wrote this?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121400044#VV02000","speaker":"1349"},{"type":"speech","time":1481737200,"counter":483,"content":"<p>A quota system was also introduced in South Africa in July of this year.  Difficulties have arisen with the implementation of this quota.  The Johannesburg based station Metro FM, for example, has lost over 3 million listeners since the introduction of a quota as its play lists have changed significantly.  This is a serious loss of revenue and not a situation I would like to see in Ireland when stations are already having to compete with Internet radio and online streaming.<\/p>  <p>  It is my view that the best approach to be followed on this issue is one that takes account of all the relevant stakeholders, where we can have direct engagement with the radio sector with a view to establishing a mutually acceptable treatment of Irish music.  That approach is likely to produce a far more successful and sustainable position on this issue, rather than seeking the imposition of an artificial quota.<\/p>  <p>  At my request, the Joint Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment is currently carrying out a broad review of the funding of public service broadcasting in Ireland, including a public consultation and engagement with relevant stakeholders.  One suggestion that has arisen from the committee&rsquo;s discussions has been the creation of a forum on broadcasting, and I have confirmed to the committee my support for this proposal.<\/p>  <p>  This is an important issue which requires careful consideration.  It affects both the Irish music industry and the Irish radio industry.  That is the reason I oppose the Bill and suggest that the issue be discussed in the proposed forum, which would be a more appropriate course of action rather than seeking a legislative solution that would have the opposite outcome to what the Deputy is seeking to achieve.  I accept the principle of what Deputy Penrose is saying.  I have said that to him privately.  I have told him that the major challenge has been the definition.  I agree with Deputy Penrose that we should use the collective wisdom of our legislators.  That is why I suggest to him that he should allow the committee, through the proposed forum on broadcasting, to come forward with recommendations that deal practically with the issues he has raised.<\/p>  <p>  I accept that we need to look at this and I am prepared to work with Deputy Penrose and the committee to see how we can progress this issue in a real and practical manner.  The difficulty, as I have said to Deputy Penrose privately and publicly, is the issue of the definition.  This issue was examined over many years by a number of Ministers.  Deputy Penrose is aware of the difficulties in coming up with a definition.  If someone can come up with one that is workable, I am prepared to consider it but let the collective wisdom of the legislators be used.  It should be discussed via the forum on broadcasting to see if we should go down the legislative route or if there is another mechanism through the licensing of the broadcasters that we can use to achieve the same goal regarding it.  For that reason, I cannot accept the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121400044#VV02100","speaker":"1234"},{"type":"speech","time":1481737200,"counter":484,"content":"<p>We now move to Deputies Lawless and Butler, who have 20 minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121400044#VV02200","speaker":"1261"},{"type":"speech","time":1481737200,"counter":485,"content":"<p>I am sharing time with Deputy Butler; another colleague may join us.<\/p><p>I thank Deputy Penrose for introducing this legislation to the House.  I acknowledge the presence in the Chamber of representatives of both sides of the debate, which is welcome.  It is a pleasant change to have such interest in a Bill being debated in the House.<\/p><p> I regret to say that Fianna F&aacute;il will not be supporting this Bill on this occasion and I will outline a number of concerns and reasons that is so.  Of course, we are and always have been 100% supportive of local and indigenous production of music and culture, but we feel the quota system is unworkable.  Quotas of any kind are an imperfect mechanism.  Quotas are inappropriate, particularly in this space.<\/p> <p> It is worth noting at the outset that quotas of 25% to 30%, depending on the station and the contracts awarded, are already in effect.  The proposal to increase this to 40% seems a bridge too far, and I will outline a number of reasons.<\/p> <p> I am not convinced that quotas have worked internationally.  The Deputy made reference to international quotas.  France is the most often cited example.  South Africa also introduced quotas.  Canada, maybe for similar reasons, experimented with a quota system as well.  The motivation in those cases was more a language motivation than a cultural motivation, and that may be at the heart of this Bill.  That may be where the dichotomy occurs, if there is a misunderstanding between the sides of the House on this issue.  If this is a language Bill, let us call it a language Bill and let us take it as such and deal with it separately.  At present, it appears to be a cultural Bill involving a cultural quota, and as the Minister stated, it is difficult to define how that might come about.<\/p> <p> The experience internationally has not been exclusively positive.  If we look at Canada, the city of Montreal was riven apart.  Digressing a little, in 1976, Montreal was a fine city and it hosted the Olympic Games.  A decade later, the city was in tatters.  Most of its economy had migrated to other parts of the state.  A lot of this was due to language laws and faction fighting within.  Of course, its quota laws pertained to language barriers rather than quotas.  In France and in Canada, I understand these are language quotas as opposed to a cultural music quota.  In fact, in France, they reversed the legislation.  The legislature in France reversed it, back down to 30% from what it had been.  At one stage, there was a notable boycott when radio stations boycotted the quota that was in place and got away with doing so.<\/p> <p> On the point about forced cultural consumption, there is an ongoing debate about the Irish language and how we teach it and educate, and why after 80 years of compulsory Irish, we do not have a fluent Irish speaking population.  Perhaps it is because it is forced.  Perhaps forced quotas are not the way forward for any aspect of education or cultural promotion.  Forced culture is unwelcome and the recipient often regurgitates it.  As has been proven, it is not the way to go about it.<\/p> <p> In terms of the language, we have mentioned the EU difficulties.  The Minister touched on that.  I am also aware that my colleagues, the former MEPs, Deputy Gallagher and Mr. Liam Aylward, and Mr. Brian Crowley MEP, submitted a parliamentary question in the European Parliament which found that the quota would be difficult to satisfy European legislation.  I appreciate the Deputy has made attempts to address that in this Bill but I am not quite sure it is there yet.<\/p> <p> Another difficulty I and my partner see with the Bill is the difficulty in defining what the definition means.  I referenced it again while the Deputy was speaking.  I listened carefully to a number of the points the Deputy made but I am not quite sure what the \"distinguishing element of the culture of the island of Ireland\" means.  We can all guess what it means but as an eminent barrister, the Deputy will know a court might not always agree on something as nebulous as that.  If an Irish artist was to perform opera, would that satisfy the definition?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121400044#VV02300","speaker":"1323","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1481737800,"counter":487,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121400045#WW00200","speaker":"1353"},{"type":"speech","time":1481737800,"counter":488,"content":"<p>If a hip-hop band were to emerge, would that measure up?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121400045#WW00300","speaker":"1323"},{"type":"speech","time":1481737800,"counter":489,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121400045#WW00400","speaker":"1370"},{"type":"speech","time":1481737800,"counter":490,"content":"<p>Of course.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121400045#WW00500","speaker":"1349"},{"type":"speech","time":1481737800,"counter":491,"content":"<p>We cannot say categorically whether that is true or not.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121400045#WW00600","speaker":"1323"},{"type":"speech","time":1481737800,"counter":492,"content":"<p>Of course, one can.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121400045#WW00700","speaker":"1353"},{"type":"speech","time":1481737800,"counter":493,"content":"<p>Of course, one can.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121400045#WW00800","speaker":"1253"},{"type":"speech","time":1481737800,"counter":494,"content":"<p>A court would have to identify.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121400045#WW00900","speaker":"1323"},{"type":"speech","time":1481737800,"counter":495,"content":"<p>Of course.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121400045#WW01000","speaker":"1370"},{"type":"speech","time":1481737800,"counter":496,"content":"<p>Sorry, excuse me, we cannot.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121400045#WW01100","speaker":"1323"},{"type":"speech","time":1481737800,"counter":497,"content":"<p>That is Irish.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121400045#WW01200","speaker":"1253"},{"type":"speech","time":1481737800,"counter":498,"content":"<p>We are dancing on the top of a pin here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121400045#WW01300","speaker":"1370"},{"type":"speech","time":1481737800,"counter":499,"content":"<p>Deputy Penrose alluded to the foundation of the State, \"An Claidheamh Soluis\", the Gaelic League and such cultural movements at the beginning of the century which led the Irish national cultural revolution.

The legislation does not appear to be crystal clear.  It appears to be open to debate.  The fact that we are even arguing it in this debate alone highlights that.<\/p>  <p>  Looking again to the French experience, Daft Punk, an internationally successful eminent French outfit, could not get played on the French airwaves because of the quota legislation that was in place.  It was not a French language outfit and, therefore, it could not qualify.  That also highlights the difficulty.<\/p>  <p>  How do we quantify this?  I do not know how we quantify it.  I can imagine how we quantify it but I am not sure how a court would interpret that.  In legislation, we have to be a little clearer in how we do that.  Meaning no disrespect, I appreciate the intent, but as it is currently formulated I cannot see how that would work.<\/p>  <p>  We have to consider it is unduly restrictive of the Irish independent radio sector.  We are unique in this country in that, unlike, say, France and other European states, we are English language speaking.  It is our vernacular, although not our first language, and that means we are automatically catapulted onto the same stage as the United States, the United Kingdom and many other English-speaking content producers.  That makes it infinitesimally more difficult for our content producers to produce on the English-language media than anywhere else.  That is already a challenge, and a challenge that RTE, as a public service broadcaster, has to grapple with, but also that independent radio stations have to grapple with.<\/p>  <p>  We are in a digital age.  I do not see how the legislation, as I understand it, could apply to the likes of Spotify, Internet radio, digital radio, digital streaming, consumption via the web, consumption via television and consumption via multiple media.  It appears to focus on one particular sector of output and, without commenting on the merits or otherwise of that, it seems unfair and disproportionate to concentrate on one sector at the expense of others.<\/p>  <p>  Of course, it is a marketplace.  There is competition and if we are to restrict and place artificial inhibitions on one sector in a free market and allow the others run amok, that is not a recipe for success.  In that scenario, I would worry for the future of those independent radio stations which provide employment and an important public service remit in their news coverage and other aspects.<\/p>  <p>  The commercial viability has to be questioned as well in terms of the radio stations themselves.  For the most part, the ones we are talking about here are local.  They know their audience.  I was in my own local radio station, KFM, this morning and reviewed the schedule.  There are already multiple Irish language and Irish music programmes on the schedule - \"Irish Music Scene\", \"Ceol agus Caint\", \"K Country\" - but those broadcasters know their market audience and they meet that demand.  In a cultural expression, as much as anything else, the listeners hear what they want to hear.  If the station feels that the listeners are demanding more of a certain type of content, they will provide that.  The market finds its own level and the music market finds its own level in that regard.  If there was a clamour for increased music of a certain type, that probably would be reflected already in the schedules because these stations need market share to succeed.  My own local station, KFM, is on 49% radio share at present.  As it is, it is doing fairly okay and it meets the 30% compliance requirement that is already in place from the BAI.  I am not sure why we need to interfere and go beyond that.<\/p>  <p>  Something else we need to consider is an open point the Deputy and the Minister have queried.  My understand is RTE is not included in this legislation.  The Deputy suggested that if that is so, an amendment may correct that.  Certainly, as it is currently constituted, I do not see that RTE is included.  I have been informed that RTE is not covered in this legislation.  That would seem the elephant in the room.  If the largest, State broadcaster, with the resources of the licence fee-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121400045#WW01800","speaker":"1323"},{"type":"speech","time":1481737800,"counter":504,"content":"<p>I will cite the section for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121400045#WW01900","speaker":"1370"},{"type":"speech","time":1481737800,"counter":505,"content":"<p>-----behind it, is somehow exempt from this legislation, whether intentionally or accidentally, that would seem a significant imbalance towards the smaller independent radio stations that are trying to survive and meet the demands of their listenership and their market.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy alluded to this when he was introducing the Bill.  I refer to Fiddler's Green and Irish language and Irish music productions of note that were on RTE radio and perhaps RTE television.  If RTE is exempt, that is a moot point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121400045#WW02000","speaker":"1323"},{"type":"speech","time":1481737800,"counter":506,"content":"<p>It is not.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121400045#WW02100","speaker":"1353"},{"type":"speech","time":1481737800,"counter":507,"content":"<p>I do not think it applies.<\/p>  <p>  The way forward, rather than enforcing quotas on a certain sector of the output, is to promote stations such as TG4 and Raidi&oacute; na Gaeltachta.  There is no reason RTE could not introduce a new digital radio channel, if it wished to do so, with 100% music with an Irish, what is the expression, \"cultural identity\".  I do not know whether that has been explored.<\/p>  <p>  Ultimately, this comes back to choice and freedom, the choice that listeners make and the choice that a station makes to present.  Enforcing quantity as a measure rather than quality will always be a difficult one to balance.<\/p>  <p>  The other point that has been made to me is the question of how this Bill provides a guarantee.  The intention, which is extremely admirable and with which no one could quibble, is to promote new music sources, new media and indigenous artists coming through.  This is noble and something we all would wish to support.  There is no guarantee that under the legislation, as constituted, one could not put a U2, The Dubliners or Planxty song on repeat for 40% of the airtime and let it run.  That would satisfy it.  We might hear more of the same artists rather than hearing new artists coming through.  If the noble intention I referred to is the intention, let us address that in other ways as there are other ways we can do it.<\/p>  <p>  This has been raised already.  My understanding, as per the Minister, was that this was introduced, although not into the House.  I accept Deputy Penrose's clarification on that.<\/p><p>There were attempts to introduce this in the previous D&aacute;il when the Labour Party was in Government, but it did not get the Minister's approval at the time for some of the reasons we are now identifying as concerns.  That is a precedent we look to when something was attempted in the past.  The representative body, IASCA, the Irish Association of Songwriters, Composers &amp;amp; Authors, appears to be working with the local radio stations at present and with the industry.  I and many Deputies have received multiple representations from the independent radio stations and their representative bodies as well as from industry agencies, groups and lobby groups.  The Deputy suggests that they do not mean what they say, but I do not understand that.  I can only accept what is in writing before me.  If I receive an e-mail or a letter, I accept it in good faith and at face value.  I received multiple letters, e-mails and representations along those lines.  Again, I must accept them <i>prima facie<\/i>.  They say they are against the legislation for many reasons, including that they consider it unworkable, impractical and because such legislation has not succeeded elsewhere.  If it is a language matter, we should look at it in a separate context.<br\/><br\/>I am a member of the communications committee and I have not seen this on the committee's agenda since I was elected to the House.  Perhaps that is the appropriate forum for the Bill.  The artists, agencies and different representative groups could be brought before the committee, and I am sure the Minister would join us for that session, and the debate could proceed.  Perhaps the Bill could be reintroduced with RTE included and the vagueness around the cultural definition addressed.  Let us take some time to refine it by bringing it to the committee.  A discussion could be held there before introducing it again in the House.  At that point, it might go forward.<br\/><br\/>My party supports the general intent of the Bill, but as currently drafted I cannot see how it could work in practice.  The immediate negative impact on the independent radio sector appears to be too great a price to pay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121400045#WW02200","speaker":"1323","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1481738400,"counter":509,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill, and I do not doubt Deputy Penrose's passion on this subject.  Even though I, personally and as a member of Fianna F&aacute;il, do not favour 40% quotas, it does not mean I do not support Irish music, whether it is listening to the High Kings in the car when driving to Dublin, listening to Christy Moore on the way back down to Waterford or spending the last 15 years of my life going to Irish feiseanna with my daughter and listening to Irish music all day long at such events.  I do not accept that just because I do not support the 40% quota it means I do not support and love Irish music and culture.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill provides that sound broadcasting contracts are awarded to applicants on the condition that 40% of the transmission time for music be used for musical compositions that relate to \"some distinguishing element of the culture of the island of Ireland\".  Fianna F&aacute;il very much supports a viable broadcasting sector that reflects the interests of the people and offers quality content for its audiences, but it opposes this Bill on the grounds that it is impractical and will not serve Irish cultural producers or consumers well.  While Fianna F&aacute;il supports Irish cultural production, a quota is not the appropriate means to do so.  Instead, we must open dialogue and seek engagement with a broad array of interest groups to find a better solution that will not dampen Irish broadcasting.<\/p>  <p>  Yesterday and today, I spoke to the managing director of Waterford Local Radio, WLR FM, a radio station in Waterford that has a huge listenership.

In addition to the 33% daily output, WLR FM also broadcasts three separate Irish music programmes that air on Friday, Saturday and Sunday nights.  An Irish music feature promoting new Irish music is broadcast daily from Monday to Thursday on WLR FM.  These radio stations are not opposed to Irish music.  They have a strong public service remit and included in that is the promotion of Irish music of all genres.  It is one that independent radio stations are keen to fulfil.<\/p>  <p>  I also spoke to Gabrielle Cummins who is the managing director of Beat FM, which appeals to an audience of people between 15 and 35 years of age.  The station believes that this is a critical time for recruiting and retaining young listeners.  Ms Cummins said that the challenge is difficult and she believes that enforced quotas as high as the 40% proposed by the Labour Party would drive young ears even more quickly to streaming services such as Spotify and Apple Music.  I have a 19 year old and 23 year old at home and I see how often they have headphones on to listen to Spotify and Apple Music.  Irish artists have a much better chance of decent exposure on Irish radio than on Spotify or Apple Music playlists because they get decent rotations on air.  If the legislation is passed, the end result could create a worse situation for Irish music artists if fewer young people are listening to radio.<\/p>  <p>  I also note that the proposed legislation only appears to cover independent radio and will not impact on RTE.  That is undemocratic.  The public service broadcaster should be to the fore in championing new Irish music, yet no quotas exist for its stations.  The Bill is an aggressive measure both for our cultural production and the broadcasting sector which play a very important role in Ireland.  Undoubtedly, the arrival of Internet-based music streaming services and radio presents a significant challenge.  I do not doubt the Deputy's passion in introducing this Bill but I believe it is a step too far.

It did not happen in that five-year period and it appears it will not happen this evening.  What we must do now is examine how we can support this industry into the future.  The new chair of the RTE authority should be invited to appear before the Oireachtas joint committee to answer why RTE is not playing Irish artists on its various shows.

I have read and considered it and we have had some discussion around it.  There is no doubt that there are problems faced by those involved in the music industry in Ireland in accessing the airwaves.  Ireland is recognised worldwide for its rich cultural heritage and our extremely talented musicians and composers are central to this.  Unfortunately, those involved in the Irish music industry are struggling to make ends meet due to the lack of radio airplay on some stations.  It is extremely difficult for Irish music to compete with the multinational culture and music companies.  We are sandwiched between the music that comes out of Britain and the United States, some of which is very good, and dominated by that music and the global media and all that goes with that.<\/p>  <p>  The reality is that the broad spectrum of Irish music in Ireland is given very little consideration on radio and, in some cases, gets only 10% of airplay.  Ireland is bursting with talent, and in this economic climate, we surely need to be tapping into this great creativity, encouraging and nurturing our musicians, songwriters and performers.  Ireland&rsquo;s music industry supports 11,500 jobs nationwide and is worth close to &euro;500 million annually to the economy, which is an important factor.  We need to provide real investment into that creative industry.  A proper percentage of airplay is crucial for Irish music to develop and maintain a strong industry and further growth in that sector.<\/p>  <p>  Many countries in the European Union and outside it have been able to introduce national music quotas of up to 40%, but there are problems with that.  We have seen recommendations from the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland on a minimum quota for Irish culture.  Sinn F&eacute;in supports Irish culture and art being promoted in Ireland and across the world.  We want to see more artists being able to make a living for themselves in this country.  My party colleague, Liadh N&iacute; Riada MEP, comes from a family with a very rich tradition and involvement in the music industry.  Her late father was Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Riada.  She corresponded with the previous Minister with responsibility for communications, Alex White, asking that Irish music and culture be given greater support by Government.  Our party believes that the promotion of the Irish language in broadcasting is essential to the language as a whole.  In the North we have been supporting an Irish language broadcast fund that supports the production of excellent television, radio and online broadcasts.  In this State, TG4 has achieved tremendous success in producing Irish language content, drama and documentaries with very limited funding, and that has been important in it reaching young people in particular.<\/p>  <p>  However, while Sinn F&eacute;in supports advancing this Bill to Committee Stage, it requires further scrutiny.  We see some pitfalls in it.  I would not be as dismissive as some previous speakers of it.  The Bill needs to be developed.  For example, what constitutes &ldquo;musical compositions that relate to some distinguishing element of the culture ... of the island of Ireland&rdquo;?  That is a broad definition and further work needs to be done on that.<\/p>  <p>  Our party wants to see all different forms and diversity of the music of Ireland being supported.  There are many examples of international musicians who have based themselves or have come to live in Ireland and who have made successful careers for themselves by performing locally and signing with Irish record labels, and in doing so they have undoubtedly contributed to the music culture of the island.  Would these artists be supported or discriminated against under this Bill?  There needs to be tied up.  There are also examples of international acts which are based abroad whose Irish heritage is a prominent element of their music.  Would those artists benefit from this legislation or would it work the other way?  We do not want an outcome that is too purist or exclusive in that we have to leave people with a choice but we also want to give Irish music maximum support.  We believe this Bill should be supported to progress to the next Stage but we want assurances that it will be based on fairness and diversity.  The definitions and quotas need to be further examined and developed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121400047#YY00800","speaker":"1232"},{"type":"speech","time":1481739000,"counter":526,"content":"<p>The Deputy is sharing the remaining four minutes in this time slot with Deputy Eugene Murphy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121400047#YY00900","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1481739000,"counter":527,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Stanley for giving me a few minutes of his time.  My side of the House has adequately put the case during the debate.  I was in my office meeting a deputation from my part of the country which had an issue, but I was following on the monitor Deputy Penrose's passionate contribution and, boy, does he put every effort into it.<\/p>  <p>  As Deputy Penrose and the Minister, Deputy Naughten, know, I worked in this business for 20 years and promoted Irish music.  I want to remind people in the Gallery because some of them might not realise this that I did more than anybody in this House to promote Irish music and song.  Many of those in the Gallery know I played their records and they did not have to ring me to ask me to do so.  I played their records because I have a belief in this business.  I know more than most that this business is under pressure.  We may not agree with this Bill but this side of the House has done more for Irish music than those on any other side of this House.  We brought in local radio and local radio throughout this country has given a new platform to Irish country music, traditional music and, indeed, to new Irish rock bands.  Stations like Shannonside and Northern Sound, for which I used to work, cater for all that type of music, and up to almost 40% of their coverage deals with different strands of Irish music.  Stations like Midwest Radio, LMFM and Midlands Radio 3 have all done Trojan work for this business.<\/p>  <p>  With due respect to Deputy Penrose, the problem with this Bill is that it will not deal with the national issue, and that is where the problem lies with national stations.  I can show the Deputy a number of letters I have on my desk from the bosses of radio stations saying that this Bill is not workable and that they do not want it.  I do not believe that going down the road of quotas works in any walk of life.  It has failed in other areas and it will fail in this area.  I know the Deputy is passionate about this and that he wants to do the right thing but I must remind him that a Bill was brought forward by the Labour Party when his party was in government in 2014 and the Deputy's then Labour Party Minister, Alex White, would not support it.

We were treated to a feast of music from incredible artists, young and old, in the audio-visual room a month or six weeks ago.  The O'Neill sisters from Kerry, if my memory serves me right, and Phil Coulter were there, which shows the talent from one age to next that we have in this country and that has been nurtured along.  That is a great asset.<\/p><p>No matter where we are, it might be at a wedding and we might have too many pints on us, the final thing the Irish will do at night is to get together and sing the songs of which we are proud.  Tonight, I heard that this one and the other one did all the work to ensure that the Irish music business has survived.  Mothers and fathers around Ireland who brought their youngsters to learn guitar, the fiddle or whatever, are the ones who kept music alive in this country, as did those who went to the different dance halls to hear bands perform live long before those bands ever played hotels.  I recall that 3,000 people would attend The Sound of Music in Glenamaddy, County Galway and many also went to The Beaten Path in Claremorris, County Mayo.<\/p> <p> MidWest Radio, Shannonside Northern Sound, Galway Bay FM and Highland Radio are successful radio stations because they have played this music and brought forward these kinds of musicians.  We have to face up to it that we have a problem with the large stations because it might not be cool to play some Irish music.  It might not be cool in certain parts of the country or in a big city to play it.<\/p> <p> This music also generates much money throughout the country.  For example, a band playing at an event will involve, say, people on the door and inside the bar working.  Thousands of people are employed around the country and the talent these young people have is incredible.  It is like a young footballer.  A young lad or girl who wants to play football will be brought for training on a Saturday morning or afternoon to learn how to kick.  As time goes on, he or she gets better and plays for the local club.  If he or she is good, he or she will get the opportunity to play for his or her county.  There are parts of this country where youngsters have learned various instruments or have amazing voices or have written great songs, but, unfortunately, after spending &euro;10,000 on recording their music in a studio, they are not given the opportunity they deserve to have it played on the airwaves.<\/p> <p> We should be proud of these people.  They have gone to foreign lands, as was the case with Foster and Allen many years ago.  I remember them appearing on \"Top of the Pops\" and representing Ireland.  As legislators, this is what we should ensure.  Do we want all the money going out to Robbie Williams or whoever is on the radio because the music is cooler?  Do we want to keep that money in our own country in order to help our own youngsters, to create more jobs and, above all, to preserve our Irishness?  Are we ashamed of driving forward with our Irishness?<\/p> <p> Deputy Willie Penrose introduced a Bill when I was not long in the D&aacute;il to help people in mortgage trouble to go bankrupt.  I commended him on that at the time.  I also commend him on the Bill before the House.  No one is saying that it is perfect.  Earlier, a Deputy claimed that some radio stations play 30% of Irish music.  We can agree on an amendment to show the youngsters coming up in rock, pop, traditional or country music, what we mean.  When I was a youngster, we danced to Joe Dolan.  Then, it was not cool to do that and we listened to Shakin' Stevens and all the others.  Now the wheel has turned and everyone is listening to Joe Dolan again.  When there is a charity event for a young child or a community, who is the first to do a voluntary gig?  It is not the artist in England but an artist in Ireland who will perform at such a gig to raise funds.<\/p> <p> This is what we should appreciate.  This is our Irishness and what we should be proud of.  We should not be ashamed to stand up for musicians both here and abroad.  If one is playing Irish music, I do not care if one is from America, so long as it is Irish music one is playing and one has Irish roots.  We need to give these youngsters a chance.  They have spent a lot of money and have never got the opportunity.  One would stand in the snow to listen to the Doyle sisters who sang in the AV room recently.  Unfortunately, they are not getting the opportunity to be heard everywhere they deserve to be heard.  If one does not get the opportunities, then it is a harder road.  They may get a break, they may not.  Hopefully, they will.  We are not talking about the local radio stations.  In fairness, every local radio station in the west and other parts of the country is playing the percentage of Irish music which Deputy Willie Penrose is seeking in this Bill.  It is the big guns - in circumstances where it might not be fashionable to do it - that are not doing so.  They should be whipped into line the same as the rest.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121400047#YY02300","speaker":"1341","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1481739600,"counter":542,"content":"<p>The Minister, Deputy Denis Naughten, requested to give an explanation to the House.

It is disappointing, however, that it will not be supported by the Government.  The Bill seeks to introduce a quota by making it a condition for the awarding of all sound and broadcasting contracts to include at least 45% of the time allocated to music content in programmes for music that relates to \"some distinguished element of the culture of the island of Ireland\".<\/p>  <p>  Radio maintains a consistent presence in our society.  Up to 86% of adults, almost 3 million people, listen to radio on the average weekday in Ireland.  While TV and print media ratings are falling ahead of increased online broadcasting trends, maintaining a music quota for radio will have the greatest impact in exposing the listening population to music content that relates to a cultural aspect of Ireland.  In saying that, I do not believe we need to restrict quotas only to music which has a cultural element.  It could be read to assume that only music deemed culturally relevant to the island of Ireland will be played.  What about Irish singers who might write and produce original pop songs here in Ireland or an African national living here who has written, produced and performed music in Ireland but who cannot get air time?  Upholding a quota for culturally specific Irish music may not do anything to develop and grow the music industry in itself.<\/p>  <p>  Alongside any quota system being introduced, a strategy should also be introduced to develop a home-grown music industry.  This year, the Taoiseach launched Creative Ireland as the Government's legacy programme for Ireland 2016, a five-year whole-of-Government initiative from 2017 to 2022, which aims to improve access to cultural and creative activity in every county.  While this is welcome, little is contained in the programme to enhance prospects for the music industry, which means we are still without a fully functioning music strategy.  According to the Irish Music Rights Organisation which deals with licensing rights for Irish musicians, Ireland's music industry supports 11,500 jobs nationwide and is worth close to &euro;500 million annually to the economy.  Clearly, there is potential to develop this further.  Like many other industries, the music sector has been impacted in recent years both as a result of austerity cuts and on foot of technological advances as people increasingly download music for free.  More than that, it is also the fact that this Government lacks a clear and coherent strategy to support the sector.<\/p>  <p>  During the economic recovery process as we seek to create more employment, increase tourism and develop sustainable sectors, now is the time to develop a real plan for Irish music, involving all stakeholders including the Government, industry representative bodies, musicians and songwriters themselves, among others.  This is crucial if we are to optimise the economic and social return of the music sector.  This should coincide with any quota system that could be introduced.<\/p>  <p>  I want to dispute the age-old notion that we cannot possibly introduce a quota system as it may contravene EU competition law.  Niall Stokes, former chair of the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, previously sought a music quota for Ireland in the 1990s, which the EU sanctioned.  In 1994, France secured a 40% quota for songs played in French.<\/p><p>While this law primarily dealt with preserving the spoken language of French as it was felt English was homogenising the music industry, we need to be clear about our own intentions.  Is it about the preservation of language, our cultural heritage or the preservation of our music industry in general?  Both are intrinsically linked because music recorded and written in Ireland is also part of our cultural heritage and should be preserved and given the airtime it deserves.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121400048#ZZ00600","speaker":"1366","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1481740200,"counter":548,"content":"<p>I am delighted to warmly congratulate Deputy Willie Penrose on bringing forward this important Bill.  The Broadcasting (Amendment) Bill 2016 will insert section 65A into the Broadcasting Act 2009 and provide for a quota of at least 40% to be allocated to Irish music or musical compositions that relate to some distinguishing element of the culture of our country.<\/p>  <p>  When one looks at Irish music down through the decades, one sees a phenomenal pantheon of achievement by our music artists.  We could spend the rest of tonight up to midnight reading out the names of great men and women who have contributed to the artistic life and culture of our country.  Some of them are U2, the Script, Phil Coulter, Paul Brady, Van Morrison, Joe Dolan, Dickie Rock, Sin&eacute;ad O'Connor, Hozier, Walking on Cars, Snow Patrol, Niall Horan, Thin Lizzy, Enya, Damien Rice, Glen Hansard, the Pogues, the great Christy Moore, Aslan, Nathan Carter, George Murphy, Paddy Casey and the great Damien Dempsey from my constituency.  They represent a tiny fragment of the men and women who have done so much for our artistic life.  To protect and develop it, particularly as a result of the new challenges we face in the digital age, it is critical that our 34 stations give that amount of airtime to Irish music.<\/p>  <p>  I meant to mention a great man from the Leas-Cheann Comhairle's party, the former Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, and the work of Comhaltas Ceolt&oacute;ir&iacute; &Eacute;ireann which down through the decades has done a phenomenal amount to teach instruments to our children.  I am thinking also of the great O'Dwyer family of the Beara Peninsula, some of my own relations and the great tradition they and so many thousands of Irish families represent.<\/p>  <p>  When one thinks of our great musical heritage, one must consider that other large English-speaking countries relentlessly push their own music.  Our smaller EU partners and many other states in Latin America, Africa and Asia deliberately insist on good play time on the radio and television networks for their musicians.  South Africa insists on 90% and I believe we should move in the same direction.  If one thinks about great national musical traditions around the world, for example, the great musicians of Mali, Cuba or Jamaica, it is incontrovertible that major airplay on local stations has played a huge role in building up these traditions and encouraging and supporting these artists.<\/p>  <p>  There is also huge issue with the power of IT companies like Apple, Google, YouTube and Spotify in the downloading and streaming of music.  The ultimate benefits which accrue for composers and musicians is something this House will have to look at in the years to come and the fact that musicians often get such small returns for brilliant composition and playing.  Down the years there have also been huge issues with the protection of copyright and royalties for Irish composers, especially in traditional music.  I agree with the approach Deputy Penrose and the Labour Party have taken in this regard and by bringing such a group of our great musicians into D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann tonight to publicise the Bill.  It is a small but necessary step to cherish our musical heritage and to foster a love of Irish music for generations to come.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Pringle mentioned the new creative policy the Government has launched.  It will need resources.  In my constituency, and possibly in the Minister's, huge efforts are being made by great community activists like Finola Young to ensure every child in every school will have a musical instrument and that they will all be musically literate by the time they get to adulthood.  We should have a total emphasis on our music and pushing it first and last in all genres in which our musicians are so brilliant.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121400049#AAA00200","speaker":"1361"},{"type":"speech","time":1481740200,"counter":549,"content":"<p>Is m&oacute;r an trua &eacute; go bhfuil daoine ar n&oacute;s na n-iar-Sheanad&oacute;ir&iacute;, Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, Paschal Mooney agus Donie Cassidy, imithe as Ph&aacute;irt&iacute; Parlaiminte Fhianna F&aacute;il.  It would be a different story if they were here.  It is a pity the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, because of the Whip system, is not allowed to support his good friends and the culture which he and I love and pay for.  We have a new censor here in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann tonight.  Deputy Lawless is the new censor for music in Ireland and what we can do.<\/p>  <p>  I am disappointed, to say the least, that the party of which my father was a founding member and of which I was a member of all my life cannot support something as noble as this.  I salute Deputy Penrose and his colleagues on bringing this forward.  I would not ask why they did not do it in the past five years.  They did not do it and that is fine.  They are doing it now and it is needed.  We should be proud of our Irish culture and our heritage.  We should play it and support it.  We might not get it from the national broadcasting services but we get it from our local radio stations.  I salute Tipp FM radio and Tipperary Mid West Radio and all the good people there and the work they do, including the Tony Brooke show and many others.<\/p>  <p>  I commend Paschal Mooney - God be with him - and his country music shows that we all listen to.  He is still alive thank God.  Fianna F&aacute;il might have a different parliamentary party.  Was this discussed at the parliamentary party?

They mind themselves as far as I can see.<\/p>  <p>  I support this Bill.  I welcome all the good people to the Public Gallery.  I love Irish heritage - the music, song and dance.

There is too much influence from those places coming in here.  We need our culture, identity and heritage.  I salute groups such as Clannad, Bachelors in Trouble, the Morrisseys and the former Senator Donie Cassidy.  They composed a song, \"Arise and Follow Charlie\".  If he was here I do not know what he would do with the Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies.  He would throw them all out in the yard somewhere.  That is what happened in those times but now we are here and we are left with this.  It is good legislation.  It may not be perfect but it can be amended.<\/p>  <p>  I was delighted to meet Deputy Penrose at the Fleadh Cheoil in Ennis with his young kids ag rince set agus ag rince f&oacute;irne.  Bh&iacute; mo chlann ann freisin.  I commend the work of former Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute; who was ardsti&uacute;rth&oacute;ir of Comhaltas Ceolt&oacute;ir&iacute; &Eacute;ireann agus a bhean ch&eacute;ile, Una, and the sterling work they have done for decades in the cultural centre in Tipperary, Br&uacute; Bor&uacute; and elsewhere.  They promoted our culture and heritage nakedly and unashamedly and supported young students who came out of college after studying art when nobody else would do it and when it was not popular to do so.<\/p>  <p>  I danced to Big Tom at the carnival in Scotstown and I enjoyed it.  I am not ashamed of it.  They might say I am a Neanderthal or a caveman.  That is not so long ago.  Our culture is what we have to hold dearly and celebrate.  I love listening to the Bachelors in Trouble.  I wish them well and like their satire.  It is very important.  I like Deputy Penrose's good friend, Johnny Mac from Tipperary.  They get together in the cornfields and make videos down in Maryville house in the plush, green Golden Vale of Tipperary.<\/p>  <p>  If we do not support our own, we support nothing.  I support Deputy Penrose.  I do not know the Government's opinion on the Bill.  I have not heard yet from the Minister.  He is interested and has young kids himself.  I will mention the Clancy Brothers, Stephen Donnelly in Clonmel and Paddy O'Brien.  Rinne na fir sin an-obair thar na blianta ar fud an domhain.  They danced all over the world.  They brought Ireland and its culture to the people of the world.  Afterwards there was U2 and all the other bands that are doing so well.  We had all the rumpus last year about bringing your man into Croke Park and asking if he would come.<\/p>  <p>  Anywhere in any town or village, we will get young people to dance, we will get a man to play a tune on the fiddle, ar an bhfead&oacute;g n&oacute; rud &eacute;igin mar sin agus beidh an-chraic againn.  That is our culture.  That is what purists abroad want to see.  They want us to have it here played on our radio.  They do not want to listen to other stuff.  When they come to Ireland and go into a hotel, pub or go into get their hair cut, they want the Irish music and culture played and listened to.  They do not just want stuff coming from abroad.  That is good as well and we cannot close our mind to it but we have to get back to our roots.  I do not know where the Deputies' roots are gone but, by God, they are short green shoots.  They need to get some 10-10-20 or some kind of fertiliser to see if they can stimulate them again.  They have lost their way in a lot of cases.<\/p>  <p>  I heard Deputy Murphy - I know the work he does on his radio station - lecturing people across the way.  None of us can be proud.  We all make mistakes but we all have an onus to cherish our culture, heritage, faith and d&uacute;chas and to support it and young groups like Caladh Nua from Ballymacarbry who won national awards last year.<\/p><p>They are a great group of young people from Contae Thiobraid &Aacute;rann, Cluain Meala agus Baile Mhac Cairbre i gContae Phort L&aacute;irge.  The talent oozes from them.  They love it.  They do not cost a bob to anyone but their parents.  We are not charging anybody for this.  It is not like Uisce &Eacute;ireann, which Deputy Lawless mentioned.  We have enough of talking about Irish Water.  Let us talk about what is good for us, what we enjoy and what we love.  Let us celebrate our culture and heritage.  We should be allowed to do so.  A quota of 40% is not too much.  Let us compel our radio stations to play more and to be proud of it, not all the foreign influences we have and the diatribe that comes on some of the stations some of the time.<\/p> <p> The group is called Caladh Nua.  It is a lovely new group.  People should go out and get their CD and listen to it.  Those who do buy it will be dancing around the Christmas table with the turkey in their hands and they might spill the cranberry sauce if they are not careful.  The music is stimulating and invigorating.  It is what we are.  It is what we come from.  It is where we came from, what we are proud of and what we want to have.  I do not want any party in this House seeking to do down Deputy Willie Penrose or anybody else.  Goodness knows, we are downtrodden enough since the recession and everything the troika says we cannot do.  This is something we can do, we are able to do and we want to do.  Let us do it.  Let us celebrate what we are and our culture.  We should bring back the likes of former Senators Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute; and Donie Cassidy to give people, particularly those who oppose the Bill, pep talks on what can be done.<\/p> <p> This is good legislation.  Deputy Penrose is not infallible.  He has a legal background and I have admired many of the Bills he has brought forward.  I admired him when he stood up for his local barracks and his people and gave up his super junior Cabinet post.  He is not a man for himself but a man of the people and a man of culture.  I will not say that he is a man of history, given that he is still with us, but he will leave behind a proud legacy.  Let us all consider the Bill and embrace it.  The Minister, Deputy Denis Naughten is part of the rural group of Independents and I hope he will support it.<\/p> <p> The House will be sitting tomorrow.  As I said during the debate on post offices, we should use our culture, music, dance, literature, history and arts, or we will lose them.  It is a case of \"Use it or lose it\".  We have lost a great deal.  Thanks are due to all the good people in the Public Gallery, their families and supporters for all the employment they give driving vans to bring the people who provide background music to the hotels and marquees.  Use it or lose it.  Go n-&eacute;ir&iacute; an t-&aacute;dh leis an mBille.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121400049#AAA00300","speaker":"1347","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1481740800,"counter":551,"content":"<p>I very much welcome the debate and commend Deputy Willie Penrose on raising the issue and allowing us to consider it.  The music we listen to is important.  When I leave the Chamber, the first thing I will do on my way home is put on my earphones and listen to John Creedon's radio show.  I love it.  It is the highlight of my day.  I leave it to him as to whether he plays ska for the first half-hour or hour or whether he plays the Sultans of Ping non-stop.  I trust him, and I love this quality in my day.  It is important to me.  If he is not on, or some similar show is not airing, I spend a lot of time jumping between stations trying to find something I like.<\/p>  <p>  We are all influenced, particularly by the experiences of our younger years.  I am a child of the 1970s, when we seemed to get it right.  The musician Martin Hayes said something happened in Irish traditional music in the early 1970s that was truly spectacular.  I could name endless bands such as the Bothy Band, Skara Brae and Planxty that were incredibly innovative, creative and popular, not just here but all over the world.  We were the leaders and originators in world music on foot of the spark and creativity of that time.  Although I am less tuned into it, it was probably the same in terms of show bands and country music.  I am old enough to remember going around the country and seeing big crowds outside show band halls.  It was a hugely popular and successful musical culture.<\/p>  <p>  I was at home in punk.  I am a child of punk and, at that time, for whatever combination of reasons, Ireland was an amazingly vibrant centre.  We were right up to speed with punk just as much as London or Manchester, and we were proud.  It did not seem like it was Irish.  We were proud because they were local people but also because it was beyond being Irish.  It was just contemporary and global.  People all over the world were listening to Stiff Little Fingers or whichever of the plethora of bands that took off at that time.  Perhaps it was because we were cut off.  People did not travel to Ireland, given that they did not see it as safe.  We did not have a huge amount of choice or radio stations.  Perhaps, because we had so many young people, the culture was ripe for musical development.<\/p>  <p>  We need to try to recreate that and build Irish music back up.  It is still there.  There is still talent and an incredible variety of different musical genres.  The underlying capability and creative instinct is still there.  However, two things have happened in the interim that changed the nature of how music is heard and how the music business works.  The first of these was the development of all those radio stations.  It is worth debating how we regulate them in terms of quality and diversity and how we get those in the industry to promote Irish music while giving them the freedom to retain their audiences and make their judgements in terms of how they play it.  I am nervous about overly restricting them.<\/p>  <p>  Last week, some member of the Tory Party stated that every British radio station should finish each night with \"God Save the Queen\".  Somebody responded with John Lydon's version of \"God Save the Queen\" from the Sex Pistols.  I slightly fear that we will just box ourselves in.  What the Minister said about definitions is true.  John Lydon is as Irish as anyone.  I will go up to the former Frankie Kennedy Winter School, Scoil Geimhridh Ghaoth Dobhair in Donegal every year.  Over the years I have seen all sorts of bands there.  Are the Rankin Family Irish or Canadian?  Is Caper Ceilidh Scottish or Irish?  We could go on forever debating where we put the line.  There are difficulties around it.  However, it is worthwhile to consider how we do it regarding our regulation of radio.<\/p>  <p>  The bigger change which has really affected the commercial viability of Irish music and the ability for people to earn a living and develop a career is the digital revolution that is altering so many things in our lives.  Five or six years ago, I was on a platform with Paul Brady, one of my greatest musical heroes, and Niall Stokes who stated that it was killing them and was not working for the industry.  The latter is true.  The development of the Internet and social media and the flow of advertising to social media companies rather than local Irish media companies, and the fact that content can be copied, downloaded or stolen - whatever words we use - and that musicians are not getting paid, is one of the fundamental problems underlying the concern that has people sitting in the Public Gallery today.<\/p>  <p>  I commend Deputy Penrose.  I have listened very keenly to the different arguments in the debate.  It is a very valid debate which needs to be deepened, widened and continued.  I listened to what the Minister suggested regarding the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment, of which I am proud to be a member, and the suggestion that we consider establishing a public forum to consider how we manage the digital revolution to protect our media industries which have been crippled by the digital revolution or are under threat.  We can talk about regulating radio stations but if they are not there in three years' time due to the fact that 80% of advertising revenue is going to social media companies, it is a threat to Irish music and all the good stations and DJs that Deputy Penrose mentioned.  If they are not on the air in three years' time, no percentage we determine would have an effect.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister is suggesting a public forum as a course of action.  I would be happy to support that.  It will be difficult to do it given that we are looking at the question not just of how we protect media providers in this changing digital landscape but also content creators.  However, it is valid.  Why not be ambitious and think big?  We may have to give it more time and broaden the involvement so that Deputy Penrose, other individuals and the industry could come along to have the debate and make their views clear.  We cannot stop the tide of technology.  Young Irish musicians are using it and can use it in a variety of ways.  We can try to shape it and ensure we protect or develop a strong cultural industry here.<\/p>  <p>  It needs to go back to those roots in the 1970s of being free spirited, anarchic and not overly controlled.  Nobody completely regulated for happened in traditional Irish music in the early 1970s.  It happened as a result of a number of people in their 20s getting together and expressing themselves.  While we have a role in trying to protect and develop, we must be careful not to be so expressive in terms of how we regulate it that we do not stifle the creative environment.<\/p><p>We need to be good with digital industries.  We need to get our music out on digital platforms.  We need to share it with the whole world and have it played on our radio stations.  I agree with the Minister that we should use this forum as a means to consider the Bill in more detail.  It is not intended to stop the debate.  The debate needs to be deepened and lengthened.  I commend the Labour Party on starting it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121400050#BBB00200","speaker":"1294","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1481741400,"counter":553,"content":"<p>I rise to support my colleague, Deputy Penrose, on his Bill, which is very important.

The industry supports tens of thousands of jobs, not only in production, but also in event management, PR and a range of other disciplines which all hang off the industry.  These disciplines are found in all parts of Ireland, as the Minister knows, so the Bill will help support these jobs, maintain them and create more jobs in rural areas.  Surely, we should support this industry.  We all know what is happening to it.  Spotify and other online media are disintermediating musicians.  It is hard for them to get royalties and an income in the normal way because they are being disintermediated by technology.  That is the reality.  We therefore need ways to promote artists through the traditional medium of the radio station.<\/p>  <p>  The Musicians Union of Ireland supports the Bill.

It would affect anyone who produces Irish music, whether in jazz, traditional music, rock music, whether it is The Riptide Movement, Kodaline, The Coronas, The Blizzards or whoever else.  It would promote all of them and provide for thousands of jobs.  We need to support the industry as much as we can.

It is ironic that in the same week of that launch this Government cannot support what is absolutely a no brainer when it comes to a Bill to promote Irish music.  It is incredible.<\/p> <p> I implore the Minister and Fianna F&aacute;il in particular to support this Bill and to allow it to go to Committee Stage.  It is no great thing to ask.  I appeal to them to allow it to go to Committee.  We all know that is the right thing to do.  We all know that the industry is 100% behind this and that thousands of jobs are dependent on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121400051#CCC03700","speaker":"1349","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1481742000,"counter":590,"content":"<p>Tuigim go bhfuil an Teachta Neville ag scoilt a chuid ama leis an Aire St&aacute;it, an Teachta Kyne.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121400052#DDD00200","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1481742000,"counter":591,"content":"<p>I welcome the discussion of the Bill.  It has raised an emotive debate.  We have heard a number of speakers and views.  No one here wants to impede Irish music or Irish produced music.  The question is and the crux of the Bill is around the definition.<\/p>  <p>  Obviously, technology has changed music - that is a no-brainer - during the past ten or 15 years in the sense of the way music is consumed.  Now, it works across digital platforms.  As Deputy Kelly noted, the advent of Spotify, Myspace and such platforms has led to the flattening of music and has eroded the power of record companies.  Now, the artists are dealing directly with radio stations and the media.<\/p>  <p>  I studied for a master&rsquo;s degree in music technology in the University of Limerick in 2008.  I discovered one major thing when I came out.  There were seven disc jockeys - I was one of them &ndash; seven composers and seven electronic engineers on the course.  However, there was no real educational push on the commercial side of music.  That is something we need to work on to help artists.  By their nature, artists focus on their art.  It is a question of the commercial side.  At the end of the day, artists have to pay bills, earn money, raise children, try to put food on the table and try to make a living out of it.  More education is needed to allow them to compete with the broader market.  The flattening of the industry has given them a broader market but it has increased the completion as well.  It is a chicken and egg situation.  It is a question of giving them the wherewithal.  Many people in music have diversified into digital marketing.  They work in the area because it helps them to deliver their art.<\/p>  <p>  I imagine Deputy Penrose probably came up with the definition in good faith.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121400052#DDD00300","speaker":"1328"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1481742000,"counter":592,"content":"<p>(Interruptions).<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1481742000,"counter":593,"content":"<p>Sorry, I never interrupted the Deputies, so I would appreciate it if they allowed me to speak.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121400052#DDD00500","speaker":"1328"},{"type":"speech","time":1481742000,"counter":594,"content":"<p>Perhaps I can make a decision.

Many Irish producers are working on techno and hip-hop.  These types of music are played by many Irish artists on radio stations.  I know this because I listen to these genres.<\/p>  <p>  As part of my masters degree I teased out the distinction between producer, DJ and composer and where the boundaries blur when it comes to composition and playing music.  How do we define what is Irish?  Is it the anchor, the person actually delivering the music?  Is it the composer?  Is it the producer?  Where does the music change?  Technology and genres are moving so fast.  It is extremely difficult to nail them down.  I agree with the view of Deputy Eamon Ryan to the effect that in an environment where culture and creativity is allowed to flourish, we come up with brilliance.  Riverdance first appeared 20 years ago.  It reinvented Irish dancing.  Irish dancing was probably on its knees in the popular way or as far as my age group was concerned.  Then, when Riverdance came along, things changed completely.  It was born out of brilliance and creativity.  We are not trying to take away from Irish artists.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Penrose has ratcheted this question up the political ladder and raised the profile of the discussion.  The discussion is necessary.  It has been cathartic.  Everyone is giving their views and talking about it.<\/p>  <p>  Music scenes come and go.  Technology is driving things.  What used to happen in the 1980s and 1990s is not happening today.  Grunge came and went.  The new romantics came and went.  Punk came and went.  Music scenes move on.  Yet, our Irish music and culture continues to survive.  It is the one thing that keeps pushing through all the challenges.  It comes through all the challenges.  It goes through its dips and troughs but it always comes through.  It is inherent in us.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the debate but I do not believe that coercing stations into playing a specific amount is going to work.  We do not want to erode the platform in place already that gives bands the chance.  We need to help these bands and educate them more on the commercial side.  We need to help them to beat the competition.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121400052#DDD00900","speaker":"1328"},{"type":"speech","time":1481742000,"counter":598,"content":"<p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht seo.  Molaim an Teachta Penrose as ucht an Bhille seo a chur os &aacute;r gcomhair.  T&aacute; s&eacute; r&aacute;ite ag mo chomhghleaca&iacute;, an tAire, an Teachta Naughten, go bhfuil fadhbanna ag baint leis an mBille seo.  Aonta&iacute;m leis an Aire go bhfuil fadhb leis an gcu&oacute;ta de 40%, mar shampla.  I welcome this debate.  It is an interesting debate and one that has raised some genuine passions.  Clearly, it is an issue of interest to all Deputies.<\/p>  <p>  Under the Broadcasting Act 2009, public service broadcasters must ensure their service reflects the varied elements which make up the culture of the people of Ireland.  RTE and TG4 have published detailed commitments on an annual basis setting out how they plan to meet these obligations across the range of services they provide.  The practical implementation of these commitments is of significant benefit to Irish artists and musicians across all those services, not only on radio.<\/p>  <p>  The majority of commercial stations already have a 30% quota in their broadcasting licence.  Many of these stations play over and above this percentage.  The Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Naughten, has confirmed to me that he will write to the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland to seek confirmation of adherence by broadcasters to this quota, as per the request of Deputy Kelly.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to recognise that broadcasters are important stakeholders in this debate as well.  It is also important to note the right of broadcasters to determine the type of programming and content they wish to broadcast, subject to meeting relevant licensing and legislative obligations.<\/p>  <p>  As Minister Naughten has outlined, the introduction of specific quotas is not always the solution.  It could possibly lead to a position of strict adherence to the minimum by those upon whom they are imposed.  We have already heard about the difficulties this has created in France and South Africa.<\/p>  <p>  The main problem with the approach proposed by Deputy Penrose is that, despite all the efforts over the years, it has not been possible to come up with a satisfactory and workable definition of Irish music.  The definition provided by Deputy Penrose is decidedly vague and I do not believe that it could be introduced as it stands.  The current arrangement, whereby applicants for commercial radio licences are invited to volunteer Irish music commitments for inclusion in the programme policy statements of the station, has been found to be the most efficient solution.  As these commitments are voluntary, they can include commitments based on nationality and residence and have not created any issues at European level.  These commitments form part of the individual licence of each broadcaster and are monitored by the BAI on an ongoing basis to ensure compliance.<\/p>  <p>  While the promotion of works by Irish artists is to be encouraged, this is not something into which public service or commercial radio stations wish to be forced.  The best way to increase air play of Irish music is for the music industry to engage with radio stations and for the parties to work together.  A quota, if introduced, could or would have a negative effect.  It could result in more repetitive Irish music being played, negative impacts on radio station revenues and potential resultant job losses.  This can be explored in the forum to which the Minister referred earlier.<\/p>  <p>  The proposed legislative approach is inflexible and could have the opposite effect of the stated intention of Deputy Penrose to promote the Irish music industry.  I believe the issue would be best considered by the proposed joint Oireachtas committee broadcasting forum to which the Minister, Deputy Naughten, referred earlier.  This would give all stakeholders, musicians, broadcasters and policy-makers an opportunity to consider how best to promote Irish music in such a manner that benefits all.  Therefore, I urge Deputies not to support the Broadcasting (Amendment) Bill.  Moreover, I encourage Members to engage with the broadcasting forum on this important issue in due course.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121400052#DDD01000","speaker":"1314"},{"type":"speech","time":1481742000,"counter":599,"content":"<p>I thank everyone who has contributed to the debate.

For a long time during an earlier D&aacute;il, I shared an office and subsequently a corridor with the former Deputy and current President, Michael D. Higgins.  Nobody is saying that the Labour Party in government is perfect, but when we went into government in the 1990s we created the first ever culture Ministry in this country with the total backing of my colleague, Deputy Penrose.  That is how far it goes back.  People said that TG4 was in some way a figment of the Labour Party.  I remind the House that Dessie O'Malley said that Michael D. Higgins would &quot;go mad&quot; as a Minister in government.  Michael D. Higgins brought forward a vision of an engaged and active Irish culture with massive participation from every community around the country.  We need to be clear that this is about our culture.  Unless we can hear and play our own music and thereby help our artists and writers to get a stream of income from that music, we will not have the richness, depth and participation that has been a part of the vision in this House over the decades since we first created a Ministry for communications and culture.  I remind the Minister, Deputy Naughten, that he should be very honoured to inherit part of that responsibility.<\/p><p>I want to take issue with a specific paragraph in the Minister's speech.  He said:<\/p><blockquote>The wording refers to musical composition that relates to some distinguishing element of the culture of the island of Ireland.  Who is to decide what those distinguishing elements are to be?  For example, will it encompass electronica music such as techno, ambient or downtempo?  Furthermore, in a multi-cultural society such as we have now, how should we treat music written or enjoyed by those Irish citizens of African, eastern European or South American heritage?<\/blockquote><p>For God's sake, what civil servant wrote that stuff?  The Minister went on to ask &quot;in a multi-cultural society such as we have now, how should we treat music written or enjoyed by those Irish citizens of African, eastern European or South American heritage?&quot;.  I suggest that whoever wrote that is creating a problem in Irish society where there is none.  Has the Minister ever heard of Phil Lynott or Thin Lizzy?  Has he ever walked to the top of Grafton Street to see the statue?  If he stood beside it, he might feel like doing a little bit of air guitar as the Taoiseach once did.  Has the Minister ever heard of Ruth Negga, who is an Irish-Ethiopian?  We were delighted to learn recently that she is potentially about to receive an award in America for her cultural achievements and acting skills.  What about Paul McGrath?  For heaven's sake, we need to move on from an outdated and jaded image of Ireland that is not inclusive of all the different strands that go back to the Tuatha D&eacute; Danann and make us what we are.  We are an inclusive culture.  I do not attribute the Minister's remarks to him personally.  The language used in his speech is not the language I would associate with him.  Somebody wrote it for him.  When one becomes a Minister - Deputy Penrose and I have been there - it can go to one's head.  One can be over-impressed by people who put words in one's hands that one is then required to parrot here.<\/p><p>I would like to get to the essence of this issue by referring to a line of the speech given by the Minister of State, Deputy Kyne.  He said that the commitments to Irish playlists &quot;form part of the individual licence of each broadcaster and are monitored by the BAI on an ongoing basis to ensure compliance&quot;.  I ask the Minister and the Minister of State to speak with their own voices and in their own language.  I do not know what kind of globalised American English this is, but it is certainly not Irish English as it is spoken in this country.  It is disingenuous to make the suggestion we heard from the Minister of State.  The essence of Deputy Penrose's Bill is that Irish music should have playlist opportunities in peak times.  He is flexible on the issue of peak times.  Perhaps this could apply from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. or from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m.  The Deputy has had a look at what happens in other jurisdictions and at how this is operable.  I hear people like Liam &Oacute; Maonla&iacute; and Fiachna &Oacute; Braon&aacute;in on RTE late at night and early in the morning.  A former Member of this House, Pat Rabbitte, used to say that late-night politics programmes were for insomniacs and others.  I am sure everybody involved in politics listens to the radio late at night and early in the morning as we sort out our thoughts.  Deputy Penrose wants serious playtime at peak times.<\/p><p>I dislike the idea that we cannot allow a small Bill like this to go forward for further debate so that it can be pulled apart and put back together again in improved form.  It seems to be contrary to new politics, which involves Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Independents facing off against each other and essentially agreeing.  The objective of this legislation is for this House to make a statement about Irish culture at this time.  It is important to make a commitment to that.  I remind the House that musicians and artists are working to make a living and need to have a mechanism to earn that living.<\/p><p>Deputy Neville rightly pointed to all the changes that have happened in music distribution in terms of social media and other media.  We are all aware of that.  We need to put our minds together to find a means of supporting people in the music industry in Ireland.  Deputy Butler suggested that this Bill &quot;is an aggressive measure&quot;.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121400053#EEE00600","speaker":"1253"},{"type":"speech","time":1481742600,"counter":606,"content":"<p>She may have said it was regressive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121400053#EEE00700","speaker":"1370"},{"type":"speech","time":1481742600,"counter":607,"content":"<p>What is regressive or indeed aggressive about the notion that Irish music and culture, in the broadest sense, should be reflected in the music that is played on our radio stations?  As speakers from all sides of the House have pointed out, many stations already do this.  RTE television gives a lot of attention to music, but there is certainly not enough Irish music on RTE daytime radio.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister, Deputy Naughten, made a slightly snide comment when he spoke about the French quota, which has existed for a long period of time.  He mentioned that the quota used in France \"requires air play of music in the French language\" - I remind him that it relates to the arts in general - and suggested that a similar quota here would cause problems in an English-speaking country.  I really do not understand that one.  I go to an Irish music festival in France every year for a couple of days.  It is popular among people coming from the Willie Clancy festival.  Deputies may be aware that the Willie Clancy week in Clare is called the \"wet Willie\" and the week in France is called the sunshine one or the warm one.  The finest Irish musicians are feted every year when they go to the Dordogne, Lorient and other places.  Our music is part of the draw for the French tourists whom we all welcome.  If we do not ensure our children have opportunities at school and in their homes to experience Irish music by hearing it on the radio, we are at serious risk of diminishing the amazing cultural heritage we have inherited.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121400053#EEE00800","speaker":"1253"},{"type":"speech","time":1481742600,"counter":608,"content":"<p>The Deputy's time has elapsed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121400053#EEE00900","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1481742600,"counter":609,"content":"<p>I commend this Bill to the House.

However, I am sure they will spur a broader debate on budgetary policy, in which I will happily engage, both in this House and outside it.<\/p>  <p>  I want to start by explaining that the Bill is an essential element of financial housekeeping that must be concluded by the D&aacute;il this year.  It has two primary purposes.  First, the Bill is necessary to authorise in law all of the expenditure that has been undertaken in 2016 on the basis of the Estimates that have already been voted on by the D&aacute;il during the year.  The amounts included in the Bill all relate to amounts included in the Revised Estimates for 2016 of &euro;44.2 billion in aggregate, voted on by the D&aacute;il in April and July this year, as well as the Supplementary Estimates of &euro;400 million agreed by the D&aacute;il last week.  These Estimates were subject to consideration by the relevant select committee, or on the floor of the House, before being agreed by the D&aacute;il.  These Estimates provided capital funding for necessary repair work to transport infrastructure arising from flood damage at the start of the year, expenditure arising on school building works and additional funding for the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  In addition, the Supplementary Estimates reflected the element of the Christmas bonus to long-term social welfare recipients funded from the social protection Vote.<\/p>  <p>  Taking into account expenditure of the Social Insurance Fund and the National Training Fund, gross voted expenditure is forecast to total &euro;56.1 billion in 2016, in line with the estimate set out in the expenditure report for 2017, published on budget day in October.  This represents a 2.75% increase on the 2015 outturn.  The expenditure report outlines that gross voted expenditure is to increase by just over 3% in 2017.  Given the need for the continuation of a responsible approach to fiscal and expenditure policy, these increases are both prudent and sustainable.<\/p>  <p>  The second purpose of the Bill is to provide a legal basis for spending to continue into 2017.  The passage of the Bill allows continued funding, in the period before the D&aacute;il votes on the 2017 Estimates, of social welfare payments from the social protection Vote, Exchequer pay and pensions and other voted expenditure.  Additionally, under the rolling multi-annual capital envelopes introduced in budget 2004, Departments may carry over, from the current year to the following year, unspent capital up to a maximum of 10% of voted capital.  This is designed to improve effectiveness and efficiency.  It recognises the difficulties inherent in the planning process and the profiling of capital expenditure.  This facility allows for a portion of unspent moneys, which have been lost to the capital programmes and projects concerned under the annual system of allocating capital, to be made available for spending on programme priorities in the following year.<\/p>  <p>  The Act determines definitively the capital amounts which may be carried over to the following year.  In the Bill we are discussing, the aggregate amount of proposed capital carryover is just under &euro;76.5 million, which represents less than 2% of the total Exchequer capital programme of &euro;4.2 billion for 2016.  In 2015 an amount of just under &euro;112 million in capital expenditure savings was carried over into the following year.  The amount of &euro;4.2 billion allocated to capital expenditure in 2016 represents an increase of over 10% on gross voted capital expenditure in 2015.  The expenditure report for 2017 sets out a capital expenditure amount of &euro;4.5 billion for 2017.<\/p>  <p>  The proposed amounts in unspent capital to be carried over by Vote are set out in Schedule 2 of the Bill.  The 2017 Revised Estimates volume, to be presented to the House and circulated to Deputies tomorrow, will set out detailed financial and key performance information for Departments and offices.<\/p>  <p>  Deputies will also be aware that certain Exchequer pay and pensions and social welfare payments, in particular child benefit, are due for payment by electronic funds transfer on 3 January 2017.  With the banking system closed on 2 January 2017, funding will need to be in place in departmental bank accounts by 30 December 2016 to meet those liabilities on a timely basis.  In addition, An Post needs to be pre-funded before the end of 2016 in respect of these child benefit payments due in the first week of next year in order to convert electronic funds transfer payments from the Department of Social Protection into real cash and physically transfer it to its network of post offices throughout the country.<\/p>  <p>  These Exchequer pay and pension and social welfare payments will form part of the supply services for 2017 and, consequently, the funds to cover these costs will be included in amounts disbursed from the Central Fund to the Paymaster General's supply account as part of the 2017 supply issues.  These costs will come under moneys voted by the D&aacute;il in 2017 in respect of which the usual processes and mechanisms for voted moneys in that year will apply.  However, as the funds need to be available in the Paymaster General's supply account before the end of the year in order to facilitate timely payment, section 3 of the Appropriation Bill includes a specific provision to allow for an advance from the Central Fund to the Paymaster General's supply account.  Any amounts advanced to the supply account would then be repaid to the Central Fund in January.  The Bill provides that the amounts so advanced shall not exceed &euro;200 million.<\/p>  <p>  I hope this gives Deputies a flavour of the contents of this Bill which is, as I have explained, a technical one but one which is vital to the prudent management of the public finances.  I remarked at the outset that the Bill is an essential element of housekeeping which those of us in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann are required to undertake.<\/p><p>The passing of the Bill will authorise in law all of the expenditure undertaken in 2016 on the basis of the Estimates voted in by the D&aacute;il during that year; ensures that payments funded from voted expenditure in 2016, such as jobseeker's allowance, disability allowance, non-contributory State pension, nurses' pay, teachers' pay and any other pay and pensions funded from voted money can continue to be funded in 2017 in the period before the D&aacute;il approves the Estimates of that year.  It meets the technicalities of the Bill as I have described them and as I have told the House the passage of this Bill takes place after the approval of additional Estimates by the House last week and provides the underpinning to allow the State on behalf of the Oireachtas to make available social welfare payments and income supports to families and citizens across the country in the early part of next year. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121400054#FFF01400","speaker":"1292","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1481743800,"counter":625,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.  We will be supporting the Bill.  There is not exactly a rapt D&aacute;il Chamber here, which is extraordinary given that we are approving the expenditure of so much money.  It is important to reflect that this Bill is the end of a process in terms of the scrutiny of the Supplementary Estimates by committees in recent weeks, and the important consideration that was given in the course of the Social Welfare Bill 2016 to the payments the Minister has mentioned.<\/p>  <p>  In advance of next year's planned expenditure review, I take this opportunity to speak about expenditure generally.  The Minister referred to the need to make the Government expenditure process more robust.  There have been annual Supplementary Estimates for the Department of Health, something that we will no longer be able to do from next year yet the health service has gone beyond creaking at the seams.  The seams are broken, as we can see in the pressure on accident and emergency departments, despite that continued injection of money.  I hope the process next year will involve a review of how we determine expenditure ceilings for each Department to make them more accurate, relevant and accountable and make those in charge of them more accountable.  Is it worthwhile having a discussion and maybe bringing in penalties where expenditure ceilings are breached?  If the process is robust and they are discussed and scrutinised enough there needs to be a consequence when they are breached, otherwise the process is undermined.  I understand and know, having been through the process and through the most recent budget process, that calculating expenditure ceilings is exceptionally challenging in many Departments.  I include the Departments of Health and Social Protection, which we are discussing this evening.  This evening we also have an allocation for flood defences.  It is very difficult at times to anticipate expenditure.  We need, however, to take our responsibilities as fiscal monitors more seriously and be far more responsible about expenditure ceilings.  <\/p>  <p>  The idea behind the multi-annual expenditure ceiling was to move away from the past where the expenditure was set on a short-term year to year basis.  This system offered very little control over Government expenditure and as a result when the crisis hit it seemed much more difficult to regain control of the country&rsquo;s finances.  Multi-annual expenditure ceilings were introduced to ensure that governments would think in a more long-term and strategic way about budgeting, to provide relevant Departments and their Ministers with a clearer picture of the resources available to them over several years rather than just one.  In short, they were brought in to provide control of Government finances but also to allow short, medium and long term planning for Government programmes.  The current framework requires Government to set expenditure ceilings over a three year period.  It sets upper limits for each Department based on an expenditure benchmark.  The system, however, is flawed and does not work.<\/p>  <p>  In a recent report the Fiscal Advisory Council was explicit that the current system of expenditure ceilings is not working.  In many of the budgets since 2011 the actual out-turn of expenditure has been greater than was budgeted.  The council says that for 2018 and 2019 currently planned expenditure already exceeds the ceilings and therefore upward revisions to ceilings are likely to be required.  That suggests the ceilings were either too low or expenditure is getting more difficult to control.  We have to have a discussion and make choices about that.  In many ways the Fiscal Advisory Council operates in a space where it does not have to consider the complexities of that process.  We had a discussion with it at the Committee on Budgetary Oversight yesterday where it accepted that it operates in an environment very different from ours.  We need, however, to have fiscal and expenditure discipline because that is one of the lessons that should surely have been learned in recent years.  We need to have a sense that medium and long-term plans are properly funded in advance and the funding is there to allow those plans to come to fruition and make the impact that we all hope they will make.  We are also realistic enough to know that things happen.  This time last year, for example, nobody would have anticipated the impact of Brexit on our country's finances over the next three years.  Events are often outside our control but that does not take away from the fact that we need a far more robust process and discussion about expenditure ceilings.  <\/p>  <p>  I hope we will reach a point where revisions are rare and with the new fiscal rules we have to get to that point because if one Department breaches expenditure ceilings another will have to pay for them.  That means a cut in services or plans for another Department.  That sets the context for the next six months.  It will be a busy year for the Minister in respect of the expenditure review, the capital plan review, public service pay talks, all in the first six months.  On the night that is in it we wish him a good break before what lies ahead.  Let us learn the lessons of the past few years and not have a situation arise where a Minister has to cut the life out of programmes because of fiscal rectitude.  We owe it as legislators to take the lessons of the crash on board in so many areas, be they housing or services, but in respect of expenditure and controlling expenditure we need to get real. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121400055#GGG00200","speaker":"1335"},{"type":"speech","time":1481743800,"counter":626,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Calleary for his very helpful and constructive contribution.

I look forward to putting my side of the case in respect of the use of taxpayers' resources in 2017 and working and debating with colleagues in the House and where possible reaching agreement with them.<\/p>  <p>  Some critics argue that there has been a huge increase in Government expenditure not planned for or adequately funded.  As we move into next year the rate of increase in total expenditure for 2017 will be less than the rate of growth of our entire economy.  We are doing that because of the focus on eliminating our deficit so that if the global economy does move into more turbulent waters in the coming weeks, months and years the impact of that on the fortunes of citizens will be reduced.<\/p><p>That is why we are being so careful in terms of the additional expenditure allocated for next year.<\/p> <p> On the broad point Deputy Calleary made about multi-annual expenditure ceilings I, as one would expect, am committed to finding ways in which they can work better, while acknowledging that they do a lot of good work at the moment.  I would like to give an example of that good work, while also pointing to the limitations of that approach that I will have to grapple with in 2017.  An example of their good work is that the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, is going to embark on a very significant and much needed reform of the quality and costs of the child care sector.  The Minister and her Department have an approximate indication of the funding that will be available to them in 2018 and 2019.  Of course, that is going to change when the Estimates negotiations for next year take place.  However, at least there is some indication of what spending trends could look like in the coming years to provide some more certainty around policy choices that could be made.<\/p> <p> The expenditure ceilings also have limitations.  As Deputy Calleary acknowledged, their first limitation is dealing with the unexpected.  If the Government had not made an additional &euro;100 million available to deal with flooded roads and ruined bridges earlier on in the year, we would have justifiably been criticised for not doing so when the damage of that flooding became apparent.  While there has been some criticism of the additional funding that was supplied to the Department of Health across 2016, I am sure that the criticism of policy failures or difficulties in the latter half of this year would have been greater if that funding had not been made available to the Department.<\/p> <p> There are also limitations relating to policy changes that governments may make.  Ministers change and governments change.  I believe it is absolutely essential to the vitality of our democratic institutions that if a Minister changes or a Government comes in with a new outlook, they have the flexibility to reflect their own policy views or the views of those who elected them.  If we reach a point at which such latitude is not available to governments, whatever benefits that may be gained by fiscal rectitude will be quickly dispersed by the further undermining of supports that people have stemming from how governments function and spend taxpayers' money.<\/p> <p> I will conclude on that point.  In this job, I never know when I am going to have the opportunity to address the House next, but if I do not have that opportunity before the end of the year, I want to wish Deputy Calleary, Deputy Munster, all of the Deputies that I have worked with across 2016 and their families a happy Christmas and a peaceful new year.  I thank all of the staff and the Ceann Comhairle for all of their work across the year.  I will certainly be taking Deputy Calleary's advice and I will be having a break.  I offer that advice to everybody else here tonight.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121400055#GGG00500","speaker":"1292","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1481744400,"counter":630,"content":"<p>Do not go yet.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121400056#HHH00200","speaker":"1342"},{"type":"speech","time":1481744400,"counter":631,"content":"<p>I hope the Minister continues to take my advice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121400056#HHH00300","speaker":"1335"},{"type":"speech","time":1481744400,"counter":632,"content":"<p>The first half of 2017 in particular looks like it will be exciting.

I thank the Ceann Comhairle.<\/p>  <p>  As I had only just begun my response to these amendments when we ran out of time yesterday, I would like to begin by again thanking both Deputies Troy and Munster for tabling these amendments to extend the list of drugs listed in the Bill.  I am fully sympathetic with their intent and I do believe the list will grow in the future.  I would like to explain why this is not the time to do it and why, when they are looked at closely, both amendments would unintentionally undermine rather than extend the law on drug driving.  The same attitude applies to virtually all of the amendments on Report Stage, that is, that nearly all of them are aspirations I share.<\/p><p>However, there are difficulties with the drafting and there would be, quite understandably, unintended consequences if we were to accept them in their entirety.  I am learning on the job myself that road traffic legislation is extremely complicated and very difficult to get right.  If there are any drafting problems, this can give rise to unintended consequences which we cannot accept and obviously cannot allow into law.  That said, I am happy to work with those Deputies who have tabled amendments which we cannot accept for those reasons.  I am happy to push them further and include their provisions in future road traffic Bills.  There are almost always road traffic Bills pending or being drafted by officials in my Department.  <\/p> <p> I will now remind the House of what the law already says on drug driving.  It is an offence under the Road Traffic Act 2010 to drive a mechanically propelled vehicle while under the influence of any intoxicant to such an extent as to be incapable of controlling the vehicle.  The law covers legal and illegal drugs.  If garda&iacute; find a person driving while intoxicated, a specimen will be taken for testing by the Medical Bureau of Road Safety, MBRS.  The bureau tests for 42 different drugs.  This covers the whole range of drugs likely to be found and to cause intoxication in drivers.<\/p> <p> The law as it stands also has quite a different offence in it, namely, driving while over the limit for alcohol.  In this case, the prosecution needs to prove only that a driver was over the legal limit, not that he or she was actually impaired.  This Bill is putting three drugs, cannabis, cocaine and heroin on the same basis as alcohol by setting legal limits for drivers for these drugs.  It will be an offence to be driving while over this limit without any need to prove impairment.  This is a major step forward in Irish law.  It will still be an offence to be impaired due to any other drug and as I said, the bureau's wide-ranging tests will identify all likely drugs.  <\/p> <p> I have selected three drugs, cannabis, cocaine and heroin, based on the best scientific advice.  I am not sure why Deputy Troy believes that my proposals are based on 16 year old evidence.  They are based on detailed discussions with the MBRS during 2015 and further ongoing discussions with the bureau since then.  The bureau's advice is clear.  Setting specific levels for drugs is extremely difficult and inevitably the evidence base for drug driving internationally lags far behind what is available for dealing with alcohol.  The bureau is clear that it is possible to set scientifically reliable levels for these three drugs now but not for others.  It is not that we do not want to include other drugs.  We do and we will, as and when the scientific basis for doing so exists.  The time is not yet right and the evidence basis is not yet there to extend the list today.  <\/p> <p> I also believe that accepting either of the proposed amendments could have a damaging effect on drug driving law.  To take Deputy Munster's proposal first, it would replace the list of drugs and levels agreed with the bureau with a new list.  The proposed list would double the level of cannabis recommended by the bureau and would remove cannabis acid from the Bill.  This is a by product of cannabis which is often traceable when the original drug is not.  The effect of taking it out would be to make it easier, not harder, to get away with driving after taking a serious quantity of cannabis.  The other drugs in Deputy Munster's list also present a few problems.  For example, the proposed limit for flunitrazepam is set at 300\u03bcg\/L but I understand that it is possible to be seriously impaired well below that level.  This presents a risk that persons charged under the existing offence of being under the influence of an intoxicant could argue in their defence that they were under the legal limit.  <\/p> <p> Deputy Troy is proposing to amend the schedule of drugs in the Bill by introducing a link to Part 1 of Schedule 6 of the Misuse of Drugs Act.  This would bring all of the drugs in that schedule into the new presence only offence being created in the Bill.  There are several reasons this could cause serious problems.  First, the Misuse of Drugs Act is focused on the dangers posed by drugs while road traffic legislation is about road safety.  Many of the drugs listed in the Misuse of Drugs Act may be addictive and damaging to human health but are not necessarily of relevance to safe driving.  This would create confusion between drug enforcement law and road traffic law and would require the Garda traffic bureau to spend time dealing with drugs which have no relevance to traffic.  I have said that it is important to proceed on the basis of sound scientific evidence.  When it comes to the drugs in the Misuse of Drugs Act we do not have, in many cases, the scientific evidence base to tie them to road safety dangers, much less to contemplate setting appropriate limits for them.<\/p> <p> The proposal to allow me, as Minister, to set levels for these drugs in regulations is not likely to be constitutional.  Members may remember the Bederev judgment.  In that case, it was found that the practice of allowing the Minister for Justice to add drugs to the list of illegal substances by way of regulation was unconstitutional.  Only the Oireachtas can create an offence.  It cannot be done in regulations.  As Deputy Troy's amendment stands, it asks the Minister to set levels for drugs and being over those levels would be an offence.  A Minister cannot do that, constitutionally, which is precisely why we are setting levels for each drug in the Bill.<\/p> <p> Deputy Troy's suggestions are fine.  I do not have much of a problem with them, with many of the other suggestions for the Bill or with the list but the point is that the Minister cannot make such regulations.  To do so would mean that the Bill would be open to constitutional challenge.  We do not want the Bill to be open to such a challenge.  That is the problem with some of the amendments.  We do not want any part of this Bill to be subject to legal challenge.  It would be very detrimental to the entire Bill and could delay it for a very long time.  <\/p> <p> I am happy that we are taking the right approach at this stage with a limited number of illicit drugs being included in our new presence only offence.  Setting drug levels is complicated and requires careful scientific review.  Expanding the list of drugs and limits is not something we would want to rush into at this time.  The drugs covered by the new law will be kept under review and once the new system has bedded down we will consider, with the MBRS, whether to expand it based on the operational experience gained and any further advances within the scientific community with regard to setting appropriate threshold levels for other substances.<\/p> <p> Deputy Munster asked on Committee Stage for an assurance that the list would be expanded within a year.  If we are to rely on scientific evidence, which we should, then it is not possible to guarantee when the scientific evidence will have advanced to the point where we can add more drugs to the list.  However, I can promise that when the evidence is there, we will definitively act on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121400056#HHH01300","speaker":"1213","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1481745000,"counter":643,"content":"<p>The beauty of being on that side of the House is that one has an army of officials to help one to draft legislation, unlike those of us on this side of the House.

I will take the Minister's ruling that he cannot accept this amendment because it would be unconstitutional, but I hope he will approach subsequent amendments we table in a more open manner.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121400058#KKK00200","speaker":"1250"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1481745600,"counter":646,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1481745600,"counter":647,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 2:<blockquote><br \/><br \/>In page 9, to delete lines 1 to 10 and substitute the following:<br \/><br \/>&ldquo;<table><tr><th>Reference Number<br \/><br \/>(1)<\/th><th>Drug<br \/><br \/>(2)<\/th><th>Level (units in whole blood)<br \/><br \/>(3)<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>1<\/td><td>benzolecgonine<\/td><td>50ug\/L<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2<\/td><td>cocaine<\/td><td>10ug\/L<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>3<\/td><td>delta-9-tetrahydrocannibinol (cannabis)<\/td><td>2ug\/L<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>4<\/td><td>ketamine<\/td><td>20ug\/L<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>5<\/td><td>lysergic acid diethylamide<\/td><td>1ug\/L<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>6<\/td><td>methylamphetamine<\/td><td>10ug\/L<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>7<\/td><td>MDMA<\/td><td>10ug\/L<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>8<\/td><td>6-monoacetylmorphine (heroin)<\/td><td>5ug\/L<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>9<\/td><td>amphetamine<\/td><td>250ug\/L<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>10<\/td><td>clonazepam<\/td><td>50ug\/L<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>11<\/td><td>diazepam<\/td><td>550ug\/L<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>12<\/td><td>flunitrazepam<\/td><td>300ug\/L<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>13<\/td><td>lorazepam<\/td><td>100ug\/L<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>14<\/td><td>methadone<\/td><td>500ug\/L<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>15<\/td><td>morphine<\/td><td>80ug\/L<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>16<\/td><td>oxazepam<\/td><td>300ug\/L<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>17<\/td><td>temazepam<\/td><td>1,000ug\/L<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/blockquote><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121400058#KKK00600","speaker":"1333"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1481745600,"counter":648,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1481745600,"counter":649,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 3 not moved.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1481745600,"counter":650,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 4 and 5 are related and will be discussed together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121400058#KKK01400","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1481745600,"counter":651,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 4:<\/p><blockquote>In page 18, between lines 5 and 6, to insert the following:<b>&ldquo;Amendment of section 2 of Road Traffic Act 2004<\/b><br \/><br \/><b>22. <\/b>The Road Traffic Act 2004, is amended in section 2, by the insertion of the following:<blockquote>&ldquo; &lsquo;housing estate&rsquo; means an area consisting of a self-contained group of dwellings with a single or multiple entry points for mechanically propelled vehicles;<br \/><br \/>&lsquo;residential road&rsquo; means a road, whether public or private, within an area defined as a housing estate.&rdquo;.&rdquo;.<\/blockquote><\/blockquote><p>Amendments Nos. 4 and 5 primarily deal with the matter of road safety, particularly for children and pedestrians in residential areas, inlcuding housing estates.

However, will he commit to making a progress report or providing statistics in a year's time in the context of the requests to have a 20 km\/h speed limit in residential areas and also for the compliance rate of local authorities?  That would allow us gauge the success of the measure or determine if we needed to strengthen it.  Local authorities use every excuse about having to combine many by-laws and so on.

I had hoped the Minister might see his way to bring forward an amendment in that regard, but he has stuck with the provision included in the Bill which provides an option for local authorities.  I do not believe, however, that they have shown their ability to implement a 20 km\/h or even a 30 km\/h speed limit.

He stated this is a difficult area and perhaps it needs to be simplified and codified better so that no citizen, garda, member of the RSA or anybody else would be in any doubt as to what are the provisions of the traffic law.<\/p> <p> I support strongly Deputy Munster's amendments Nos. 4 and 5.  Approximately 18 years ago, I proposed, at Dublin City Council, that we would have something similar to the home zones which the Netherlands and some of our other European neighbours have, where on going into an estate, the speed limit reduces to what in those days was 25 mph or approximately 30 km\/h.  The roll-out so far, recently, by Dublin City Council, of the speed limit of 30 km\/h or 50 km\/h between the canals, is valuable.  Every driver should know precisely what the speed limit is and it should be clear on every road on which one travels.  That is the work of the local authorities.  Also, in a previous traffic Bill, I helped to insert a 40 km\/h limit - the old 25 mph limit.  Local authorities should not be afraid of using that and I support those amendments.<\/p> <p> With Deputy Healy, I warmly welcome the members of the Promoting Awareness Responsibility and Care, PARC, road safety campaigning group which is in the Gallery, in particular, Ms Susan Gray, Ms Ann Fogarty, Mr. Noel Clancy, Ms Fiona Clancy, Mr. Declan Clancy, Mr. Alec Lee, Mr. David Walsh, Ms Louise Doyle, Mr. John Fleming and Mr. James Regan who have campaigned so hard for so many of the measures that are coming forward in this Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121400058#KKK01700","speaker":"1361","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1481746200,"counter":655,"content":"<p>I merely want to add my support to the previous speakers' contributions.

Every day that it is delayed there is the potential for loss of life but I do not want to make it bad legislation by rushing it through.  We have debated quite a lot of this previously but there are important issues here, particularly in this amendment.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Munster's request is reasonable.  I will certainly ask for a report on this after one year, if this amendment is withdrawn or if the Bill goes through in its present form.  It is fair enough that we should look at how it is working and whether the options are being exercised by the local authorities on 20 km\/h.  I would certainly be happy to do that.  I am not sure what sort of report would do.  I might ask the Road Safety Authority or someone to do it.  I will talk to Deputy Munster about it afterwards, if she likes.  We will find an independent body to have a look and report to us on how it is working.<\/p>  <p>  I also welcome those long-time crusaders in the Gallery who crusaded for road safety for so long and their interest in this Bill.  We all agree that speeding is one of the main causes of death and serious injury on our roads.  Tackling speeding means setting appropriate speed limits for all areas, enforcing those limits and, above all, getting the message across to all drivers of the risk they pose to themselves and others by speeding.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Munster is proposing to make a speed limit of 20 km\/h mandatory in housing estates.  What I have proposed in the Bill is different, as Deputy Munster acknowledges.  The Bill gives local authorities the option of imposing a 20 km\/h speed limit where they believe it is appropriate.  I appreciate the motivation behind Deputy Munster's amendment - we are on the same page - but I do not agree that her amendment is the way to go forward at present.  I certainly will look at it and report back within a year.  There are several reasons for this.  First, we have what I think is a sound principle in law, as it currently operates, that local authorities decide what is the appropriate speed for a given road in their area.  These roads can vary enormously, with visibility, straightness and other factors which affect the question of what is a safe speed.  While the law sets blanket limits for motorways on the main national routes, this is because all of these roads are built to defined standards.  The variety of roads covered by local authorities means that each road needs to be looked at in its own terms and the law has always rightly conferred this task on the local authorities.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Munster may argue that she is applying this specifically to housing estates.  This brings me to the first of a number of additional reasons I believe that it would be a mistake to put the amendment the Deputy has proposed into law.  Definitions in law are notoriously difficult to make precise, particularly in road traffic law.  The definition of \"housing estate\" in Deputy Munster's proposed amendment is problematic.  As proposed, a \"housing estate\" is defined as \"an area consisting of a self-contained group of dwellings with a single or multiple entry points for mechanically propelled vehicles\".  This would definitely not work.  It could mean both an apartment complex or Dublin's North Circular Road.<\/p>  <p>  Next we come to the question of where the Deputy proposes to make the amendment.  Section 9 of the Road Traffic Act 2004 deals with special speed limits.  These are precisely the kind of optional speed limits on which local authorities can decide to which I referred earlier.  At present, the default speed limit for roads under local authority jurisdiction is 50 km\/h, with authorities allowed, by section 9, to apply special speed limits of 40 km\/h or 30 km\/h.  My proposal, as stated in the Bill, is to add the option of a 20 km\/h limit.  I note in passing that Deputy Munster's amendment would keep the 30 km\/h limit but drop the option of a 40 km\/h limit.  In any case, Deputy Munster's amendment, if accepted, would include a mandatory 20 km\/h limit as one of the optional limits in section 9.  This would, obviously inadvertently, be confusing if not contradictory.  We would have legislation that would state that among the options for a local authority was a mandatory one.  I need hardly point out that this would make the operation of section 9 completely impossible since it would become contradictory.  The net effect would be that local authorities, quite unintentionally, would not be able to use section 9 and all roads in their areas would have to be left at the default speed limit of 50 km\/h.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, one key issue which was highlighted by the Jake's Legacy campaign which the amendment does not address is the question of what happens where developments have not yet been taken in charge by the local authorities, and Deputy Munster referred to this.  This is a matter currently being examined by my Department in consultation with the Attorney General's office and I look forward to it being properly addressed when that process is concluded.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121400059#LLL00300","speaker":"1213"},{"type":"speech","time":1481746200,"counter":657,"content":"<p>I will not press the amendment on the basis that the Minister has included the 20 km\/h speed limit but it needs to be enacted and there is an onus on every local authority that has requests for the 20 km\/h speed limit in housing estates and residential areas to implement it.<\/p>  <p>  It is not only speed signage that needs to go up in estates.  In fairness, this is where the Department is lacking in funding of local authorities for road safety measures.  A sign itself is not enough.  We need resources for the traffic corps to ensure that those who speed are caught and punished for it.  We also need funding to provide ramps, chicanes and other such safety measures within residential areas.  The fact the Minister has included the 20 km\/h speed limit and that local authorities can now implement it certainly is progress.<\/p>  <p>  I recognise that defining a housing estate could be problematic.  The Minister gave the example of there being no clarity around five houses on a dual carriageway.<\/p>  <p>  Certainly, the fact that it is there is a significant step forward for the campaigners.

Currently, there is no legislation covering rickshaws.  The rickshaw operators are essentially classed as cyclists, yet they carry  passengers and work on a commercial basis.  Consider that for a moment.  Taxi drivers and bus drivers are taxed, insured, licensed and regulated, but the rickshaw operators both carry passengers and work on a commercial basis in the absence of legislation or regulation.  They are not obliged to be registered.  The authorities have no idea how many rickshaws are operating as there is no register.  It is a massive road safety issue in so far as the operator has no insurance or insurance for the passengers they carry.  If there is an accident involving a rickshaw and passengers are seriously injured, the rickshaw operator has no insurance to cover whatever damage is caused.  There is huge risk for the passengers, as well as other road safety issues.<\/p><p>In fairness, I raised this matter with the Minister early last July and he said he was examining the introduction of legislation.  He also said the NTA was getting legal advice on it.  I do not know whether the Minister or the NTA is dragging their heels on the matter but it appears to be taking a long time, given that huge problems are caused by rickshaws.  There were reports recently in some local media, although I do not know to what extent they are accurate, that some rickshaw operators were dealing in drugs and using the rickshaws as a means of getting drugs across the city.  What would put that idea into their heads?  It is the absence of legislation.  Every day they get on their rickshaws and operate from one end of the city to the other carrying passengers, knowing that nobody is taking a blind bit of notice of them and certainly not the authorities or regulators.  If it is the case that they are involved in drug dealing and are using the rickshaws to get drugs across the city, it is because they have had a free hand.  They are allowed to operate at will as there is no legislation.<\/p><p>I am sure the Minister will vote against the amendment, but its inclusion in the Bill would allow the NTA to regulate.  I cannot see a reason for the Minister opposing it when its acceptance would provide an opportunity to the NTA to regulate rickshaws.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121400060#MMM00400","speaker":"1333"},{"type":"speech","time":1481746800,"counter":663,"content":"<p>I have tabled an amendment in this regard.  I also tabled it on Committee Stage.  At present, no agency or public body has the authority to regulate rickshaws.  The NTA, which regulates small public service vehicles such as taxis or hackneys, cannot regulate rickshaws because a public service vehicle is defined as a vehicle that is mechanically propelled.  Likewise, Dublin City Council and other councils do not have the authority to regulate or license rickshaws because they are not pedal-powered vehicles.  I understand there are three types of rickshaw - some are pedal powered, some are operated by a throttle and some are operated by a combination of pedal and battery.  In 2013, Dublin City Council made draft by-laws to try to introduce regulation for rickshaws.  Obviously it did so because it was aware of the difficulty they present in the capital city.  Rickshaw operators have now moved out to other large urban areas as well.  However, the draft by-laws were withdrawn on legal advice, because the great majority of rickshaws are neither pedal nor mechanically powered but battery assisted.  This means that under the current legislative definitions they are not small public service vehicles, which are defined as mechanically propelled vehicles.  Hence, the NTA is not authorised to regulate them.<\/p>  <p>  Our proposed amendments alter the definition of small public service vehicles to include battery powered, pedal powered and non-mechanically powered vehicles.  This creates a new category of public service vehicle called \"public service rickshaws\".  It includes all rickshaws, mechanically powered, manually powered and cycled.  This closes the legal lacuna and means the NTA will be the authorised body for regulating rickshaws across the country.  The amendments also oblige the NTA to make certain regulations in respect of rickshaws.  The amendments afford the Minister the opportunity to work with the NTA on bringing forward comprehensive regulations to deal with this matter.  They do not tie the Minister's hands in terms of specifying what those regulations should be, but give him the opportunity, if he accepts them, to work with the NTA on introducing regulations.<\/p>  <p>  As my colleague said earlier, there is no regulation at present.  An increasing number of people are using rickshaws as a means of getting from A to B.  No character check is carried out on the people who are carrying passengers in the rickshaws.  They might be convicted of rape or murder, or be the most unsavoury characters.  I am not saying the majority are.  In fact, I am sure the majority are genuine, decent, ordinary, hard working people who are just trying to earn a livelihood.  However, there is no character reference so people getting into these rickshaws have no confidence in the person operating it.  We would not allow that in the case of taxis or buses, so I see no reason to allow it in the case of rickshaws.  There are also no inspections carried out on the roadworthiness of the vehicle.  A person could be getting into a vehicle that is extremely dangerous.  Again, that would not be permitted with a taxi, so why allow it with this type of public service vehicle?  In fact, taxi drivers are put through a rigorous process to ensure their vehicle is roadworthy.  Rickshaw operators are competing with taxi drivers each day, particularly for short hop-on, hop-off fares around the capital.<\/p>  <p>  Rickshaws have no insurance.  God forbid, if anybody was involved in an accident in one, and left paralysed or, worse, killed, there is no insurance.  This Bill is an opportunity.  When it was brought before the committee a number of weeks ago I was on Newstalk to discuss why we had tabled this amendment.  I was surprised at the number of people who contacted me afterwards.  They were genuine people.  One person told me that he could not get a job so he had used his savings as he saw operating a rickshaw as an opportunity to make a few bob.  I said: \"More luck to you\".  I outlined what we were trying to do and he told me we were right.  \"We need to be regulated\", he said, \"because if we are regulated it puts us on a better footing\".<\/p>  <p>  Nobody has anything to fear with this.  It is a sensible, logical proposal.  Like the case made by my colleague, Deputy Munster, I hope the Minister will accept it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121400060#MMM00500","speaker":"1250"},{"type":"speech","time":1481746800,"counter":664,"content":"<p>Before calling Deputy Broughan, I should point out that there are 40 minutes remaining and Members have expressed the view that they wish to see the legislation passed this evening.

Other colleagues have spoken about the lack of health and safety regulations that apply to this means of transport.  Anybody can put a cart together and go out and seek business and he or she can charge anything he or she wants.  There are no safety implications.  Rickshaw drivers are renowned for travelling in pedestrian only areas.  There is a lack of enforcement of regulations on their use.  The local authorities are at a loss to know what to do about them.  They are looking to us to give leadership on this.  That needs to be done.  There is anecdotal evidence of people having being injured and involved in crashes when being transported by rickshaws.  The drivers have no insurance and no liability.

This is quite a sensible suggestion but changing the definition of a term set out in law can have, as we have already seen, many unforeseen consequences and I would be very concerned about the risk of changing such a well established definition as that of a public service vehicle.  It would have many knock-on effects.  The existing provisions relating to intoxicated driving, in particular with respect to public service vehicle drivers, would be impacted by such a change in the definition and there would be negative implications for these provisions.  The definition of a rickshaw proposed around what a rickshaw is not is too wide to be of any meaningful effect.<\/p>  <p>  I cannot give a definitive timeframe for the introduction of new legislation - it would be dishonest of me to say it will happen in March, May or June but I recognise it is a matter of urgency - until I receive and examine the proposals from the National Transport Authority, which should be within six weeks.  I have stressed to the NTA the importance and urgency of submitting its proposals and it has given a timeframe in the early part of the first quarter.<\/p>  <p>  I appeal to the Deputies to withdraw their proposals at this point to allow the NTA to develop a comprehensive response and to introduce legislation under the right Act to regulate rickshaws.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121400061#NNN00300","speaker":"1213"},{"type":"speech","time":1481747400,"counter":668,"content":"<p>Are there any further comments?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121400061#NNN00400","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1481747400,"counter":669,"content":"<p>As I said earlier, we have waited too long for this.

I put my amendment forward in order that this proposal would be able to go through under this legislation, which in turn would enable the Minister to work with the NTA to bring forward regulations quite quickly.  If a rickshaw is not a public service vehicle, then what is?  The person who cycles or powers it is carrying members of the public.  The public are using these vehicles and are paying to do so.  That is a pubic service vehicle.  The Minister said that this would have consequences in terms of drink driving.  I do not believe that people in control of two or three passengers to the rear of them, whether it be on a bicycle powered by a battery, a motor or a pedal should be under the influence of alcohol in the same way as I do not believe a passenger in the back of a car or bus should be under the influence of alcohol.<\/p>  <p>  This amendment was framed in a manner to enable us to progress this issue.

The Minister shall instruct all motor insurance companies to write to all present and future learner drivers stating that driving unaccompanied by a specified qualified driver and\/or without displaying L plates invalidates the terms and conditions of their insurance policy and that any payment made to a third party in the event of a collision may be recouped from the learner driver and\/or the main policy holder.&rdquo;.<\/blockquote><p>Amendments Nos. 7 and 12 attempt to deal with issues that have arisen with regard to drivers on learner permits and the serious level of deaths and casualties which have occurred involving unaccompanied learner drivers.  Last year, some 3,200 drivers on learner permits were caught with no qualified driver present.  To the end of October 2016, a very large number of penalty points - 10,000 - were applied to learner and novice drivers, which included 6,148 applied to drivers for driving unaccompanied.  In amendment No. 7 I was trying to suggest a formula whereby the mere act of driving unaccompanied or without displaying L plates would invalidate the terms and conditions of the insurance policy.  A key issue that would arise here is that many drivers on learner permits are named drivers on their parents insurance policies.  <\/p><p>What I have asked the Minister to pursue in this regard will be very difficult.<\/p><p>Had we been heading for finishing the Bill tonight, I was proposing to ask the Minister for a view on it and then to withdraw it.<\/p> <p> In amendment No. 12, I proposed to amend section 36 of the principal Act by inserting the section to provide that a driver with a learner permit, without an accompanied specified qualified driver should be deemed in law to be driving without valid motor insurance.  The person could, therefore, be arrested by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and charged with the offence of driving without insurance and the vehicle could be seized on the spot.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has alerted us to the fact that there is no power to seize the vehicle in this case and that a driver on a learner permit caught in this situation ends up laughing at the garda and driving away unaccompanied.  There seems to be a grave lacuna in the law.  My Sinn F&eacute;in colleagues have tried to address it in other ways.  This is one aspect of the issue we could have approached.  It is a very serious issue, given that 87 unaccompanied learner drivers died between 2007 and 2012.  A distinguished visitor to the Gallery, Mr. Noel Clancy, lost his wife and daughter, who were fatally injured by an unaccompanied learner driver this time last year.  It was a colossal tragedy for the Clancy family at this family time of the year.  The Minister needs to examine it very seriously and address it.  In two amendments, I tried to give one way forward by giving additional powers to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  There definitely seems to be a lacuna in the law in this regard and I urge the Minister to accept amendment No. 12.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121400063#PPP00200","speaker":"1361","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1481748600,"counter":676,"content":"<p>The amendment was debated on Committee Stage and I will not go through the case I made.

In the main, young drivers, when learning, understand there is a serious consequence to driving unaccompanied.  There is also an onus on us to ensure that when people want to apply for a test, a test is available promptly and that there is a proper insurance regime.  Deputy Broughan also addressed the question of the liabilities with insurance.  It is important that unaccompanied learner drivers understand they are not insured in any way and that, given that they are breaking the law, they are not covered by insurance, although the victim, if there is a victim, would be.<\/p>  <p>  They must also understand that the car, whether their own or their parents', can be seized.  Presumably, a fine or a recovery scheme would have to be put in place to ensure the State was not suffering the expense of seizing cars.  In the past, when a car was seized and the owner went to recover it from the Garda station, or wherever it was stored, there would have been a payment of sorts to the Garda, which was forced to confiscate the vehicle.<\/p>  <p>  Far too often, I have been driving around the country and seen people with L plates driving on a motorway.  One presumes it is perhaps the father driving, not the son or daughter who also has access to the car.  However, on looking through the window one quickly notices that it is probably an unaccompanied learner driver.  If I can see this on a motorway, I presume the garda&iacute; can also see it.  Not enough is done.  Of late, there has been a major campaign to try to encourage learners to drive accompanied.<\/p>  <p>  Progress has been made in recent years in terms of insurance products.  If they reduced the price, it would be good.  Some insurance products specifically tell people that if they exceed a certain speed, which is monitored by a GPS, their insurance premiums will increase substantially.  Other policies are based on speed inhibitors.  These will work in tandem with a fully licensed driver.  While the licensed drivers cannot do everything, they may be able to steer people or explain where they are making mistakes in their driving.  Without this, people will take chances and drive.  One of the keys is to ensure that many of those who are driving and who want access to driving tests as quickly as possible have this access.  Otherwise, people will chance their arm.  At least, Deputy Tommy Broughan is ensuring they understand the full consequences if they do chance their arms.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121400064#QQQ00400","speaker":"1305"},{"type":"speech","time":1481748600,"counter":679,"content":"<p>I support what my colleagues have said.

Deputy Tommy Broughan has also proposed measures regarding insurance and unaccompanied learners.  It raises a very important issue and the law is very clear.

It is not to be treated as a licence, nor do we want to go back to the old culture whereby some people were happy to remain learners for decades.<\/p>  <p>  Since 2010, a range of measures has been introduced as part of a graduated driver licence system including developments such as mandatory lessons for learners, lower alcohol limits for learner and novice drivers and lower penalty point thresholds.
