Funding for the Arts Council has increased in recent years and now stands at &euro;75 million in 2019, and increase of\u00a0some &euro;6.8m or 10% over 2018. The Creative Ireland Programme is also delivering additional resources to the sector, for example, through the Creative Youth Programme and the Culture and Creativity Strategies delivered by local authorities. This increase in current funding builds on the multi-annual commitment to increased capital funding of &euro;1.2 billion over the ten year period to 2028 set out in the National Development Plan, and is in line with the Government's commitment to double funding for the sector over a seven year period.<\/p>  <p>  The Arts Council, which is independent in its funding decisions under the Arts Act 2003,\u00a0operates within a published 10 year strategic framework entitled Making Great Art Work. This strategy prioritises support for artists throughout their careers, by the involvement of many agencies in cultural provision, by the impact of the arts on the creative economy, and by the depth and breadth of people's engagement with the arts.<\/p>  <p>  For example, the Arts Council now \u00a0include as an assessment criterion, \u00a0an organisation&rsquo;s policy on the remuneration of artists. This aims to ensure \u00a0that organisations in receipt of Arts Council funding should offer fair and equitable remuneration to artists.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, last year\u00a0I launched a\u00a0&euro;200m Audio-visual Action Plan,\u00a0an industry-wide, long-term plan, under the Creative Ireland Programme,\u00a0to support the Government&rsquo;s ambition to enable Ireland to become a global hub for the production of Film, TV drama and animation, and which aims to double employment in the sector.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  With regard to legal protections for workers across the arts sector, it is important to note that employees in every industry and sector are entitled to all existing legal protections.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  As members will be aware legislation was introduced by my colleague, the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection. The Employment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2018 should improve the insecurity and unpredictability of working hours for employees on insecure contracts and those working variable hours. Employment law in general should also have a role to play in terms of existing legal protections. There are also institutions for reporting abuse of employment legislation.

In 2016 my Department completed the purchase of 5,000 hectares of lands in Glenasmole. The area, known popularly as the Featherbeds, has been added to Wicklow Mountains National Park, expanding the total size of this National Park to some 22,000 hectares. The lands referred to are thus being managed as part of Wicklow Mountains National Park. 93% of this acquisition lies within the Wicklow Mountains Special Area of Conservation (SAC) or Special Protection Area (SPA), while it is in very close proximity to the Glenasmole Valley SAC. SACs and SPAs are the most important wildlife and habitat conservation areas in the country, considered to be important on a European as well as Irish level.<\/p>  <p>  The Featherbeds are an important area for nature conservation and for public amenity.

This is a critical phase in the development of Heritage Ireland 2030, the new National Heritage Plan for Ireland\u00a0and we need to hear the views of all those we know care deeply about their heritage.<\/p><p>It was\u00a0my intention\u00a0that the 4 month consultation period would close at the end of February.\u00a0Given the huge level of interest across the country\u00a0I have decided to\u00a0extend the\u00a0consultation period by one month to allow more time for everyone to have their say.<\/p><p>To date 74 separate events have been arranged around the country as part of the consultation process and more are being organised all the time. Details of all of these\u00a0public events are available on my Department's website.<\/p><p>The range of events includes public information sessions, roundtable workshops, regional sessions, heritage forums and other events being organised by local tourism\u00a0and heritage organisations. Forty-five of the events arranged to date are open to the public. \u00a0The Local Authority Heritage Officer network and the Heritage Council are playing a tremendous role, making use of their local and regional networks and expertise in public engagement to support our consultation.<\/p><p>Our heritage is a priceless and irreplaceable national asset which belongs to all of us. We want everyone to be able to enjoy this heritage, to have a sense of pride in it, and to keep it safe for the future. The voices we are hearing in the conversations taking place as part of this public consultation illustrate the passion people have for other heritage, their monuments, their national parks, their landscapes, their nature and biodiversity.<\/p><p>To find out about Heritage Ireland 2030 public events in their own county, people should contact the Heritage Officer in their local authority. A list of Heritage Officers is available on the Heritage Council website<i>www.heritagecouncil.ie. <\/i><\/p><p>I am aware that a small number of local authorities do not have a Heritage Officer. My Department will work with these local authorities and the Heritage Council to ensure that these counties are catered for and have a public event for people to attend. People may also contact my Department directly or make a submission through any of the channels I have already mentioned.<\/p><p>Our vision for heritage is a simple one - that heritage is valued and protected. Heritage Ireland 2030 is built around that vision: that the way in which we identify and protect our heritage is the best it can be. I would encourage everyone to avail of this unique opportunity to rethink how we care for our habitats, landscapes, wildlife, historic buildings and monuments, so they can be celebrated and enjoyed long into the future.<\/p><p>The shadow of Ben Bulben, coasts of Sligo, the hills and vales of Leitrim and the wild peatlands and monastic lineage of Offaly show the diversity of what we are all charged with protecting for future generations. These counties at the centre and the beautiful edge of this island provide many exemplars of our built and natural heritage, driving a sense of place in the smallest villages and the urban centres. Their contribution to this strategy is essential. I am pleased that 2 events have been held in Sligo on 5 and 7 February to allow the people from that area to have their say. The Heritage Council has also arranged a regional event for Connacht in Claregalway on 19 February, and two events have been arranged\u00a0in Offaly, on 23 January 18 February.<\/p><p>These public events are\u00a0just one of\u00a0four ways in which people can participate in the consultation.

These Regulations transpose\u00a0the EU Birds Directive and\u00a0the EU Habitats Directive into national law, and provide for\u00a0protection of certain habitats and species across the\u00a0European Union and\u00a0give a framework for specific\u00a0measures to be taken to target areas of concern in each Member State.

The most recent Plan (Ireland's\u00a03rd) was published in October 2017 and includes a number of actions aimed at assisting local authorities throughout the country in their efforts to protect and conserve biodiversity in their areas. Local authorities\u00a0undertake much valuable work\u00a0in this sphere and several, including Kildare County Council,\u00a0have produced\u00a0local Biodiversity Action Plans which are an important element in the overall approach to halting biodiversity loss.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  My Department's National Parks and Wildlife Service will continue to monitor and protect biodiversity in County Kildare through the implementation of the existing legislative framework and in particular\u00a0will continue\u00a0to protect and enhance the habitat and species within the designated European Sites listed for County Kildare.

The sale and any apportionment of the property into lots is a commercial matter for the vendor.<\/p>  <p>  This is known to the Vendors. Through the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS), my Department manages a property portfolio in respect of national parks and reserves of approximately 87,000 hectares. These important biodiversity areas are located all around the country including a large area of County Wicklow, and the 5,000 hectares of lands in Glenasmole purchased in recent years.<\/p>  <p>  Clearly, the Glenasmole purchase of 5,000 hectares sets a precedent, and although the circumstance pertaining are very dissimilar, it is certainly a market factor. As the Deputy will no doubt appreciate, it would not be appropriate of me to seek to negotiate indirectly or publicly. Suffice it to say that I am aware of the public-good value of this property, balanced across a range of demands across my Department. <\/p>  <p>  With regard to the use of the area by hillwalkers, climbers and the public in general, as I have stated previously, I have no statutory function regarding the provision of access to private lands. Nevertheless, it should be noted that the Estate has allowed a permissive access to its hugely popular walking route for many decades and I would hope that this would continue under any new ownership arrangements and my Department has conveyed this desire directly to the vendors and their agent.<\/p>  <p>  As outlined in my earlier replies, my Department's relationship with the Estate here, and more generally, has been positive. It is one of mutual respect and good neighbours, and indeed often working together on shared issue of interest. These include herd management and husbandry, habitat oversight, film-making, signage, visitor accommodation, trail maintenance and designation management. Indeed, for the most part, the boundary between the private estate and the National Park is invisible to the visitor and tourist, with pre-imminence being given to the idyllic shared land, lake and mountainscape.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022100054#WRA02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1243"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Arts Funding","counter":43,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022100054#WRA02950"},{"type":"question","counter":44,"qnumday":24,"qnumall":"[8675\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022100054#WRA03000","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the efforts she is making to address employment and training precarity and poverty among workers and performers in the arts sector; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1238","askee":"1243"},{"type":"speech","counter":45,"content":"<p>Workers in every industry and sector are entitled to all existing legal protections.\u00a0 These protections are equally applicable to people working in\u00a0the arts and film the audiovisual industries.\u00a0 Legislation which is the responsibility of my Cabinet colleague Regina Doherty T.D.\u00a0Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection was passed last December which strengthens the protection of people working in all sectors in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  The\u00a0Employment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2018 is designed to improve the situation of insecurity and unpredictability of working hours for employees on insecure contracts and those working variable hours. <\/p>  <p>  The new legislation\u00a0requires that employers provide employees with certain terms of employment within a certain period after commencing employment.\u00a0 It also\u00a0imposes sanctions for certain offences; to further provide for a minimum payment due to employees in certain circumstances; to prohibit contracts specifying zero as the contract hours in certain circumstances and to provide for the introduction of banded contract hours; to further provide for prohibition of penalisation and for those purposes to amend the Terms of Employment (Information) Act 1994 and the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997; to amend the Workplace Relations Act 2015; and to provide for related matters<\/p>  <p>  Employment law in general should also have a role to play in terms of existing legal protections.

My Department will be seeking details of each site, including summary information about why applicants consider it to be of Outstanding Universal Value, and any information currently available about management controls and legal protections already in place or propsed. My Department will also be assessing the level of likely community engagement and support for any eventual World Heritage nomination. Of course, of itself, this process also affords a great opportunity to communities to enrich their knowledge of the historical and archaeological treasures that exist in their local area.<\/p><p>This is indeed a very exciting time for World Heritage in Ireland. The opportunity to make an application to my Department to go on the new World Heritage Tentative List remains open until June 2020. Further information is available on the <i>worldheritageireland.ie<\/i>website and I would encourage all potential applicants to engage with their local authority, which will seek any necessary advice or guidance from my Department, at the earliest possible stage.  <\/p><p>Apart from, World Heritage, a number of key built heritage sites in Counties Carlow and Kilkenny are benefiting from funding schemes provided by my Department through the local authorities. In 2018, heritage sites in both Counties Carlow and Kilkenny were successful grant recipients. <\/p><p>In Carlow, these included St. Johns Church, Cloydagh, Milford; Borris House itself and its Apple House Walled Garden; Ballydarton House, Fenagh; and Farrar's Tower House, Dunroe. <\/p><p>In Kilkenny, the successful applicants were The Stone Cottage, Callan; Yesterdays, Lower Patrick Street, Kilkenny City; Mountain View, Graiguenamagh; Dunkitt House, Dunkitt; Bridge View House, High Street, Inistioge; 6 Priors Orchard, Johns Quay, Kilkenny City; Old Methodist Hall, Inistioge; Forest Lodge, Gowran; Kilree House, Bennettsbridge; The Thatch, Burnafea, Castlewarren; Ballyduff Mill, Ballyduff, Thomastown; and the Former Stable Block &amp;amp; Barracks, Clomantagh, Barna.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022100055#WRB00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1243"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Cultural Policy","counter":80,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022100055#WRB00850"},{"type":"question","counter":81,"qnumday":36,"qnumall":"[8683\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022100055#WRB00900","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"if she will report on the management and quarterly reports of the auditor pursuant to the performance delivery agreement signed and dated 6 November 2018 in relation to Galway 2020; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

It will also take account of sensitivities across communities in Northern Ireland and continue to recognise that very different perspectives persist on many of these events.<\/p>  <p>  The commemorative programme\u00a0will be respectful, measured, inclusive, and authentic, and will comprise four broad thematic strands:<\/p>  <p>  - A State Ceremonial Strand which will comprise a limited number of State-led commemorations focusing on themes of remembrance and reconciliation and on the commemoration of all of those who suffered and who\u00a0lost their lives during this period.<\/p>  <p>  - An Historical Strand which will comprise a rich and diverse range of activities designed to encourage authentic historical enquiry about this period and promote the use of primary archival sources. Initiatives will be developed in collaboration with State partners, National Cultural Institutions, institutions of learning and other stakeholders.<\/p>  <p>  - A Community Strand, which will involve a collaborative approach &ndash; similar to that adopted for the 1916 centenary commemorations &ndash; between the State, local authority network and community organisations, including in Northern Ireland where appropriate.<\/p>  <p>  - The Creative Imagination Strand, which will continue to encourage artistic and creative expression in remembrance of the significant historical events of the period from 1919 to 1923 and all of those who lost their lives.<\/p>  <p>  On 21st  January the centenary of the convening of the First D&aacute;il was commemorated, with a diverse programme, including a ceremonial event,\u00a0led by the Houses of the Oireachtas.\u00a0 On 20th January, I represented the Government at a community-led commemoration to\u00a0mark the centenary of the Soloheadbeg Ambush.

Ireland recognised the importance of these peatlands and took steps to protect the best remaining bogs through designation as special areas of conservation and natural heritage areas. Between 1997 and 2002, Ireland nominated 53 raised bog sites for designation as special areas of conservation. 75 raised bog natural heritage areas have also been designated under the Wildlife (Amendment) Act 2000 to supplement the raised bog special area of conservation network. Ireland has also identified 50 areas as special areas of conservation for the protection of blanket bog. A further 73 sites containing blanket bog habitat have been designated as natural heritage areas under Irish law. 67 sites have been selected for conservation for one or more Habitats Directive Annex I fen habitat in Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland has approximately 60% of the remaining raised bog habitat in Western Europe. Most of Ireland&rsquo;s raised bog peatlands are no longer of ecological interest as they have been cut over. For conservation purposes, there has been a need to restrict turf-cutting on a number of sites to protect the best of our remaining active raised bog habitat. <\/p>  <p>  Significant efforts have been made by the State to resolve the issue of the protection of Ireland&rsquo;s raised bog special areas of conservation, within the framework of the EU Habitats Directive. This has included the establishment of the Peatlands Council, intensive and on-going engagement with turf cutting interests, the farming community, non-governmental organisations and with the European Commission, as well as the establishment of a long-term compensation scheme for affected turf cutters. The aim is to address the needs of turf cutters as part of an overall raised bog designated network solution, as set out in the National Raised Bog Special Areas of Conservation\u00a0Management Plan 2017-2022. This involves a balance of protecting traditional rights, providing compensation where these rights are curtailed and seeking to facilitate feasible alternatives where possible, while working to ensure that Ireland meets its legal obligations. <\/p>  <p>  The national restoration programme for Ireland&rsquo;s raised bog special areas of conservation and natural heritage areas is contained within this Plan. It is intended to restore all designated raised bogs within 3 cycles, with the first cycle operating for the duration of the Management Plan. <\/p>  <p>  Work on the restoration programme has already begun with a &euro;5.4m project &lsquo;The Living Bog&rsquo; which is co-funded under the EU LIFE 2014-2020 programme. My Department is managing this project and is contributing &euro;1.352m with the European Commission providing &euro;4.056m.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The Living Bog project, which commenced in 2016 and will conclude at the end of 2020, aims to restore the favourable conservation condition and increase the area for active raised bog by 277 hectares on the 12 raised bog special area of conservation project sites. This will contribute to the national objective of achieving favourable conservation status for active raised bog in Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  In tandem with the LIFE project, the National Parks and Wildlife Service of my Department is undertaking restoration works on State owned lands within the protected raised bog network.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022100055#WRB03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1243"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Film Industry","counter":120,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022100055#WRB03550"},{"type":"question","counter":121,"qnumday":50,"qnumall":"[8674\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022100055#WRB03600","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"if efforts to establish a film stakeholders forum have been abandoned due to the fact that some stakeholders have decided to boycott it; if so, the reason some stakeholders are allowed to effectively veto efforts to resolve ongoing disputes across the industry; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1238","askee":"1243"},{"type":"speech","counter":122,"content":"<p>The Joint Oireachtas Committee on Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht on the Development and Working Conditions in the Irish Film Industry recommended in July that Screen Ireland (formerly the Irish Film Board) constitute a Film Forum, with an independent Chair, in order to allow all stakeholders within the sector to meet and work together to develop mutually beneficial solutions for the industry.\u00a0 <\/p><p>Screen Ireland has been endeavouring to organise the Forum and had drawn up a list of all stakeholders to invite to the Forum.\u00a0 These include representatives of workers in the industry which include<\/p><p>- The Irish Congress of Trade Unions (ICTU)<\/p><p>- SIPTU<\/p><p>- Irish Film Workers Association (IFWA)<\/p><p>- GMBh Trade Union<\/p><p>- Screen Guilds of Ireland<\/p><p>The emergence of\u00a0disputes between stakeholders have, however, impeded\u00a0progress on the Forum.\u00a0 I understand that following the transmission of an RT&Eacute; Prime Time programme on the film industry, ICTU and SIPTU stated that they would not attend a Forum to which the IFWA is invited, and that \u00a0the Screen Guilds of Ireland gave a similar response.\u00a0 Based on the ICTU position, Screen Producers Ireland also indicated that it would not attend.\u00a0<\/p><p>It is important to\u00a0underline that the State has formal institutional arrangements for\u00a0the resolution of disputes in all industries.\u00a0 The audiovisual industry is not exempt from these arrangements which consist of the Workplace Relations Commission and the Labour Court.\u00a0 The Film Forum would have a developmental role in the industry.<\/p><p>My Department\u00a0will\u00a0work with the Audiovisual High Level Steering Group\u00a0to address issues raised in the audiovisual industry, and to support\u00a0the industry and\u00a0the people who work in it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022100055#WRB03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1243"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Orchestras","counter":124,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022100056#WRC00150"},{"type":"question","counter":125,"qnumday":51,"qnumall":"[8693\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022100056#WRC00200","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the contact she and her officials have had with members and representatives of the RT&Eacute; Concert Orchestra; if members and representatives of musicians in these orchestras have been included in the working parties examining the potential transfer of the orchestras to the National Concert Hall; the progress made in this regard; and the stage plans are at to upgrade the National Concert Hall.","asker":"1370","askee":"1243"},{"type":"speech","counter":126,"content":"<p>Following the publication of the report by RT&Eacute; that it commissioned from independent consultants Helen Boaden and Mediatique on the RT&Eacute; Orchestras entitled RT&Eacute; Orchestras Ensuring a Sustainable Future, the Government\u00a0 agreed in principle that the RT&Eacute; National Symphony Orchestra (RT&Eacute; NSO) should come within the remit of the National Concert Hall (NCH).

At the moment, these comprise three\u00a0Special Areas of Conservation (SAC) and 12 Special Protection Areas (SPA).\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  As it does on a national level, my Department\u00a0will also continue to advise\u00a0on planning, forestry and EPA licence applications in each of the four Dublin area local authorities.\u00a0It also engages\u00a0in wildlife surveys and monitoring, carries out stakeholder liaison and maintains its educational role. My Department also has a\u00a0remit to\u00a0comment on a variety of licences under the Wildlife Acts\u00a0with the aim of helping to protect\u00a0biodiversity throughout the city and county of Dublin.<\/p>  <p>  In support of the work carried out by local authorities, I announced yesterday at the National Biodiversity Conference\u00a0in Dublin Castle, a commitment in the coming years to double the funding my Department makes available for local Heritage and Biodiversity Officers to implement biodiversity actions at local level and to tackle invasive species. A pilot grant scheme was introduced in 2018 to assist local authority led biodiversity projects and I am pleased that we are in a position to extend this scheme in 2019. In 2018 Dublin City Council, Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown and Fingal County Councils all availed of funding under the pilot scheme. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  I look forward to local authorities\u00a0using the funding available for projects\u00a0aimed at tackling invasive alien species in their areas. Invasive alien species are a significant threat to our biodiversity and can\u00a0also have significant adverse\u00a0effects in terms of the cost involved in implementing eradication\u00a0or management measures.\u00a0I want therefore to enable locally led works and also to raise awareness\u00a0around invasive alien species and biodiversity matters more generally.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is also preparing\u00a0legislation to implement\u00a0certain provisions of the EU IAS Regulation and this new legislation will\u00a0strengthen and update existing legislative\u00a0provisions\u00a0around the management and control of invasive alien species in Ireland. <\/p>  <p>The work of local authorities is invaluable in efforts to halt biodiversity\u00a0loss. The Dublin Bay Biosphere is an important initiative that\u00a0is managed by the Dublin Bay Biosphere Partnership, which includes Dublin City Council, Dublin Port Company, D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, Fingal County Council, F&aacute;ilte Ireland and the National Parks &amp;amp; Wildlife Service of my Department. The Biosphere was expanded in 2015 and\u00a0now covers Dublin Bay, reflecting its significant environmental, economic, cultural and tourism importance, and extends to over 300 km2.  Over 300,000 people live within the newly enlarged Biosphere.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, as well as funding commitments to support efforts to halt biodiversity loss, announced at the National Biodiversity Conference yesterday, I also announced a range\u00a0of additional\u00a0measures, 10\u00a0Seeds for Nature,\u00a0that will raise awareness of biodiversity and strengthen the\u00a0 operational\u00a0framework\u00a0governing implementation of the legislative framework that is already in place. <\/p>  <p>  These include\u00a0bringing proposals to Government on Natural Capital; bringing draft legislation to\u00a0Government to introduce a requirement on public bodies to consider what they can do to promote or restore biodiversity in the execution of their functions; and supporting climate change research to improve our knowledge\u00a0and understanding of climate change impacts on biodiversity and assessing possible nature based solutions to mitigate and adapt to climate change.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022100056#WRC02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1243"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":155,"content":"<p>Question No. 62 answered with Question No. 35.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Monuments","counter":156,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022100056#WRC02350"},{"type":"question","counter":157,"qnumday":63,"qnumall":"[8550\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022100056#WRC02400","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"further to Parliamentary Question Nos. 684 and 685 of 5 February 2019, if her Department receives submissions from the public regarding whether a monument should be designated as a national monument; if so, the number of such submissions received in each of the years 2016 to 2018 and to date in 2019; the number of requests progressed to the designation of a national monument; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1243"},{"type":"speech","counter":158,"content":"<p>Under the 1930 National Monuments Act, a national monument<\/p>  <p>  &ldquo;means a monument or the remains of a monument the preservation of which is a matter of national importance by reason of the historical, architectural, traditional, artistic, or archaeological interest attaching thereto and also includes (but not so as to limit, extend or otherwise influence the construction of the foregoing general definition) every monument in Saorst&aacute;t Eireann to which the Ancient Monuments Protection Act, 1882, applied immediately before the passing of this Act, and the said expression shall be construed as including, in addition to the monument itself, the site of the monument and the means of access thereto and also such portion of land adjoining such site as may be required to fence, cover in, or otherwise preserve from injury the monument or to preserve the amenities thereof&rdquo;<\/p>  <p>  Under Section 8 of the National Monuments Act (as amended), should a structure that meets this definition be in danger of destruction, injury or removal, then I may place a Temporary Preservation Order or Preservation Order on it, which will ensure its preservation.

The TIPH, a civilian observer mission which was established in 1997 as part of United Nations Security Council Resolution 904 and the Oslo II accords, has played an important role in mitigating tension and conflict in Hebron. This conflict prevention mechanism has continued to meet a vital need, and no adequate reason has been given for the decision to end its mandate, which would seem to be a unilateral breach by Israel of the Oslo Accords. <\/p>  <p>  The withdrawal of the international presence is likely to accentuate tensions on the ground in an already fragile situation in Hebron. Ireland regrets this decision and I call on Israel to reverse it. Ireland stands with the EU in stressing that Israel must fulfil its obligations under international law, as an occupying power, to protect the Palestinian people in the occupied Palestinian territory. This decision will instead reduce those protections, leaving Palestinians more vulnerable to persistent attacks by settlers.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy has noted, the observers from the ecumenical accompaniment programme in Palestine and Israel (EAPPI) have also suffered from increasing settler attacks, and the withdrawal of the TIPH has now led the EAPPI to conclude that it too must withdraw its volunteers from Hebron. Many Irish volunteers have participated in the EAPPI programme over the years, and my Department has met with them from time to time, and values their work. Both the TIPH and the EAPPI in Hebron have been engaged in protecting children going to school from attacks by settlers, something which will have immediate resonance with Irish people. These children too are now under increased risk.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to take a firm stance on matters relating to the Palestinian people and the Middle East Peace Process. At Israel&rsquo;s Universal Periodic Review at the UN Human Rights Council last year, Ireland raised the continued expansion of settlements, and urged that Israel abide by its international legal obligations, including under the Fourth Geneva Convention, on the treatment of a civilian population under military occupation. I reiterated our concerns about these policies in my speech to the UN General Assembly in September. The Israeli authorities are well aware of our views, and we will certainly convey our specific concerns about the case of Hebron.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022100057#WRD00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Registration of Births","counter":167,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022100057#WRD00700"},{"type":"question","counter":168,"qnumday":67,"qnumall":"[8867\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022100057#WRD00800","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"when applications by persons (details supplied) will be processed.","asker":"1268","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":169,"content":"<p>Foreign Birth Registration, by its nature, can be a detailed and complex process often involving official documentation related to three generations and issued by several jurisdictions. <\/p><p>Applications generally take 6 months to process from the time all of\u00a0the required documentation has been submitted to the Foreign Births Registration team.

Therefore, whilst the Central Bank Examination was\u00a0underway individual tracker mortgage-related complaints were placed \"on hold\" by the FSPO pending confirmation that the\u00a0Examination had concluded in respect of those complainants.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  In July 2018, a decision was taken by the FSPO to begin to take and advance complaints that could be progressed.\u00a0 Tracker complaints which have\u00a0completed the financial provider&rsquo;s internal dispute resolution process and where they have availed of the tracker framework independent appeals process if open to them are now being progressed, as are\u00a0complaints which have been confirmed by the provider as not being\u00a0impacted by the tracker examination.

In most cases, there has been a seamless integration of the new real-time reporting arrangements into employers&rsquo; payroll systems without any impact on employees.

The Office of Public Works has long experience managing the herd gained over many years.  This is supported by scientific advice from the School of Biology &amp;amp; Environmental Science at University College Dublin and the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine (Deer Management in Ireland a Framework for Action &ndash; 2015).  OPW also liaises with the Royal Parks London, whose deer management practices are endorsed by The British Deer Society and the Deer Initiative of England. OPW is also a member of the Irish Deer Society and it might interest the Deputy to know that it received the John Nicholson Perpetual Trophy in 2016. This trophy is the Society&rsquo;s highest honour, awarded for meritorious service in the welfare, conservation, management and protection of deer in Ireland.  <\/p><p>Deer culling is of course an activity that OPW would prefer not to have to carry out.  However, the cull, as undertaken, is considered to be the most appropriate and humane way to sustainably manage the population of deer in the Park. While there are a number of potential strategies for population control, as outlined below, there are specific reasons why each such strategy is unfeasible.<\/p><p>1.<i>1. Live Capture<\/i><\/p><p>A live capture was carried out in 1991 with over 100 persons involved from Ireland and the UK. However, with current health &amp;amp; safety requirements, skills shortage and the size of the current herd, it is not practicable or safe to undertake this exercise today. Professional advice from the School of Biology &amp;amp; Environmental Science at University College Dublin suggests that this practice has the following consequences:<\/p><p>(i) live capture takes hours to be completed. Stress levels (i.e. corticosteroids) can reach abnormal levels in the animals leading to immune-depression and abortion in females<\/p><p>(ii) live capture requires the gathering of many deer in limited spaces (e.g. temporary corrals) and this can lead to severe or sometimes lethal injuries (especially among fawns and younger deer injured by bucks)<\/p><p>(iii) these risks are accentuated during the transport of deer to a different location.  Deer are wild animals and, unlike livestock, they become particularly stressed when transported on trucks.<\/p><p>1.<i>2. Tranquillising deer for administration of contraceptives and\/or removal<\/i><\/p><p>Use of drugs to tranquillise deer is usually limited to a small number of individual deer selected for research purposes (e.g., body condition check, parasite screening, and deployment of radio tracking devices for individual monitoring).  Darting of deer for capture to administer contraceptives would be an extremely dangerous procedure to undertake in a public park. Darts are often lost during such operations resulting in a dangerous hazard to the public and other wildlife. The quantities of tranquiliser required to sedate a deer could be fatal for humans which is obviously of particular concern in a park frequented by large  volumes of visitors. In order to carry out a safe procedure, darting should be carried out from short distances (less than 25 meters), which means that only a small number of animals could be darted over several days of work in the field. The exercise would be costly, time-consuming and ineffective. Ultimately, this would be an extremely dangerous procedure for the deer (if carried out from long-distances with the intention of capturing more animals) and for the public.<\/p><p>1.<i>3. Transportation to other locations<\/i><\/p><p>The Phoenix Park deer are part of a wild herd and transportation would be very stressful for such wild animals. They would be also prone to injury during transport, as already highlighted above.  Furthermore, it is illegal to release deer into the wild. Most importantly, the deer would suffer significant stress through live capture and transport before being released into a completely new environment, which could soon be over-populated with deer after just a few release events leading ultimately to the same over-population problem and requiring a deer management plan and population control plan for the new location.<\/p><p>1.<i>4. Contraception<\/i><\/p><p>There are no contraceptives licensed for use on wild deer in Ireland.<\/p><p>Although not licensed yet, there are different contraception strategies available for deer, but in most cases, they refer to heavily managed herds (not wild herds), ie. animals kept within enclosures like livestock. The most common strategy would be steroids, which are given to each female on a yearly basis (from Sept to Jan). These steroids can regulate the ovarian cycle so as to produce anoestrus female deer. The main challenge in administering these steroids is that each female must get the correct dose. The only way to do this is to get close enough to each female deer to make sure that it receives the correct dose. This is entirely impractical in a large, wild herd as this form of artificial feeding would disrupt normal herd behaviour and, based on a study by UCD, a success rate of only 10-15% is achievable. Most importantly, females who are not individually identifiable in a wild herd (e.g. without colour-coded ear-tags) could not be administered with steroids as, potentially, individual deer could receive multiple doses over time resulting in an overdose of the medication.<\/p><p>The alternative is to administer steroids via supplementary feeding (e.g. pills mixed with attractive food). This is considered to be high risk due to potential overdosing among females and the ingestion of the food by male deer which would have a detrimental effect on them. As far as injecting contraception, this would require the capture and immobilisation of each female for injection which is clearly not feasible. Most contraceptive strategies would require multiple captures per year of each female with clear negative consequences for the animals.  It would also be virtually impossible to capture all the females of the deer population. Wild deer simply cannot be rounded up in any realistic way without causing severe stress and injury to both animals and operatives involved.<\/p><p>Perhaps most importantly, steroidal contraceptives are a significant risk in respect of pollution to both the environment and the food chain (e.g. crows and foxes eat deer that have perished from natural causes). Oral contraceptives, similar to those used by humans, cannot be given to wild animals because other animals would potentially pick on leftovers of deer feed and would be adversely affected. Droppings and urine from the deer would also contaminate the habitat. Hormonal contraceptives would interfere with antler growth and shedding.  It would be impossible to feed such contraceptives to females only and to prevent male deer consuming them.<\/p><p>Sterilization of males has been deemed inefficient, as just one fertile male remaining in the herd is sufficient to sire a very large number of deer. When considering the use of contraceptives among the female deer population, there are other negative aspects to consider in respect of the welfare of the male deer. The adoption of female contraception strategies, assuming that these were possible, would have the effect that most of the females would not be in oestrus during the rutting season. This would have a significant effect on male stress and behaviour. The males would inevitably fight for the limited number of oestrus females available (as indicated above it would be impossible to give the proper contraception dose to all females, so some of them will be in oestrus during the rut). Male stress levels would be higher due to increased male competition for access to the fewer oestrus females. Many males would likely roam the Park in the continuous search of oestrus females, increasing the likelihood of being involved in traffic accidents and, as recorded in other study sites, they may attempt to leave the Park to look for females in the wider urban setting.<\/p><p>The wild deer herd is an integral part of the biodiversity of the Phoenix Park and has been such for over 350 years. Adopting measures that would significantly reduce numbers instead of maintaining them at sustainable levels would have a major impact on the biodiversity of the Park and result in significant change to other wildlife habitats. <\/p><p>I can assure the Deputy that OPW will continue to monitor options available to it in managing the wild herd and will continue to engage with the School of Biology &amp;amp; Environmental Science in University College Dublin, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the Irish Deer Society in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022100057#WRD05000","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Cycling Facilities Provision","counter":211,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022100057#WRD05100"},{"type":"question","counter":212,"qnumday":82,"qnumall":"[8870\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022100057#WRD05200","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 185 of 10 July 2018,  the date on which works will commence on the changeover; the details of the recommendations of the report; the progress made on implementing same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1226","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":213,"content":"<p>Given the comprehensive nature of this report and the significant engineering options presented, the Office of Public Works is considering the recommendations regarding the cycle and pedestrian paths along Chesterfield Avenue in the context of the Phoenix Park&rsquo;s historic structure and natural amenities.

While many Irish businesses already have plans in place to mitigate the impacts of Brexit, I am conscious that\u00a0a proportion of\u00a0businesses have delayed their Brexit planning\u00a0due to\u00a0the degree of uncertainty in the UK surrounding the Brexit negotiations and the withdrawal process. As we approach the withdrawal date, I am\u00a0urging all businesses to prepare, make all necessary decisions, and complete all required administrative actions. <\/p>  <p>  Extensive work has been ongoing in my Department and across Government to help businesses prepare for all Brexit eventualities. This includes research and development of supports to help ensure that businesses are prepared for potential difficulties arising as a result of the UK&rsquo;s decision to leave the EU. It is important that businesses understand that there are supports and advice available to help them prepare for Brexit. <\/p>  <p>  My Department and its agencies are fully engaged in preparing Irish businesses for Brexit and have participated in the Government of Ireland&rsquo;s series of Getting Ireland Brexit Ready events in Cork, Galway, Monaghan, Dublin, Limerick and Donegal. As part of awareness-raising activities, EI continues to roll out regional Brexit Advisory clinics. To date, these clinics have been held in Letterkenny, Tralee, Portlaoise, Claremorris, Cootehill, Charleville, Dublin, Galway, Dundalk, Waterford and Limerick. Further events are planned in Galway, Cork, Letterkenny and Dublin ahead of the withdrawal date. <\/p>  <p>  EI has also been running a PrepareforBrexit communications campaign, featuring the Brexit SME Scorecard and the PrepareforBrexit.ie website, which offers information on the likely impacts of Brexit on Irish businesses and how these impacts might be mitigated. The Brexit SME Scorecard is an interactive online platform that can be used by all Irish businesses to self-assess their exposure to Brexit. EI has also made available a Be Prepared Grant which offers up to &euro;5,000 for exporting client companies to conduct further research and use external expertise to develop a Brexit Action Plan. <\/p>  <p>  Funding to the Local Enterprise Offices has been increased by 22% and they, along with InterTradeIreland,\u00a0are offering a range of Brexit focused supports to companies, including those engaged in cross-border trade with Northern Ireland. InterTradeIreland continues to offer its Brexit: Start to Plan voucher scheme, which makes available financial support of up to &euro;2,250 towards professional advisory services to address Brexit-related challenges.<\/p>  <p>  The\u00a0LEOs offer Brexit supports to micro and small businesses through the 31 LEOs nationwide. These\u00a0include a &ldquo;Technical Assistance for Micro-enterprises&rdquo; grant, designed to support qualifying businesses to diversify into new markets, enabling companies to explore and develop new market opportunities. This is accompanied by tailored mentoring to address Brexit-related business challenges, and targeted training on specific Brexit challenges.<\/p>  <p>  After the withdrawal date, businesses that continue to buy goods from the UK will be classed as importers. This has the potential to cause further disruption to supply chains. Businesses are encouraged to contact Revenue to understand the changes that may affect them once the UK leaves the EU. Businesses are also urged to contact their suppliers and service providers to seek assurances about the continuity of the supply of their goods and services post Brexit.<\/p>  <p>  Where standards and conformity assessment are areas of potential concern, businesses are encouraged to contact the National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI), which\u00a0provides support and guidance to Irish businesses and industry to mitigate Brexit effects on standards and certification.\u00a0For businesses importing chemicals from the UK, the Health and Safety Authority's (HSA) Chemicals Helpdesk is available to help prepare for Brexit. <\/p>  <p>  For further information, as well as a full list of the information and advisory supports available, businesses should consult my Department's\u00a0Getting Business Brexit Ready page\u00a0at dbei.gov.ie\/BrexitReady.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022100059#WRF03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"question","counter":317,"qnumday":117,"qnumall":"[8938\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022100059#WRF03800","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the timeline for implementation of all the recommendations to date in relation to the report by the expert group on future skills needs on addressing the skills needs arising from the potential trade implications of Brexit; the details of recommendations implemented and not implemented to date, in tabular form; the details of all customs awareness and higher level customs clearance training and advice for third country trading that are in place; the number of participants in customs training and mentoring supports that was announced in budget 2019; and the amount of such funding expended that was announced in Budget 2019 to date regarding customs training.","asker":"1229","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":318,"content":"<p>The Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGFSN) is an independent body tasked with advising the Government on the current and future skills needs of the Irish economy, as well as any other issues that impact on the national potential for enterprise and employment growth.<\/p><p>In June of last year the Group published its report &ldquo;Addressing the Skills Needs Arising from the Potential Trade Implications of Brexit&rdquo;, which was an important contribution to the evidence base on Brexit and the Government&rsquo;s wider contingency planning.<\/p><p>Following the report&rsquo;s publication my Department formally engaged with the responsible bodies identified in the report, including a number of Government Departments, agencies, and industry bodies, to action and formally progress its recommendations- the timelines for which, as per the advice offered by the EGFSN, were both short term and longer term in nature. <\/p><p>The recommendations of the EGFSN have been reflected in the work the Government has undertaken to ensure the enterprise base can respond to Brexit through enhancing its capacity to compete, innovate and trade.

13 horticulture projects.<\/p>  <p>  39 projects across the three sectors were successfully completed and &euro;6.5m was paid in grant aid. In the small meat sector, 18 completed projects were paid a total of &euro;3.5m, with 14 completed mart projects grant aided to a total of &euro;1.6m.  The remainder related to the horticulture sector.<\/p>  <p>  The economic downturn in Ireland, at that time, played a role in the reduction in the uptake of the capital investment scheme, with 27 applicants unable to proceed with the investments. With their agreement, their approvals were ultimately revoked.  <\/p>  <p>  Grant aid in the livestock marts sector was aimed at supporting a positive impact on the environment by providing marts with adequate slurry storage and treatment facilities while the projects in the small meat sector included grant aid to small slaughterhouses and low throughput enterprises to aid improvement in efficiency and to enable the production of new and innovative quality products to assist food business operators to develop new markets.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022100061#WRH04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Food Exports","counter":433,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022100061#WRH04200"},{"type":"question","counter":434,"qnumday":159,"qnumall":"[8932\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022100061#WRH04300","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the volume and value of butter exports to each applicable country in 2017 and 2018; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1244","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":435,"content":"<p>In 2018, Ireland exported dairy products, including butter to 131 countries totalling over &euro;4.5 billion worth of produce.

The Waste Management Act imposes a general duty of care on holders of waste, under which a person may not hold, transport, recover or dispose of waste in a manner that causes, or is likely to cause, environmental pollution.<\/p>  <p>  Each local authority is responsible for the supervision and the enforcement of the relevant provisions of the Waste Management Act in relation to the holding, recovery and disposal of waste within its functional area. Local authorities have specific powers under the Act to require measures to be taken, or to take measures directly, to prevent or limit environmental pollution caused or likely to be caused by the holding, recovery or disposal of waste, and to mitigate or remedy the effects on the environment of such activity.<\/p>  <p>  Under section 60(3) of the Waste Management Act 1996, as Minister, I am precluded from exercising any power or control in relation to the performance by a local authority, in particular circumstances, of a statutory function vested in it. <\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, while enforcement action in this area is a matter in the first instance for local authorities, my Department encourages a multi-facetted approach to tackling the problem, incorporating enforcement, public awareness and education and, as such, provides funding to support the activities of the Waste Enforcement Regional Lead Authorities of approximately &euro;1 million per annum and of the network of local authority waste enforcement officers of approximately &euro;7.4 million per annum. <\/p>  <p>  My Department has developed the Anti-Dumping Initiative to work in partnership with local authorities and community organisations in identifying high risk or problem areas, developing appropriate enforcement responses and carrying out clean-up operations. Since 2017 funding of &euro;3.3 million has been made available from the Environment Fund in this regard which has supported over 400 projects across all 31 local authority areas, remediating black spots and equipping local authority enforcement officers with the latest technologies available to support SMART enforcement of our waste laws. <\/p>  <p>  A review of this initiative is underway which will inform a 2019 anti-dumping work programme that will place an increased emphasis on all actors who facilitate the unauthorised movement and disposal of waste.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022100062#WRJ01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Funding","counter":459,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022100062#WRJ01300"},{"type":"question","counter":460,"qnumday":169,"qnumall":"[8918\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022100062#WRJ01400","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the grants available to agricultural contractors who are SMEs and not farmers and do not have a herd number who wish to purchase slurry spreading machinery which has low emissions and is environmentally friendly in line with climate action policy; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1231","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":461,"content":"<p>On 18 February, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and I\u00a0jointly announced 2019 funding for Energy Efficient Dairy Farm Equipment.

As a single, comprehensive social insurance scheme was only introduced approximately 8 years previously, a system where people needed a set number of years contributions for a full pension, could not have been introduced, without it either (a) requiring very few contributions for the maximum rate contributory pension, or (b) no-one qualifying at the maximum rate for several decades. <\/p>  <p>  Under the Yearly Average approach, people are paid a rate according to their rateband.  For example, someone with 20 years contributions over a 48 year period would qualify at the 85% rate (if they do not qualify for a non-contributory pension at a higher rate of up to 95% instead).  These ratebands have been adjusted a number of times over the decades, most recently in 2012 as an alternative to a reduction in the core rate of the pension, which I believe would be the change referred to by the Deputy.<\/p>  <p>  Since 2010, it has been Government policy to replace the Yearly Average system with a Total Contributions Approach (TCA) to establishing the level of entitlement for all new state pension contributory claims from 2020 onwards (TCA2020). <\/p>  <p>  In January 2018, I announced the Government Decision to introduce a new interim Total Contributions Approach (TCA) to the calculation of State Pension (Contributory) for pensioners born on or after 1 September 1946, who were awarded state pension (contributory) under the post 2012 rate bands.  This approach, which includes generous provision for homecaring periods, will benefit many such pensioners, especially those who took time out of the workplace for caring purposes.  The required primary legislative provisions are contained in the Social Welfare, Pensions and Civil Registration Act 2018, enacted on 24 December 2018.  All the necessary regulatory and system changes have now been made to allow the increased payments to begin. <\/p>  <p>  My Department is now reviewing the pension payments of approximately 91,000 pensioners who were awarded less than the maximum rate of pension since September 2012.  Given the number of pensioners involved, this work will take a number of months to complete.  The increased payments will also include arrears to the 30th March 2018, or the pensioner&rsquo;s 66th birthday if later.  The Department is using information it already has to complete these reviews.  However, in quite a number of cases, additional information is required from the pensioners concerned about gap periods in their social insurance records and my Department will be in touch with each of those pensioners individually to get that information. <\/p>  <p>  As regards the TCA model that will apply for all new pensioners post-2020, I launched a public consultation on the design of the full scheme on the 28th of May to which a wide variety of stakeholder groups were invited.  A number of workshops were also held on the day to elicit views and feedback.  All Oireachtas members were invited to a detailed briefing in Leinster House by my officials shortly afterwards.  The consultation was open for over 3 months and the Department received almost 300 responses from individuals and organisations.  Those submissions outlined the views of respondents on a number of issues, including the number of years required for a full pension, as intended as part of the consultation process. <\/p>  <p>  I have recently been provided with an analysis of the views submitted in the consultation.  Having considered this analysis, I intend bringing a proposal to Government shortly, setting out the proposed details of the scheme.  When the Government has agreed the approach to be taken, I will initiate the work required to introduce this reform.  I can confirm that the model will include provision for homecaring periods. <\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022100063#WRK01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Pension Provisions","counter":512,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022100063#WRK01700"},{"type":"question","counter":513,"qnumday":191,"qnumall":"[8787\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022100063#WRK01800","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if her attention has been drawn to the potential for small self-administered pensions to partner with the State to assist with the long-term lease scheme for social housing; if she has considered the impact that a the lack of derogation will have in this regard; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1228","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":514,"content":"<p>Housing policy is a matter for the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government.

Transposition will raise governance standards, improve trustee qualification and suitability, and increase supervision through enhanced powers for the Pensions Authority.   <\/p>  <p>  While the Directive provides for the possibility of derogation from specific Articles for smaller schemes, I believe that members of smaller schemes should get the same protections and oversight as members of large schemes.  Money saved for pension purposes should be properly protected to ensure that people have adequate income for their retirement years.  It should be noted that Member States must apply certain provisions concerning investment rules and the system of governance to schemes which have more than 15 members. <\/p>  <p>  Article 19 of the Directive sets out the investment rules for occupational pension schemes.  Assets must be predominantly invested on regulated markets, i.e., at least 50%.  This allows adequate scope for investment in instruments with a long-term economic profile and non-listed undertakings such as property and infrastructure. <\/p>  <p>  Small self-administered pensions may continue to invest in the Irish economy, including property, but their investments must be properly diversified to avoid excessive reliance on any particular asset and so minimise risk in the portfolio as a whole.  Such diversification has been proven to reduce investment risk.  <\/p>  <p>  The value of investments held in many schemes fell substantially during the financial crisis.  This emphasised the need for stricter regulation and greater protections, especially for small schemes investing in riskier unregulated markets.  Concerns in relation to this sector are particularly around the protection of the consumer and the money they have invested, the riskiness of investments, the charges that apply, and the standard of governance.  Accordingly, the Government has decided that the provisions of the Directive should apply to all funded occupational pension schemes.  <\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022100063#WRK01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Pension (Contributory)","counter":515,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022100063#WRK02000"},{"type":"question","counter":516,"qnumday":192,"qnumall":"[8816\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022100063#WRK02100","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"when payments will issue in respect of State pension (contributory) rate reviews; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1318","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":517,"content":"<p>Since the end of September 2018, my Department has been examining the social insurance records of pensioners born on or after 1 September 1946 who have an entitlement to and are being paid a reduced State pension Contributory under post Budget 2012 rate bands.

The Commissioner of Valuation is independent in the performance of his functions under the Acts and the making of valuations for rating is his sole responsibility. I, as Minister, have no function in relation to decisions in this regard. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy may be aware that, under Irish law, there is a distinct separation of function between the valuation of rateable property and the setting and collection of commercial rates. The amount of rates payable in any calendar year is a product of the valuation set by the Commissioner of Valuation, multiplied by the Annual Rate on Valuation (ARV) decided annually by the elected members of each local authority. <\/p>  <p>  A valuation for commercial rates purposes is arrived at by estimating the\u00a0Net Annual Value\u00a0(NAV) of the property in question, at a specified valuation date. The term &ldquo;net annual value&rdquo; has a legal definition and is set out in\u00a0section 48 of the Valuation Act 2001\u00a0as &ldquo;the rent for which, one year with another, the property might, in its actual state, be reasonably expected to let from year to year, on the assumption that the probable average annual cost of repairs, insurance and other expenses (if any) that would be necessary to maintain the property in that state, and all rates and other taxes payable in respect of the property, are borne by the tenant&rdquo;. This definition of Net Annual Value is applied to all rateable properties and classes of business on a nationwide basis.<\/p>  <p>  Commercial rates are a charge levied on the occupation of a property based on the valuation of that property determined under the Valuation Acts 2001 to 2015. In the case of a property licensed under the Licensing Acts 1833 to 2011 to sell beer, wine and spirits, the annual value of that license is, under the Valuation Acts, a relevant factor in calculating the valuation of such a property. <\/p>  <p>  Where a property or part of a property becomes licensed to sell beer, wine and spirits or ceases to be so licensed under the Licensing Acts 1833 to 2011, then a &ldquo;material change of circumstances&rdquo; (MCC) within the meaning of the Valuation Acts is deemed to have taken place. Where an MCC has come about, a revision application should be made to the Valuation Office to arrange for a revision of the valuation on the property to take account of the new circumstances.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy may be aware that there are a number of avenues of redress for an occupier of rateable property who is dissatisfied with a determination of valuation made under the provisions of the Valuation Acts, 2001-2015. Firstly, before a determination is made, there is a right to make representations to the Valuation Office in relation to a proposed valuation. Later in the process, if the occupier is still dissatisfied with the determination, there is a right of appeal to the Valuation Tribunal which is an independent body set up for the purpose of hearing appeals against determinations of the Valuation Office. There is a right of appeal to the Higher Courts on a point of law.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022100064#WRL00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1265"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Home Loan Scheme","counter":561,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022100064#WRL00800"},{"type":"question","counter":562,"qnumday":207,"qnumall":"[8827\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022100064#WRL00900","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"when the capital allocations for the Rebuilding Ireland home loan will be distributed to county councils in 2019; the reason for the delay in distributing the funding to date; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1341","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":563,"content":"<p>The Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan launched on 1 February 2018.

The Government recognises the importance of culture, heritage and the Irish language. That is why the Taoiseach has committed to doubling the spend on arts and culture by 2025.<\/p>  <p>  Budget 2019 was an important milestone on this journey. The gross funding package of &euro;339 million for 2019 for developing culture, heritage and the Irish language is an increase of &euro;36 million, or 12%, on that of last year. <\/p>  <p>  Last year the Government launched Project Ireland 2040 to ensure delivery of significantly improved social, economic and cultural infrastructure. Project Ireland 2040 gave explicit recognition to the importance of our culture, language and heritage to our sustainable development over the next decade and beyond.  This recognition is underpinned by the unprecedented commitment by Government to invest &euro;1.2 billion in our culture, our language and our heritage over the 10-year implementation of the NDP.  <\/p>  <p>  My Department's part in this is the &euro;1.2 billion plan for investing in our culture, language and heritage. The level of investment proposed under this plan will transform our cultural, heritage and language infrastructure across the country. This year, we will see a very significant increase in capital spending by my Department, which will rise by &euro;19.5 million to &euro;74 million. This will allow for the very important planning and early-stage implementation phases of a number of Project Ireland 2040 culture, heritage and language projects. <\/p>  <p>  In April last year, I was delighted to launch my Department's sectoral Plan - Investing in Our Culture, Language and Heritage 2018 &ndash; 2027. The plan sets out significant investment on a phased basis over the next 10 years prioritised across 3 areas - &euro;785m for Culture; &euro;295m for Heritage and &euro;178m for our Language.  This level of investment will transform our cultural and heritage infrastructure right across the country and goes a long way towards honouring the commitment to double government spending on arts, culture and heritage.<\/p>  <p>  The 2019 allocation for capital under this plan is some &euro;74 million, an increase of &euro;19.5 million or 36% on my Department&rsquo;s 2018 capital allocation.  This unprecedented increase includes &euro;6 million in respect of Galway 2020 European City of Culture, an additional &euro;2 million for Screen Ireland, over &euro;1.5 million extra for Cultural Infrastructure &amp;amp; Development, &euro;5 million extra for the Heritage programme and an additional &euro;2 million for &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of current funding, allocations fall to be determined annually as part of the Estimates process.  In 2019, total current funding for my Department increased by &euro;16.5m or just under 7% to &euro;265.159 million, including an additional &euro;6m for the Arts Council; an additional &euro;2m across all of the National Cultural Institutions; an extra &euro;2m in additional funding for the Heritage programme and an extra &euro;3m for the Irish Language, Gaeltacht and Islands.<\/p>  <p>  In broad terms, of the total allocation of &euro;339 million for 2019, almost &euro;189 million is for culture, which is an increase of 13%. Of that &euro;189 million, including &euro;40 million in respect of capital, has been allocated to culture.<\/p>  <p>  The transformation and renewal of our national cultural institutions is already under way. I note that work has commenced on the National Library's refurbishment and the National Archives will begin moving files off-site shortly in advance of starting its redevelopment work. Many other cultural institutions are at an advanced stage with their proposals, including the National Concert Hall, the Abbey Theatre and the National Museum of Ireland. Our capital investment programme under the national development plan envisages expenditure of &euro;460 million over the decade of the plan. In addition to this, in 2019 our national cultural institutions collectively will receive an increase of more than &euro;2 million in current funding. <\/p>  <p>  We also will be providing the funding for the essential preparatory work for Galway 2020. This increase in funding also provides for increases to key institutions and agencies that deliver arts, creativity and culture across the country and to further develop the core programme areas to increase citizen engagement with creativity. <\/p>  <p>  The Arts Council, for example, will receive an additional &euro;6.8 million in 2019 to enhance its support for artists and arts organisations. This allocation is more than double the 2018 increase and brings Government support for this very important body to &euro;75 million. The Government and I welcome the very positive reaction of the Irish arts community to this news. <\/p>  <p>  The cumulative impact of these funding increases is further testament to the commitment to double Government spending in the arts, culture and heritage sector. My Department and I will continue to work rigorously with an Taoiseach and all of my Government colleagues towards delivering on the commitment to increase Government spending in the arts and culture sector on a trajectory that will see funding doubled.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022100064#WRL03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1243"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff Data","counter":587,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022100064#WRL03600"},{"type":"question","counter":588,"qnumday":217,"qnumall":"[8826\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022100064#WRL03700","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the number of conservation rangers employed in counties Carlow and Kilkenny;
