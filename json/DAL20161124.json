However, during the debate on the different Committee Stage amendments on this issue, I wanted the report to be produced and available within three months.  I did so for a specific reason.  The Minister's amendment proposes it will be produced within nine months.  I proposed three months because we have real people suffering in a real way, namely lone parents who have gone back to work but who are worse off because of the changes introduced to the one-parent family payment scheme.  I was hoping we would have the report available within three months to discuss it at the Oireachtas committee to ensure it could form part of the social welfare legislation which the Minister is proposing to introduce in the first quarter of next year.<\/p>  <p>  I note the amendment states the report has to be produced not later than nine months.  However, I am trying to emphasise there is a certain urgency about this matter.  There is the additional factor that the organisations representing lone parents will be advising a large swathe of lone parents to revert from family income supplement, an employment-related payment, to jobseeker's transition, a social welfare payment, when the back to work family dividend runs out.  If this report is not produced for nine months, that will already have happened.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112400003#A00700","speaker":"1227"},{"type":"speech","time":1479981600,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I am surprised by the Minister's amendment because he agreed to the amendment I and my colleague, Deputy Denise Mitchell, put forward last week on Committee Stage.  That amendment proposed the report would be commissioned, produced and presented to the Oireachtas committee within a six-month timeframe.  There are significant difficulties facing lone parents.  We all know the poverty rates and the impact on lone parents of the changes brought in over the past several years.  We know the family income supplement was not increased in this year's budget.  Groups such as SPARK, Single Parents Acting for the Rights of Kids, presented the facts and figures to all Members here showing that, because of the failure to increase family income supplement, lone parents are financially better off to stay on jobseeker's payment rather than go back into the workforce.  While the Minister had difficulties with the Dr. Millar and Dr. Crosse report on changes to the lone parent allowance, it showed clearly what needs to happen in this area and the impact of the changes to lone-parent payments.<\/p>  <p>  It is imperative this report is commissioned, carried out and presented to the Oireachtas in a timely fashion.  On Question Time this week, the Minister said he hoped to have the report produced and back to the House in June 2017.  That is seven months away.  With this amendment, he now wants to push it out to nine months.  That is unacceptable.  I know Deputy Joan Collins's amendment on this issue proposed the report would be compiled in six months.  She said she was piggybacking on our amendment to ensure the issue was discussed.<\/p>  <p>  I support the Minister's amendment, bar the timeframe.  We need to have the report as soon as possible.  I do not see the rationale for pushing it to nine months.  It can be delivered within the six-month timeframe.  The Minister's timeframe will not give enough time to analyse the report, given the narrow window between the publication of it and next year's budget.<\/p>  <p>  This is not about commissioning a report for the sake of a report.  There needs to be action at the end of this.  We know the real life cases and the real impacts changes to payments have had on lone parents.  Up to 22.1% of children in single-parent families are living in a constant state of poverty.  These are the facts but there are real people out there behind all of this.  We need action on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112400003#A00800","speaker":"1252"},{"type":"speech","time":1479982200,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I did not get an opportunity to speak on this on Committee Stage but I strongly welcome the concept of producing a report.

The first suggests work on the report should commence within three months of the passage of this Bill and be finished within nine months of its passage.  The reporting period is six months.

A problem everybody on this side of the House has in proposing amendments is the restriction on tabling any that would result in a cost to the Exchequer.  It makes it very difficult to engage fully.  I have tried over the years to table amendments in this regard and have them accepted by various Ministers responsible for social welfare.<\/p>  <p>  What is being proposed is a simple step.  There is a need to tidy up the legislation based on the amended version from the committee.  Sections 12 and 13 are basically duplicates and should not have been dealt with in the way they were.  The Minister indicated on Committee Stage he would accept the proposal on a report.  His indicating this should have triggered the commencement of the work on the report, no matter how long the delay in passing the Bill in this House or the Upper House.  The production of the report should be triggered immediately on the passage of this Bill.  Obviously, it would take six months to prepare it but there should not be a delay.  A six-month period would mean that, by the end of June next year, there would be report.  That is fair enough.  The work on this should begin even if there is a delay in the passage of the Bill in the Seanad.  We do not want to dictate to the Seanad what its timeframe should be.<\/p>  <p>  A number of Opposition amendments tabled on Committee Stage and today propose the production of reports.  When I was a member of the social protection committee during the term of the last D&aacute;il, we travelled to Scotland to examine its equality budgeting services.  One of the steps it was taking at the time might inform the work of the new budget office and the new budgetary committee set up in the Oireachtas.  It would mean that, when preparing measures, including in respect of social welfare and finance, we will have taken into account the effects of those measures.  In this case, the Minister would have already have done some of the work because he would have already worked out the possible consequences.  In this instance, we are seeking a report that will look back over a number of years to determine whether circumstances were as chaotic as those who have come to my clinic have suggested.  The effects were catastrophic for them.  Others might not have this perspective.  These are the views that could be debated when a report comes back to determine whether changes need to be made to legislation.  There could be an anomaly affecting a cohort of those in receipt of social welfare, and they might need to be protected.  Ultimately, this is what social protection is about.  It is about protecting people who fall through the cracks.  We have information from SPARK and constituents.  Probably every Deputy from every party has been asked, especially in the past five years, to propose various measures, particularly for lone parents.  The latter bore the brunt of many of the cuts and the changes made to the social welfare code.<\/p>  <p>  If the Minister is adamant that this must be passed, I urge him, even at this stage, to indicate that he will make the required changes in the Seanad to remove the delay.  Thus, work on the report will start on the passage of the legislation, with a deadline of June 2017.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112400004#B00300","speaker":"1305"},{"type":"speech","time":1479982200,"counter":16,"content":"<p>I very much take the points on board.  If a detailed report is to be produced at all on the changes made over the years to the one-parent family payment, it might as well be produced sooner rather than later.  We might as well have it in good time, well before the next summer recess, so we can all consider it.  I would rather have it produced also.  The difficulty I have is the advice from my officials.  Since we are writing this into legislation, the production of the report becomes a legal obligation.  If the report is produced independently, there has to be a tender evaluation committee within the Department for a specific tender.  That work has started already so we have not waited.  A request for tenders has to be published, possibly on the e-Tenders website.  Appropriate time must be given for the interested bodies to submit their tenders.  Tenders must be assessed in order to ensure the most suitable submission is selected.  Then comes the awarding of the contract.  Those who get the contract need to be given sufficient time to do the work.<\/p>  <p>  Since the production of the report is being written into legislation, a maximum timeframe is being set out.  The process is to be well under way within three months and the report is to be available and published within nine.  That is not the target time but the maximum time permitted by the legislation.  I am happy to remind the Deputies that we have already started the work.  We commit to doing it in a much shorter timeframe than envisaged.  We hope to have the job out to tender before Christmas with a view to having the work done in a timely fashion.  It is then up to the individual.  I do not see why he or she would not have it done by May or June to give us time to consider it before the summer recess.<\/p>  <p>  That we are writing this into legislation creates a complication because we would be in breach of legislation if something went wrong.

I outlined some of the poverty rates affecting children, for example, it is 22.1% in single-parent families.  The national figure for children living in a constant state of poverty is more than 11%.  On Committee Stage the Minister outlined that a number of different reports are commissioned on an annual basis and he outlined one but, unfortunately, the latest figures we have are already out of date because they are from 2014.<\/p><p>I do not see how we can make reasonable assessments or how the Minister can put together a budget without having available the most up-to-date figures for child poverty.  The amendment asks the Minister to have compiled and presented an annual report on child poverty figures.  As there is no statutory footing for the other annual reports mentioned by him, there is no legal obligation.  We are asking for such a report to be enshrined in legislation in order that it would be produced on an annual basis and we would have the most up-to-date figures.  If we follow the Minister's logic on the reports commissioned on annual basis, we will only receive the child poverty rates for 2015 in the next couple of weeks.  As those figures are already out of date, it makes no sense.  It is a simple amendment that would ensure we would be statutorily bound to have the report compiled and published.  We could then make a reasonable assessment of the targeted measures that needed to be put in place.  I do not see how the Minister can talk about lifting 97,000 children out of consistent poverty by 2020 or 2021 without having the most up-to-date figures available that he could analyse.  Last week he said on Committee Stage that we needed the most up-to-date figures; therefore, he actually agreed with the principle.  We are asking him to follow through on it and ensure we would be statutorily bound to have the report produced and presented in order that we could analyse it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112400006#D00500","speaker":"1252","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1479983400,"counter":28,"content":"<p>We have no objection in principle to the amendment.  The point that has just been made by the previous speaker is valid.  The Government's commitment was to reduce the incidence of consistent poverty among the population as a whole to 4% by 2016.  When last measured - the figures were for early 2014 - the level was 8%.  We are, therefore, operating in a vacuum.  We cannot reasonably ask the Minister what progress has been made almost three years down the line because we still do not have the latest figures.  Is there any mechanism by which the poverty figures could be made more relevant?  The latest figure, again for 2014, for the incidence of consistent child poverty is about 12%, or nearly one in eight children.  The actual figure is 134,000, which in this day and age is shocking in a developed economy.  The Minister may tell us that the position has improved substantially since 2014, but anecdotal evidence is all we have to go on because we do not have the up-to-date figures.  The Society of St. Vincent de Paul tells us that it has never been busier in terms of the amounts spend and the numbers of telephone calls received.  On the figures for the levels of homelessness in Dublin, the number of people sleeping on the streets has more than doubled in the past 12 months.  Even though I have not seen the official figures for Limerick, I would say the numbers there are probably even worse.  I know this from my observations in walking around the streets.  The hostels are full.  They are now giving sleeping bags to people to sleep outside in this weather, which, again, is quite remarkable and it is evident to anybody walking the streets of Limerick.  I am constantly stopped by people who ask for my help in getting into a hostel.  When I make inquiries, I find that, almost invariably, the hostels are full, which means that people have nowhere to go for the night.  The problem is becoming acute and we have all the signs that the Government's consistent poverty reduction targets are not being met.<\/p>  <p>  I must ask about the validity of having a programme to reduce the incidence of consistent poverty to a certain percentage by a certain year when we do not have the figures for that year.  We have no mechanism by which to measure it.  Can we make it realistic?  As Deputy John Brady rightly said, when one is planning budgets and legislating, one has the levels of child poverty and consistent poverty among the population as a whole in mind.  In order to introduce the proper targeted measures to alleviate these levels, what one needs first are the figures.  Figures will always be dated to some extent.  The latest report will be for a period some three or six months ago, but it is unacceptable that the most recent figures we have in discussing budget 2017 are for early 2014.  I ask the Minister to tell me whether the matter can be rectified because, clearly, the position is unacceptable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112400007#E00200","speaker":"1227"},{"type":"speech","time":1479983400,"counter":29,"content":"<p>I do not propose to accept the amendment which calls for an annual analysis of child poverty rates and a report thereon to be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and issued to the Joint Committee on Social Protection.  There is already independent annual reporting of child poverty rates through the CSO in the survey on income and living conditions, SILC.  The survey is carried out as part of an EU-wide survey overseen by EUROSTAT and allows for cross-European, country by country comparisons.  It forms the basis for further extensive official reporting on child poverty rates through the publication of the annual social inclusion monitor, the annual national reform programme and the Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures annual report.  The purpose of my Department's social inclusion monitor is to report officially on progress towards meeting the national social targets for poverty reduction.  The monitor is published online and deposited in the Oireachtas Library for the consideration of the Members of both Houses.  Social Inclusion Monitor 2014 is the latest such report and was published in April this year.  It includes a specific section on the child social targets and related indicators for children and young people.  The findings of the monitor are used in reporting on progress towards meeting the national social targets for poverty reduction in the national reform programme.  There is also independent annual commentary on child poverty in the Children's Rights Alliance's annual report card and other social monitoring by groups such as TASC.<\/p>  <p>  I do not believe it would be useful at this time to provide for further analysis and reporting of the same data.  However, I am attuned to the arguments made by Deputies John Brady and Willie O'Dea that we need the figures more promptly because we want to make decisions based on up-to-date information rather than information that is very much out of date.  We are using the poverty and inequality statistics from 2014 and a lot has changed in the economy since.  The 2015 figures are not yet available and I am told by the CSO that they may not be available until the new year.  Therefore, we will receive the 2015 figures in early 2017, which is not really satisfactory.  Obviously, one cannot get the 2016 figures in 2016 because they are collated over the course of and to the end of a year, but one would hope to receive end-of-year statistics within a quarter or two.  We should have received the 2015 statistics in the middle of 2016 and should receive the 2016 statistics in the middle of 2017, but the statistics are collected by the CSO, not by my Department.  They are collected independently.  Inserting something in social welfare legislation which would require us to do it would not make it happen.  We do not have the capacity to take over the job of the CSO and start collecting and reporting on the statistics.  That is not our role but that of the CSO, as it should be.  If we were to insert a provision into legislation which would ask us to do something we could not do, we might as well ask ourselves to collect trade or other statistics and publish them annually.

It also has figures which indicate the lack of any increase in these payments in previous years.  It could be modelling these figures on an ongoing basis and there is absolutely no reason it should not be doing this in its day-to-day work.  Surely, when it is preparing a budget and looking at whether a specific payment should be increased it looks not only at how much the measure would cost but also at what the potential impact would be.  I hope that is what it does in deciding whether payments should be increased..  It beggars belief that, in this day and age, a Department the size of the Department of Social Protection does not have these figures, has to wait for the CSO to supply them and is not doing this work on an ongoing basis.

The Department engages in social impact monitoring and we can publish the information.  We are ready to publish, if it has not already been published, information on the social impact assessment of the changes made in the budget and how they will affect poverty rates, for example.  Anything we do must be done using the baseline data provided for us by the CSO which tells us how many people and children there are in the State, etc.  We make social impact assessments of any policy or proposed policy change.  We have all of that data, as well as the ESRI SWITCH analysis model to assist us, but it must all be based on some baseline data, the data collected by the CSO, the State's statistical agency.

They relate to the impact social welfare changes over the past number of years have had on seasonal and part-time workers.  In the debate on Committee Stage the Minister said this seems to have been raised in Donegal in particular in recent times and I have been raising it for a couple of years.  It is positive that the Department is at least aware that it is being raised in Donegal.<\/p><p>The reductions in the length of time somebody can be in receipt of jobseeker's benefit, from 12 to nine months and from nine to six months, have had a disproportionate impact on seasonal workers.  It is particularly acute in the context of the fishing industry because the length of the season has declined significantly over recent years, leading to the situation where workers can get jobseeker's benefit during the lay-off period but, because of the new time limits, they transition to jobseeker's allowance prior to the commencement of the season when they restart work.  This means a substantial drop in income for many of them and I know of one couple both of whom work in the fishing industry and who suffered a reduction in income of some &euro;120 per week between the two of them.  This is a huge reduction, particularly given that the fishing industry has depended on the mix of social welfare, jobseeker's benefit and the working year, so that people can be available to work in the factories at short notice when work becomes available.  The response of the Department will be that a person can move on to jobseeker's allowance but the means test assessment of earned income from six or eight months beforehand reduces the payment he or she gets.  This is fine for the Department because it saves it money but it affects the ability of people to stay in the area and be available for work when work comes back again.  It has got to the perverse stage that even IBEC is complaining about it because the effect on the availability of workers is making things more difficult for employers.<\/p><p>It is important, therefore, that we look at the implications of reinstating the original periods applicable to jobseeker's benefit.  In response to parliamentary questions I have submitted in the past, the Department estimated that it would cost approximately &euro;39 million nationally to reinstate them which, in the overall scheme of the budget of the Department of Social Protection, is not significant at 0.03% of its entire budget.  It would make a significant difference, however, to the day-to-day lives of people who cannot get alternative work because of the lack of alternative available employment where they live.<\/p><p>The second part relates to the rates for subsidiary employment, where people can access their jobseeker's benefit on the basis of having subsidiary employment of less than &euro;12.70 per day or &euro;4,500 per year.  This had a stark effect last year in south west Donegal where the Department, for some unexplained reason, decided that part-time farmers were self-employed and were not available for work so refused them jobseeker's benefit.  The practice for many years was to work during the fishing season and sign on for jobseeker's benefit during the off period, while continuing to farm for 12 months of the year.  Subsidiary employment is employment one can do while doing one's main employment and this is what farmers had been doing until the Department decided to assess them as self-employed.  I had 21 cases, probably only a small proportion of the total, of which 18 were successful on appeal and where the social welfare office accepted they were not self-employed and so could have jobseeker's benefit.<\/p><p>The &euro;12.70 per day rate has not been increased since 2007 but it should be looked at again with a view to increasing it.  Hopefully, the report such as I am proposing would address this.  In responses to my parliamentary questions the Department was not able to put a cost on the effect of increasing the rate, which makes an even greater case for carrying out a study on its impact.<\/p><p>I urge the Minister to take on board my two amendments.  The Department could very easily prepare the reports as all the information should be readily available.  It is important that these matters are discussed in the social welfare committee so that they can feed into the budgetary arrangements for next year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112400011#J00100","speaker":"1366"},{"type":"speech","time":1479985200,"counter":54,"content":"<p>Within our own party this issue has been raised consistently by my colleague from Donegal, Deputy Pat The Cope Gallagher, and he has given us a very good briefing on the situation.  It is a problem that particularly affects, but is not exclusive to, Donegal.  We put down an amendment on Committee Stage seeking what is being sought here, namely, a report, a study on the situation.  It is clearly unsatisfactory and there are a number of possible solutions.  The purpose of putting down an amendment was to get the Minister to do a report so that we could look at the solutions and hopefully advise him on the best one to adopt.  I did not get a chance to check the record this morning but my recollection is that the Minister gave an undertaking on Committee Stage that he would carry out a study of this problem and report back promptly and I would like him to reiterate that today.<\/p>  <p>  There is a real problem.  In the current system, for part-time and seasonal workers to qualify for jobseeker's benefit they have to have paid 117 contributions over a three-year period.  This equates to 39 contributions per annum, which is nearly impossible to achieve with seasonal work.  If subsidiary income of a part-time farmer or fisherman exceeds &euro;12.70 per day, &euro;63.50 per week, they are not entitled to jobseeker's benefit.  Clearly that is wrong and out of sync.  It probably relates to jobseeker's benefit paid on the basis of hours worked, rather than three days or fewer per week.  The other difficulty with the present situation is that when one social welfare claim ceases a person has to make 13 contributions to get back into the system again, which is not appropriate for people who do seasonal work.<\/p><p>This is having a very real impact on many people in County Donegal and elsewhere.  It is also creating skill shortages for employers who need this type of worker.  If it is going to make people worse off, they will not work in these businesses.  I would like the Minister to reiterate his commitment to have a study carried out in order that we can consider it at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Social Protection to recommend some humane solutions that would bring a degree of fairness and equity into the system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112400011#J00200","speaker":"1227","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1479985800,"counter":56,"content":"<p>I am pleased to have the opportunity to contribute on Report Stage of the Bill, as I did on Committee Stage, working with our spokesperson, Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea, who has submitted the amendment on our behalf.  This time last year when I was not a Member of the House but had worked for many years as a public representative in County Donegal, particularly with seasonal and part-time workers, I asked Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea to submit an amendment to the Social Welfare Bill 2015 and he was glad to do.  We were told at the time, however, that it involved a potential charge on the Exchequer and it was ruled out of order.  We had to find another way to introduce it this year and we did so on Committee Stage.  The Minister said: &ldquo;I do not know if the Deputy would be willing to accept that we will report on all of these issues next year but that this would not be written into the legislation to give us some flexibility around it.&rdquo;  I know that Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea withdrew the amendment at the time because we were taking the Minister&rsquo;s commitment in good faith.  The report should be available by the end of March or shortly afterwards.<\/p>  <p>  Any objective report would highlight the anomalies.  The income of those who work part time or seasonally supplements their social welfare payments, but now there is no incentive to do this.  I know of a company in the north west which required 17 people to come out for a few days last week.  They said they could not do so because it would break their continuity and that if they earned more than &euro;12.70 per day or &euro;63.50 per week, would make them ineligible to receive unemployment benefit.  That amounts to an income of &euro;3,302 per year which should not be sufficient to deny anyone the right to obtain a social protection payment.  We all realise the important role of seasonal and part-time workers in fisheries, agriculture and the hospitality sector at peak periods.  This measure has serious implications for all of the people concerned.<\/p>  <p>  I am pleased that the Minister gave a commitment to come back to the D&aacute;il.  Perhaps he might confirm that commitment today.  I know that many Members are asking for reports, but this would be a specific one and if the Minister were to give a commitment to review the matter, we could move on.  Without second guessing those who would prepare the report, they would see the anomalies and make recommendations that would be in the interests of everyone.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112400012#K00200","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1479985800,"counter":57,"content":"<p>While I do not propose to accept the amendment as a legislative obligation, I will ask my officials to examine the issue of jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit and the treatment of part-time and seasonal workers, including those categorised as having subsidiary employment.  We believe this work could be done in approximately four months.  The matter has been raised several times, particularly in the context of the position in County Donegal but also in other counties, by the Minister of State, Deputy Joe McHugh, as well as by Deputies Thomas Pringle, Willie O&rsquo;Dea and Pat The Cope Gallagher.<\/p>  <p>  It is important, in the interests of equity and fairness, that the conditions for receipt of jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit apply to all recipients, including those who could be categorised as seasonal and part-time workers.  To qualify for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit, a person must be unemployed, be available for and genuinely seeking work, have had a substantial loss of employment and as a result be unemployed for at least four days out of  seven. The jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit scheme provides significant support for individuals who can work up to three days a week and receive a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment. <\/p>  <p>  Jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit is paid in respect of a day&rsquo;s unemployment.  Where a claimant has fewer than 260 PRSI contributions paid, he or she is entitled to six months or 156 days of jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit.  If he or she works three days a week, he or she is paid jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit for three days a week.  This means that he or she can be paid jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit for three days a week for up to 52 weeks.  Where a claimant has more than 260 PRSI contributions paid, he or she is entitled to nine months or 234 days jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit.  If the claimant works three days a week, he or she is paid jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit for three days a week.  This means that he or she can be paid jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit for three days a week for up to 18 months.<\/p>  <p>  Changes to extend the duration of the jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit scheme would have to be considered in an overall policy and budgetary context, but they would have to apply to all recipients of jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit.  Where a person exhausts his or her entitlement to jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit, he or she must pay 13 additional PRSI contributions to requalify.  This requirement is in place to ensure the person has a reasonable connection with the labour market before he or she can requalify.  Where a person does not qualify for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit or has used up his or her entitlement to jobseeker's benefit, he or she can apply for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance, which is a means-based payment and paid at the same weekly rate as jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit.  <\/p>  <p>  For an occupation to be considered &ldquo;subsidiary&rdquo;, it must be employment that could ordinarily have been followed by the persons concerned in addition to his or her usual employment and outside the ordinary working hours of that employment.  It must also be the case that the earnings from that occupation do not exceed &euro;12.70 and-or that the person has at least 117 employment contributions in the past three years.  Where a person satisfies the 117 contributions rule, he or she can earn more than &euro;12.70 a day in subsidiary employment and continue to receive jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit, subject to there being no change to his or her subsidiary employment.  If a person does not satisfy the 117 contributions rule, the level of eligible earnings or profit from the occupation cannot exceed &euro;12.70 per day.  However, where the level of eligible earnings or profit is in respect of a longer period, it can be averaged in order that the daily average does not exceed &euro;12.70 per day or, over the course of a seven day week, a maximum of &euro;88.90.  Seasonal and part-time workers who have paid or credited contributions in either of the last two complete income tax years are awarded credits.  Credits protect social insurance entitlements by bridging gaps in an employee&rsquo;s social insurance record, where the person is not in a position to pay PRSI.  In combination with paid PRSI contributions, credits can assist employees in qualifying for short-term schemes such as jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit and enhance the level of benefit for long-term schemes.<\/p>  <p>  For the reasons I have detailed, I do not propose to accept the amendment.  The rules are extremely complicated and I am struggling to understand them as I read the reply.  It does merit some work and a study by the officials to sketch what changes might be made.  We have discussed this issue and think we can certainly have it done in approximately four months and come back to the committee with it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112400012#K00300","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1479985800,"counter":58,"content":"<p>If the work on the report starts from today and the amendment is accepted, it will be at least three and a half months before the time period runs out because the Bill must pass through the Seanad and be signed by the President in order for it to be enacted and the three month timescale to kick in.  It is welcome that the Minister has reduced the timescale from 12 months to four since Committee Stage last week.  That is the nub of my concern.  Unless there is a legislative deadline as there will have to be in the case of this amendment, the work will slip and the report will not be brought forward.  I was worried last week by the Minister&rsquo;s response to the amendment when he said he would report on all of these issues next year.<\/p><p>That reference to next year could mean budget day next year with the report coming back to say nothing can be done or that it has been decided not to do anything.  Another year will then be lost for those seasonal workers and others who are directly affected by this.  It really affects them in their daily lives.  As such, the three month deadline must stand and at present the three month deadline means 14 weeks rather than 16 weeks.  The Minister states in his contribution that he can do it.  I do not doubt that the Minister, as he says, wishes to have it done within four months but with the best will in the world, it will slip and fall through the cracks in the absence of a deadline.  We could very easily end up in the budgetary process next year before there is any conclusion in relation to the work.<\/p> <p> The Minister referred to the 117 PRSI contributions where subsidiary employment does not kick in.  None of these workers are affected by that.  They would love to have 117 contributions in the previous three years.  They would all love to be making 52 contributions every single year.  It is not that any of these people do not want to work.  In fact, they are extremely hard working, but the work just is not there.  That is the simple fact of the matter.  It is not likely to be there.  This will roll out and affect other sectors nationally as well, which is important.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112400012#K00400","speaker":"1366","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1479986400,"counter":60,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his response.

It is not necessary to wait until the Bill is enacted.  If it is not written into legislation, we can start it immediately and have it more quickly.  The various changes to social protection eligibility have worked negatively against seasonal and part-time workers and impose a real and serious hardship on families, communities and employers.  It is leading to skills shortages in seasonal and part-time work businesses.  It is not just employees who are in touch with us, but employers who are not able to get workers.  It is understandable to say that if one is offered employment, there is a dignity attached to it but many of those who are working in Deputy Pringle's town of Killybegs are travelling from my area of west Donegal, which is almost 30 miles away, and other places.  There are overheads and expenses involved and, as such, &euro;12.70 is much too low.

I am having trouble understanding how this impacts on individual cases and I would welcome a report to understand it myself.  I can direct officials to get started on that straight away with a view to having it in March or April to inform any budget decisions we might make.  As Deputy Pringle mentioned, if we are talking about &euro;30 million or &euro;40 million, it may not appear to be a lot in the context of a budget of &euro;20,000 million, but that is not far off what is required to reinstate the telephone allowance and is almost double the back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance.

There were 1,026 families and 2,110 children homeless in Dublin.  Despite all the apparent efforts that are being made to provide homes for people, this is an increase of 48% on last October's figures.  None of us on either side of the House can be complacent about the homelessness crisis.  We should make every effort to remove whatever obstacles that exist and are preventing families from leaving emergency hotel accommodation.<\/p>  <p>  A major part of the housing crisis is the lack of supply and yesterday's announcement by the Central Bank is an effort to address it.  We all know and appreciate that the 20% deposit requirement was putting enormous pressure on those who are saving to buy a house, particularly those who are already paying exorbitant rents.  The Central Bank economists found that the average first-time buyer would have to save &euro;64,000.  However, the new requirements will still prohibit those who own apartments from buying a modest house to accommodate a growing family.  They are the biggest losers in yesterday's announcement.<\/p>  <p>  There is also a large chance that house prices will be inflated.  The new rules will allow first-time buyers to borrow any amount if they have a deposit of 10%, so long as they meet the other criteria.  The other criteria include a lending limit of three and a half times the income of the buyer, which we accept and acknowledge is common sense.  There is no doubt that many people in the country will be relieved with the announcement as it will possibly enable them to get on the property ladder.  However, when these rules are taking in conjunction with the Government's help-to-buy-scheme, some people will only now be required to have a 5% to 10% deposit.  Essentially, 95% mortgages are back in town.  With the limited supply of new homes on the market at present, there is considerable risk of further house price inflation.<\/p>  <p>  We all know and accept that we want diggers on sites, but these initiatives, on their own, are a high-risk strategy.  One of the problems of the housing market is a lack of supply and not enough construction.  How is the Government confident about giving money to potential buyers so that they can outbid each other for limited supply.  How does the Government believe that that will not inflate house prices?  With building costs still very high, how is the Government sure that developers will not see this combined effort, on their own, as a massive opportunity for them to go back to the future when house prices went out of proportion?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112400015#N00400","speaker":"1217"},{"type":"speech","time":1479987300,"counter":68,"content":"<p>Thank you, Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112400015#N00500","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1479987300,"counter":69,"content":"<p>Finally, if I may, is the T&aacute;naiste and her Government satisfied that the &euro;50 million allocated for the help-to-buy scheme, in combination with the new Central Bank regime announced yesterday, will not inflate prices?

I will address both of them.<\/p>  <p>  We welcome the changes to the prudential rules announced by the Central Bank yesterday.  These rules had set borrowing conditions on those seeking to take out a mortgage.  The changes will be welcomed.  When we examine the figures on first-time buyers in Ireland, we know that the percentage is far too low.  This gives a much needed opportunity to those first-time buyers who have not been able to get on the ladder.  As a result of the easing of the rules, they will now be able to do that.  This will be welcomed by individuals throughout the country.  It is also important to note that it will impact on supply.<\/p>  <p>  Yesterday Professor Lane stated, \"The 90% loan to value ratio limit for all first-time buyers simplifies the overall framework, with only 5% of lending permitted above this level\".  He also stated that the rules needed to be adjusted because they were too complicated, but that the limit of a 3.5 times loan to income ratio on borrowing remains.  I believe that deals with the point made by Deputy Cowen.  Professor Lane further stated that he will monitor the situation, as will the Government.  I believe that these are welcome initiatives that dramatically change the mortgage lending rules.  In that regard, I note the reporting from various experts today which speak of a dramatic change.  The move is expected to lead to a surge in home building, which is precisely what is required in the country.  The situation will be kept under review, but we need an increase in supply and for first-time buyers to be able to move out of renting, as they are paying high rents, and get a deposit together.  This allows them to do that.  This is a very welcome change for a hard-pressed group, but the situation will be monitored.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy is well aware of the figures on homelessness.  The new figures we have today are those for October.  There is a slight increase, but they also show that there is a slowdown in the rate of increase, which must be welcomed.  None of us wants to see families in accommodation for the homeless or hotel accommodation.  The Minister has made it clear that it his intention, as I am sure it is everyone's intention, that no family would have to live in hotel accommodation.  We are working steadily towards ensuring that that is the situation and there will be a change in the early months and towards the middle of next year.<\/p>  <p>  There is an issue, but progress has been made.  None of us want to see families in this situation.  Let me note, however, that in 2016 there were 4,240 extra social housing units and that 1,755 homes were purchased, 670 were built and 1,500 voids were made habitable.  These are significant figures and we are seeing many families moving out of homelessness.  As a Government, we have acknowledged that this is a crisis, but it is being dealt with.  The plan was announced in July but, as the Minister acknowledged this morning, it will take time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112400015#N00700","speaker":"1214"},{"type":"speech","time":1479987300,"counter":71,"content":"<p>The T&aacute;naiste's comment on the homeless figures reminds me of a comment Garret FitzGerald once made about inflation when he spoke of a decelerating rate of acceleration.

Is she aware of the catastrophic situation where 600,000 Irish citizens with defined benefit pension schemes are facing virtual pauperisation in their retirement years, despite a lifetime of making pension contributions?  Already six out of ten defined benefit schemes have shut down under this Government's watch.  Now we have the ignominy of the Melbourne Mercer Global Pensions Index putting Ireland at the bottom of the grading list and ranking it the worst for sustainability of its pension system.<\/p>  <p>  If the Government is aware of the crisis, it has a funny way of showing it.  Not only has it done nothing to address this issue, what it has actually done has made the situation worse.  Last week, Independent News and Media, INM, unilaterally closed its defined benefit scheme on the back of a &euro;23 million shortfall, despite the fact that this was the company that got a &euro;140 million bailout from the taxpayer.  There was no discussion and no alternative provided.  It was simply gone.  It is the latest solvent employer to shut down a pension scheme because it does not want to foot the bill.  There is nothing coming out of this House to put a stop to this type of behaviour.<\/p>  <p>  Earlier in the year, we had the appalling example of the Central Remedial Clinic, CRC, unilaterally shutting down its scheme on foot of a &euro;2 million deficit, a tiny amount when lined up against its assets.  To add insult to injury, &euro;2 million is coincidentally the same amount that will be paid from these workers' pension pot to Mercers and all the other advisers involved in that scheme.  This is because the Government put wind-up costs higher than members' benefits.<\/p>  <p>  The same professional experts, who play all sides of the house, advising the trustees and acting as actuaries will now get money from a wind-up and bringing people into a new defined contribution, DC, scheme and money from administering those schemes.  One could not make this up.<\/p>  <p>  The Irish airline superannuation scheme, IASS, also has the same advisers.  They set up a very peculiar and unique funding arrangement.  I do not know if the T&aacute;naiste knows but a new bombshell trustee report has emerged on the IASS.  After years of all the so-called professional advice and a year in operation, this scheme is now in trouble.  Hidden in his report, the actuary stated he is no longer confident the scheme will meet the funding standard.  Normally, he stated in the report, that should be brought to the attention of the Pensions Authority which should be required to intervene and take action.  No action is being taken in this case, however.<\/p>  <p>  When is the Government going to wake up and realise we have a crisis in pensions?

Apparently, it is not compulsory at present, as the Deputy is probably aware.

The reason for the Bill is because in June 2016 the T&aacute;naiste directed the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, to carry out an investigation regarding matters connected with evidence given to the commission of inquiry conducted by Mr. Justice O'Higgins.  We learned in October of this year, however, that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission had difficulty in respect of that investigation because it could not gain access to the transcripts of evidence from the O'Higgins commission.  The reason GSOC could not obtain access to the transcripts was because of the provisions of section 11 of the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004.  That section states that evidence which is given to a commission of inquiry shall not be published or disclosed.  In fact, it makes it a criminal offence to publish or disclose such evidence as it is given.<\/p><p>There are, however, four exceptions within section 11(3) that allow the disclosure or publication of evidence given to a commission of investigation.  They are, first, where it is directed by a court; second, where it is necessary to inform other witnesses coming in to give evidence to a commission of investigation; third, where it is necessary for fair procedures; and fourth, where it is sought by a tribunal of inquiry.  The purpose of the Bill is to introduce a fifth exemption, which would be that the material and evidence can be provided to GSOC where it is carrying out an investigation under Part 4 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Acts 2005 to 2015.<\/p><p>I have written to the T&aacute;naiste in respect to this matter and I acknowledge that she replied to me.  She stated that she is not inclined to proceed with such a Bill at present because the advice she has been given is that it would be preferable to make an application to court.

Earlier it was essentially suggested that if we had spoken less in the debate on the Finance Bill last night, we would not have this problem.  I object to that logic because we have a job - a solemn responsibility, I argue - to scrutinise legislation, in particular something as important as the Finance Bill.  Any suggestion we should have hurried things up to avoid being here until 3 a.m. is not really appropriate.  Given that the debate ran on until 3 a.m., much later than anybody would have anticipated in the discussion at the Business Committee, it was entirely reasonable when we were dealing with legislation dealing with as important and as complex matters as finance and tax to say, \"Listen, we are not doing justice to this at this hour of the night.\"  It is not fair to use strict procedural arguments when things ran on much later than anticipated or to suggest we should have rushed things in order that we would not be in this dilemma.  Against that background, we get late notice of this motion which, by any stretch of the imagination, deals with a controversial issue.  We got last minute notice of a change to deal with a highly controversial issue and most Deputies did not know until 11.40 a.m.  In that context, it is perfectly legitimate to protest about the manner in which the motion has been taken.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112400022#V00200","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1479991500,"counter":230,"content":"<p>This is my point of order.

In that call the Minister suggested the outline of the committee, on the basis that there would be fair representation of all the D&aacute;il groups and that there would be one Fianna F&aacute;il and one Fine Gael representative from the Seanad and two others.  On that basis I said that I would have to take the proposal back to our group but that it seemed reasonable.  We would have to consider whether we would engage with this committee at all because, as the Minister knows, it was our opinion that the committee was not necessary and the D&aacute;il should have decided the issue on the back of the election.<\/p>  <p>  However, given that the committee is happening, we want to participate in it and the Minister's proposal, as outlined on the telephone, seemed reasonable.  Then, however, something else happened.  It turned out that the Seanad would not decide the two other positions beyond the Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael representatives, it would be Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael who would decide those positions - and the balance of the committee - in some sort of back room negotiations that Fine Gael was obviously having with Fianna F&aacute;il.  That is when things began to go off the rails as far as we are concerned.  Let us be clear that this means the Seanad representation on it changes the balance of the committee in favour of those who have associations with one of the two major parties.  This is against the likely representation, if the Seanad itself had decided, of a choice of at least one of those other representatives to be from the camp who are opposed to water charges.

I rejected these because I wanted to bring forward a motion that would at least recognise that everyone in the Chamber, in terms of their group, would be represented on the committee.  With regard to mandate and representation, from a percentage point of view the smaller groups have higher representation than the larger groups.  Is it undemocratic that Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il combined, the two largest parties which have a majority in terms of mandate, would have a majority on any committee?  I do not think this is undemocratic.  This is not a Government decision.  It is a proposal on which Parliament, the D&aacute;il and the Seanad, will make a determination, through a democratic vote today.  What we are proposing here today is a motion on the 16 Members of the D&aacute;il who will be on the committee.

The amendment is self-explanatory.  If someone is unfairly dismissed and goes to the tribunal where there are huge difficulties.  According to the latest figures we have it is up to 63 months before cases are heard.  The people who have been unfairly dismissed cannot get references and have difficulty finding alternative employment.  In most cases people are forced to seek social welfare payments.  Between 1977 and 1993, if an employee received an award as a result of an Employment Appeals Tribunal process the amount of any social welfare payments received was deducted from that award.<\/p><p>That was changed in 1993.  Any award to an individual now is not taken into consideration when the award is made.  Given the difficulties and the fact that it can be 63 months before a case is determined, the amendment has the potential to save the State a substantial amount of money.<\/p> <p> This is a fair amendment and the Minister said he would consider it.

An employer who is found guilty of unfairly dismissing an employee has broken the law.  There is legislation in this area in the Unfair Dismissals Act.  There can be a very long wait of up to five years to have one's case for unfair dismissal heard.  If the employer is found after that time to have been in breach of the law, it is only right and fair that any costs incurred by the State as a result of that breach should be made good.  If one were to win a case in court on an insurance or personal injuries claim, the legal costs would be returned to one.  While this is not a legal cost, it is a cost to the State when somebody is put out of work due to the illegal actions of the employer.  If the person who claims unfair dismissal loses, this does not apply.  Should the person win the claim, it should apply.<\/p>  <p>  I was always active in trade unions when I was in normal jobs, unlike this job.  I am still a member of a trade union but at one stage I used to teach courses for shop stewards on workers' rights and the legislation covering them.  One comes across an amount of cases in which employers blatantly flout the proper dismissal procedures and break the law and where the employee wins.  However, the employer can calculate that the maximum that will have to be paid in compensation under the Act is two years' salary.  That amounts in many cases to approximately &euro;60,000, which cost employers are often willing to bear to get rid of an awkward employee or to avoid paying the full redundancy entitlement.  There are many reasons for this and instances in which it happens.  As an extra punitive measure, employers who are thinking in any way of breaching the strict procedures that apply to workers' rights and the procedural agreements in many employments, or who breaches them by accident, should have to pay a cost.  The State should not be forced to bear the brunt of three, four and five years' worth of social welfare payments.  It should be reimbursed in full by the person or company who breaks the law.  That is what the amendment is about.  It is sensible, simple to understand and I cannot see why the Government would not support it given the net gain to its coffers should it be accepted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112400027#AA00200","speaker":"1367"},{"type":"speech","time":1479993900,"counter":286,"content":"<p>Usually when amendments or comments on legislation come from the Opposition benches, we are looking for the Government to spend more money.  This is a rather unusual situation in which there should be a net gain to the Government.  There is a genuine issue here.  I realise that the Employment Appeals Tribunal could take up to five years to make a determination, which is appalling.  I can see that if one was to force the employer to pay all the social welfare between the date of the dismissal and the settlement five years later, it could have an effect on smaller employers, but that is not a major issue and it is one that could be dealt with in another way.  In terms of what an unfair dismissal can cost the State, Deputy Smith referred to social welfare payments up to the time of the determination that the employee was unfairly dismissed.  As a matter of fact, it could be worse.  I have come across cases where people who rightly took cases to the EAT and won were subsequently regarded as troublemakers which stood against them in seeking employment thereafter.  One or two people I know have been condemned to a lifetime of social welfare because they had the temerity to challenge a dismissal.  Employers regarded them in that way because of it.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister's main objection on Committee Stage, if I heard him correctly, was that this amendment could, in some way, interfere with the ultimate compensation awarded to the employee.  He undertook to see if that was case.  It does not obviously affect the level of compensation to the employee as I read it but the Minister may have discovered something different.

Perhaps we should tease it out, but if a person is awarded &euro;60,000, or two years' pay, on the basis of an unfair dismissal, the return of the social welfare payments should be on top of that.  If the social welfare payments were &euro;20,000 in that two years, it should be &euro;60,000 plus &euro;20,000.  That would set the minds of some employers in regard to dismissing somebody that they have to be on strong grounds to do it.  A significant number of cases are found to be unfair dismissals.  People are blacklisted in respect of future jobs when they take on employers in relation to unfair dismissals.  Perhaps that could be teased out.  The Minister said that if someone was awarded &euro;60,000, the &euro;20,000 would be taken out of it.  It should be on top of it.

In principle, it seems like an attractive and appropriate course of action.  However, if applied to unfair dismissal cases, the principal could give rise to unintended consequences which would not be in the interests of persons found to have been unfairly dismissed.  Before going into detail, we should bear in mind that the amendment would represent a significant change in employment rights legislation which is the responsibility of the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  My officials are engaging with their counterparts in that Department in relation to this matter.<\/p>  <p>  Since 2014, a system of recovering benefits in cases of personal injury is in place in my Department.  If a person makes a successful insurance claim, we can recoup some of the money for taxpayers.  We get approximately &euro;20 million a year back on that basis where an insurance payment goes to us rather than to the person who has already been compensated.  On the face of it, it might be argued that a similar arrangement could readily be put in place in the case of unfair dismissal, but it is important to recognise the crucial difference between these two situations.  In determining the level of a personal injury award, it has always been the case that it can be reduced by the amount of certain welfare payments received by the injured party.<\/p><p>In practical terms, the compensation paid to the injured party is reduced to reflect the social welfare payments he or she has received.<\/p> <p> By contrast, in compensation awards for unfair dismissal, the governing legislation, section 6(c) of the Unfair Dismissals (Amendment) Act 1993, provides that welfare payments are explicitly disregarded in the calculation of financial loss.  This ensures that the receipt of a welfare payment does not diminish the compensation paid to the person who has been unfairly dismissed.  If the legal position was changed to provide for the recoupment of the cost of social welfare payments arising from an unfair dismissal, then it would follow that these costs should be included in the original compensation award.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112400027#AA00500","speaker":"1236","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1479994500,"counter":290,"content":"<p>No, it would not.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112400028#BB00200","speaker":"1367"},{"type":"speech","time":1479994500,"counter":291,"content":"<p>The principle of double compensation, namely that a person is not compensated twice in respect of the same injury, must be central to our thinking in this matter.  The current arrangements draw a clear distinction between compensation properly due in respect of unfair dismissal on the one hand and social welfare payments to meet income support on the other.  If we were to change that position and provide that the social welfare payments form part of the compensation to be paid by the employer, the level of compensation awarded to the person found to have been unfairly dismissed would be reduced to take into account the cost of those welfare payments.  The effect would be to reduce or, in many cases, eliminate the compensation element of the award.<\/p>  <p>  Where an employee is unfairly dismissed, a range of redress is available.  Sometimes the person is reinstated or re-engaged in his or her job, receives financial compensation to a maximum of two years where financial loss has been sustained or financial compensation to a maximum of four weeks where no financial loss has been sustained.  The scale of compensation awarded varies depending on the circumstances of the individual case taking into account, for instance, the question of where the responsibility for the dismissal lay, the measures taken to reduce financial loss and the extent to which negotiated dismissal procedures were followed.<\/p>  <p>  In 2014, 282 people were awarded compensation as a consequence of unfair dismissal.  The amount of the award was less than &euro;1,000 in 16 cases.  It was between &euro;2,000 and &euro;5,000 in 55 cases, between &euro;5,000 and &euro;10,000 in 52 cases and between &euro;10,000 and &euro;20,000 in 78 cases.  In 81 cases, the award was above &euro;20,000.<\/p>  <p>  By way of illustration, a single person in receipt of jobseeker&rsquo;s payment for one year would receive some &euro;10,000 from my Department.  In almost half of all cases determined in 2014, the welfare cost would be greater than the compensation award.  If the period of welfare payments extended to two years or included increases in respect of a qualified adult and children, then the welfare cost could be of the order of &euro;20,000.  We can surmise that in roughly three quarters of cases, the amount paid in welfare exceeds the award.  I presume in these cases, the award would be paid directly to the Department of Social Protection rather than the individual concerned.  That is the way we would recoup the cost.  We would get the money from the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, rather than the person who took the case.<\/p>  <p>  The proposed amendment suggests that welfare payments should be recouped from those paid between the date of the dismissal and the date on which the findings are made.  However, the time period could be heavily influenced by the time taken to adjudicate on a claim rather than the actual award.  In cases where it takes a long period of time for a determination to be reached, employers could end up paying compensation for administrative or other delays outside of their control rather than the financial loss suffered by the person concerned.<\/p>  <p>  The amendment also refers to social welfare payments which would encompass welfare benefits that could not reasonably or with certainty be linked with unfair dismissal, such as illness, lone parenthood, old age or caring responsibilities.  The recovery of benefit legislation in regard to personal injuries is limited to six specified illness payments for this reason.<\/p>  <p>  It is unclear at this stage whether the returns from this exercise would justify the administrative costs involved.  The total amount awarded for unfair dismissals in 2014 was less than &euro;5 million.  It is not possible to estimate how much was paid out in welfare benefits to those to whom awards were made.  The administrative burden on the Department to recover the cost of welfare payments from employers would have to be considered in terms of whether there would be any net benefit to the Exchequer or how significant it would be.<\/p>  <p>  I can appreciate why this proposal has been advanced and I accept fully that it merits proper consideration.  However, it would be unwise to alter substantially the landscape of employment rights legislation without having the input of my colleague, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, who has responsibility for this area.  What is being proposed could give rise to significant additional costs to employers and businesses which could lead to the loss of employment and the closure of businesses.  It could also inadvertently serve to disimprove the position of the person found to have been unfairly dismissed if it turns out that his or her entire compensation award is recouped by the Department.<\/p>  <p>  I would be happy to have my Department undertake a fuller analysis of the issues involved in conjunction with the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and to revert to the Oireachtas joint committee with the results of that analysis as part of the pre-legislative scrutiny for the spring Bill.

They should not need to receive the benefits.<\/p><p>However, they have been sacked and are trying to prove that they were sacked in an unfair manner.  It might be because procedures were abused or breached, that they were accused of something they did not do, that there was a deliberate attempt to get rid of them to save on having to pay out a load of redundancy money or that they were trade union activists and a bit of a nuisance.  There are many reasons.  Having witnessed them at first hand, many reasons are given to dismiss an employee where later he or she receives an award for unfair dismissal.  Take, for example, the Dunnes Stores strike against apartheid when the workers were out on strike for three years.  Within a month of their return to work, the Government having banned the importation of South African fruit and vegetables, the shop steward who was the main representative of the workers was sacked by Dunnes Stores on spurious grounds.  It claimed that there had repeatedly been till shortages in her daily account.  I worked for Mandate at the time and my then boss, Mr. Brendan Archbold, took an unfair dismissals case on Karen's behalf.  It took two years for it to be heard.  We were well aware going into the hearing that the total amount of compensation she could receive was two years' salary.  In fact, she received much less.  She was questioned by the tribunal about what she had done to find alternative employment.  This question is asked by the tribunal - in other words, those who represent the State - and the claimant has to show what interviews he or she has had and outline the efforts made to find alternative employment.  Karen told the tribunal that she had been thinking of emigrating to England.  As a result, the tribunal deducted from her compensation payment an amount for time she might have been out of the State, although she had not been.<\/p> <p> The Unfair Dismissals Act is unfair  It does not pile loads of compensation on the victim of a dismissal.  It is quite the opposite.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112400028#BB00600","speaker":"1367","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1479995100,"counter":296,"content":"<p>T&aacute; an Teachta thar ama.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112400029#CC00200","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1479995100,"counter":297,"content":"<p>Therefore, it should be seen as an unemployment benefit, with the compensation being seen as something separate.

However, unless we take the route of creating equality this matter, we may incur a further and larger cost on the State because the current legislation is open to challenge.  Let me explain.<\/p><p>In 2012 a measure was introduced in this House by the then Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton.  It gave recognition to what were called homemakers.  They are usually women but sometimes men who leave their jobs during the course of their working lives.  When their contributory pension is being calculated, the years over which it will be calculated will run from when they started to when they finished work.  There is a chunk in the middle during which time they did not work because they were making a home.  They were having and rearing children and all that jazz.  That chunk will be taken into account in determining their average number of contributions during their working life and will bring their contributory pension rate right down.  The then Minister brought forward a measure that would discard the homemaker years for homemakers post-1994.  If a person left a job to make a home after 1994, when he or she comes to retire, the homemaker years will be disregarded in determining the average number of contribution during his or her working life.<\/p><p>This is where it is important.  Other Deputies will speak about this issue, but Deputies all over the country may be familiar with it.  There is a group of mainly women - there may be the odd man - who worked in the 1960s and early 1970s.  Generally, in those days, many workers started work quite young at the age of 14, 15 or 16 years.  They did not do the leaving certificate examinations, etc.  They got married when they were perhaps 19 or 20 years old and spent the next ten, 15 or 20 years making a home and rearing their kids.  They later returned to work.  Some of the women with whom I am dealing went back to work as late as 1983, 1984 or 1985 and worked right up until last year and this year.  They retired and applied for old age pension only to find out that, although they had consistently paid a full contributory rate towards their pension for the past 33 years, in calculating the average number of contributions the Department went right back to the late 1960s and early 1970s.  This drags their average number of contributions way down.  In the case of two women, Lillian and Jean, who retired in the past year, instead of receiving the top contributory pension rate of &euro;230 per week, which is what they expected, they are receiving &euro;209 a week.  This is a considerable difference in the amount of money received when calculated over the course of a year and it will be considerably more over what I hope will be the many happy and healthy years yet to come.<\/p><p>There is clear discrimination against homemakers who made their homes in the late 1960s, 1970s and 1980s as against those who did so post-1994 and have not yet retired.<\/p><p>I assume that when the Department wanted to bring this measure in to eliminate discrimination against women who became pregnant and reared children, it looked at when it would start impacting and when it would have to start taking the cost into account.  Clearly, 1994 was chosen for a reason because around that time, it was clear that none of those homemakers from the many years before would have been in a position to retire.  However, we are now coming across a tranche of homemakers who are retiring, have worked for the past 30 or more years and have paid good money into the system.  They are being penalised because they got married in 1969 or 1970 and left their jobs for the next ten or 15 years.  This has been dragged back up to average out their contributions.  As a result, their contributions are being dragged down.  If an amendment to rectify that had been allowed and had passed, it would indeed have occurred a cost to the State, but a justifiable one.  Here is a clear act of discrimination against a certain section of society.  I argue that it is an ageist discrimination, and I believe that we could probably prove that legislatively.<\/p> <p> Over the years, I have listened to various organisations, such as Social Justice Ireland and the National Women's Council, etc., arguing for an equality-proofed budget, which would be a great idea.  We have the opportunity to equality-proof this Department of Social Protection Bill.  Unfortunately, there are many other inequalities created in the Department of Social Protection.  Glaringly, the one that jumps out is the inequality and discrimination against young people on jobseeker's allowance.  If one is 20 years old, one receives a payment of &euro;100 a week.  If one is 25 or 26 years old, one gets a bit more, and older people get more again.  There is ageist discrimination against those jobseekers on different levels.<\/p> <p> This measure is another ageist discrimination against those who are due to retire in this current period, and it will continue.  There will be another ten or 15 years of homemakers retiring without the full pension until we catch up with the legislation that rectified that situation for the years after 1994.  There is quite a serious breach of equality in the legislation and I believe we would be able to prove it is so, whether we have to go to Europe, the courts or to the pensions ombudsman.  This is not going to stay where it is at present.  That is why I have asked in amendment No. 7 that, three months after the passing of the Bill, the Minister would lay before the D&aacute;il a complete report on the homemaker scheme and the contribution years that can be disregarded for the purposes of determining the yearly average of claimants who raised families in that period.<\/p> <p> I can well understand the anger, disappointment and feeling of abandonment by this State of those women who have just turned 65 or 66 years of age and find themselves at a huge disadvantage, having worked hard and consistently for the previous 30 or 35 years, before which they had worked really hard and consistently rearing their children, and before which again they had gone out to work early as young women.  As I said, there is probably the occasional man in that group as well but, by and large, this is discrimination against women on ageist grounds and possibly on gender grounds also.  We really need that report and we need to look at it carefully.  In the meantime, because the original amendment was ruled out of order, we will do what we have to do, whether that is going to the pensions ombudsman, building a campaign or getting advice, because this is a serious breach in the social welfare legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112400029#CC01300","speaker":"1367","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1479995700,"counter":309,"content":"<p>We have all had constituents get in touch with us about the obvious inequality of somebody who has paid fewer stamps potentially getting a higher pension than somebody who has paid more stamps, because it was over a longer period, when it is averaged out.  We discussed this at some length on Committee Stage.  Deputy Smith wanted to find out why 1994 was the year picked.  There is a very simple explanation for it and I believe it is important that the record of the House should be correct and reflect this.  The reason 1994 was picked is because that legislation was introduced in 1994, and not by Deputy Joan Burton in the 2010s.  The homemaker scheme was introduced in 1994 by the then Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Michael Woods.  The difficulty with it is that it only applied going forward from April 1994.  It provided that any woman or person who looks after a child under the age of 12 or a disabled relative can have that year discarded from the averaging denominator.  I forget which comes first, the numerator or the denominator, but it can be discarded from the bottom line in any event.  It is not considered in the average.  As has been said, the difficulty is for people who left the workplace before 1994.  Those people are in an invidious position.<\/p><p>Having discussed all of this at length on Committee Stage, the Minister has indicated to us that his Department is already working on developing a new total contribution scheme in which the amount of one's pension would depend on the total amount of contributions paid.  There are three things I wish to ask the Minister on his plans in that regard.  First, when does he realistically think the country will be in a position to change over to a contributions-based system?  Second, will the homemaker's provisions be included in that as currently constructed, or will there be a different rule for homemakers?  At the moment, if somebody is applying for a contributory pension, he or she can claim credits as well as paid contributions.  What happens to the credits?  Will there be provision for credits in a contributions-based system, or will it be just based simply on contributions <i>per se<\/i>?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112400030#DD00200","speaker":"1227"},{"type":"speech","time":1479995700,"counter":310,"content":"<p>Like Deputy Smith, I met Lillian and Jean.  It immediately chimed with me because, just that week, another woman, Helen, came to my clinic and her story adds another layer of complexity, injustice and discrimination to the story that Deputy Smith has so articulately presented that faces a whole cohort of mostly women.  It illustrates the point well.  Ms McLennon reached retirement age recently, having worked continuously from the late 1970s or early 1980s all the way through to her retirement age.  She made the full 30 or 35 years of contributions and so on.  Upon retirement, she expected that she would get the full pension, but instead of receiving the &euro;230 weekly pension, she is receiving &euro;188.<\/p>  <p>  I understand the reason for this is because she seems to have been hit on the treble in terms of a discrimination affecting this cohort of women of that age.  She had worked part-time for only a few weeks, I think, in the late 1960s.  She subsequently got married.  Later, she was separated.  At that time, if I understand this correctly, when a couple was married, only one person in the house could make PRSI contributions because the woman in the house was not seen as a full equal.  Even though she was subsequently working, she was not making any PRSI contributions.  During the period in which she was not working but was married, she was caught by the failure of the homemaker scheme to be retrospective for those years before 1994.  She was caught by all of those things.<\/p><p>Her yearly average is brought down because she worked in the late 1960s.  Also, some of the work she did is not counted on foot of the fact that she was not able to make contributions because, if I understand it correctly, only one member of a married couple's contributions counted, namely, those of her husband.  Consequently, despite the fact that she has done as much work and made as many contributions as other people who get the full pension entitlement, she gets approximately &euro;40 a week less.  That is an unacceptable injustice and a discrimination against her on the basis that she is a woman of a particular age.<\/p> <p> This is a major issue and an injustice.  We are only beginning to see its impact as this cohort of women reach retirement age.  Many more women will face this injustice in the coming years until that cohort works its way through to the 1986 threshold, when the homemaker's scheme kicks in and they will not be penalised.  Whether it is by means of a combination of basing it on the total number of contributions someone makes, getting rid of the annual averaging, making the homemaker's scheme retrospective before 1986 and eliminating any possible discrimination in terms of women working prior to that date who were treated differently because they happened to be married or separated - I am not quite sure whether divorce was an option at the time - and whose work did not count because they were not liable to pay PRSI, whatever the Minister does, the discriminations to which I refer must be removed in order to ensure that there is equality for women like Helen and the many others who are likely to run foul of this inequity in the coming years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112400030#DD00300","speaker":"1238","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1479996300,"counter":312,"content":"<p>The issue was very well set out by Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith.

The problem was that they failed, pre-1994, to get the homemaker's credit and they had worked.

To get the top rate, I believe that an annual average of 48 or more contributions is required.  The Minister has introduced additional bands so people are moving a little down the pecking order.<\/p>  <p>  This debate should not be confined to homemakers.  It is largely to do with the issue of annual averaging from the point of view of equality in the system.  The homemaker's credit is an issue but I have come across people who took time out of their working careers because they went back to college or whatever.  That is a different scenario but they do not have a high enough annual average, although they might have a good number of total contributions.  Many people of my age that I know who were working at 16 or 17 will have 50 years to average their total payments.  It is the annual averaging that is at the crux of this.<\/p>  <p>  Predominantly, the people presenting are homemakers but I have come across other individuals who took time out of work for one reason or another.  They may have started work at a young age, subsequently went on to college or whatever and, therefore, they do not have that continuous working career.  This is somewhat unfair on those people when we consider that somebody who might have come to this country as a 40 year old and worked for 20 or 25 years will have full entitlement to a contributory pension.  The scheme must be examined in considerable detail.<\/p>  <p>  Deputies Brady and O'Dea will be aware that the Joint Committee on Social Protection will examine the issue of pensions but, to be honest, we cannot do that on our own because of the wealth of information that resides in the Department.  That is the key.  Many people qualify for pensions in different ways and we must be very careful to ensure that changes we make do not have unintended consequences for people currently in receipt of pensions.  Our committee needs to develop our report working closely with the Department because the statistical information we require to test any of the proposed changes resides only in the Department.

A previous speaker referred to pensions being averaged out and that there are more bands.  That also has an impact on women.  We have had women in our office who had an expectation of getting a pension of &euro;230 but it was reduced to approximately &euro;188 because of the change in the banding system.  It is primarily women who have been affected by it but men will be affected in the same way in the future.

Their employer pays nothing at all for them and, therefore, they are not entitled to the State contributory pension.  Their stamps do not  count towards State contributory pensions because they pay at 0.9% instead of 15.1%.<\/p>  <p>  On the averaging issue, Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith characterised it very clearly.  She is correct, that is exactly what happens.  Somebody could work for a short period of years, potentially even as a student or in part-time work, have a major gap in employment and come back to work for a long number of years and would be better off had they not done those few years of work in their late teens or early 20s.  That is why we want to replace the averaging system entirely with the new system.  The latter is the total contributions approach whereby what counts is the number of contributions someone made and not when he or she made them.<\/p><p>We are doing this work now.<\/p> <p> We can do things that are cost neutral but I think anything we might do would be a cost to the State.  I get worried when I hear people use the term, which is used a lot in Ireland, \"cost to the State\", as if the State were this faceless, amorphous thing that had endless money.  Our actions will not be a cost to the State but to people who pay PRSI.  That is how it works.  I much prefer when I hear Americans talk about tax dollars and tax euros.  We often talk about measures costing the Exchequer or the State, as if it were this alien thing that had a bag of money to pay for things.  The social insurance system works by people paying PRSI contributions into the fund, and the fund goes to pay the State pension, the State contributory pension, maternity benefit, jobseeker's benefit and all the rest.  I do not think anybody proposes to change it.  The cost of any measure will be passed on to people who pay PRSI.  It will be passed on to the working mothers and fathers, those who do not have children, and the employers of today.  Any change we make that costs will have this impact.  We should not be dishonest with ourselves, and we certainly should not be dishonest with the public about it.  Any change will cost and the cost will be borne by today's workers and employers.  We must be honest about it in any change we decide to make.  It is not a cost to the State, but to today's workers and employers.<\/p> <p> I welcome the interest of the Chairman of the Joint Committee on Social Protection, Deputy John Curran, in the issue and his offer to take it up as work for the committee.  It would be best done by the committee, considering all the information, options, costs, number of winners and losers, and the profile of the winners and losers for any change in the rules.  While I have not seen it yet, we will probably have some sort of draft of it before the end of the calendar year and would expect to be in a position to give that kind of information in the first quarter of 2017.  It is a big job.  It means going through PRSI records going way back.  It is very far advanced.<\/p> <p> It is not a secret that the plan we have sketched out is to move to the total contributions approach by 2020.  I would like to do it sooner, if possible, given that people are retiring now and will retire in 2017, 2018 and 2019.  It is envisaged that as part of the total contributions approach there would also be home maker credits.  What counts will be a person's weekly PRSI contributions, but there will also be credits for home makers.  It might need to be more than 20 years, given that one could potentially be looking after children under the age of 12 or caring for somebody for more than 20 years.  All these measures have costs which will fall on today's workers and employers.<\/p> <p> We have estimated, or guesstimated, what retrospectivity would cost.  There is a question whether any change should apply only to those who are retiring from now on, or whether we should go back and examine all the records of people who have already retired.  We have already done a guesstimate of the cost of bringing the home maker's scheme all the way through before 1994 and recalculating the pensions of those who have already retired.  The cost is approximately &euro;290 million, which would have to be borne by today's workers and employers.  Again, let us be honest about it.  I want to give the House the information and set out the issues, options, the number of winners and losers in each case, and the cost.  This would be a very useful body of work for the committee to consider in 2017.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112400031#EE01000","speaker":"1236","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1479996900,"counter":322,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.  It was very helpful.  I take Deputy John Curran's point about many different categories of people who may have returned to education, etc., being affected.  However, I am making a specific argument about how women, or people who left the workplace to make a home after 1994 compared to before 1994.  This difference is important in my approach to the issue.  I appreciate what the Minister said about a total contribution approach by 2020.  If the Government adjusts it by 2020, these women will have been on the lower pension for five years.  Had the Government listened to Deputies Richard Boyd Barrett and Paul Murphy last night and taken on board some of their amendments to close the tax loopholes, we probably would be talking tax dollars and tax euros, instead of today's workers, paying the estimated retrospectivity cost of &euro;290 million.  The argument is not closed.  There are many other ways of getting money into the State apart from going after the existing workforce.  The issue of the home makers is important.  I assume that if the Minister does the study and takes a holistic look at it through the committee, he will accept my amendment and not throw the baby out with the bathwater and say the amendment does not apply.

We are facing into people coming to us and saying they are not getting the pension they thought they would get.  We would be in a very different space if we applied a rule change retrospectively and told people we were recalculating their pensions downwards.  It speaks to my point that we need to understand how any change would impact on people.  We could not have a situation in which we applied different sets of rules to different people.

The Free Legal Aid Centres, FLAC, and Community Law &amp;amp; Mediation sent a number of requests that we propose such an amendment.  While we cannot propose amendments that might incur a cost to the State, it is important to examine it again.  I recently put down a parliamentary question to the Minister.  He made the point that 2,200 people are in receipt of mortgage interest supplement, costing the State &euro;6 million.  He advised that people go through the mortgage arrears resolution process, MARP, go to the Money Advice &amp;amp; Budgeting Service, MABS, or go to the new service, Abhaile, the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Service, about it.  Mortgage interest supplement was introduced because people found themselves out of work for short periods due to, for example, a broken leg, cancer or a longer illness than usual, and they found it difficult to make the interest payments on their mortgages.<\/p><p>The scheme was introduced to assist these people but obviously became difficult to manage following the crash.  As a result it was closed to new entrants in 2014.<\/p> <p> I am not a fan of the banks, as the Minister is well aware.  They ripped us off and we are paying to bail them out at great cost to individuals, families and society in general.  Regardless of whether the supplement is paid to the banks, it was introduced to protect people.  The free legal advice centres and Community Law &amp;amp; Mediation are of the opinion that it should be a targeted short-term payment lasting for up to 24 months.  If the mortgage holder is in an unsustainable position after such a period, he or she should go through the mortgage arrears resolution process.<\/p> <p> The Minister was adamant in our discussion on Committee Stage that he would not consider this option.  The Joint Committee on Housing and Homelessness shares our view on the issue and recommended in July that a targeted use of mortgage interest supplement be restored to assist people with a short-term mortgage arrears problem.  The scheme should be reinstated in the context of the current housing and homelessness crisis and the Minister should have a report done on the number of people who would benefit from its reinstatement and potential costs of doing so.  He should then indicate to the committee whether its proposal would work.<\/p> <p> While the payment would ultimately be made to the banks, the mortgage interest supplement scheme would offer protection to people in mortgage difficulties for a short period.  No one is required to enter the mortgage arrears resolution process if he or she is out of work for six or eight months due to illness.  The scheme should be targeted and short-term in nature and those who find their mortgage repayments are unsustainable after the process should enter the MARP.<\/p> <p> The Minister indicated people could renegotiate their mortgages, for example, by extending them by one year.  This does not provide a definitive resolution and would require the agreement of the mortgage holder's bank.  The mortgage interest supplement would be made available immediately to people who find themselves in difficulty repaying their mortgage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112400032#FF00800","speaker":"1306","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1479997500,"counter":330,"content":"<p>I do not propose to accept the amendment.  The original purpose of the mortgage interest supplement scheme was to provide a short-term support to eligible people who were unable to meet their mortgage interest repayments in respect of their home.  Section 11 of the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2013 provided for the closure of the scheme to new entrants from January 2014 and the cessation of the scheme by the end of December 2017.<\/p>  <p>  Customers availing of this support prior to 1 January 2014 have been able to retain entitlement to the scheme up to 1 January 2018.  There are currently approximately 2,200 people in receipt of mortgage interest supplement, with an estimated expenditure of approximately &euro;6 million for the scheme in 2016 and &euro;4 million in 2017. <\/p>  <p>  I appreciate that the Deputy is not advocating that the State should pay a person's mortgage interest indefinitely and the supplement should be paid for a short period, perhaps where a person has become ill or experiences unemployment.  I understand, therefore, that the proposal to reinstate the payment is not in respect of people in long-term arrears.  A number of groups, including Community Law &amp;amp; Mediation, have recommended the reintroduction of the scheme as a temporary measure to pay the mortgage interest of persons who get into temporary difficulties for a number of months or perhaps one year.  <\/p>  <p>  My difficulty with the proposal is that it would essentially subsidise the banks because the interest payments would be made directly to the banks.  They would be the major beneficiary of the scheme because the interest would be paid and the loan would continue to be performing.  In such circumstances, we can be certain that banks would not take any steps to assist the mortgage holder, whereas they should provide a mortgage holiday, extend the term of the mortgage by several months or a year or increase the payments marginally when the person gets back on his or her feet.  The banks would be delighted if the Government reinstated the scheme as a short-term measure because they would not need to take any of these steps and could instead simply take the money.  They would also benefit from being able to hold on to the performing loan for longer.  The scheme would operate purely as a subsidy for the banking sector.<\/p>  <p>  It is a red herring to link the reinstatement of this scheme to the housing and homelessness crisis.  No homes are being repossessed in cases where a householder does not pay a mortgage for a few months.  If this is a short-term measure, it is not connected in any way to housing and homelessness because people have to be in arrears for years before repossession proceedings begin.  The scheme would be a gift to the banks by essentially putting them in a position of not having to do anything to assist the mortgage holder, for example, extending the loan term or providing a repayment holiday, in the knowledge that the taxpayer would intervene and pay the mortgage interest. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112400033#GG00200","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1479997500,"counter":331,"content":"<p>It is strange to hear the Minister express concern that the banks would make gains on the backs of people who find themselves in difficult circumstances.  We bailed out the banks to the tune of &euro;64 billion and citizens must repay the interest on this bailout every year.  We also gave them millions of euro ostensibly to prevent repossessions at the start of the period of austerity.  The difference in the case of mortgage interest supplement is that it is intended to protect mortgage holders for a short period and prevent them from getting into difficulties.  If a person who was unable to work because of illness and could still not make mortgage interest repayments after one year or 16 months on the scheme, he or she would enter the mortgage arrears resolution process.  The scheme is designed to provide protection for a short time and is targeted at specific circumstances.<\/p>  <p>  Single Parents Acting for the Rights of Kids, SPARK, made a presentation to Deputies in which it expressed concern that the cessation of the mortgage interest supplement scheme would result in homelessness.  If a parent in a one-parent family contracts a long-term illness, there is a real risk that the family will be on such a trajectory if some short-term support is not provided.<\/p>  <p>  This is a targeted short-term scheme and those who are still in difficulty after 16 or 18 months should be advised to contact their bank or enter the mortgage arrears resolution process.

Any further consideration of remuneration adjustment for any group of public servants, including issues relating to more recently recruited public servants, falls to be examined within the provisions of the Lansdowne Road agreement.

Again, the measures applied under the phased unwinding of the FEMPI legislation reductions through the Lansdowne Road agreemtn were also progressive.  It provided the greatest benefit at the fastest pace for lower paid public servants.  For example, it exclusively targeted those earning under &euro;65,000 for increases in pay, ranging from &euro;1,500 for those earning &euro;20,000 to &euro;1,000 for those earning &euro;60,000.  It utilised increases in the exemption threshold of the pension related deduction to maximise the benefit to low-paid workers.  All statutory deductions, other than tax, are made before the pension related deduction is taken from salary; therefore, a reduction of an amount in pension related deduction will benefit the employee to that amount, less PAYE.

He will give an indication of future rates of growth in the economy and the impact on expenditure, concluding with next year's expenditure report.  In this way we will look at the effect on expenditure ceilings.  We need to take care to recognise that it is still up to governments and policy makers to set their priorities each year and I have raised this issue with my Department.  Expenditure ceilings are a very important part of how we plan future growth, but I do not believe they can be at the expense of the Minister for Finance, or any Minister of the day, having some latitude in how they spend, if only to respond to the issues the Deputy has raised.  The key aspect is to meet the requirements imposed on us by the fiscal rules and the commitments we, as a state, have given on deficits and debt, the main components of how we look at the issue of budgetary discipline.  In any given year, on budget day, a Government Minister should still have discretion in how he or she allocates funding and in terms of any new initiative he or she wishes to instigate, as long as he or she insides an affordable budgetary framework.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112400042#QQ00800","speaker":"1292"},{"type":"speech","time":1480002900,"counter":475,"content":"<p>The budget came out unscathed from the European Commission, but there was also a comment to the effect that, while across the European Union the medium-term target is 0.5%, there would be greater flexibility in 2017.

It is widely recognised that early intervention is of critical importance when it comes to improving outcomes for children with disabilities but despite the recognition of such a need, the HSE is failing to ensure that young disabled children receive the earliest possible interventions to give them the best start in life.  Under the Disability Act 2005, assessments of children's needs must be completed within six months.  The recent revelation of the failure by the HSE to process in 2015 as many as 2,500 applications from parents for needs assessments for their children on foot of a disability notwithstanding the legal requirement is a damning indictment of the Government.  Exceptional circumstances were cited as the reason for delays in a number of cases.  While this is permitted under the regulations, my concern is that the provision is being used to facilitate delayed assessments by the HSE.<\/p>  <p>  Every parent wants the very best for his or her child.  In their desperation to have their disabled children assessed, they are now being forced to go private.  According to the autism charity Shine, 107 children were assessed privately in 2014 but between 1 January and October 2016, the number of children being diagnosed privately rose to 216.  Private diagnosis can cost from &euro;700 to more than &euro;1,000, which is a hefty sum and one which parents should not have to pay to have their children's needs assessed.  Equally concerning are the claims by Shine that no follow-up services such as speech and language and occupational therapy have been available since last November to children assessed as having an autism need.  I agree with Shine's chief executive, Kieran Kennedy, who says the system has gone beyond crisis.  I understand the HSE did not provide a direct answer when asked if follow-up services had been unavailable since last November to children assessed as having that need.  It said it was \"reconfiguring existing therapy services into geographic based children's disability network teams\".  Perhaps the Minister of State can confirm if this is the case.<\/p>  <p>  Does the Minister of State agree that reconfiguring existing resources is not going to cut it?  What we need are additional resources and we need them now.  This is an issue that must be addressed as a matter of urgency in circumstances in which the number of children seeking to be assessed is rising year on year.  I want to know what the Government is doing to address this pressing situation.  How will it ensure that no child will have to wait longer than six months to be assessed and how will it ensure that follow-up services are available to all of these young people, each of whom deserves proper attention and support?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112400044#SS00300","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speech","time":1480004100,"counter":498,"content":"<p>I am pleased to have the opportunity to update the House on behalf of the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, who extends his apologies for being unable to attend.  I am glad to update Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in on progress in developing services for children with disabilities and the current position on waiting times and needs assessment.  I thank the Deputy for raising this important matter, which is one that has been close to his heart for a long time.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE has recognised that early intervention services and services for school-aged children with disabilities need to be improved and organised more effectively and this process is well under way.  While there has been continual additional investment in the area, we recognise that the HSE faces significant challenges in respect of meeting the statutory timeframes which apply to the assessment of needs process under the Disability Act 2005 due to the volume of applications, which continues to increase year on year.  The HSE is currently engaged in a reconfiguration of existing therapy resources to geographic based teams for children.  The objective of the new model of assessment and intervention is to provide one clear referral pathway for all children irrespective of disability, place of residence or school attended.  The level of requests for assessment is higher in areas where the reconfiguration of children's disability services has yet to take place, which suggests that where a good service is being provided, the need for assessment is reduced.  Some areas have proven particularly challenging in respect of waiting times for assessment and therapeutic service delivery.  An example is the Cork-Kerry region where a number of measures have been put in place to deal with waiting lists.<\/p>  <p>  Since 2014, the roll-out of the programme progressing disability services for children and young people has entailed the targeted investment of &euro;14 million and the provision of 275 additional therapy staff to increase services for children with all disabilities.  In 2016, &euro;4 million was provided under the HSE's national service plan to focus specifically on speech and language therapy waiting lists in primary care and social care for children aged up to 18 years.  This investment represents a long-term increase in speech and language therapy capacity which will be maintained into 2017.  A Programme for a Partnership Government commits the Government to improving services and increasing supports for people with disabilities, particular in respect of early assessment and intervention for children with special needs.  Significant resources have been invested by the health sector in services for children with disabilities over the last number of years, which is something we all welcome.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112400044#SS00400","speaker":"1339"},{"type":"speech","time":1480004100,"counter":499,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for taking this matter.  I am deeply concerned by the reply I have received.  The Minister of State has reaffirmed the very points I made in my opening contribution.  She cites the HSE is currently engaged in a reconfiguration of existing therapy resources.  She says the objective of the new model of assessment and intervention is to provide one clear referral pathway for all children but it will not do it.  As I said earlier, it will not cut it.  That is the sad reality because we have an underprovision of the professional skills necessary to cope, not only with the existing year-on-year number presenting but the fact that an increasing number of children are being referred.  They are not being referred for no good reason.  There is an absolutely valid basis to all of these referrals.  It is critical to recognise that resourcing is the essential element in terms of the provision of the necessary professional skills in speech and language therapy, occupational therapy, child psychology <i>et al<\/i>.  While the Minister of State says that since 2014, an additional 275 therapy staff have been appointed, the fact is that a number of them are replacements who filled existing vacancies in circumstances where we are working from a very low base following years of no recruitment.  We must ensure that we meet the need that is presenting.  It is just not good enough.<\/p><p>As a spokesperson on disability rights among other issues, I was hugely concerned looking at the budget for 2017 that this area had not been properly recognised in the funding provision for the coming year.  I appeal to the Minister of State in her particular office to engage with her colleagues and the senior Minister who cannot be left at a remove from responsibility in relation to these matters.  I appeal to her in her respective position to reflect on the very serious matter I have highlighted to her.  The HSE has recognised, as stated in the Minister of State's reply, that early intervention services and services for school-aged children with disabilities must be improved.<\/p><p>In light of all of my years of service here and in previous life as a public representative, I have to ask when that dawned on the HSE.

Like Deputies Griffin and Neville, many people in Cork have contacted Deputy Moynihan.  Deputy Griffin has set the backdrop and I will now read a letter from a dad who wrote to me.  He is a representative of the newly formed parents group of Kalydeco.  It was established to try to obtain reimbursement for the cystic fibrosis drug Kalydeco for children aged between two and five years.  The drug is already reimbursed for children aged over six.  The group represents 18 families that have children in the age group which will benefit from Kalydeco.  The letter to which I refer states:<\/p><blockquote>As you will be aware the NCPE recently recommended against the reimbursement of the cystic fibrosis drug Kalydeco for 2 to 5 year olds. at the submitted price.  As a father of 3 year old with cystic fibrosis and who has the form of cystic fibrosis that Kalydeco treats, I was astonished, disappointed and saddened at the decision of the NCPE.  The NCPE decision was made on the 12th of October of this year.  To make matters worse, the NCPE took seven months to make the decision.  My feelings of disappointment were worsened largely by the fact that the Government is already reimbursing this drug in six year olds and over and has been doing so sometime since early 2013.  So why then has this extension not been made available to 2 to 5 year olds?  The drug is safe and more effective in children in 2 to 5 years of age in range than in children and adults over 6.  The fact that the Government has not reimbursed the drug amounts to age discrimination.  It is not reasonable to say that the drug is not good enough in one age group and not in another.<\/blockquote><p>I am speaking on behalf of 18 families, but cystic fibrosis affects people in every county.  When 18 families feel they have been totally and utterly sidelined, they deserve a response.

The Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, has asked me to extend his apologies for not being available to be here.<\/p>  <p>  I am very aware, as we all are, that access to potentially beneficial drug treatment is an important issue for people with cystic fibrosis and that cystic fibrosis sufferers and their families face enormous day-to-day challenges in dealing with this progressive and debilitating condition.  It is important to point out, however, that it is the HSE which has statutory responsibility for decisions on pricing and reimbursement of medicinal products under the community drug scheme, in accordance with the provisions of the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013, as Deputies are probably aware.<\/p>  <p>  Decisions on which medicines are licensed for use in Ireland and which are reimbursed by taxpayer are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds by the HSE on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics, NCPE.  It is a team of clinicians, pharmacists, pharmacologists and statisticians that evaluates the benefits and costs of medical technologies and provides advice to the HSE.<\/p>  <p>  It conducts health technology assessments of pharmaceutical products for the HSE and can make recommendations on reimbursement to assist the HSE in its decision-making process.  Since July of this year, a revised and more transparent assessment process for the reimbursement of new medicines by the HSE has been in place.  Importantly, this process includes consideration of the budget impact of individual new medicines, the opportunity cost of the treatment and resources available to the HSE.  I understand how patients and their families must feel in the circumstances, as they await decisions from the HSE on reimbursement.  However, as with all new drugs developed, the HSE must follow a process.<\/p>  <p>  Orkambi is indicated for the treatment of cystic fibrosis in patients aged 12 years and older who have a particular mutation in the CFTR gene.  Following a request from the HSE, the NCPE completed a health technology assessment for Orkambi and submitted to the HSE in June 2016.  The NCPE determined that the manufacturer failed to demonstrate cost-effectiveness or value for money from using the drug.  The NCPE has confirmed that all relevant costs were included in the analysis.<\/p>  <p>  The five-year gross budget impact of reimbursing Orkambi is estimated at more than &euro;390 million and the NCPE noted the significant opportunity costs associated with reimbursing the drug.  The biggest barrier  to access of such medicines is the price being charged by companies.  The HSE has since had further engagements with the manufacturer in an effort to secure significant price reductions for Orkambi.  The HSE is considering the outcome of these engagements, together with the NCPE recommendation and other expert advice, in making a final decision on reimbursement.  The HSE has advised that the decision will be made on objective, scientific and economic grounds, in line with the 2013 Act.<\/p>  <p>  In regard to Kalydeco, I am informed that, following a request from the HSE, the NCPE carried out an assessment of the manufacturer's economic dossier of ivacaftor, the brand name for which is Kalydeco, for the treatment of cystic fibrosis patients aged two years and older weighing less than 25 kg.  In October of this year, the NCPE recommended that Kalydeco should not be reimbursed by the HSE.  The five-year gross budget impact of reimbursing Kalydeco is estimated at more than &euro;21 million and the NCPE noted the significant opportunity cost associated with reimbursing the drug.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE will enter into negotiations with the manufacturer in an effort to secure significant price reductions for Kalydeco.  The HSE will consider the outcome of these engagements, together with the NCPE recommendation and other expert advice, in making a final decision on reimbursement.  As already stated, the HSE has advised that it will make this decision on objective, scientific and economic grounds.<\/p>  <p>  It is appropriate that these should not be political decisions and that a scientific and evidence-based approach is taken in determining the extent to which patients would benefit from treatment with expensive new drugs, the opportunity cost of such decisions on the public service and whether this represents cost-effectiveness for the health service and taxpayer.<\/p><p>It is essential that the HSE has everyone's support in getting the best results for patients.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112400045#TT00500","speaker":"1339","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1480005300,"counter":507,"content":"<p>For the record of the House, I wish to pay tribute to Marisa Reidy, a campaigner in County Kerry who has gone public about her situation in terms of Orkambi and her daughter.

These changes will take effect from the start of next year.  The Central Bank has an independent mandate to protect the stability of the Irish financial system and it first introduced the macro-prudential lending regulations in February 2015.<\/p>  <p>  These regulations were the first such controls on lending in Ireland and they applied proportionate loan-to-value, LTV, and loan-to-income, LTI, limits to mortgage lending by regulated financial service providers in the Irish market.  Under these regulations a borrower was subject to a general maximum loan-to-value limit of 80% of the value of a primary home property.  However, the regulations also allowed for a higher 90% threshold for first-time buyers in respect of the value of a property up to an amount of &euro;220,000 and for an 80% threshold for any value in excess of that amount.  The rules also applied an LTI restriction of 3.5 times annual income.  The regulations did allow a certain flexibility to banks to exceed both the LTV and LTI thresholds by up to 15% and 20% respectively in regards to each individual bank's overall primary home mortgage lending in any year.<\/p>  <p>  When they were introduced, the Central Bank made clear that these controls on mortgage lending were designed to be a permanent feature of the Irish financial system.  However, the Bank also committed itself to keeping the particular measures under review to ensure they are appropriately calibrated to evolving financial and economic circumstances.<\/p><p>For this reason, the Central Bank began its first review of the regulations earlier this year.  As part of that process, the bank initiated a call for evidence based submissions.  In total, it received approximately 50 external submissions as part of the review process.  Yesterday, the Central Bank announced the results of this review process and confirmed that some small adjustments would be made to the regulations.<\/p> <p> The key changes will mainly apply to first-time buyers, for whom the LTV limit of 90% will now apply to the entire value of a property rather than the first &euro;220,000 of a mortgage loan as is currently the case.  Also, the flexibility to banks to lend above the LTV limits is being adjusted.  Mortgage lenders will now be able to lend up to 5% of their overall lending to first-time buyers at above the 90% LTV limit; in respect of second subsequent buyers, lenders can allow 20% of their overall mortgage loan book to exceed the 80% LTV restriction that applies to such lenders.  Currently, the overall limit is 15%.<\/p> <p> There are two other changes to the regulations, namely, the removal of large commercial borrowers from the scope of the regulations and allowing property valuations to be carried out up to four months before a loan is provided.  Valuations were required to be carried out within two months of a loan being provided and this had caused some problems at the closing of some sales.  More flexibility is now available at the key point in a sales transaction.  Nevertheless, it should be noted that no change has been made to the LTI restrictions of 3.5 times annual income or to the exemption allowance of 20% of a lender's  overall mortgage loan book.<\/p> <p> This macro-prudential regulatory framework is designed to avoid spiral dynamics between house prices and credit volumes.  This system should allow for consumers to purchase their own homes while protecting against any significant surge in property prices and preventing imprudent lending on the part of the banks.  The Central Bank indicated that since the mortgage measures were initially flagged in late 2014, there has been a sharp moderation in expectations for annual gains in house prices.  This is because it is widely understood that persistently high rates of increase in house prices are not likely in a system in which measures place ceilings on LTI and LTV lending ratios.  Moreover, the Central Bank has indicated that the regulations will be kept under constant review and can be tightened if there is emerging evidence of elevated risks in the mortgage market.<\/p> <p> As indicated, these refinements of the macro-prudential regulations will take effect from January 2017.  From the Government's point of view, they are a prudent but welcome development that will make it a little easier for people to secure a mortgage.  In particular, when taken in conjunction with the help-to-buy scheme, they should assist first-time buyers who are struggling to save the deposits required to purchase homes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112400046#UU01300","speaker":"1356","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1480005900,"counter":520,"content":"<p>It will continue to be the case that no control will be exercised over property prices or rent levels.

First-time buyers will be bidding against investors for new builds.  The latter can afford to see prices rise, particularly in view of the fact that Ireland has the most attractive residential investment yield in Europe.<\/p>  <p>  What will trigger a review of the effects of the new mortgage lending criteria and how will those effects be monitored?  An annual review is planned by the Central Bank.  How will the success or failure of the new criteria be measured?  This morning, Sharon Donnery of the Central Bank stated that the majority of first-time applicants for loans had in excess of the previous minimum deposit of 20%.  If that is the case, what is the rationale for making the proposed changes to mortgage deposit criteria?  What statistics and trends underpin the proposed changes?  Why has the Central Bank suddenly changed its view that a 20% deposit was the right idea?  From where is the pressure is coming?  It is certainly not coming from young people because they are not able to exert such pressure.  The State must build affordable housing if young people are to purchase houses.

Various sources suggest the profit margin in the current market stands at roughly &euro;30,000 per housing unit.  Success will be measured by developers being able to get out of bed for a profit of &euro;30,000 per each unit they build and a few ordinary people being able to borrow enough to put themselves in debt for more than 30 years, with their mortgage repayments consuming 40% or 50% of their total income.

When I tried to get a mortgage 30 years ago banks applied prudent lending rules for mortgages to purchase or build a home.  The LTI limit at that time was set at 2.5 times the income of the private earner in addition to 1.5 times the secondary income.  Rule-of-thumb measures have traditionally been applied to mortgage lending.  During the bubble, however, no rules applied and lending institutions - which have since left the Irish market - engaged in aggressive advertising to encourage people to remortgage their homes or set up current accounts on their mortgage in which they retained a certain amount.  Weekend events were also held in hotels in provincial towns to highlight the value of investment properties abroad and encourage people to remortgage their homes.<\/p>  <p>  The reason the Central Bank introduced new rules on mortgage lending was to control lending to first-time buyers and give them a small advantage over buyers of second and subsequent houses.  Under these rules, first-time buyers could secure mortgages of 90% of the sale value for houses priced at up to &euro;220,000.  Different criteria applied for higher price houses.  All the submissions received by the Central Bank have been published on its website.  The submission from the Department of Finance proposed that the 90% threshold be applied to the first &euro;320,000 cost of a home, in other words, it proposed to increase the current figure by &euro;100,000.  The Central Bank, in its wisdom, decided to remove the limit. <\/p>  <p>  These changes are not aimed at increasing profits for developers or anyone else but to encourage house building.  Even if we build so-called affordable houses, the basic economic fact remains that supply must meet demand if we are to get stability in the market.

I had intended to share time with the Deputy but she had another commitment this evening and was unable to come to the House.<\/p>  <p>  Grain farmers are going through one of the most difficult periods experienced on family farms in many decades and farm incomes are at an all-time low.  I have spoken at length with some members of the farming organisations and grain farmers in west Cork in recent weeks.<\/p><p>I have visited many grain farmers from Kinsale to Skibbereen and seen at first hand the crisis.  Grain farmers across the country have lost much of their crops and many face ruination.  Many grain farmers in County Cork, particularly along the coast, are in severe difficulties as a result of the recent weather conditions which were unsuitable for grain harvesting.  This has been the most difficult harvest in the past 30 years.  Instead, the grain harvest this year turned out to be a salvage operation.  The bad weather, coupled with the low prices of grain in the world market and high input costs such as the cost of fertilisers and sprays, means the situation has reached crisis point.  Many grain farmers have lost between &euro;200 and &euro;250 per acre this year.<\/p> <p> Many growers of winter grain along the south coast lost their crops due to bad winter weather.  They then replanted their crops with spring grain crops which led to extra expense.  Many of these crops were then damaged by the bad autumn weather, compounding the problem for many grain growers in the south.  Many of them are left with large bills to pay to co-ops and other merchants.  This is a serious emergency for the sector and it is clear compensation should be made available immediately to rescue the industry.<\/p> <p> This year is the fourth year in a row in which many grain farmers find themselves trading at a loss.  Over the past four years, the amount of land in cereal production dropped by 100,000 acres.  It is predicted to fall by a further 67,000 acres in 2017.  The whole farming sector is suffering from low prices.  The Government must stick up for it and support our farmers.  Without support, farmers will not survive.  The IFA, Irish Farmers Association, and the ICSA, the Irish Cattle and Sheep Farmers Association, have already made a case to Europe on this issue but they need strong support from the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  French farmers experienced similar problems this year and their Government is seeking compensation from the EU.  Did the Irish Government support this call of the French Government?<\/p> <p> Without a compensation package being made available to grain farmers, many of them will not survive.  The sector is in real crisis.  Will the Minister do everything in his power to support grain farmers in this difficult time?  He would not be setting a precedent if he did, as in the recent past dairy farmers have been rightly compensated in a time of difficulty while forestry owners have been given replanting grants.  Many grain farmers have told me that, due to the bad weather, their yield was as low as 0.8 of a tonne to the acre.  Normally, they would have three tonnes to the acre.  It is clear this year's harvest was simply a salvage operation, leaving them with huge losses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112400047#VV00600","speaker":"1263","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1480006500,"counter":526,"content":"<p>I am pleased to have this opportunity to address the House on this important issue.  I fully acknowledge and accept there are ongoing difficulties being experienced by the farming community, not least by our tillage farmers.The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Michael Creed, is aware of the specific difficulties in County Cork and other coastal locations that some tillage farmers experienced this year at harvest as a result of sea mist.<\/p><p>This sector is an important area in the agricultural economy but it has been a challenging year both in terms of market returns and variable weather conditions experienced during the harvest.  The Minister recently chaired a meeting with the main stakeholders in the tillage sector. At the time, the Minister said this meeting provided a platform for the stakeholders to express their views and concerns on the challenges they are facing but, equally, to discuss the opportunities that lie ahead for the industry.  At that meeting the Minister outlined that one of his chief priorities was to provide low-cost and more flexible finance.<\/p><p>In this regard, he was happy to announce on budget day plans for a &euro;150 million agri-cash flow loan support scheme.  This financial instrument has been developed in conjunction with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland by leveraging EU and Exchequer funding totalling &euro;25 million from the Department to deliver a total loan fund of &euro;150 million.  This will support highly flexible loans for up to six years for amounts up to &euro;150,000.  The interest rate applying is 2.95% and the product will be available to livestock, tillage and horticulture farmers.  Loans to tillage and horticulture farmers will be provided in line with the EU's agriculture state aid <i>de minimis<\/i>requirements.<\/p><p>This is a cash flow support facility to improve the working capital position of farmers and other viable primary agriculture small and medium-sized enterprises, SMEs.  The loans are primarily to pay down expensive forms of credit such as merchant credit and other short-term financing facilities such as overdrafts.  Last week. The Minister welcomed the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland open call for financial intermediaries to deliver the scheme, which will be operational as early as possible in 2017.<\/p><p>The loan scheme is part of a three pillar strategy in response to income volatility that was announced in the recent budget, along with additional tax measures and farm payments.  Among the tax measures agreed with the Minister for Finance was an adjustment to the current income averaging system, which will allow for an opt-out in an exceptional year.  This will be available immediately for this year's tax liability and will go some way towards addressing current cash flow concerns.<\/p><p>As an additional support to cash flow on farms, including tillage farms, advance payments would be made this year in respect of the basic payment and greening payment schemes.  Advance payments commenced on 17 October last, the earliest possible date by which payments can begin under the governing EU regulations.  Up to last week, &euro;786 million has been paid out to 119,904 farmers and payments are ongoing.<\/p><p>I am also pleased to note the processing of the areas of natural constraints payment scheme is on schedule and payments have already commenced during the third week in September.  It is expected approximately 96,500 will fulfil the scheme eligibility requirements.  The Department will also be opening a targeted agricultural modernisation scheme specifically for the tillage sector.<\/p><p>The Minister also stressed at the recent tillage stakeholders meeting that, in this changing landscape, we need to take a fresh look at our tillage industry to ensure that it is best positioned to withstand possible future threats and to avail of the new opportunities which may present themselves.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112400048#WW00200","speaker":"1356"},{"type":"speech","time":1480006500,"counter":527,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his reply.

Will the Minister join with the French in working towards that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112400048#WW00300","speaker":"1263"},{"type":"speech","time":1480006500,"counter":528,"content":"<p>On the claim the French Government sought support at the Council of Ministers, while I was not at the recent meeting, I am given to understand that was not the case.  There is no appetite in Europe for claims for emergency compensation.  At best, the French call was lukewarm.<\/p>  <p>  Tillage in parts of the country has suffered as badly as it did in 1985 and 1986, the last two bad years when it hit all the country.  I have 15 acres of grain myself.  The harvest was delayed because of weather and the birds did a lot of damage.  We did manage to salvage a reasonable crop, however.<\/p><p>The east coast was not as badly affected as the south and west coasts.<\/p> <p> There are two big problems with the grain sector, one of which has been masked in recent years by high yield.  The first is global prices.  These are invariably cyclical but they have been cyclically down for four consecutive years.  This year, the problem was compounded by yield.  The second issue in the Irish context is the fact that 50% of all crops in the arable sector are on rented or leased land.  This is not the best way.  The current conacre system is a disaster for farmers.  It drives up prices with competition.  We do not have any long-term security.  Farmers say that every year they have to give a certain price, which is probably the value plus X.  If, however, they were in a position to engage in long-term leasing, it would help.  The agri-taxation measures taken a couple of years ago were to try to incentivise longer-term leasing to give a certain level of security.  Partnerships can be arranged between farmers and landowners such that there is risk-sharing.<\/p> <p> The low interest, flexible money is because tillage farmers in particular find the position on working capital and merchant credit really difficult.  If they owe a certain pot of money to a merchant on a bank overdraft, it will still remain.  If they can get low-interest money, with a six-year loan and an interest-only option for the first few years, they can clear it.  If we adopt the principle that the cycle will actually improve, there is a chance that farmers can trade out of this, with the help of other supports.  It is very difficult to secure specific funding just for a sector in Europe.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112400048#WW00400","speaker":"1356","continuing":true},{"type":"majorheading","content":"An Bille um an gC&uacute;igi&uacute; Leas&uacute; is Tr&iacute;ocha ar an mBunreacht (Neodracht) 2016: Second Stage [Private Members] - Thirty-Fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Neutrality) Bill 2016: Second Stage [Private Members]","time":1480007100,"counter":531,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112400049#XX00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1480007100,"counter":532,"content":"<p>Tairgim: &quot;Go l&eacute;ifear an Bille an Dara hUair anois.&quot;<\/p><p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&quot;<\/p><p>Ba mhaith liom mo chuid ama a roinnt leis an Teachta Se&aacute;n Crowe.<\/p><p>The Thirty-Fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Neutrality) Bill that Deputy Crowe and I have jointly signed and tabled allows for a referendum to amend Articles 28 and 29 of Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann to ensure Ireland is prevented from aiding in any way a foreign power in preparation for or during a war unless it has the assent of the D&aacute;il.  Ireland's neutrality should be cherished, protected and enhanced so that we can reaffirm our commitment to a different type of international politics focused on peace, justice, equality and human rights.  The Government, regrettably, has made clear it will oppose this Bill and today it published an amendment &ndash; exhibit A in the case &ndash; that supposedly reaffirms our neutral status by citing what is in Article 29 of the Constitution, as if I did not know it already.  I am seeking to change it.  The Government's supposedly strongly worded amendment is nothing of the sort.  It is not worth the paper it is written on, in many ways.  It is a cynical attempt to hide the fact that the Government is running scared of allowing the people a vote in a referendum that would enshrine Irish neutrality in the Constitution.<\/p><p>Despite the claims of both Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il that our neutrality is allowed for in our Constitution, the opposite is the case.  This was made clear by Mr. Justice Kearns in the 2003 High Court case of Horgan <i>v<\/i>. An Taoiseach:<\/p><blockquote>Despite the great historic value attached by Ireland to the concept of neutrality, that status is nowhere reflected in Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann, or elsewhere in any domestic legislation.  It is effectively a matter of Government policy only, albeit a policy to which, traditionally at least, considerable importance was attached.<\/blockquote><p>The Bill addresses that anomaly by allowing for a referendum in which citizens could vote to reaffirm our neutrality.  The Taoiseach, however, claims that by reaffirming our neutrality and inserting a clause to that effect in the Constitution, the Judiciary may constrain the Government's capacity to fulfil its obligations in support of UN-mandated actions.  By this very reasoning, no amendment could be made to the Constitution on the grounds that citizens seeking clarification on what is constitutional would constrain Governments from implementing policy.  What is the purpose of the Constitution at all if one is worried the Judiciary or citizens may interpret it?  The idea is that we put in a constitution principles that we uphold and then add laws to protect it and give effect to it.<\/p><p>Spin doctors, the Taoiseach and perhaps the Minister of State, Deputy Paul Kehoe, have been complaining about the cost of a referendum.  Nowhere did I state in the publicity material circulated before the introduction of this Bill that the Bill had to be a stand-alone initiative.  The public has shown quite ably that they can deal with several concepts at the same time.  Several referendums have been held at the same time.  The proposed referendum can be held with the others the Government has already committed to holding.  Therefore, the cost is negligible.  One way or the other, whether there is a cost or not, it should not be the key point if we believe in neutrality as a principle.  In that case, the principle should far outweigh the cost given what is at stake.<\/p><p>The views expounded by Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il in rejecting this Bill are totally false.  In some ways this is why the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Shane Ross, and the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, argued so forcefully during this week's Cabinet meeting for a free vote on this Bill.  It is why both, in addition to Minister of State, Deputy John Halligan, supported the exact same Bill when it was tabled in 2015 and it is why they have been so strident in their criticism of how successive Governments have abused Ireland's position of neutrality.  I hope, therefore, that they will remain true to the positions they adopted in the past and will vote with us to enshrine Irish neutrality within Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann when the vote is taken next Thursday.  By so doing, they will have reaffirmed their support for a policy of non-membership of military alliances at a time when Ireland, like other neutral countries such as Sweden and Finland, are being pressurised to join NATO or to support and be part of ever-growing EU military architecture.<\/p><p>This Government, like its predecessors, seems hell-bent on adopting policies that compromise and undermine our neutral status.  By so doing, it is at odds with the majority of Irish citizens who value and support our neutrality.  In a document I presume all Deputies were given by the Irish Peace and Neutrality Alliance, PANA, I saw a reference to the only poll I know of that was carried out to ascertain the public's view on neutrality.  It was a Red C poll carried out in 2013.  It was found that 78% of the public supported in full Irish neutrality.<\/p><p>Probably the most obvious example of how successive Governments have discredited Irish neutrality is the continued use of Shannon Airport as a military stopover for US armed forces.  Since the illegal invasion of Afghanistan in 2001, over 2.5 million US troops have travelled through Shannon in transit to and from conflict zones in places such as Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria and Kurdistan, countries where hundreds of thousands of people have been killed, maimed or left displaced and destitute.<\/p><p>There is evidence that indicates Shannon Airport is a stopover for CIA rendition flights, involving a blatant and perverse contravention of our neutrality.  The State has never investigated the possibility that we have facilitated torture.  By the failure to act, successive Fine Gael, Fianna F&aacute;il and Labour Party Governments have made the State complicit in gross violations of human rights.<\/p><p>This contravention of Ireland's neutrality has contributed to deaths, torture, starvation, forced displacement and a range of other shameful human rights abuses that could have been stopped had the Governments called halt or had this legislation enshrining neutrality in the Constitution been passed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112400049#XX00400","speaker":"1305","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1480007700,"counter":534,"content":"<p>I tabled a similar Bill in the previous D&aacute;il that was supported by members of what is now the Independent Alliance.  I hope that they will be consistent and vote in favour of this Bill next week rather than the Government's weak amendment, which is a continuation of the <i>status quo<\/i>and the undermining of Irish neutrality.<\/p><p>In the 2003 version of this Bill, we got the support of the Labour Party, which was in opposition at the time.  Rather strangely, when Labour was in government last year and could act on the issue, in its wisdom it chose not to support my neutrality Bill.  Let us hope that, now that Labour is back in &quot;radical mode&quot;, it will again support this Bill.<\/p><p>The aim of the Bill is to give power and choice to the Irish people to decide by referendum if they want to enshrine neutrality in Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann.  Who could be afraid of that?  I appeal to all parties and Teachta&iacute; D&aacute;la to allow the Bill to pass Second Stage and let us begin an honest and open debate about Ireland's policy of neutrality. It is important to enshrine such a fundamental principle in Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann because successive Governments have breached the Hague Convention and undermined Irish neutrality.  The Government amendment is a continuation of that.  It claims that there are already constitutional protections for neutrality, but the reality is that neutrality is not mentioned once in Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann.  This has allowed successive Governments to tear strips off neutrality piece by piece against the wishes of the majority of Irish people.<\/p><p>As neutrality is not protected in the Constitution, previous Governments have signed Ireland up to NATO's Partnership for Peace and allowed and facilitated the civilian airport in Shannon to become a virtual forward airbase for the US military.  The current Government continues to support Ireland's involvement in the emerging EU military structures.  A referendum to insert neutrality would bring greater clarity to the State's neutrality policy, which has become blurred, distorted and riddled with double speak as successive Governments say one thing but do the opposite.<\/p><p>Given that the momentum behind the creation of a EU army has been accelerated by Mr. Donald Trump's election and Brexit, the Bill is timely.  This week, the European Parliament voted in favour of a report on the creation of an enhanced EU armed force.  The report called on the EU to develop a European military-industrial complex and set aside EU and national funds in order to do so.  Children go to bed hungry while taxpayers' hard-earned money is wasted on military funding.  Sinn F&eacute;in's MEPs voted against this disastrous project and attack on Irish neutrality.<\/p><p>The Government amendment references The Global Island foreign policy document, which only mentions neutrality twice in 57 pages.  That Fine Gael's MEPs abstained on the recent European Parliament report shows how much these empty commitments mean to them.  It is also significant that, in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade's most recent strategy statement for 2015 to 2017, Irish neutrality is not mentioned once.<\/p><p>We do not need to look to Brussels to find the Government's undermining of neutrality, we just need to focus our attention on Shannon Airport.  Some 2.25 million US troops have passed through Shannon Airport since 2002.  Like many others, Teachta&iacute; Wallace and Clare Daly have consistently raised the issue of the failure and the need for the Garda authorities to investigate and search flights carrying military personnel through Shannon.  Their recent court case heard important evidence from military and security experts that detailed how foreign militaries transport weaponry on aircraft passing through Shannon.  These airplanes are guarded by Irish Army personnel and the Garda, but they have never been given an order to do even a cursory search of these craft for weapons.  Shannonwatch has provided the Garda with all of this information and more but, strangely, no investigation has taken place to our knowledge.  Shannon is a civilian airport and not built for military traffic.  An accident or crash there could cause major civilian casualties.<\/p><p>Some Deputies will argue that neutrality is outdated.  I do not agree.  We live in a world where half of the population lives in poverty, with one person in every eight suffering from malnutrition, and where poverty kills approximately 19 people every minute of every day, yet trillions of euro are spent on military expenditure every year.  To ensure that we live in a safer and more equal world, greater military expenditure is not the solution, nor is supporting the creation of an EU army and assisting NATO.  We need to challenge the very structures that cause poverty, food insecurity, conflict and division.<\/p><p>If Ireland followed a policy of positive neutrality, the State could make a significant and powerful contribution towards the long-held global objective of an international peace with justice.  Through a policy of positive neutrality, the State would not look to increase its military spending or take part in the arms trade and profit from war and people's misery.  Instead, it could focus on enhancing the economic, social, political and cultural rights of people worldwide.<\/p><p>If we redoubled our efforts to focus on working with countries on implementing global targets on issues such as land rights, climate change, citizen participation, economic equality and government accountability, surely the world would become a better and safer place for us all.  Irish neutrality is not a policy of opting out of international affairs.  Rather, it is a genuine commitment to a different type of international politics that is focused on justice, development and human rights.<\/p><p>Sinn F&eacute;in supports the continued role of Irish troops in UN peacekeeping missions around the world and the brave work that they do.  Blue helmet peacekeeping missions and Irish Aid continue to be two of the most positive pillars of the State's foreign affairs over the decades.  Surely it is long past time that power was given to the Irish people to decide on Ireland's on future and on whether neutrality should be at the core of that policy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112400050#YY00200","speaker":"1309"},{"type":"speech","time":1480007700,"counter":535,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 1:<\/p><blockquote>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann declines to give the Bill a second reading in order to protect the authority of the Executive to conduct external relations pursuant to Article 29.4 1&deg; of the Constitution;<br \/><br \/>noting also, for example, that the Bill, as currently framed, may constrain the Government&rsquo;s capacity to fulfil its obligations to support United Nations, UN, mandated actions, in particular peace enforcement missions under Chapter VII of the UN Charter;<br \/><br \/>reaffirming its commitment to Ireland&rsquo;s longstanding policy of military neutrality;<br \/><br \/>acknowledging the constitutional framework within which the policy of military neutrality operates, in particular the following Articles of Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann:<blockquote>-- Article 29.1 which affirms Ireland&rsquo;s &quot;devotion to the ideal of peace and friendly cooperation amongst nations founded on international justice and morality&quot;;<br \/><br \/>-- Article 29.2 which affirms Ireland&rsquo;s &quot;&lsquo;adherence to the principle of the pacific settlement of international disputes by international arbitration or judicial determination&quot;&rsquo;; and<br \/><br \/>-- Article 29.4.9&deg; which states: &quot;The State shall not adopt a decision taken by the European Council to establish a common defence pursuant to Article 42 of the Treaty on European Union where that common defence would include the State.&quot;;<\/blockquote>noting that the legally binding Protocol to the Lisbon Treaty negotiated by Ireland, states that &quot;the Treaty of Lisbon does not prejudice Ireland&rsquo;s traditional policy of military neutrality.&quot;;.<br \/><br \/>reaffirming the Government&rsquo;s commitment to the &quot;Triple Lock&quot; principle provided for under the Defence Acts which govern the deployment of Irish Defence Forces overseas.

The text of the Government's reasoned amendment has been circulated to the House.<\/p><p>The Government is clear in our policy on military neutrality.  As Deputies will be aware, the policy dates back to the Second World War.  Over subsequent decades, successive Governments have restated their commitment to the policy and it remains as strong as ever under the current Government.  We are also clear, however, that the proposed legislation is unnecessary and would impact negatively on Ireland's ability to contribute positively in the international community.  On that basis, we are proposing an amendment.<\/p><p>While I cannot support the Bill, today's debate affords a useful opportunity to restate our continuing commitment to Ireland's long-standing policy of military neutrality and to set out how and why we strongly support this policy.  That commitment was most recently set out in the White Paper on Defence, which was published in August 2015.  This reaffirmed that our policy of military neutrality remained a core element of foreign policy, as had been previously restated in the review of foreign policy, The Global Island, published in January 2015.<\/p><p>There are substantive provisions in the Constitution that underpin Ireland's policy on military neutrality.  Article 29 establishes the framework within which Ireland conducts its international relations.  In particular, Article 29.1 reads: &quot;Ireland affirms its devotion to the ideal of peace and friendly co-operation amongst nations founded on international justice and morality.&quot;  Article 29.2 confirms that Ireland adheres to the principle of the peaceful settlement of international disputes.<\/p><p>Further safeguards on this issue are provided in Article 29(4)(9) which imposes a constitutional block on Ireland&rsquo;s participation in a common defence policy under Article 42 of the EU treaties.  This safeguard will remain in our Constitution unless and until the people decide otherwise by referendum on some future occasion.  Moreover, the protocols attaching to the Lisbon treaty specifically recognise Ireland&rsquo;s policy of military neutrality stating, <i>inter alia<\/i>, &quot;The Lisbon Treaty does not affect or prejudice Ireland&rsquo;s traditional policy of military neutrality&quot;.<br\/><br\/>It is suggested that one of the bases for the current proposal is to ensure that we do not deploy our Defence Forces in support of military operations in international conflicts.  As all Members of the House are aware, the Defence Acts set out the parameters within which Defence Forces personnel may be deployed on international operations.  Any such deployment is constrained by the provisions known as the triple lock.  The triple lock provisions also form part of Ireland&rsquo;s declaration under the Lisbon treaty.<br\/><br\/>Successive Governments have pursued a policy of military neutrality, which is characterised by non-participation in military alliances and non-engagement in mutual defence commitments.  Ireland&rsquo;s concept of military neutrality has served us well.  While we choose to remain neutral, that is not out of any lack of interest in issues underpinning conflicts or any isolationist stance.  <br\/><br\/>Ireland&rsquo;s approach to international relations is founded on full and active engagement in the international community in support of international peace and security and the rule of law.  We follow and will continue to follow this policy approach of being militarily neutral but fully engaged, because, as committed members of the United Nations, we subscribe fully to the principles set out in the UN charter.<br\/><br\/>In particular, we believe that disputes between states should be resolved in a peaceful manner.  That is set out in the provisions of Article 2(3) of the UN Charter which states that &quot;All Members shall settle their international disputes by peaceful means in such a manner that international peace and security, and justice, are not endangered.&quot;  We subscribe to, and are bound by, the provisions of chapter 6 of the charter, which deals with the peaceful settlement of disputes and chapter 7 which sets out provisions for joint action in respect of threats to the peace and acts of aggression.  We are also committed as a UN member to meeting our obligations to contribute troops for deployment on UN-mandated missions, whether those are peacekeeping or peace enforcement operations requiring combat ready and capable troops.  Since 1958, the Defence Forces have made an extraordinary contribution to such UN missions.  As a nation we are very proud of the role that the Defence Forces have played, and continue to play, in very challenging and difficult missions.  As of last Friday, Ireland is contributing more than 570 Defence Forces personnel to UN mandated missions throughout the world.<br\/><br\/>The main overseas missions in which Defence Forces personnel are currently deployed are the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, UNIFIL, with 379 personnel, and the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force, UNDOF, in Syria with 136 Defence Forces personnel.  I have just returned from Lebanon this week where Ireland has entered the next chapter of our participation in the UNIFIL mission under the overall control of the head of mission and force commander, Major General Michael Beary.  He is the first Irish person to hold this important post in more than 30 years.  Since Tuesday last, Ireland has once again taken over the lead nation role in the joint Irish-Finnish battalion and will undertake this role for the next two years.  Other missions include the UN-mandated, NATO-led international security presence, KFOR, in Kosovo with 12 personnel, the EU-led operation ALTHEA in Bosnia and Herzegovina, with seven personnel and the EU-led training mission in Mali with 18 personnel.  These missions are undertaken in pursuit of the guiding UN principles to maintain international peace and security and to take effective collective measures to prevent and remove threats to peace.<br\/><br\/>Concern has been expressed at various times about Ireland&rsquo;s participation in NATO-led operations.  I wish to again put on record in the House that the NATO-led operations, in which Ireland participates, such as the NATO-led KFOR Mission in Kosovo and, previously ISAF in Afghanistan, have been authorised by successive UN Security Council resolutions.  They are operations undertaken at the behest of the UN, authorised by the UN, and very often working with a UN mission.  Ireland&rsquo;s participation in them in no way infringes on our traditional policy of military neutrality and our participation is both welcomed and strongly supported by the UN, as is Ireland&rsquo;s participation in EU battle groups.<br\/><br\/>Ireland&rsquo;s co-operation with NATO is conducted through the Partnership for Peace, PfP.  Our purpose in participating in the PfP is to improve our military capabilities so as to be able to participate effectively and safely with other nations in UN-mandated operations.  In joining the PfP, Ireland, in common with other PfP nations, reaffirmed its commitment to fulfil, in good faith, the obligations of the United Nations Charter, and the principles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.  Ireland&rsquo;s decision to participate in PfP is in full accordance with Ireland&rsquo;s policy of military neutrality.<br\/><br\/>Concerns have also been expressed at various times that our participation in the Common Security and Defence Policy, CSDP, of the European Union has posed a threat to our military neutrality, most recently in the context of the publication of the EU&rsquo;s Global Strategy on Foreign and Security Policy.  That is not true.  Ireland&rsquo;s traditional policy on military neutrality is completely unaffected by our membership of the EU or by any treaties or policies associated with the EU.<br\/><br\/>Similarly, concern has been expressed about the recent joint EU-NATO declaration on co-operation.  I can confirm to the House that the declaration clearly states that future co-operation between the EU and NATO will fully respect the decision-making autonomy of both organisations and will not prejudice the specific character of the security and defence policy of any member state, which in our case is one of military neutrality.  The European Union's Common Foreign and Security Policy clearly does not prejudice the specific character of the security and defence policy of certain member states.  That has been consistent treaty language in EU treaties since the Maastricht treaty in 1992.  It was included at Ireland&rsquo;s behest to fully protect our specific policy of military neutrality.  It has been replicated and referenced consistently in all related policies since then, including in relation to the development of the EU&rsquo;s Common Security and Defence Policy, as part of CSDP.<br\/><br\/>There are no proposals to create a standing EU army and we are not and will not become part of any alliance or permanent military formation.  Indeed, there are no provisions whatsoever under the existing EU treaties which would facilitate or enable the creation of a European army.  The guarantees under the Lisbon treaty and Ireland&rsquo;s declaration make this very clear.  Moreover, any form of common defence that may be agreed can only come about if all the member states agree unanimously.  Even if the member states were ever to agree that, Ireland could not participate without a separate referendum.  What has developed in the context of EU-CSDP operations with military elements, is that the Union now engages in a wide range of <br\/><br\/>crisis management operations, invariably in support of or in partnership with the UN.  These are the sort of tasks already undertaken on UN-mandated crisis management operations combining the efforts of both civilian and military personnel.<br\/><br\/>In regard to EU missions and operations overseas under CSDP, the launching of any such missions requires the unanimous approval of the Council.  As such, Ireland has the right of veto over launching any such mission.  Also, it must be recognised that our triple lock would prevent Irish troops from participation in any such mission without a UN mandate and D&aacute;il approval, as appropriate.  I have highlighted the Government&rsquo;s continued commitment to military neutrality, as evidenced through successive policy statements, the Lisbon treaty guarantees and, most recently, the Government's White Paper on Defence.  While Ireland is committed to a policy of military neutrality, we must be clear that Ireland is not ideologically neutral.  Political neutrality in international affairs has never been part of Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy tradition.  Ireland is an outward looking country that has played a proactive role and continues to play a proactive role in preventing and managing conflicts and the maintenance of international peace.<\/p><p> Accordingly, in view of the strength and long-standing nature of this commitment reiterated by successive Governments spanning the political spectrum, the Government is satisfied that there is no need to insert a constitutional provision relating to this policy and has therefore proposed amendment No. 1.  Not only are the proposals in the Bill unnecessary, they are also potentially fraught with difficulties.  Enshrining these provisions in the Constitution could, for example, constrain the Government's flexibility and scope to respond effectively in emergency or urgent circumstances where speed is of the essence.<\/p> <p> More serious are the potential effects which cannot be foreseen and indeed how the proposal may be interpreted in time to come.  As a State, we have seen how constitutional provisions inserted at various times with apparent clear objectives have subsequently been subject to differing interpretations and the cause of ongoing dispute on both sides of the argument.  I would be concerned, for example, that inserting the proposed text in the Constitution might constrain the Government's scope to support UN-mandated actions, particularly in conflict zones and fragile states involving both state and non-state actors.  Moreover, I see no groundswell of public or political opinion to the effect that the people would wish to constrain the Government and D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann in this way.<\/p> <p> Our military neutrality has always been a matter of policy and principle rather than a matter of law.  The instigators of the policy never sought to enshrine it in law and successive Governments have continued to maintain the policy but have not proceeded to give it legal or constitutional effect.  This pragmatic approach has enabled successive Governments to respond to international crises through both civilian and military means in both peacekeeping and peace enforcement missions.<\/p> <p> Finally, I would like to address the issue of the Government's policy in respect of the use of Shannon Airport by US aircraft and the inevitable claims that will be made that this policy is incompatible with our neutrality.  Successive Governments have made overflight and landing facilities available at Shannon Airport to the US for well over 50 years.  These arrangements are governed by strict conditions, including that the aircraft must be unarmed, carry no arms, ammunition or explosives and not engage in intelligence and that the flights do not form part of military exercises or operations.  We impose these conditions to ensure compatibility between these arrangements and our neutrality.<\/p> <p> This is the context in which today's amendment to the motion has been proposed.  Government policy on neutrality is unambiguous.  There are effective safeguards in place to protect Ireland's military neutrality while enabling Ireland to continue actively to play its part internationally through a range of actions, including diplomatic activity, humanitarian interventions and peacekeeping, peace enforcement and crisis management operations.  The inclusion of the proposed provisions in the Constitution is neither necessary nor appropriate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112400050#YY00300","speaker":"1365","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1480008900,"counter":538,"content":"<p>Fianna F&aacute;il opposes the Bill.

We have to ask ourselves whether this is necessary.  While those who propose this may feel that it would not apply in this case, it is still possible that a court challenge might arise on this basis.<\/p><p>In respect of the amendment of Article 29, the definition of a military alliance is open to interpretation.  Is it NATO?  Could it also be interpreted as an EU battlegroup on a peacekeeping mission with a UN mandate?  Is our participation in UNDOF or UNIFIL a form of military alliance?  Furthermore, in the event of Ireland being attacked, would such an article not render it unconstitutional for us to form an alliance to repel the attack?  A constitutional declaration of neutrality is no guarantee that our neutrality will be respected.  We must be practical and take a long-term view.  We must leave ourselves in a position to react to whatever may come at us.<\/p><p>Fianna F&aacute;il is dedicated to Ireland's policy of military neutrality.  It is a policy which we have pursued both in and out of Government and it has as a key defining characteristic non-membership of military alliances.  This policy of military neutrality has gone hand in hand with strong support for international co-operation for peace and stability, as manifested in Ireland's participation in UN-mandated peacekeeping operations.  Various Defence Acts passed by this Oireachtas mean that Ireland only takes part in missions which are unambiguously authorised by the UN and on the basis of a sovereign decision by Government subject to the approval of the D&aacute;il - the triple lock system.  Furthermore, in Article 29, the Constitution also confirms Ireland's dedication to the ideal of peace and friendly co-operation among nations founded on international justice and morality.  Article 29 also upholds our observance of the principle of peaceful resolution of international disputes.  Our neutrality is a policy rather than a status.  Fianna F&aacute;il does not see a case for amending the Constitution in this area.<\/p><p>The second Nice treaty referendum introduced a provision in the Irish Constitution affirming that Ireland could not partake in common defence without further amendment to the Constitution.  This gave constitutional effect to the solemn commitment in the national declaration by Ireland at Seville that a referendum would be held in Ireland on the adoption of decisions taken by the EU to move to a common defence.  The Seville declarations clarified that there was nothing in the Treaty of Nice or previous treaties that posed a threat to Ireland's traditional policy of military neutrality.  In order for Ireland to join a common defence, the people would first have to vote to delete or amend this constitutional prohibition.  At the Seville summit in June 2002, the State secured the agreement of our EU partners to declarations that reflect Ireland's position on military neutrality and European security and defence policy.  Two declarations were included in the Nice treaty to underline the Irish position.<\/p><p>The first was the national declaration by Ireland, which states that Ireland is not party to any mutual defence commitment, is not party to any plans to develop a European army and will take a sovereign decision on a case-by-case basis on whether the Defence Forces should participate in humanitarian or crisis management tasks undertaken by the EU based on the triple lock of a UN mandate, a Government decision and approval by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.<\/p><p>The Declaration of the European Council at the time confirmed that Ireland's policy of military neutrality is in full conformity with the treaties on which the European Union is based, including the Treaty of Nice, and that there is no obligation arising from the treaties which would or could oblige Ireland to depart from that policy.  These declarations are solemn political declarations of a formal kind which will be deposited at the United Nations and we stand by them.  We also stand by the triple lock.<\/p><p>Ireland has always conferred fundamental importance on the United Nations since we joined 58 years ago and working with other UN members we have supported international action in areas such as disarmament, peacekeeping, development and human rights and we are proud of this.  We are strong and committed supporters of collective security through the United Nations.  This has been the stated policy of many Governments over the past 58 years.  Alongside this, we have endorsed and supported the primary role of the Security Council in the maintenance of international peace and security in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations.  This emphasis on the UN is not one we should lightly discard.  While we are conscious of the opposition to the triple lock from some military and political commentators, we do believe that there is overwhelming public support for the mechanism.  Furthermore, the legitimacy conferred by a UN mission bolsters the safety and security of our Defence Forces when they participate in peacekeeping and peace enforcement missions.  Obviously, no mission will be without risk but the absence of the blue hat will heighten the risk.<\/p><p>While neutrality was the given policy of successive Governments prior to the Second World War, it was that conflict that put it to the test.  In 1940, Eamon de Valera told this House that:<\/p><blockquote>We have chosen the policy of neutrality ... because we believed that it was the right policy for our people.  It is the policy which has been accepted, not merely by this House, but by our people as a whole, and nobody who realises what modern war means, and what it means particularly for those who have not sufficient air defences, will have the slightest doubt that policy was the right one, apart altogether from any questions of sympathy on one side or the other.<\/blockquote><p>In 1946, as the D&aacute;il debated a motion to see admission to the newly formed United Nations, he provided another illuminating insight.  He said that &quot;I would like our people and the Members of this House to bear in mind that for six years of war the question as to whether our neutrality would be respected or not depended ultimately upon the will of, perhaps, two men.&quot;  He acknowledged that those two men were President Franklin Roosevelt and Winston Churchill.  He went on to say with regard to the United Nations that:<\/p><blockquote>It is the small nations particularly that should welcome an organisation which is intended to give collective security.  But the small nations, just like the big ones, will, if they become members of such an organisation, have to be really loyal members of it.  They will have to make up their minds that the obligations which are necessary, if the organisation is to be successful, will be fulfilled and carried out.<\/blockquote><p>As has been pointed out in this house before, the war from 1939 to 1945 showed clearly that military neutrality by itself is not sufficient to maintain conditions of peace and security internationally.  It is also essential that we work actively for international peace and security taking account of the prevailing circumstances.  This support for collective security has essentially been followed through the United Nations.<\/p><p>Let us recall very clearly that when our neutrality was most tested from 1939 to 1945, Sinn F&eacute;in and the IRA did everything but respect that neutrality and for that organisation to present itself now as a champion and guarantor of Irish neutrality lacks any semblance of credibility.<\/p><p>Ireland is not alone in not providing a constitutional provision for its neutrality.  A number of our EU partners do the same thing.  Sweden has a long-standing policy of neutrality but it is not a feature of its constitution.  Similarly, its neighbour and also our European Union partner, Finland, is not in any military alliance but does not feel any need to provide for a constitution prohibition.<br\/><br\/>What would happen if we made a provision for neutrality in the Constitution?  We must consider the impact of passing this legislation.  Can the definition of a military alliance also be open to interpretation?  Is it NATO and only NATO?  Could it also be interpreted as an EU battle group on a peacekeeping mission with a UN mandate?  Is our participation in the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force, UNDOF, in the Golan Heights or the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, UNIFIL, a form of military alliance?  If the provisions of the Bill became law, it could fall to the Supreme Court to decide because I have no doubt there would be a challenge to such missions.<br\/><br\/>The truth is that a constitutional provision could be too rigid, too doctrinaire.  It could also have a detrimental impact on the ability of the Government to manage foreign policy issues.  Neutrality should not mean neutering.<br\/><br\/>It is not long since Sinn F&eacute;in started recognising the courts of this Republic, but we do not need to confer these additional powers on them.  It could undermine the whole purpose of collective security and the United Nations that Ireland is so committed to.<br\/><br\/>Let me return to what De Valera said in 1946: <\/p><blockquote>It would be fatal for the small nations, including ourselves, who have any hope of collective security, to think that they can in the end dodge their obligations, if they attempt to do so, they are going to bring the whole edifice down and they might as well never have had anything to do with an organisation of this sort.  Therefore our people should realise that when we enter into an organisation of this sort we are committing ourselves to take collective action with other people.<\/blockquote><p>The difference between a war, such as may arise under the obligations of the charter, and other wars is as follows.  This type of war would be a war of enforcement - enforcement of obligations, and also enforcement of rights.  If there is ever to be a rule of law, nations must make up their minds that they will take part in such enforcement, because if there is not enforcement, then, of course, the duties and the rights that are guaranteed will be all thrown aside.<br\/><br\/>The reality is that the inclusion of a specific reference to neutrality in the Constitution could have a serious impact on our capacity to support the United Nations.  There would be serious doubt as to whether we could fulfil our obligations as a member of the United Nations.<br\/><br\/>Resorting to the courts would be a clear implication of this plan to amend the Constitution and it is simply not a suitable area for judicial decision.  These are not matters to be settled in the Supreme Court rather than by those of us who have been elected by the people.  The people are sovereign through our electoral system and that is where sovereignty must reside.  We are the legislators in this regard, elected by the people to do this job.<br\/><br\/>Another myth that Sinn F&eacute;in and other supporters of this Bill peddle is that of increasing militarisation.  Throughout Europe military expenditure has declined rapidly in the past 20 years.  Recent events in the Ukraine may reverse that in some countries, but here in Ireland we have reduced our Defence Forces from around 14,000 in 1990 to less than 10,000 now.  In the ten years after 1997, defence spending in this country halved as a share of GDP.<br\/><br\/>Of course, the period known as the Troubles crippled our country in many ways with needless loss of thousands of lives, people maimed and a massive annual bill for defence which has been reduced due to the ending of the campaigns of terror by the Provisional IRA and other paramilitary organisations.<br\/><br\/>This Bill represents a backwards step.  It would do nothing to enhance the protection of military neutrality that already exists and I restate my party's opposition to it.  We did not support a similar Bill proposed by the same party while we were in government in 2003 nor did we do so in 2015, and we will not do so now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112400052#AAA00200","speaker":"1336","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1480009500,"counter":540,"content":"<p>Before proceeding to the next speaker, I feel the Chair should apologise to Deputy Clare Daly.

More importantly, we also believe that the principle is supported by the bulk of the Irish people, and that it should therefore be incorporated into the text of the Constitution.  We will, therefore, be supporting this Bill.  It is bizarre that the Government should oppose a Bill to amend the Constitution on the grounds that it is unconstitutional.  Yet that, effectively, is what the Government amendment argues.<\/p>  <p>  In the hope that the Bill reaches Committee Stage, I will outline the reasoning for some of the amendments we will propose, which I believe will improve its effectiveness.  First, we need to distinguish between neutrality in time of peace and neutrality in time of war.  Neutrality in time of peace means that the State is not a member of a mutual defence alliance and therefore does not commit itself in advance to the defence of its allies even if it is not, itself, attacked.  That is the rule which the Sinn F&eacute;in Bill seeks to enshrine in the Constitution.  Ireland is not a member of any mutual defence alliance.  I think it would probably be unconstitutional for us ever to join such an alliance.<\/p>  <p>  Some members will recall Raymond Crotty's case against the State.  His case arose from the proposal to sign up to the Single European Act, with its very tentative arrangements for European political co-operation, without a referendum.  In the event, the Supreme Court held that European political co-operation interfered with the unfettered discretion of the Government to conduct foreign affairs and would be unconstitutional without a referendum.  <\/p>  <p>  In the same way, a binding advance commitment on the part of the State to go to war in future, but unknown, circumstances would seem to be an unconstitutional overriding of the D&aacute;il's sovereign discretion and choice.  Article 28.3.1&deg; provides that: \"War shall not be declared and the State shall not participate in any war save with the assent of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann\".  For that reason, it seems highly likely that the courts would hold that, under the Constitution as it reads at present, it would not be possible to sign up to a military mutual defence alliance.<\/p>  <p>  The second aspect of neutrality relates to our obligations in time of war.  This has directly arisen in the context of the two Gulf wars and the assistance provided to the US military by governments here.  Neutrality in time of war relates to the rules of international law that impose requirements on non-belligerents.  Neutrals are entitled to have their territory respected and unaffected by the consequences of an armed conflict, but only as long as their activities do not benefit one belligerent at the expense of the other.  It is self-evident that a state that supports either of the parties to the conflict loses its neutral status.<\/p>  <p>  Therefore, in time of war, states that proclaim themselves to be neutral in a war cannot aid or hinder either side of the conflict and must keep the conflict from entering their neutral territory.  However, this is subject to one overriding consideration.  Ireland is a member of the United Nations.  Chapter VII of the UN Charter confers on the Security Council a capacity to instruct member states as to how to react when there is a threat to international peace and security.  Those instructions could include, for example, the taking of sides in a time of war and the loss of neutrality.  Compliance with Security Council resolutions may entail loss of neutrality in time of a war in which the State is not a participant.  The first Gulf war is a case in point.<\/p>  <p>  In the event of any threat to the peace, breach of the peace or act of aggression, the Security Council is authorised to make recommendations, to call for the employment of measures short of force, or to take forcible measures to maintain or restore international peace and security.  If a state is called upon to take military action against an aggressor, or to assist those taking such action, that state loses its right to remain neutral and actually loses its neutrality to the extent that it complies with the direction of the Security Council.<\/p>  <p>  An important issue arises here.  Because of the reasoning of the Supreme Court in the Crotty case, Irish membership of the UN may in fact be unconstitutional.  This proposition is realistically discussed in learned legal circles, but it has not been given much political prominence.  The reasoning in the Crotty case is that the State is not entitled to fetter its sovereign discretion in the conduct of its foreign relations, by entering into prior and binding commitments as to how it will act in the future.  Yet a central purpose of the UN Charter is to bind and commit each member state to comply with future resolutions of the Security Council.  So, for the same reasons that signing up to European political co-operation required a referendum, so also, probably, would membership of the UN if it were to happen tomorrow.  Any proposal to amend the Constitution to deal with neutrality should deal with this issue.  I believe the text should specifically reference and approve our membership of the United Nations.<\/p>  <p>  The text should also deal with the enforceability of these rules in our courts.  Can the courts intervene if the State breaches neutrality?  I have given some thought to this.  It is instructive to look at the different ways in which the D&aacute;il responded to the two Gulf wars.  The difference between the two is that there was a UN mandate for military action after the invasion of Kuwait, but there was no mandate for the second, disastrous episode.<\/p>  <p>  In the first case, the D&aacute;il noted that under the United Nations Charter all member states were bound to accept and carry out the decisions of the Security Council in accordance with the charter.  The D&aacute;il declared its support for the decisions of the Security Council and it specifically noted Resolution 678, which requested all states to provide appropriate support for the actions taken in pursuance of the resolution.  It was under the terms of Security Council Resolution 678 that the State was bound to provide support, including overflight and Shannon stopover facilities for the US military.<\/p><p>On the other hand, in 2003 the D&aacute;il regretted that the US-UK coalition was launching a campaign against Iraq in the absence of agreement on a further UN Security Council resolution.  The D&aacute;il, however, went on to recall what the resolution referred to as the long-standing arrangements for the overflight and landing in Ireland of US military and civilian aircraft and it supported the decision of the Government to maintain those arrangements.  In other words, the D&aacute;il supported the Government in abandoning Ireland's neutral status, without any UN mandate or justification.  Just for the record, it is important to remember that the US-UK coalition returned to the UN Security Council at a later stage and sought and secured a mandate for its efforts to return some peace and stability to the region.   The overflight and Shannon stopover arrangements that were in place as and from that date therefore have a UN mandate.  I would argue that our Constitution, which is now proposed to be amended, should provide us with some assistance in differentiating between these two scenarios.  In both cases US aircraft were permitted landing and overflight facilities at Shannon.  In the first case there was a UN Security Council resolution requesting all member states to provide appropriate support, while in the second case there was no UN mandate.  Edward Horgan, a Limerick man, sought court declarations that the Government decision to permit US military aircraft engaged in the second Gulf War to overfly the State, to land and be refuelled at Shannon was clearly in breach of Ireland&rsquo;s neutral State duty and constituted participation by the State in a war without D&aacute;il assent, in breach of Article 28.3 of the Constitution.  That case was heard by the High Court.  The High Court held that the State&rsquo;s compliance with generally recognised principles of international law was not enforceable by the courts.  In fact, the High Court went further and held that the discretion of the Government in international relations could not be fettered by reference to rules of international law.  The High Court also held that what constituted &ldquo;participation&rdquo; in a war, within the meaning of Article 28.3.1 of the Constitution, was a matter to be decided by the D&aacute;il.   I think it is noteworthy that, for the purpose of these arguments, the High Court accepted that international law imposed duties on non-belligerents.  The question was whether the court could enforce them.  Although this rule exists in the international plane, the High Court&rsquo;s position was that under the Constitution as it stands, the rule is not enforceable.  This Bill presents an ideal opportunity to remedy this defect and it could be very useful in that regard.<\/p> <p> In summary, the Labour Party, which supports the amendment, believes that a constitutional amendment should do five things.  First, it should secure Ireland&rsquo;s membership of the United Nations which, as I have said, is open to question.  Second, it should explicitly prohibit the State from membership of a military alliance for mutual defence.  Third, it should prohibit the State, unless authorised by the United Nations and with D&aacute;il assent, from declaring war, participating in war, sending the Defence Forces to participate in any form of armed conflict or providing any assistance to belligerents in time of war.  Fourth, it should be made clear that the Defence Forces could continue to take part in training, joint exercises, rapid reaction forces and the like, in preparation for UN-mandated international missions, a task with a UN mandate and for which the missions have won plaudits and admiration across the world.  We, as a nation, are very proud of the role played by our Defence Forces and soldiers in many challenging and difficult roles and situations.  Some are from our own areas, including the former Columb Barracks in Mullingar, Custume Barracks in Athlone and across the midlands.  They have played a vital role and we must continue that.  Finally, but most importantly, the amendment should provide that its terms are justiciable, meaning that the text is cognisable and enforceable by the courts of the land.  That is an important situation.  This is a worthwhile Bill and the Labour Party will be supporting it fully.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112400053#BBB00300","speaker":"1370","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1480010100,"counter":543,"content":"<p>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for his apology.  He does not need to apologise to me - nobody does - these things happen.  I just hope that next time around the rules of the House are upheld because it is a matter for all individual Deputies rather than the priority of the parties, which normally prevails in here.  It is nobody's fault, this stuff happens.  I am absolutely delighted to be here and I am very glad that the Bill was selected from the lottery.  I compliment the Deputies for bringing it forward.  We have been given the opportunity to do something very positive here tonight.  This motion is not about standing idly by.  It is about being proactive, internationalist, standing up for human rights and the peaceful organisation of the world.  It is very interesting to see how language has changed.  Time after time the Minister of State kept talking about military neutrality but this is about positive neutrality.  It is not a stand at the seams and do nothing policy.  It is not about Ireland just not being involved in armed conflict.  The Bill is very clear that it is also about not aiding foreign powers in any way in the preparation for war or other armed conflict.  That, in and of itself, is a proactive policy which should be supported.  When listening to the Minister of State I did not know whether to laugh or to cry because he told us his commitment to neutrality was as strong as it ever was, and maybe that was when we started to get worried.  It is another Irish solution to an Irish problem.  The Minister of State talks the talk about neutrality but he ignores the elephant in the room or rather the Hercules C-130 on the runway at Shannon.  This does not happen arbitrarily but on average at least two times a day.  Last month Shannonwatch photographed such aircraft six times in the one day at Shannon Airport.  Two weeks ago a NATO warship docked and refuelled at Cork Harbour with armed personnel on board.  Last year the Department gave 600 exemptions for military aircraft to land at Shannon Airport and 700 exemptions for aircraft to carry weaponry.<\/p>  <p>  What does the Minister of State think these aircraft are doing?  The figures are there.  Since 2001 some 2.5 million troops have passed through Shannon, over 60,000 in the last year alone, en route to the Middle East.  The Government has given permission for hundreds of millions of tonnes to pass through Irish airspace to locations such as Afghanistan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and so on.  What does Minister of State think all that transit is about?  It costs substantial amounts of money to move this type of aircraft.  It does not come cheap.  It defies credibility that this is being done in compliance with the regulations laid down that to adhere to our neutrality we are not involved in military conflict operations and do not carry weapons, ammunition and the like.  It could not be the case.  Not only must we speculate on the bounds of credibility, we know this for a fact, as Deputy Crowe has said.  In our court case in 2015, three people gave direct evidence of seeing, personally and directly, weaponry on board US aircraft.  This is a fact.  In fairness to the judge in that case, he made a point in his summation that he accepted without any doubt whatsoever the bona fides and the expertise of the witnesses we had assembled but that he could not adjudicate the picture because of the charge that we were there.  I would actually have more respect for the Minister of State if he said we are not really neutral at all, we want to allow the US military to basically operate in Ireland whatever way it likes because we might get a few jobs out of it, it is good for the economy and it is good for multinationals.  In reality, that is the Government's position and rather than dressing it up in this duplicitous way which is very disrespectful to the Irish people, we know from our history that it would be entirely appropriate and possible for the Government to deny permission for such aircraft.  We know that previous taoisigh such as Se&aacute;n Lemass ordered planes to be checked.  For the Minister of State to say that a referendum could not be put to the people because of cost is incredibly insulting when one looks at the human cost of the global war machine and the consequences.  We are complicit in this by allowing Shannon Airport to be used.  There are 65 million people displaced by war.  Last year 24 people every minute were forced to flee their homes as a direct result of military conflict.  One in every 113 people globally is now a refugee, an asylum seeker or an internally displaced person and 51% of those people are children.  We are complicit in that situation.  It is a fact and we are not even speculating on it.<\/p><p> The international arms trade is a huge contributor to this situation yet we continue to do business with countries such as the UAE and Saudi Arabia, transporting dual use goods there when it is not clear what the end use will be.  Freedom of information requests have shown many of these exports are on their way to countries, for example Saudi Arabia, where it is indisputable they are getting co-operation from the United States which has used its aircraft to refuel Saudi aircraft on the way to unleash appalling butchery and hardship on the people of Yemen.<\/p> <p> Based on the information we have seen through freedom of information requests, we have to be complicit in this.  The figures tally with the number of refuelling US aircraft that went through Shannon Airport and onwards in that direction.  There could be no other conclusion drawn from the situation.  To come in here and say we are neutral, we love being neutral and we want to keep neutrality belies the reality on the ground.  The position of the Minister of State is not akin to the wishes and intentions of the Irish people, because Irish people do not want to be part of this situation.  We know an online poll conducted yesterday indicated 57% of people are in favour of enshrining neutrality in the Constitution.  Deputy Wallace commissioned a Red C opinion poll last year, which gave figures of approximately 60% of the population supporting neutrality.  If the same poll were taken now it would probably be higher, given the outcome of the US election and the imminent presidency of Donald Trump, which is a little ironic because Donald Trump's interest in foreign invasion is probably a little less than President Barack Obama, who signed off on a record number of assassinations and an unprecedented level of military activity.<\/p> <p> Historically, our neutrality has probably got a lot more to do with the war against Britain and the insurgent nationalism in the early days of the State when Irish people were justifiably trying to shake off British imperialism.  The anti-conscription campaign politicised a layer of Irish people, who went on to join the struggle for independence.  It may have started in this way but it has developed into something very different.  Our neutrality is something that Irish people hold very dear.  When they go on holidays they like to be recognised as Irish.  They do not get insulted when they are called English because they do not want to be identified with an aggressor nation.  They are, if we like, affiliated with the idea of being part of the peoples of the world rather than facilitating armed imperialist world powers.  Given this outlook and because Irish people are all over the world, we have the potential to punch way above our weight in terms of a positive contribution to world relations for a world that would be dominated more in terms of peaceful co-existence rather than imperialist pursuit.  The Minister of State told us one of the most serious issues he has with the Bill is the potential effects which cannot be foreseen.  This utterly ridiculous for a constitutional amendment.  The attitude the Government has taken to this beggars belief.  What is it afraid of?  To paraphrase the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Fitzgerald, why not let the people decide because they are the best arbiters.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112400054#CCC00200","speaker":"1259","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1480010700,"counter":545,"content":"<p>In many ways the Bill could not be more timely.  On Tuesday, the European Parliament backed plans to create a defence union by 369 votes to 255.  The non-binding resolution states 2% of GDP should be spent on defence, the establishment of multinational forces and an EU headquarters built for crisis management operations, enabling the EU to act where NATO is unwilling to do so.  The resolution tasks the European Council to lead the creation of common union defence policy.<\/p>  <p>  All types of arguments have been put forward for this move, from Russia to the victory for Donald Trump, with Brexit being the most recent, but the military union has been in the works for a while.  The main strategy is laid out in the document Shared Vision, Common Action: A Stronger Europe, which was published last June.  The strategy reads like an Orwellian nightmare.  It states NATO and the battle groups are not enough to stand up to global threats, we need a European army, Europe's soft power needs to be backed by a hard power and Europe must stabilise the Middle East, stop smuggling networks and fight terrorism.  Federica Mogherini, the EU foreign policy chief and one of the central drivers of the move, has said it is starting to be clear to everyone we can only succeed in providing security to our citizens if we work together as a true union with the full potential of a superpower in the field of security and defence.<\/p>  <p>  The whole issue of the European army is worrying to say the least, particularly in light of the fact most European countries are busy bombing the Middle East back to the Stone Age.  Perhaps this move will mean every European country will join the carnage and invest more in the industry of death.  The defence plan speaks about pre-emptive peace building missions in the Middle East and northern Africa.  Is this doublespeak for aerial bombing campaigns?  It is hard not to think so given the track record of the countries beating the drum for the EU army.  Belgium, Bulgaria, Denmark, France, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Romania, Spain, Sweden and the UK all participated in the NATO-led air strikes on Libya in 2011 and what a disaster that was.  Germany, Belgium, Denmark, France, Italy and the UK are among the European countries that have been bombing Syria in the US-led strikes over the past two years.  Germany, France and the UK have all publicly expressed support for the ongoing war crimes in Yemen being perpetrated by Saudi Arabia with direct support coming from the US, France and the UK, and from Ireland through allowing the use of Shannon by the US military.  The death toll of the war there over the past 20 months is so high the Red Cross has started to donate entire morgue units to Yemeni hospitals.  Not a single word of condemnation has come from our Government.  Instead, in direct contradiction of the stated policy of neutrality, we facilitate this death and destruction.<\/p>  <p>  Freedom of information documents obtained by Shannonwatch on permits for landing and flyovers in 2014 reveal a total of 272 flights were given permits to take weapons or explosives through Shannon Airport.  Machine guns, troops, missiles, rocket mortars, explosives and other war materials were routinely given permission to fly to Irish space.  On six flights alone, 190 metric tonnes of bullets passed through our borders on the way to Afghanistan from the US.  God knows how many people they killed.<\/p>  <p>  On 20 May 2014, we allowed missile parts to be flown through Ireland on the way to the United Arab Emirates.  On 15 and 16 November 2014, cluster bombs, a brutal instrument of war that Ireland helped to get banned years ago, were given permission to go to our trade partner Saudi Arabia.  Both of these brutally authoritarian regimes and the US have been committing war crimes in Yemen for 20 months, directly targeting civilians using cluster bombs sold by the US, bombing markets, hospitals and public gatherings.  We know for a fact permissions for munitions landings and overflights granted by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport lead directly to the deaths of countless civilians.  Why are we taking part in these crimes?  It makes a mockery of the notion we might be neutral.<\/p>  <p>  Only a few weeks ago, five US military planes were in Shannon Airport on the same day.  Aside from the ongoing assault on Yemen, there is a big build-up in support of the assault on Mosul in Iraq.  According to Shannonwatch, each of the military planes must be on a military operation in spite of US and Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade assurances they are not.  No such aircraft ever leaves its home airbase unless it is on an authorised military operation.  They are not playing golf in the Middle East.<\/p>  <p>  The same information Shannonwatch obtained through freedom of information to discover for certain we are helping drown the Middle East in weapons is not now forthcoming.  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is refusing to give us details it gave previously, with no legitimate reason for keeping the public in the dark about this.  This is particularly worrying as the number of requests for landings and overflights are higher than they have been for a number of years.  An incredible amount of aerial bombing is going on by the US and its sidekicks, and much more is planned in the coming months.  It is soul destroying when we see the images of destruction in the Middle East, knowing our Government helps it happen and we help to kill people, including women and children, and the Government does not seem to care.  We certainly do not seem to care about the people who suffer from our actions.  We agreed to the EU sending Afghans back to a country we have helped the US bomb for 15 years.<\/p><p>They are still bombing there.  A few weeks ago, two US soldiers were killed in a firefight with the Taliban and, in retaliation, air strikes were called in and 36 civilians were killed, including a significant number of children and infants.  In late September a drone struck the celebration of a tribal elder's return from his pilgrimage to Mecca and 15 civilians were killed.  We are sending people back to a war zone but many of the children we are sending back have nothing there any more.  Family members are either dead or living abroad and, sometimes, by going back to places like Afghanistan they put their lives in danger.  They left because they had to save their lives, but if they or their extended family had fallen foul of the Taliban or ISIS or had relatives who had worked with the US army, they were targeted by some of the groups in retaliation.<\/p> <p> We have been sending refugees back to Turkey which, far from being safe for refugees, is hardly safe for Turkish people.  Mr. Erdo\u011fan is talking about bringing back the death penalty and has thrown 130,000 people in jail, including a record number of journalists.  Refugees continue to face many obstacles to registration and access to education, employment and health care.  Turkey has effectively sealed its border with Syria and has shot at forcibly returned women, men and children fleeing violence, persecution and human rights abuses in that country.  It is not a safe third country and the continuation of the Turkey-EU deal is just another signal of our inability to take responsibility for our actions in the Middle East and beyond.<\/p> <p> Successive Irish Governments have made a mockery of Irish neutrality.  They have facilitated the US wars in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria and openly criticised Russia but they cannot see the part that they themselves played in this chapter of human history.  Russia should be criticised and we will never defend its actions, but let us call a spade a spade and criticise everyone involved in this destruction.  The Minister said in his opening statement \"we believe that disputes between states should be resolved in a peaceful manner\".  So do we.  He quoted the UN charter by saying, \"All members shall settle their international disputes by peaceful means in such a manner that international peace and security, and justice, are not endangered.\"  What we facilitated in Afghanistan, Iraq and in other parts of that region has not done anything for international peace, has done nothing for world security and certainly has not done anything for justice.  I do not believe the Irish people are in favour of this.  In a Red C poll, referred to earlier by Deputy Daly, the Irish were asked whether they approved of Shannon Airport being used as a US military base.  In response, just under 60% said they did not.  I do not just hold this Government accountable for this because Fianna F&aacute;il has behaved the very same.  When in Opposition Fine Gael, and even Labour Party Members, wanted planes inspected and wondered how we could know whether there were arms on military planes if we did not inspect them, but as soon as they went into power they did not want to know.  I know that the Ministers present do not agree with us but I do not think it would affect our business if we stopped Shannon being used as a military airport.  It would be a positive thing worldwide, for everyone's sake.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112400055#DDD00200","speaker":"1355","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1480011300,"counter":547,"content":"<p>I often get a sense of the surreal when I am in this Chamber because of the common disconnect between the assertions and statements of this Government and the reality, outside in the real world, to which those statements relate.  On no issue is that feeling more acute than on the issue of Ireland's supposed military neutrality and the repeated assertions of the Minister of State at the Department of Defence, Deputy Paul Kehoe, and the Government about their commitment to military neutrality and peace as against the reality of what this country is doing on the question of war and militarism.  In this context, the Government's commitment to military neutrality brings to mind George Orwell's famous references to doublespeak and Big Brother's slogans that \"War is Peace\", \"Freedom is Slavery\" and \"Ignorance is Strength\".<\/p>  <p>  I do not see how the Government could possibly contend that Irish Government policy, now or previously under Fianna F&aacute;il or Fine Gael, adheres even to the principles set out in the Government's amendment to Sinn F&eacute;in's neutrality Bill.  Article 29 is quoted in the amendment as affirming Ireland&rsquo;s \"devotion to the ideal of peace and friendly co-operation amongst nations founded on international justice and morality\".  Article 29.2 affirms Ireland&rsquo;s \"adherence to the principle of the pacific settlement of international disputes by international arbitration or judicial determination\".  Will the Minister of State please explain to me how those imperatives, set out in the Government amendment, tally with allowing Shannon Airport to be used in the context of US military action and the destruction and devastation it has inflicted in Afghanistan, Iraq, Yemen or Syria?  How could any of those things be described as according with \"devotion to the ideal of peace and friendly co-operation\" or the \"pacific settlement of international disputes by international arbitration or judicial determination\"?  That is not what they are doing.<\/p>  <p>  There is no international arbitration or judicial determination in the decision of the United States, as confirmed on 23 October, to use depleted uranium weapons in Syria.  Do the Ministers condemn that?  Do they abhor it?  Does it concern them?  Has it got anything whatsoever to do with international arbitration, judicial determination or the pacific settlement of international disputes?  No, it has not.  It involves using disgusting weapons of mass destruction to kill people, poison people, irradiate the environment in which they live and poison their water and their land, producing higher infant mortality rates and a disgusting spike in the levels of cancers and deformities among young children.  Syria has been ravaged as a result of the recent war, as was Iraq.  These are the same depleted uranium weapons used by the same US-led military coalition as in 2003 and the previous war to poison Iraq, leading to enormous, obscene rises in the level of infant deformation, disability and mortality.  In the lowest estimates 250,000 people have been killed in Iraq and, in the highest estimates, 1 million have been killed, directly or indirectly, as a result of US military action.<\/p><p>What the hell does that have to do with the imperatives the Minister of State claims to uphold?  What does it have to do with what is happening in Iraq, where 5,000 US military personnel are working with Iraqi and Kurdish forces in trying to retake the city of Mosul, where the United Nations fears there will be an enormous humanitarian crisis which will result in 700,000 people fleeing the city?  The UN camps can accommodate only 60,000.  More destruction will be wreaked on Iraqi cities that have already been decimated as a result of the US-led war starting in 2003 with all of the spillover effects that have led to the destabilisation of Syria and the obscene destruction and killing that is taking place, in which the United States continues to participate.  It recently killed 56 civilians in Manbij.<\/p> <p> What does it have to do with what they are doing in Yemen?  It has just been announced that in October alone there were 1,400 cases of cholera in Yemen where a major outbreak was declared as a result of 18 months of war.  The majority of health facilities and clean water supplies have been destroyed by the US-supported, Saudi-led coalition which is bombing the hell out of Yemen.  <\/p> <p> What does it have to do with the peaceful settlement of international disputes?  It is just warmongering and wanton destruction of innocent civilians, causing millions to be displaced, using obscene weapons, and we are facilitating it at Shannon Airport.  Any reasonable definition of neutrality, as the Hague Convention makes clear, does not allow for weapons of war to be moved through neutral states when used in that sort of military action.  What is worse is that we have had a small number of troops under NATO command in Afghanistan in what was clearly a retaliatory war, led by the United States in response to the horrendous events of 11 September 2001.  There have been 15 years of war which have destroyed society in Afghanistan which we have facilitated every inch of the way.  <\/p> <p> How can the Minister of State say we are upholding Ireland&rsquo;s military neutrality or adhering to the principles he asserts?  It is self-evident that are not and Orwellian to suggest we are.  That is why we need this neutrality Bill to lock into the Constitution the bringing into effect of the principles the Minister of State says he is upholding in order that there would be no swivel room to allow him to shred military neutrality by implicating us in these wars, mass destruction and killing and supporting a major imperial power in its vicious, brutal, cruel and destructive military actions in the Middle East.  It is even more the case with Mr. Trump who says: &ldquo;We will spend what we need to rebuild our military.  It is the cheapest investment we can make.  We will develop, build and purchase the best equipment known to mankind.  Our military dominance must be unquestioned.&rdquo;  That is his policy.  Are we going to facilitate a state that has that attitude towards military dominance, a clearly expressed imperial perspective?  If we are, it is an affront to any claim that we uphold military neutrality.  If the Minister of State is serious about the principles he has included in his amendment, he has no choice but to support the Bill brought forward by Sinn F&eacute;in.  Anything less would be hypocrisy and show him up as trying to fool the people, but they are not fooled.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112400056#EEE00200","speaker":"1238","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1480011900,"counter":549,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate and fully support the Bill.  The Minister of State has left the House.  If one wanted to be generous about his contribution at the start of this debate, one could think the Government was presenting a reasoned argument.  If one did not know very much about what was happening, it might seem the Government was trying to balance all of these difficult issues to arrive at the most practical position on neutrality.  Then one gets to the second last paragraph of his contribution in which he talks about the Government granting permission for the use of Shannon Airport as a <i>de facto<\/i>US military base.  He said:<\/p><blockquote>Successive Governments have made overflight and landing facilities available at Shannon Airport to the United States for well over 50 years.  These arrangements are governed by strict conditions, including that the aircraft must be unarmed, carry no arms, ammunition or explosives, that they do not engage in intelligence and that the flights do not form part of military exercises or operations.  We impose these conditions to ensure compatibility between these arrangements and our neutrality.<\/blockquote><p>That gives the lie to the Government&rsquo;s contribution to this debate.  We have never checked any of the flights transiting through Shannon Airport.  We do not know and do not want to know.  We have turned a blind eye to it.  A total of 2.5 million US troops have travelled through Shannon Airport on their way to Afghanistan and Iraq, as has been outlined by other Members, to kill civilians in these countries.  Shannon Airport has also been tied to dozens of CIA rendition flights on which prisoners illegally seized in Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan were shipped to various black sites in Europe and Asia and Guantanamo Bay in Cuba, yet we do nothing.  As Deputies Mick Wallace and Clare Daly said, we have given permission for thousands of tonnes of armaments to be carried in overflights, about which we never ask.  They said we had given permission for cluster bombs to be flown through Irish airspace on their way to Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria to kill civilians there.  In 2008 we passed a Cluster Munitions And Anti-Personnel Mines Act 2008 to instruct State investment agencies to divest from investing in munitions companies involved in the manufacture of cluster bombs, yet we give the Americans an exemption to overfly the State with cluster bombs on their way to do their deadly work. <\/p><p>The Government&rsquo;s argument is disingenuous and duplicitous.  It is afraid of the answer it would get from the people if it allowed the proposal for a referendum to be debated by them because they would back it very strongly and forcefully.  Deputy Willie Penrose&rsquo;s contribution on behalf of the Labour Party was thought-provoking and it would be interesting to tease out the Bill further on Committee Stage.  It is hard, however, to escape the reality that when the Labour Party was in government, it voted down the Bill and did not present the same reasoned arguments.  It was a lost opportunity. <\/p><p>I was struck by the similarity between the Government's and Fianna F&aacute;il's contributions in terms of the arguments and language used.  They could have been written by the same person, with a few tweaks along the way.  The message is that a referendum to enshrine neutrality in the Constitution would signal that we were withdrawing from international relations and going to become an insular country, but is far from the way it would be.  Why would the fact that we had enshrined neutrality in the Constitution mean we were withdrawing from international relations?  It would, in fact, probably increase our credibility in international relations.  If we were proactive, stopped the use of Shannon Airport as an American military base and stopped granting permission for overflights to transport armaments to war zones, we would strengthen our standing in the international community.  The problem for the Government is that it would not strengthen it with the people to whom it wants to cosy up - the Americans, the British and the French, all former colonial powers that want to bomb people into oblivion around the world.  That is why the Government does not want the Bill to move forward or have the proposal for a referendum to be discussed or see the light of day.<\/p><p> The Bill needs to be changed and it would be interesting to see it being tweaked along the lines the Labour Party outlined.  I have concerns about the wording \"save without the assent of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann for participation in war zones\".  We have that already in what the Government calls the \"triple lock\".  In effect, it is a dual lock because all one needs is a UN resolution and then one has the Executive which controls the D&aacute;il anyway.  In effect, if the Executive goes for it, the D&aacute;il will go for it as well.  The triple lock is actually a dual lock and that is all we have in terms of protecting the citizens of the country and our neutrality.  The Government amendment states that the triple lock comes into play when it is proposed to deploy more than 12 military personnel.  It is interesting that we had 12 military personnel deployed in Afghanistan for the duration of that invasion there.  I wonder if the figure of 12 was useful because it meant that deployment did not have to be endorsed by the House; not that such an endorsement would have caused the Government a real problem other than the slight embarrassment of having to go through a vote on it.<\/p> <p> We should move forward with the Bill.  Obviously, Fianna F&aacute;il will combine with its coalition partner to defeat it, which is regrettable.  These Bills will keep coming forward and we will get to a situation where a Government on those benches will stand up for neutrality and place it in the Constitution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112400057#FFF00200","speaker":"1366","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1480012500,"counter":551,"content":"<p>I am disappointed but not surprised that Fine Gael and its partners in government, Fianna F&aacute;il, are rejecting the Bill.  In doing so, they remain true to form.  In the past, they have denied citizens the opportunity to vote in a referendum that would enshrine our neutrality in Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann.  The Minister's comments are not far removed from those of past and current Fine Gael Deputies who have been explicit in their contempt for Irish neutrality.  As far back as 2002, Fine Gael Deputy and later MEP Gay Mitchell spoke of his party's willingness to depart from neutrality and take part in an EU defence entity.  In 2012, the then Minister for Defence, Alan Shatter, stated that Irish neutrality was a principle of moral bankruptcy.  He was also explicit in his support for NATO which he said provided standards of excellence which are important with regard to missions in which we can participate.  As recently as 2015, the Minister of State, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, told the House that we were not a neutral country, that we never had been and that to say otherwise was ridiculous.  It just shows where they are coming from.<\/p>  <p>  Fianna F&aacute;il is equally responsible for undermining and discrediting our neutrality.  In justifying their rejection of our Bill twice in the past, Fianna F&aacute;il Ministers and Deputies spoke of their dedication to Ireland's policy of military neutrality.  Their contention that the Constitution already enshrines neutrality is simply not true.  The Bill makes it very clear that neutrality is not mentioned in the 1937 Constitution.  It only addresses foreign affairs powers indirectly.  While Article 29 contains a rhetorical comment on the ideals of peace, friendly co-operation and pacific settlement, nothing in that article obliges Ireland to be neutral or prohibits the Government of the day from departing from that policy.  That is why the supposed commitment of Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il to the peaceful resolution of international disputes belies the fact that they are the architects of policies which have resulted in successive Irish Governments aiding belligerents in war, most notably the USA.  In doing so, they have violated international laws on neutrality.<\/p>  <p>  Even more shameful has been the deafening silence during this debate from the Minister, Deputy Shane Ross, and Ministers of State, Deputies Finian McGrath and John Halligan, who in the past have been exceptionally vocal in their support for Irish neutrality and justifiably critical of past and present Governments' foreign policies.  When Deputy Crowe tabled this same Bill in 2014, the Minister, Deputy Ross, spoke of how Ireland was not a neutral nation but a neutered one.  He demanded that the then Government object to the use of Shannon Airport by the US military.  The Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, spoke of how Ireland was respected because of its independence and neutrality and as recently as August, the Minister of State, Deputy Halligan, castigated the Government for the US military's use of Shannon Airport, which he said made a mockery of Irish neutrality.  Unfortunately, they are not here tonight.  Reports in this week's media of a row during a meeting of the Cabinet when the Minister, Deputy Ross, and the Minister of State, Deputy McGrath, sought a free vote on the Bill do not hide the fact that if they do not vote for the Bill next week, they are capitulating to the Taoiseach's demand to toe the line.  In doing so, they have discredited themselves and undermined their past commitment to Irish neutrality.  I urge them to reconsider their position as, indeed, I urge the Government to vote in favour of the Bill when it comes before the House next Thursday.<\/p>  <p>  Most of the focus on Irish neutrality is the result of what has happened in Shannon where US planes land on a daily basis.  It is opportune to thank organisations like Shannonwatch, the Peace and Neutrality Alliance and others who have done great work to bring attention to this issue.  Many ordinary people across the country know what is going on and want it to end.  It is time the Government stood up and stopped it.<\/p>  <p>  The vote on the Bill is a test for those Deputies who believe in Irish independence and the sanctity of our neutrality and those who support the European superstate with a military to match.  If it is defeated, as it appears will happen, it will not be the end of our call for a referendum on neutrality.  However, it will be a black day for everyone who believes Ireland is truly neutral.  When the D&aacute;il finally votes on the Bill next Thursday, it is clear what the Government and its partners in Fianna F&aacute;il will do.  They will step out and say, \"We want a Europe which is a military superstate aided and abetted by the superpowers of the world\".  The example of that is what is going on at Shannon Airport on a daily basis.  Members of the Government can hang their heads in shame when they see what they are doing.  In reality, the Irish people will one day lift their heads high and support through a referendum the enshrining of neutrality in the Constitution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112400058#GGG00200","speaker":"1345"},{"type":"speech","time":1480012500,"counter":552,"content":"<p>I reiterate the opposition of the Government to the Bill.  Indeed, while I oppose the Bill strongly myself, I acknowledge that it has been valuable to have a debate.  In particular, I am grateful for the opportunity to make it perfectly clear that the Government remains committed to Ireland's long-standing policy of military neutrality.  During the last Government's term of office, this was reinforced again and again.  In my own Department, the statement on foreign policy, entitled \"A Global Island\" approved by the Government in January 2015, clearly states that our policy of military neutrality remains a core element of Irish foreign policy.  This was further reinforced in the ten-year strategy for defence policy set out in the White Paper on defence approved by the Government in July 2015 and committed to in the 2016 programme for partnership Government as set out in the amendment.  That makes clear the policy the Fine Gael Party has consistently pursued in government.  I brought the Global Island policy to Cabinet myself while my colleague, the then Minister for Defence, the Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney, brought the White Paper on defence to Cabinet as stated by the Minister of State, Deputy Paul Kehoe, earlier this evening.  In shaping these policies, we were operating in a robust constitutional and legal context.<\/p>  <p>  As is made clear in the Government's amendment, Article 29 of the Constitution provides a framework for our policy of military neutrality.  It commits the State to uphold the ideal of peace and friendly co-operation among nations and to the principle of pacific settlement of international disputes.  In respect of EU law, the Lisbon treaty contains a legally binding protocol negotiated by the Irish Government which recognises explicitly Ireland's traditional policy of military neutrality.  In terms of primary legislation, the Defence Acts provide for the triple lock which continues to govern the deployment of Irish Defence Forces personnel overseas.  It mandates that deployment for overseas peace support operations may only occur where the operation is mandated by the United Nations.  Deployment must also be approved by the Government.  If it is proposed to deploy more than 12 personnel, a D&aacute;il resolution must be approved.  The triple lock provides strong parliamentary oversight of the deployment of Defence Forces personnel.  Ireland's strong commitment to the policy of military neutrality is complemented by a strong commitment to the United Nations and its work around the world.  Irish troops participate in peacekeeping and, where necessary, peace enforcement around the world.<\/p><p>Our Defence Forces personnel have a well-deserved high reputation internationally for their contribution, which extends unbroken over more than 50 years.  We are all immensely proud of our peacekeepers.  As the House is aware, 573 Irish Defence Forces personnel are currently serving with UN missions in places of the most difficult and challenging conflict across the world.  If the provisions before us today were to be inserted into our Constitution, a question mark would be placed over whether Ireland could continue to fulfil its obligations to support UN-mandated actions, particular peace enforcement missions under Chapter 7 of the UN Charter.<\/p> <p> I submit that there is an even more fundamental point as to why this Bill should not be passed.  Being a member of the executive of any state is an immense responsibility.  It requires Ministers to take what are quite often difficult decisions in what they determine to be in the public interest at the time.  The fundamental responsibilities of the Executive branch of the Irish Government are clearly set out in Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann.  These are solemn duties to be discharged with care and diligence.  They are not to be lightly transferred to another branch of Government as an unattended consequence of an unnecessary constitutional amendment.  It would be wrong for the Executive to abdicate its responsibilities under Article 29 of Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann.  Moreover, in cases where the UN Security Council has adopted a resolution mandating action to maintain and restore international peace and security, all UN member states, including Ireland, may be obliged under the terms of the resolution to offer appropriate assistance.  This Bill could have the effect of constraining the ability of the Executive to fulfil these obligations.<\/p> <p> In other cases, a decision by the D&aacute;il to respond to a UN request for support could end up before the courts should the provision proposed in the Bill be inserted into the Constitution.  The grounds for challenging a decision of this nature would be considerably expanded by the Bill.  That goes to the heart of my opposition to it.<\/p> <p> The Constitution mandates that the Executive power of the State, in its external relations, is conferred on the Executive branch, not on the judicial branch or the courts.  These are the solemn duties and responsibilities of those of us who have the privilege of serving in government.  We take these responsibilities extremely seriously, as I know all Members of the Oireachtas take their responsibilities as elected representatives most seriously.<\/p> <p> There has been considerable comment on Shannon Airport.  I reject the assertion by Deputies that the use of the airport is in some way at odds with our long-standing policy of military neutrality.  The Government permits foreign military aircraft to land at Shannon Airport if, and only if, they comply with a series of conditions, including that they are unarmed, carry no arms or ammunition, do not engage in intelligence gathering and are not part of any military exercises or operations.  By any measure, these are conditions of the most strict nature and are imposed because of our military neutrality.<\/p> <p> Our policy on Shannon Airport has been in place under successive Governments for decades - almost as long, indeed, as our policy of military neutrality.  There is no incompatibility between the two policies.  I wish to stress that these conditions are applied to all landings of foreign military aircraft, including those from the United States of America.  That the largest numbers of applications are received from the US results from geographical factors.  We do not vary the conditions depending on the state from which an aircraft comes.  There is no favouritism as far as this is concerned.<\/p> <p> Ireland remains strictly neutral and objective in applying the same strict conditions to the use of our airport by military aircraft belonging to all member states.  Therefore, I am satisfied that Ireland's long-standing policy of military neutrality is efficiently safeguarded through existing constitutional provisions, the protocol of the Lisbon treaty, the Defence Acts and the long-term policy strategies adopted by Governments.  Moreover, the policy enjoys widespread public support and all democratically-elected Governments can only govern with the support of the people.<\/p> <p> I wish to thank all Members who contributed to the debate.  I reaffirm my opposition and that of the Government to the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112400058#GGG00300","speaker":"1233","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1480013100,"counter":554,"content":"<p>Gabhaim mo bhu&iacute;ochas leo si&uacute;d ar fad a bhain p&aacute;irt sa d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht seo agus go h&aacute;irithe iad si&uacute;d at&aacute; tar &eacute;is a l&eacute;iri&uacute; go dtabharfaidh siad taca&iacute;ocht d&uacute;inn nuair a bheidh an Bille seo os comhair na D&aacute;la an D&eacute;ardaoin seo chugainn.

I will return to some of the issues.  I do not know where the scriptwriters for Fine Gael Deputies, in particular, and Fianna F&aacute;il came from.  What was said was absolutely bonkers and out of touch with any reality.<\/p>  <p>  I was very interested in what the Labour Party and Deputy Pringle had to say in terms of the wording of the Bill.  I am fallible, as are we all.  I accept criticism and that the wording I proposed today could be changed.  Somebody might be better at developing wording that would stand up in the courts and more effectively capture what is intended by the Bill.<\/p>  <p>  Reference was made to the UN and whether we are even legally entitled to be in it, which is an interesting point.  I would like to see the full legal opinion which, I presume, the Labour Party received.  If that is a fact, it opens up the question of the Houses having to address our foreign policy and our role at the UN, and, therefore, the question of neutrality in a more urgent manner than has been the case heretofore.<\/p>  <p>  I want to thank, in particular, the Peace and Neutrality Alliance and Shannonwatch.  The Peace and Neutrality Alliance helped us put the wording together and circulated information to many parties over the years to try to ensure that military neutrality was contained and inserted into the Constitution.<\/p>  <p>  I will now turn to some of the bizarre comments that were made.  I have a copy of script from the Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe, who has left the House.  I do not know what the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, or the members of the former Fianna F&aacute;il Government think that US planes are doing in Shannon.  What the hell are the transport planes doing?  They are not bringing soldiers on holidays to Gibraltar or to wherever it is they go.  The planes landing in Shannon are military aircraft which never move from their bases unless they are involved in major operations or wars.  Any cursory look at their contents or the soldiers wearing combat uniforms who have been in the duty-free shop in Shannon Airport over the years would tell one exactly where they are coming from and where they are going.<\/p>  <p>  The history of extraordinary rendition is a sorry and disgusting one, particularly in the context of what has happened at Shannon and around the world.  It is scary that only this week the President-elect of the United States appointed Kansas Congressman Mike Pompeo as director of the CIA.  Mr. Pompeo is a supporter of the war on terror.  He openly opposed the closing of the CIA black sites that were used for torture, criticised the requirement that interrogators adhere to anti-torture laws and opposed the closure of the prison at Guantanamo Bay.  He also supported waterboarding and much worse.<\/p>  <p>  We are living in a new era.  In some ways, it is a case of back to the future. <\/p><p>It is, therefore, opportune that we would take the position that we now need a clearer statement of Ireland's military neutrality.<br\/><br\/>Irish neutrality goes a lot further back than the Second World War, as stated by the Minister of State, Deputy Paul Kehoe.  The Irish Neutrality League, of which James Connolly was a leading member, existed in 1914.  Even before that, way back in 1790, Wolfe Tone espoused neutrality in <i>The Spanish War<\/i>.  I suggest to the Minister that he read it.  He might then understand that the concept of military neutrality has been around for republicans for many years.<br\/><br\/>Fianna F&aacute;il stated that it believed military neutrality was a policy and not a status.  Given the flip-flopping over the weekend about its policy on Irish Water and water charges, we see that a policy can be changed overnight.  However, a constitution cannot.  I, therefore, believe that we should properly enshrine military neutrality in the Constitution in order that it stands the test of time and cannot be changed willy-nilly by a Government.  The flexibility that the Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe, decried would be lost is exactly what we want to prevent.  We do not want a Government such as the Minister's, as has happened in the past, riding roughshod over the policy.<br\/><br\/>This is not a neutered policy but a positive one that looks to ensure positive action.  It allows us to protect ourselves, but it should also allow us to promote peace around the world and the UN.  It should not allow us to undermine it by aligning ourselves with military groupings in Europe and those who were previously imperialists and are now hankering after the empire they once had.<br\/><br\/>The Minister denied any militarisation was happening and the Fianna F&aacute;il representative stated that military expenditure had reduced.  Given the European Defence Agency's stated policy that we have to increase the capacity of all EU military apparatus, I cannot see how those assertions stand up.  Further, that the EU has just committed itself to a &euro;4 billion subsidy towards military research also contradicts those assertions in their totality.<br\/><br\/>I ask that Deputies on all sides of the House, in the next week, before the vote is held, look at the wording we are seeking to be inserted in the Constitution.  Why are those Members afraid of allowing the people debate these words, form their own view and decide whether to insert it them in the Constitution?  Other referendums could also happen on that day.  The people could make the choice.  I trust the people on the issue.  I remember standing with more than 100,000 people on the streets of Dublin when they opposed the illegal war in Iraq.  We are proposing to insert these words: &quot;War shall not be declared and the State shall not participate in any war or other armed conflict, nor aid foreign powers in any way in preparation for war or other armed conflict, or conduct of war or other armed conflict, save with the assent of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.&quot;  Those words recognise the primacy of this House in setting laws.<br\/><br\/>We are not proposing the deletion of articles in the Constitution, so the triple lock, as some call it, and other provisions dealing with international relations would still stand.  However, to me, this is the key provision:<\/p><blockquote>Ireland affirms that it is a neutral state.  To this end the State shall, in particular, maintain a policy of non-membership of military alliances.<\/blockquote><p>That is required so that we do not have a repeat of the summary of Mr. Justice Kearns on the position:<\/p><blockquote>Despite the great historic value attached by Ireland to the concept of neutrality, that status is nowhere reflected in Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann, or elsewhere in ... domestic legislation.  It is effectively a matter of government policy only, albeit a policy to which, traditionally at least, considerable importance was attached.<\/blockquote><p>Stick it in the Constitution.  Allow the public the right to accept or reject the proposal.  Do not be afraid of the public.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112400059#HHH00200","speaker":"1305","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1480013700,"counter":556,"content":"<p>Amendment put.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1480013700,"counter":557,"content":"<p>In accordance with an order of the D&aacute;il on Tuesday, 22 November, the division is postponed until the weekly division time on Thursday, 1 December 2016.<\/p><p>Leis sin, t&aacute; gn&oacute; na seachtaine cr&iacute;ochnaithe.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112400060#JJJ00300","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1480013700,"counter":558,"content":"<p>The D&aacute;il adjourned at at 7.45 p.m. until 2 p.m. on Tuesday, 29 November 2016.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
