The 2019 Appropriation Account for Vote 34 Housing, Planning and Local Government records gross expenditure of &euro;3.96 billion. The appropriation account is presented under five programme headings.  Some &euro;2.37 billion, or almost 60% of the total, was spent on a wide range of schemes that together constitute the housing programme.  A further &euro;1.29 billion, or just under one third of the total, was spent on the water services programme, and comprises mainly payments to Irish Water.  Just under &euro;211 million was spent on the local government programme.  Some &euro;68 million was spent on the planning programme.  And just under &euro;28 million was spent on Met &Eacute;ireann.<\/p> <p>  The surplus at the year-end was &euro;40.1 million.  Of this, &euro;33.5 million related to unspent capital allocations associated with the planning programme which were carried forward to 2020.  I issued a clear audit opinion on the account.  However, I drew attention to the disclosures in the statement on internal financial control as to some non-compliant procurement by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage during the year.<\/p> <p>  The Local Government Fund is managed separately from the Vote, by the Department.  There have been a number of changes in the source of funding for the fund in recent years. It is now funded by the proceeds of the local property tax, or LPT, and a transfer from the Vote.  In 2019, LPT receipts into the fund amounted to &euro;473 million.  This was down marginally from the level of receipts in 2018.  The transfer to the fund from the Vote in 2019 amounted to &euro;185 million.  This was up by &euro;60 million, or 48%, year on year.  Total receipts were &euro;658 million.  The fund expenditure in 2019 amounted to &euro;644 million.  The bulk of this was accounted for by transfers to local authorities.  At the end of December 2019, the fund&rsquo;s reserves stood at just under &euro;99 million.  Again, I issued a clear audit opinion also as to the fund account.<\/p> <p>  Because of the complex ways that central Government funds flow to individual local authorities, chapter 2 is compiled each year to present an overview of the level and purpose of the funding provided.  The chapter also outlines the oversight of local authorities&rsquo; financial performance by the Department, the Local Government Audit Service and the National Oversight and Audit Commission.<\/p> <p>  In 2019, transfers of funding from central Government sources to local authorities amounted to a total of &euro;4.17 billion &ndash; an increase of 13% from 2018 funding.  More than 90% of the central Government funding for local authorities came from three sources: Vote 34; the Local Government Fund; and Vote 31 for Transport, Tourism and Sport.  Of the total of &euro;4.17 billion central Government funding, almost &euro;2.4 billion was provided to local authorities for housing and regeneration.  A further &euro;882 million was provided for transport investment.<\/p> <p>  I will introduce the chapters which are the focus of tomorrow's meeting in advance of that meeting tomorrow.

Together, we will work in discussing the expenditure and activity of the Department in 2019 with the committee.<\/p> <p>  Despite not being present in the Department for the period under examination, I have very carefully examined all of the areas of activity and expenditure.  I recognise that the Department had a very substantial work programme in 2019 and delivered on a range of key policies and programmes.  I will not go through every area of expenditure but will touch on the key areas briefly.<\/p> <p>  As requested by the committee, I have provided some advance briefing for the meeting and also a copy of this opening statement.<\/p> <p>  The Department&rsquo;s gross expenditure in 2019, as set out in the appropriation account before the committee today, totalled some &euro;3.9 billion.  I will start by welcoming the work of the Comptroller and Auditor General, and, in particular, on the four chapters which will be examined over the course of this evening and tomorrow.  I recognise and appreciate the value of this work in the context of enhancing the outward demonstration not only to this committee but to the public in general of the important work that is done in my Department and the value we put on transparency and accountability.  As with previous recommendations, we will continue to evolve and mature our systems and reporting to align with best practice wherever possible.<\/p> <p>  The focus of the Department&rsquo;s 2019 activity in the area of housing was led by the actions set out in the six year Rebuilding Ireland: Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness.  The year, 2019, represented the fourth full year of activity under the plan and a milestone year in terms of social housing delivery.  The Department&rsquo;s gross voted expenditure on housing programmes, as set out in the appropriation account, totalled some &euro;2.365 billion in 2019.  A further &euro;92.6 million was available from local property tax receipts to fund housing programmes of certain local authorities whose LPT allocation exceeded their funding baseline, bringing the overall total resourcing for the Department&rsquo;s housing programmes to almost &euro;2.5 billion in 2019.<\/p> <p>  Social housing delivery represents a large proportion of expenditure under the housing programme.  Delivery is achieved through the main headings of build, acquisition, leasing, housing assistance payment, HAP, and the rental accommodation scheme, RAS.  Within these headings there are multiple sub-delivery vehicles, all working in parallel to achieve the optimum outcome for Exchequer investment.<\/p> <p>  To understand why the Department relies on both capital and current structures for social housing delivery, it is important to refresh our minds on the context of the Rebuilding Ireland social housing targets.  These were developed in response to the recommendations of the Oireachtas Committee on Housing and Homelessness in 2016.  That committee indicated that the local authority and approved housing bodies stock available for social housing should be increased by some 50,000 homes, but also recognised that the ability of the State to meet the cost of responding to the need for social housing was hampered by the application of domestic and EU fiscal rules.  In addition to this, the need for immediate, mid-term and long-term delivery had to be taken into account and the range of programmes that are now in place seek to harness the maximum delivery possible by deploying the maximum current and capital funding available.<\/p> <p>  Appendix 1, which I have circulated in the briefing paper, sets out the key targets for the period 2016 to 2021 and details the progress that had been made to the end of 2019.  In overall terms, housing supports were delivered to over 28,000 households in 2019, just ahead of the target.  Cumulatively, since 2016 more than 100,000 additional households had received a social housing support, and social housing waiting lists dropped by 25%.<\/p> <p>  Build activity increased year on year, with new build activity - excluding returning vacant local authority dwellings to active use under the voids programme - growing almost ten-fold between 2015 and 2019.<\/p> <p>  The quarterly Social Housing Construction Status Report showed an increase from 8,430 homes in the programme overall at various stages of development at end 2016 to some 26,015 homes at end 2019.  Local authority-led new-build activity also grew significantly over the period.  The number of local authority-led projects increased from 290 schemes representing 4,820 homes at end 2016 to almost 700 schemes representing almost 11,000 homes by the end of 2019, and this continues to grow.  This excludes local authority turnkey schemes, which accounted for 3,860 homes in the programme at end 2019.<\/p> <p>  Wider housing supply also continued to grow in 2019 with the number of new homes becoming available for use in the full year reaching 24,394, a 14% increase on 2018.<\/p><p>While what I have set out reflects some of the positive indicators and increasing provision of social housing, we are keenly aware of the substantial work that remains to be done.  The number of homeless households supported into more sustainable housing increased by 16% last year, however the challenge remains in making substantial and sustainable inroads into reducing the net numbers reliant on emergency accommodation and services, and we continue to absolutely prioritise working with housing authorities and NGOs.  Prevention is just as critical as developing pathways for exits.<\/p><p> Across all areas we will be unrelenting in our commitment to achieve the best outcome for citizens using the resources provided to us by the Exchequer.  The new programme for Government seeks to place even more demanding ambition on delivery to be achieved in the years ahead and rising to meet this ambition will be the cornerstone of social housing activity for my Department.<\/p><p> The 2020 provision for housing amounts to nearly &euro;2.7 billion, including local property tax receipts, the majority of which will be concentrated on supporting over 27,500 additional households across all our social housing delivery streams and those already in a support.  Like many sectors, the impact of Covid-19 has been very challenging for the Department and its stakeholders, however we continue to push for maximum feasible delivery across all streams.  As we move into 2021, a provision of over &euro;3.3 billion will be available for the housing programme.  This represents the largest ever investment in housing and will support implementation of the ambitions in the programme for Government with a particular focus on increasing supply through new build activity. <\/p><p> I will now turn to water services. The past decade has seen a significant period of reform in the approach to the delivery of water services and the promotion of wider environmental protection.  As the committee is aware, responsibility for the provision of public water services transferred from local authorities to Irish Water on 1 January 2014.  Irish Water is now firmly established as the national public water utility and has brought a new coherent approach to the delivery of water services investment and management.<\/p><p> While the Government&rsquo;s voted Exchequer investment in Irish Water is substantial, with &euro;1.2 billion in the accounts before the committee today for 2019, and &euro;1.3 billion for 2020 and 2021, there remain significant infrastructure deficits to be dealt with and it is critical that we maintain a high level of investment in the sector in order to achieve compliance but also to support national housing and regional development objectives.  In terms of our rural water programme, in 2019 some &euro;41.1 million was provided across both capital and current funding structures.  Certainty for priority investment has been put in place through a multi-annual capital programme, aimed at improving the reliability and efficiency of rural water services infrastructure. <\/p><p> On local government, members will be aware that the Local Government Fund, LGF, is a special central fund established in 1999 under the Local Government Act 1998.  The profile of income and expenditure of the Local Government Fund has undergone significant changes in recent years.  Income, which historically comprised motor tax income along with some payments from the Exchequer, is now comprised of income from the Exchequer and, since 2014, local property tax.  The Government decides the expenditure from the Local Government Fund each year as part of the budgetary process.  As the chapter shows, transfers of funding from central government sources to local authorities in 2019 totalled some &euro;4.17 billion, an increase of 13% on 2018.  The Local Government Fund accounted for 15% of this amount.  A number of Departments, including my own Department and the Department of Transport, as well as other agencies, are involved in providing this annual funding to local authorities.  The Local Government Fund account for 2019 gives details of the operation of the fund during the year.  The income sources to the fund totalled &euro;658 million, made up of local property tax receipts of &euro;473 million and a payment of &euro;185 million from the Exchequer, through the Department&rsquo;s vote.<\/p><p> The main payments from the LGF in 2019 were: local property tax allocations to local authorities of &euro;503 million; an allocation in respect of local authority pay and pensions costs of &euro;86 million; an allocation of &euro;47 million in respect of compensation in respect of rates previously paid on water infrastructure; and an allocation of just under &euro;1 million to support the implementation of the Creative Ireland programme at local level.<\/p><p> With regard to chapter 2, which has been prepared by the Comptroller and Auditor General, the Department welcomes the work undertaken to provide such a comprehensive overview of the structures and the funding flow, and the complexity of same.  The chapter also sets out the scale and levels of scrutiny and accountability that have been put in place to ensure appropriate levels of oversight, including through the Local Government Audit Service and the National Oversight and Audit Commission.<\/p><p> As for other programme areas, further areas of expenditure set out in the 2019 appropriation account include, in the planning area, meeting the costs of An Bord Plean&aacute;la of &euro;18.5 million, as well as Met &Eacute;ireann costs of &euro;28 million.  Since the establishment of the new Government this year, my Department has also taken on responsibility for the heritage division and while not covered in today&rsquo;s examination, I look forward to updating members in due course on the wide range of activities supported by expenditure in that area. <\/p><p> Before I conclude, I will make some short remarks regarding my Department&rsquo;s activity in 2020.  While not the subject of today&rsquo;s meeting, and I look forward to meeting members in due course to discuss expenditure, it has been an exceptionally challenging year for all sectors.  I am immensely proud of the responsive and proactive manner in which the Civil Service has acted in response to this pandemic and for the collegiate and practical collaboration with political colleagues during a never-before-seen set of circumstances, starting with the election in February.  I came to this Department a very short time ago, in the midst of the pandemic, and saw at first hand the scale of activity and responsiveness.  The Department, its agencies and our partners for delivery, including the NGO and approved housing body sectors, have given of themselves tirelessly to achieve the best for those we serve and I formally acknowledge that here today.  In particular our local authorities, with whom members will all have played their own part, have demonstrated the true value of public service through the Community Call and other critical supports deployed at local level.  At all times, the Department has continued to advocate for local government at a national level and will continue to do so, in recognition of the absolutely critical nature of the local authorities.<\/p><p> The matters I have referred to illustrate well the broad range of programmes and activities for which the Department had responsibility in 2019.  I and my colleagues will be happy to respond to questions or issues that emerge in the course of the committee&rsquo;s work today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2020112500002#B00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Graham Doyle","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1606321800,"counter":20,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Doyle.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2020112500002#C00200","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speech","time":1606321800,"counter":21,"content":"<p>I welcome our witnesses, those before us and those joining us remotely.

I thank the Deputy for his comments also.<\/p> <p>  In 2019 just over 10,000 social homes were delivered through build, acquisition and leasing schemes.  That was pretty much exactly in line with the target of 10,000 for that year.  Of these, 6,074 were homes built through the different programmes implemented by local authorities and the approved housing bodies.  That was an increase of about 20% on the build activity of the previous year.  Including the housing assistance payment, HAP, and rental accommodation scheme, RAS, activity that is just over 28,000 social homes provided for families and individuals in 2019, against a target of almost 27,400.  That was 3% over target.  This was on the back of a record level of public investment of &euro;2.4 billion in 2019 to support the delivery of housing programmes.  Almost &euro;1.5 billion was on build, acquisition and lease, which breaks down as &euro;836 million for build, &euro;496 million for acquisition and &euro;150 million for lease.  The 6,074 built social housing units that are referred to break down as 2,271 local authority new build units; 2,174 approved housing body new build units; and 1,326 Part V units.

We are increasing the level of direct build and that will continue forward into next year.  For example, next year we are looking at a direct build programme of 9,500.  We are seeking to increase that and to change the mix in terms of delivery across the programme, which is challenging.  There is no question but that as we ramp that up, we are going to have to play a very careful role around local authority delivery and through the other streams as well.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the concerns about construction activity in this year that have been mentioned, there is no denying that time was lost around that.  We work closely with the local authorities.  I think the housing delivery co-ordination office is playing a really strong role at this point in time in working with each local authority and the other stakeholders to try to maximise delivery this year and into next year.  Just trying to minimise the impact of that delay, and looking at the construction status report for quarter 2, it showed us that delivery was below target, obviously, at that stage.  There were almost 1,500 built, acquired or leased homes at that point of the year.  They cycle of delivery, which has surprised me in terms of coming to the Department and I would have really expected delivery across a year, but it does actually get back-ended, just the cycle tends to get back-ended, into the latter part of the year.  That profile for completion in quarter 4, heavily weighted towards quarter 4, is there.  We are hopeful that we will get much of what we sought to deliver this year and the numbers are relatively encouraging.

Over the course of the past four years, 1,132 schemes have been completed, so in respect of the projects one would see listed in the appropriation account, there is a range of projects and they move through the various stage of the pipeline.  Things can fall over various years.  One of the interesting things that the Deputy has raised is about the build.  If one looks at the expenditure on build over the last number of years, in 2016, when we started to develop the pipeline, the spend on build was in the order of &euro;170 million and, in 2019, we spent &euro;835 million on build.  That shows the growth of the pipeline.<\/p> <p>  One of the things, in terms of delivery also, has been the blend of delivery.  One of the things that we have tried to do, in terms of delivery and it is reflected in the expenditure, is to maximise the amount of homes that we actually deliver through the various different schemes whether it be build, acquisition or leasing.

The needs-and-resources model was developed around 2000 and ran until 2008.  It involved 600 layers of data being analysed every year.  It was quite an inefficient process in terms of allocating local government funding.  However, the current baselines in operation were essentially set at 2014 levels.  No additional general-purpose funding through local property tax has been brought into that system since then, although they were adjusted marginally in 2017.

There are properties where windows have to be nailed shut, and doors one could put a finger through.  Local authority management have said they are starved of funding.

I raised this issue when I was a councillor.  The house is built by the local authority with taxpayer money.  A tenant lives in it for 30 to 40 years and then buys it out under a tenant purchase scheme.  The house might subsequently be bought by an individual who turned out to be a small-time - in some cases, big-time - landlord.  The tenant renting the house would get rent supplement or HAP.  The taxpayer was effectively subsiding the rent for a house which the taxpayer built.  There is a 20-year rule which can be applied.  The county council of which I was a member did not apply it.  It is an issue which needs to be nailed down.<\/p> <p>  There are several ways the Department does long-term leasing which includes Part V housing.  About a third of these are lease-to-buy, meaning the local authority would own the unit after 25 years.  Then there is lease-to-lease which is the greater number, two thirds.  The local authority leases these units under a long-term lease but never gets to own them.  After 25 years, it has to start all over again.<\/p> <p>  D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, for example, pays &euro;2,300 a month per apartment under this scheme.  The cost of that over 30 years would come to &euro;828,000 for an apartment.  A cost-to-build unit on public land would come to one quarter of that.  This does not make sense.  Where is the logic in that approach?  Dublin City Council will enter into a deal on former RT&Eacute; lands in Donnybrook which will come to &euro;521,000 for a two-bed apartment and &euro;472,000 for a one-bed.  That lease is astronomical.<\/p> <p>  Can anything be done by the Department to ensure value for money?

It is not always easy to compare the unitary cost of a lease like that with other delivery mechanisms.  We have to look at the availability of alternatives in that area, particularly in a local authority where land is constrained and its own construction programme is operating in parallel but also at a cost.<\/p> <p>  The lease costs have other elements to them which are not immediately visible and not comparable with the construction, notably management, maintenance and the long-term management of the tenant within the unit.  There are outliers relating to more expensive units but there are other schemes progressing at more normal prices in the market.  It is a market-rent driven scheme.  The leases paid for are not above market rent and a discount is secured on the market rent as part of the contract.

The problem is that it is a lot of money going down a big hole.  Up to &euro;2,300 a month to rent an apartment is an astronomical spend, even in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown.  In terms of social housing delivery, I am in favour of the integration of social housing with private.  I have argued for it over the years.  When I was chair of my local authority SPC, strategic policy committee, I pushed it hard.<\/p> <p>  Up to 70% of new builds for local authorities and approved housing bodies were turnkeys.  There is an argument that this takes away from private housing stock in that if an approved housing body buys units in a development, it leaves fewer for first-time buyers trying to get a starter home.<\/p><p>The cost of these homes appears astronomical.  Figures supplied by the Department show that the cost to build such a unit in Fingal is estimated to be &euro;209,000 while a turnkey unit costs &euro;412,000.  In Dublin city, the cost to build an apartment is &euro;181,000 while the cost of a turnkey apartment was &euro;382,000 in 2019.  It is more a case of breaking even in rural areas in that turnkey accommodation can be bought for roughly the same amount as it would cost to build.  By any standard, these turnkey developments represent an excessive cost.  To return to the issue of leasing under Part V, in many cases developers have the option to lease 10% of units rather than allowing the local authority to buy between 10% and 20% of them at a discounted rate, as was the case under the old system.  That is where many of the leases are getting caught.

All I see in my constituency are long leases.  Properties are leased for 25 years at 90% of market rent with reviews at four-year intervals.  That is in cases where the maintenance is done.  When the maintenance is not covered, 80% of market rent is paid.  At the end of that period, the property is still owned by the developer.  I cannot see where the housing stock is going to come from in future.  All I see are the housing assistance payment, HAP, and long leases.  I could point the witnesses to six such developments being acquired under long leases, some of which are replacing units that were expected to be purchased under Part V.  Other whole estates are completed and it is expected that they are going to go on the market.  People tell me that they were waiting in the hope that they could stay in the area in which they grew up, where these are the only developments under way, only to find that, all of a sudden, these units are to be put out under long leases of 25 years.  I cannot see how value for money could possibly be achieved in that way.

I hear that developers are encouraged to suggest this option to the local authority.  That encouragement must be coming from the Department if that is the case.  Perhaps the mix in my area is different from that in others because I do not believe the local authority in my constituency owns any land which is designated for housing, but how can this be considered good value for money?  HAP is another issue.  Since 2014, I have been giving out about HAP and about how it is not a short-term measure and was the only measure available for a long time.  We have spent an absolute fortune on these measures which deliver no permanent assets and, in the case of HAP, do not deliver any certainty either.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2020112500002#K01000","speaker":"1489"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1606321800,"counter":171,"content":"<p>The system is moving towards building more accommodation.

I am back to An Bord Plean&aacute;la's insistence in some instances of usurping the local development plan and insisting on 35 dwellings per hectare, and in rural areas particularly, which means a mix of apartments and a mix of houses.  Essentially, one cannot build the apartment for less than one can sell it for.  Those developments, therefore, do not go ahead.  To my mind, to the developers' minds and to the minds of the people who are looking for housing this is not solving our housing problem.  It is creating it.  We may have lots of applications and lots of planning granted but the significant issue is that they are not viable at 35 dwellings per hectare in areas where apartments are just not suitable.  Rural and small towns in Ireland do not have the infrastructure.  It is a bit chicken and egg.  We need to put the infrastructure in to allow people to travel by train to these areas, or some other form of transport in order that they are not just the ghettos of the future.  This is why they are not being built.  That is the difficulty I have.  We need to see where An Bord Plean&aacute;la is coming up with this.  It is not in the guidelines, it is not anywhere.  I have raised this in the D&aacute;il.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la is doing it persistently and it is preventing housing stock from increasing because the development of housing stock is not going ahead.  The grant for planning may be there but it is not viable on the basis of 35 dwellings per hectare.

I pass on my appreciation and that of my party to everyone concerned.<\/p> <p>  The opening remarks of the Comptroller and Auditor General referred to the &euro;3.9 billion expenditure of our witnesses' Department.  Am I correct in saying &euro;2.5 billion of this was spent on housing?  My initial questions are on housing, and I have a number of them.  I think I heard Ms Hurley mention that in 2019 there were 20,809 homes in pre-development stage, or it may have been Ms Ryan who said that earlier on.  As to those nearly 21,000 homes at pre-development stage, under what kind of schemes are those homes being developed under?  Can I get a snapshot of those, please?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2020112500002#M00600","speaker":"1481"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1606321800,"counter":223,"content":"<p>I do not know if the Deputy is familiar with the construction status report that is published on a quarterly basis but there are two tables, appendixes 1 and 2, in the foreword to that, which break down all of the projects, not only by category of development - that is approved housing body, AHB or whatever - but also by the status of development.<\/p> <p>  As to the current pipeline, which is at 29,810 units, 2,945 are at stage 1, 1,981 are at stage 2, 998 are at stage 3, 3,160 are at stage 4, and 8,529 are on site.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2020112500002#M00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Marguerite Ryan"},{"type":"speech","time":1606321800,"counter":224,"content":"<p>I refer to the make up of those units.

The 2016 report was an expert examination of legal protections for workers with a particular focus on ways of ensuring limited liability and corporate restructuring are not used to avoid a company's obligations to its employees.  The examination looks specifically at situations where assets of significant value are separated from the operating entity, being the employer, and how the position of employees can be better protected in such situations.<\/p> <p>  Recently, we heard from the authors of the report, Ms Nessa Cahill and Mr. Kevin Duffy.  To assist the committee in its further consideration of this matter, I am pleased to welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Damien English, on his first visit to our committee.  The Minister of State's opening statement has been circulated to members.<\/p> <p>  Before the Minister of State begins, I will explain parliamentary privilege to members.

It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.

I will address the committee on my own behalf and that of the Minister of State, Deputy Robert Troy, as we both work in this area in relation to the review of Duffy Cahill report and the other necessary discussion and debate around insolvency and redundancy.<\/p> <p>  The committee invited me to discuss the implementation of the Duffy Cahill expert report.  I understand the committee recently discussed the report with the experts themselves and that was a worthwhile discussion, which I have had a chance to review.  The work of the committee is very timely because our Department has been going through a similar process over the past few months and weeks, which we hope to finish by December.  We are very happy to engage further with the committee over the next month and to consider its finding and deliberations.<\/p> <p>  I am also very much aware of the backdrop of these discussions with the situation Debenhams workers find themselves in following the liquidation of that company.  I am highly sympathetic to the plight of those workers.  However, I must make it clear that the Duffy Cahill report was drafted in a completely different context and to the best of my knowledge, the Debenhams situation is not comparable to the scenario that gave rise to the Duffy Cahill report and its recommendations.<\/p> <p>  I note that Ms Cahill and Mr. Duffy set out the context and the parameters of the terms of reference for that report, which were quite narrow and specific.  The specific scenario the report aims to address is where assets of a significant value are separated from the employer company, also known as the operating company, and where the employer company subsequently enters into liquidation.  The purpose of the recommendations is to better protect employees in circumstances whereby corporate restructuring is availed of in an effort to avoid the company having to meet its obligation to its employees.  The authors themselves emphasised that the recommendations are not based on the specific facts of any particular liquidation.  It is also very important to bear in mind that the report&rsquo;s recommendations address a very hypothetical and highly unusual situation and do not address the generality of redundancies that arise in insolvency situations.  <\/p> <p>  The report contained six proposals that the authors assert could potentially protect the interests of employees in circumstances where assets of significant value are separated, or where the separation of the assets is being contemplated, from the operating entity, that is, the employer body. These proposals include amending various sections of the Protection of Employment Act 1977 to ensure that employees will have the opportunity to consult with their employer for a period of not less than 30 days before key collective redundancy can take effect, whether the employer is insolvent or not.  It proposes provisions to ensure that a related person must notify the employer if he or she is considering any action regarding an asset of significance that may result in collective redundancies, the possibility of injunction applications in certain circumstances, the provision of enhanced redundancy payments, and a mechanism for recovering an asset or proceeds of an asset in circumstances where the transfer of the asset had the effect of perpetrating a fraud on the employees.<\/p><p>This is dealt with in company law but we also have to examine why the various remedies are not being used by creditors, their representatives or the State in some cases.<br\/><br\/>The authors stress that the proposals made need to be considered in conjunction with each other, as no one proposal alone will provide solutions to the narrow focus in question.  The experts also opined that the success of any proposal to deter or address what are sometimes called tactical insolvencies will be heavily dependent on the use that is made of existing statutory provisions, including sanctions.  This is something on which we are focusing our work.  Part of our work now is to research why existing statutory remedies have not been availed of in certain circumstances and we are examining if there are better ways to enhance workers' rights in these situations.<br\/><br\/>There was a previous public consultation on this report, but no consensus was reached among the stakeholders in support of the implementation of these recommendations.  This was largely due to the very narrow focus in which the recommendations were made.  In our work, we are examining the report and other areas to see whether we can strengthen the measures.<br\/><br\/>As things stand, company law and employment rights governing redundancy situations arising from corporate insolvencies fall under the remit of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and officials are working together on the various cross-cutting policy issues that have been identified.  This is why Ms Coogan and her colleagues who are working on this in the Department are with me.  The Duffy Cahill recommendations concerning employment law, and other considerations relating to company law, are being revisited by, respectively, officials in consultation with stakeholders, and by the Company Law Review Group.  The Minister of State, Deputy Robert Troy, who has responsibility for company law, and I have initiated a process with union and employer representatives to establish what would make a real difference to employees who find themselves in a redundancy situation due to company insolvency.  There are no quick solutions but we are working to find consensus around where any gaps might be and I would welcome any observation the committee has.  I am very happy to take on board its work from these sessions.<br\/><br\/>The issues we are looking at and focusing on, including the Duffy Cahill recommendations, are employees' access to information concerning the company&rsquo;s financial situation, consultation periods, employees' rights as creditors, asset transfer, the treatment of collective agreements in insolvencies, and the establishment of a stand-alone fund to handle <i>ex gratia<\/i>payments in insolvency situations<br\/><br\/>I firmly believe that it is important to ensure we have the most appropriate legislative infrastructure in place to ensure every worker's rights are protected in a redundancy process while recognising there are redundancies that arise in different corporate contexts.  Some redundancies are about securing the company's survival while others, unfortunately, happen in the context of the company closing its doors for good.  It is my aim and that of the Minister of State, Deputy Troy, and the Minister, to amend legislative provisions where an improvement is required and where it is workable and effective.  The key part we are working on is what we can do that is workable and would be effective and would enhance the situation.<br\/><br\/>It is also important to note that any employee who is in insurable employment, regardless of whether the employer can afford to pay the statutory redundancy entitlement, is protected by the Social Insurance Fund.  The persons seated in this room understand this challenge better than others.  The State cannot create a system whereby one worker is treated more favourably than another worker in a similar situation.  This theme also ran through the Duffy Cahill report.  What we bring forward has to work for everybody and has to be fair and implementable.<br\/><br\/>With regard to the timing of today's session, this is an area we will work on in the coming weeks and months and I am happy to engage with the committee at a later stage, as is the Minister of State, Deputy Troy, when appropriate, to tease out some of the changes we propose to make.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2020112500002#B00300","speaker":"1505","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1606262400,"counter":267,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State and thank him for his submission.

They are two very different scenarios.  In the first case, where the company still exists, the workers have somebody to negotiate with.  There is a massive difference between the two cases.  In the case of Debenhams the company shut its doors.  I note Congress put a proposal to the Minister of State.  I do not mean this disrespectfully in any way but I get absolutely no sense of urgency from the Government or the Department on this and I hope he will convince me that I am wrong.<\/p> <p>  In the letter on 31 August, a proposal was put to him.  It makes reference to what was in the Minister of State's submission - that the lockdown denied the Debenhams workers the opportunity to vindicate their rights because of the circumstances.  Senator Gavan and I, and others, have experience of prosecuting a dispute.  I have never had to do it in a pandemic and I cannot imagine how it would be done.  Everything has to stop.  What work has been done on the proposal put by the most senior ranking trade union official in the State?  What thought was given to it?  What work has been done on looking into it?  If it is a case that it will not work, that can be explained to us.  If it is being examined, the Minister of State might bring us up to date on where it is at.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2020112500002#C00200","speaker":"1467"},{"type":"speech","time":1606262400,"counter":268,"content":"<p>There have been a few letters going to and fro on the details of the potential of doing it.  It was also raised at one of the Labour Employer Economic Forum meetings.  As soon as we had the transfer of functions to cover employment law and company law, the Minister of State, Deputy Troy, and I brought together a number of stakeholders to discuss a range of ideas, similar to what the committee is doing.  It is a worthwhile exercise.  We examined some of the recommendations in the Duffy Cahill report and suggestions others put forward, including one on a fund that could be put in place.<\/p> <p>  Reference was made to a fund in other countries and it is something we have are researching.  I have asked for all those suggesting a similar approach to forward to me any evidence they have on how successful it has been and where it has worked.  The Department is also engaging.  We are looking at a number of issues.  The question that has to be teased out goes back to what the Duffy Cahill report states on whether there are two types of people who end up redundant with two sets of entitlements.<\/p> <p>  The fund would set aside money or would draw on the Social Insurance Fund to pay out for collective agreements, which are above the statutory rights on redundancy.  If we are to go down that road, and we are very open to looking at all of this, the question will be who pays into the fund or how we charge for it.  Will it be through increased PRSI or a draw on the Social Insurance Fund?  Will we consider a voluntary fund whereby those companies and employees who have agreed to additional terms of employment would be in a position to separate moneys to fund it in the future?  These are the questions we are teasing out with the stakeholders and we are asking for views on this.<\/p> <p>  We will come to a conclusion on this when we finish our work, hopefully during December.  I am happy to re-engage with the committee on this.  I would also welcome the views of the committee on who would pay into the fund and who would draw from it.  I understand the proposal is very much that those with a collective agreement, whereby in the event of redundancy they would have extra payouts above the statutory entitlement, would draw on the fund.  As part of this discussion we have said that if we go down that road there will need to be greater transparency on collective agreements.

The primary issue concerns the consultation period, the secondary issue concerns this hiding of assets and a third issue is collective deals for the future.  As for the first, the issue of making it obligatory to have consultation in an insolvency, is there consensus on this being a correct way forward?  It seems reasonable to me that there should be consultation in an insolvency.  I know there are some things to be tidied up, such as the issue of not trading while insolvent and so on, but I think it can be done.<\/p> <p>  The secondary issue concerns the hiding of assets.  Mr. Duffy and Ms Cahill are obviously not going to give evidence on a particular case, but is there any consensus as to whether Debenhams concealed assets?  I know there has been a lot of argumentation, but have lawyers on different sides established whether assets have been fraudulently put away in order to prevent workers getting their entitlement?<\/p> <p>  The third question concerns recommendation 6.  Have I misunderstood it?  My understanding is that what the recommendation says is that a collective deal which could involve more than statutory redundancy could become a burden on an insolvency fund but only if the employer had failed to undertake his or her obligations to consult.  The difficulty I have is that I can see how this can be argued, but does applying it in the Debenhams case, where there was no law obliging the company to consult at the time, not create a real problem?  Even if we introduce this, one cannot retrospectively create an obligation on the company to have consulted.  At the time it was the law that it did not have to consult, so that trigger requires a change in two areas of law which raise a retrospective issue here because one cannot change the law in respect of an obligation on a company, even if the State were to undertake certain responsibilities in that situation.<\/p> <p>  My last question concerns the proposal being considered by the Department to create some sort of fund in respect of which we do not know how contributions to it will be made.  Is it to cover collective agreements in every case or solely in cases of companies that have failed in respect of some specific legal obligation?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2020112500002#D02500","speaker":"1549"},{"type":"speech","time":1606262400,"counter":300,"content":"<p>I will try to answer the Deputy's questions as best I can.

There is a general sense, certainly in our Department, that we may be able to strengthen the position in this area.  There are two consequences to that.  The Deputy is right that one of the consequences involves the director's responsibilities in continuing to trade in such a situation for those 30 days when it is effectively insolvent.  This needs to be teased out and could result in other serious complications.  My understanding is that this was considered before with the Company Law Review Group, which did not recommend changes here.  We are trying to tease that out.  I think the word used by Mr. Duffy was \"dignity\".  The very least one would achieve during that process would be a reasonable conversation with employees to respect their dignity and have a chance to tease through all the situations involving a company.  It is a very difficult time when there is an insolvency because the company is effectively going broke.<\/p><p>It is different if there are assets involved or decisions have been taken at earlier stages which affect that.  In most cases, an insolvency is a very difficult time for employees.  We can see that in respect of Debenhams, which was mentioned.  It has been a very difficult time.  We are trying to see if we can allow for that 30 days of consultation.  The other part of that is what it can achieve and if it would be effective.  We would then have to try to define what the consultation is and what it covers.  There is consensus that if we could do that, it would be the right thing to do in that situation.  There would seem to be consultation in most cases but in other cases, insolvencies take place overnight because the creditor might make a move.  It is not always straightforward but we are looking to try to do that.<\/p><p> The other issue is what happens to employees during that time.  The committee discussed at its previous session access to social welfare entitlements and who pays employees during the 30-day consultation.  If employees still employed but there is no money to pay their wages, technically they would not be entitled to social welfare payments.  We are examining how we could address that issue.  My reading of it is that it is fixable.  None of those with whom I have engaged has spoken against trying to address this issue.<\/p><p> On the hiding of assets, the Duffy Cahill report, while not referencing any one case, dealt with hypothetical cases where assets had been stripped, hidden or sold off.  That does not mean that the pattern is similar in every situation but that is the one the Duffy Cahill review was asked to examine.  The view in the report, and of our team and the company law review that current legislation allows for those assets to be chased down.  It is clear, however, that it has not been used.  Part of the question we are asking all the stakeholders is why it has not been used.  Is it too expensive or too difficult or is it too hard to try to prove a case?  That is the issue we are teasing out to see how we can improve that situation.  It is desirable that we do it and we are asking if we can do it or what needs to be done.<\/p><p> The Deputy asked me if there is evidence of that practice in a current case.  That case is before the courts and the court's duty is to decide that in conjunction with the liquidator and all the creditors.  I have seen no evidence that that is the case here.  I have heard commentary on it but no one has presented any evidence to me that that is the case.  The situation the Deputy mentioned is probably different from other ones that were discussed originally in the Duffy Cahill report.  Much of that report dealt with cases where there is an asset.  I have not seen evidence of that and none has been presented to me but others will judge that.  That is the purpose of the courts.  The law is there to protect but we will see if we can make the law more user-friendly.  The T&aacute;naiste has committed to doing that work and it is under way in the Department.  We will try to have that finished by the end of December.<\/p><p> Recommendation 4 was related to collective redundancies and the potential fund.  Deputy O'Reilly asked me my view on that.  The Department has not expressed a view on this.  We are facilitating a conversation on the issue to see where it ends up.  We will express a view when we have finished the consultation.  The proposal is to establish a new fund that would honour collective agreements.  Collective agreements are negotiated in companies, very often at an earlier stage of a company's restructuring when it wants to reduce the number of employees or make other changes.  They are very often negotiated at an earlier stage, not necessarily at an insolvency stage.  That issue must be teased out.  What is being suggested here is that a fund would be established, probably at the time the agreement is made, that could pay for the agreement at a later stage.  In fairness, the majority of companies working with trade unions and employees enter such collective agreements assuming they have resources to pay them.  The position may change, however, in an insolvency years later.  In that case, how would that play out?  If there were a fund in place, as Deputy O'Reilly and others have referred to, it could be tapped into to pay for that.  Who should contribute to such a fund?  Not everybody has a collective agreement or enhanced entitlements.  Should everybody pay into such a fund?  That is the question we are asking.<\/p><p> If we draw on the State's Social Insurance Fund, it would mean every employer and employee had paid into it.  We have to tease that out because not everybody would agree with using that fund or find it appropriate to use it.  The percentage of employees covered by collective agreements is smaller that those covered by the Social Insurance Fund.  We will discuss whether there should be a register of collective agreements that is visible and transparent in terms of where they are and who has them.  That question may have been asked previously.  That is an issue we want to tease out, which is exactly what we are doing.

It provides for enhanced redundancy payments over and above the statutory entitlement in the event that there is a contravention by the employer of the Protection of Employment Act 1977.  That refers to an earlier proposal around that 30-day consultation and if that Act has been contravened in respect of the consultation.  It would apply if we changed the Act to allow for the 30-day consultation and it was not honoured.  The authors of the Duffy Cahill report stress that we must look at all the proposals together.  It is not a case of picking one over the other.

I assure him that we are taking it seriously.  It is urgent, but it needs very careful consideration because there are far-reaching consequences.  As a Department, our job is to get the balance right in this area.  The Minister of State, Deputy Robert Troy, and I are committed to this.  The T&aacute;naiste is also dealing with the Labour Employer Economic Forum, LEEF.  Our report will feed into the LEEF process, which involves all the relevant stakeholders.<\/p> <p>  I will ask Ms Tara Coogan to comment on the State's involvement in legal cases.  She has been involved in these proceedings.  Talking to some of the stakeholders, I get the sense that their legal advice was that using the legislation would be very costly.  That has been referred to in the Duffy Cahill report.  Moreover, it might not give them the result they need.  They have obviously made a decision not to go down the road of availing of all the legislation.  That is what I am trying to tease out.  I want to research this issue.  These laws are there to act as a deterrent, but they are also there to be used.  If they are not being used, we have to find out why.  To use the laws a party has to believe that assets are being hidden.  I hear a lot of talk about assets in certain situations and I am not sure the evidence backs it up.  The courts will decide that.  A liquidator's job is to pursue all the assets to pay all the debts. <\/p> <p>  The Duffy Cahill report touches on the idea of the State assuming that responsibility through changes to the Redundancy Payments Acts.  The State can instruct the liquidator to chase down these assets and provide the resources for it to do so.  Ms Coogan is much more of an expert than I am, so I will let her discuss that. <\/p> <p>  Deputies also referred to collective agreements and the Social Insurance Fund.  In any situation where a collective agreement on enhanced terms of employment is reached, everybody sitting around the table believes the money to pay for it exists.  Presumably parties would not agree to certain benefits if they did not believe someone would pay them.  At some point, the funding to meet these obligations existed.  If a collective agreement is in place, it would follow that there are sufficient assets to pay out on any change in the structure of the business.  However, collective agreements are often made when a company is restructuring.  A deal is done and the company pays out there and then.  People take voluntary redundancy because of that enhanced package.  That package sometimes sets a precedent, which is where the matter of compensation arises.  In common with some stakeholders, the Duffy Cahill report suggests that assets or money should be ring-fenced to pay out on such agreements.  On the face of it, that is a private decision for each individual company or group of companies.  The other question is whether the State should provide that funding if necessary.  That is a very different question.  It would be a draw on the Social Insurance Fund, which is under a lot of pressure at the moment. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2020112500002#F00200","speaker":"1505"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1606262400,"counter":315,"content":"<p>The Deputy asked about the remedies and protections available in company law.  In the interests of time, it might be helpful if we forward a briefing note on that through the Chair.  That could be shared with all the committee members.  I will give the committee a flavour of some of the available remedies.<\/p> <p>  There are provisions under the Companies Act 2014 whereby the corporate veil can be lifted.  If two corporate entities are involved, it is possible to look into the affairs of a second company in certain circumstances, provided the test outlined in the Act can be met.  There is also a provision allowing for the pooling of assets of related companies.  Again, very stringent tests are associated with these.  We have to accept that while many people look at overall structures, distinct companies are separate legal persons.  Those matters have to be addressed. <\/p> <p>  There are also mechanisms that allow a liquidator to look back over the two-year period prior to the insolvency to see if there have been any inappropriate transfers of assets, payments that do not ring true, etc.  Those transfers can be recovered.  The other day the committee discussed cases where there has been a fraudulent effect.  Those provisions are in place.  They are quite extensive so I will prepare a note on them. <\/p> <p>  I am very mindful of the fact that a specific case is involved so I will speak about litigation in very general terms.  This is a matter for our colleagues in the Department of Social Protection.  It is important that the committee appreciates that while payouts to insured workers are always honoured in the context of insolvencies, companies sometimes undergo restructuring where voluntary redundancies arise but they are genuinely struggling to meet their statutory entitlements.  The Social Insurance Fund can be relied upon in those circumstances.  It must be understood that in Ireland we honour employees' statutory entitlements.  I will not say generous because that is not appropriate but we make quite extensive payments in certain circumstances. <\/p> <p>  There is also a duty in certain circumstances because a liquidation is an ongoing process.  We are not 100% clear on what the situation in a given company is.  At the end of a liquidation, if it appears that assets are available or contributions could have been made, our colleagues will go after that company and try to recover certain assets for the Social Insurance Fund.  When the Minister steps in and makes redundancy payments, he or she becomes a creditor and is entitled under the Companies Act 2014 to seek certain remedies in insolvencies.  I hope that answers the Deputy's question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2020112500002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Tara Coogan"},{"type":"speech","time":1606262400,"counter":316,"content":"<p>The first thing that strikes me about the Government's approach is the complete lack of urgency.

The latest change to the entitlement to two weeks' pay per year of employment was made in 2002.  Paying out statutory entitlements is very costly for the State, but it is very important that when employees are left without their statutory entitlements the State steps in to honour them.

I committed to doing that, as did the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister of State, Deputy Troy.  We are doing that work in the Department.

Debenhams may have been well flagged.  I have a copy of a <i>Financial Times<\/i>report from 16 April 2020 outlining where Debenhams used administration.  It had more than &pound;1 billion in annual sales and 142 high street stores and it was flagging difficulties relating to the coronavirus pandemic.  It is a pity that we did not have the directors of Debenhams come to Ireland and show their foresightedness that they could look to such a process so early on.  There was no doubt that foreign ownership became an issue with the movement of assets.  That is at the crux of the liquidation process, where the assets of the Irish entity were moved and heaped with debt.  A twin track is going on here this morning - first, the possible implementation of the recommendations of the Duffy Cahill report and, second, the situation of the Debenhams workers.

That is an opinion.  Some Members of this House have made assumptions, rightly or wrongly, but I do not have the evidence to make that comment.

Again, I do not think there is necessarily any connection between what happened to Debenhams and who owned it.  From what I can see, Debenhams has been in trading difficulties for many years.  I have not followed its story - I am not involved in retail - but the fact that it was restructuring in 2015 or 2016 around redundancies showed that it had difficulties for a long number of years.  I am not sure it is right to say it is because it belonged to a foreign owner.  The Deputy is asking us to look at the owners of every company and see what needs to be done.  I am not sure where he is going with that.<\/p> <p>  I chaired the retail forum and I engage practically daily with the retail sector.  The trade unions are represented on the forum.  We discuss all the circumstances relating to retail and Covid.  Retail is a major employer.  Over 300,000 people are employed in the retail sector and it one I want to develop.  I want to recognise and develop the skills in this area and bring in new technologies.  There are loads of opportunities and potential for retail but it is in a very difficult period.  This is why the State is moving very quickly to put supports in place using taxpayers' money to support these businesses and guide them through this period.  Being restricted in terms of trading when one's premises is closed is very difficult so we are working with that sector to bring it through this.  It has a positive future if we can get through this.  That does not mean there will not be more companies that will end up in a difficult situation.  Some are already very close to or are in that situation and we will engage with them all as quickly as possible.  This is what we are trying to do.<\/p> <p>  Regarding ownership, I am not sure what changes Deputy Shanahan wants us to introduce or what he is trying to achieve.  Again, I must say the situation is different compared with what is referred to in the Duffy Cahill report in respect of where others are joining the dots.  I do not think the authors would agree with the Deputy on that point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2020112500002#H00400","speaker":"1505"},{"type":"speech","time":1606262400,"counter":334,"content":"<p>We could spend a lot of time debating that.  Ms Cahill addressed the previous meeting of the committee.  She referred to the ability of the related company to pay the debts of the insolvent company where it has in some way contributed to the insolvency, as set out in section 599, and said that the provision seems to have never been invoked.  I draw the Minister of State's attention to that.  I think that might relate to Debenhams.  I will move away from the subject of Debenhams.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the provision of future agreements and possible setting up of a fund, I agree with the Minister of State.  It is very difficult to understand how this is going to work.  People might come into employment, pay into a fund and leave the employment and part of their payments are left behind and they might never get a follow-on residual benefit.  I accept that but we must do something about creating some security.  What about mandatory employee share ownership trusts for companies?  We would set up and mandate employee share ownership trusts where companies have some benefit in ownership assuming it goes on.  In that instance, they obviously get paid for performance but in the event of liquidation, there might be some value in that.  This might be something worth looking at.  <\/p> <p>  My next point goes back to Debenhams.  I know people closer to the unions talk about pay bargaining.  Where pay agreements are made, is there an opportunity to have them provisioned in a company's balance sheet and corporate accounts?  In other words, if there is an agreement, does it show up as a provisioned debt within the company so that in the event of insolvency where a liquidator comes in, that forms part of the debts of the company and it is clear that a benefit is due to the employees?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2020112500002#H00500","speaker":"1616"},{"type":"speech","time":1606262400,"counter":335,"content":"<p>On that last point, that is probably where we think the benefit might be regarding having a visible list of agreements that have been reached.  Again, they are private agreements reached in private companies.  The State does not have an involvement.  They are private arrangements in private companies but it would beneficial for all involved - certainly employees and everyone else - if we can see them and clearly know they are there.  I have asked whether we can try to get a handle on how many private agreements have been made so that is something we are looking at.  The question about it being on the balance sheet is a discussion about having a fund.  If a company enters into an agreement, I presume at that time in good faith, is there a way of paying for those arrangements?  Generally, those agreements were paid out quite quickly because they are part of the process of that time.  That is my understanding of them.  If they are to be there long term because in some cases, they are or become terms of employment or part of an employment negotiation, are funds allocated or an asset ring-fenced to pay for them?

The State does step in.  The Social Insurance Fund is available but, again, the first call is the assets of a company to pay out what the employees are entitled to.  If the company cannot do that and there are no assets to do that, the State steps in.

He said something very strange a few minutes ago.  He said that in respect of the Duffy Cahill report, it was a very specific situation.  No, it was not.  I can tell him that Deputy Quinlivan and I were standing with the HMV workers ten years.  I can talk to the Minister of State about Clerys but also about Connolly Shoes, La Senza and TalkTalk.

I am engaging in a process in the Department that is not finished; we are in the middle of it.  Therefore, it would not be appropriate for me to come in and say that this is what I, or myself and the Minister of State, Deputy Troy, or myself and the T&aacute;naiste, or the Department have decided.  What then would be the point of having a consultation or discussion in the next month?  What would the point even be of engaging here?  I would rather the Senator welcome the opportunity to actually have engagement.  I am listening to suggestions and questions being put forward by Deputy Shanahan and others and we are very open to any of those suggestions.  I assume that is what the Chairman is doing by having this review.  I assume it is about seeing how we can all achieve the same outcome, which is to strengthen the position of employees.  That is what I am committed to doing but it might go beyond Duffy Cahill.<\/p> <p>  The Duffy Cahill recommendations were submitted in 2016 to the Departments.  They were reviewed and looked at and decisions were taken at the time to not move on with them.  That is what we are looking back over again, to see if we can take a different approach or if a part of these proposals can give us the right solution.  Deputy Bruton referred to proposal No. 1 on the 30 days.  We believe we can adjust that proposal and make something out of that and that is what we are going to try to do.  Again, however, I am very conscious that there are a lot of stakeholders who want to contribute to this discussion because it has a significant impact on employment, employment rights, companies and so on.  I do not want to do anything that has a knock-on negative impact; I want to get the situation right here.  The State is protecting workers and the State pays out, using taxpayers' money, through the Social Insurance Fund on employees' statutory entitlements.  That is honoured and I have not seen a case where it has not been.  Again, it is taxpayers' money, used very correctly and wisely and by agreement over many years.

Now I must tell the Minister of State, having spoken to Debenhams workers in Limerick, who have in some cases given 30 or 40 years of service, they do not view it as an extensive payment.  Their view is that they have been let down by the State, specifically because four years ago, the Minister of State's Government commissioned a report and as he has acknowledged himself, it refused to implement those proposals.  I put it to him that there is a very clear demarcation here.  On the one hand is a report with six proposals which the Minister of State's Government commissioned four years ago and which the Irish Congress of Trade Unions asked that Government to implement.  On the other hand, IBEC asked that Government not to implement any of the proposals.

I think the authors have said so as well because the Senator has tried to get them to say so, from what I could see from reading the transcripts.  They did not say that their report was applicable to the Debenhams situation.  Their report was about companies in deficit situations.  They have indeed referred to some cases where that looks to have happened with assets but they are not saying their report would serve a purpose in the Debenhams situation or would aid the employees there.  They are not saying that, that I can see.  We looked at this and do not believe it would have helped them either.  The Taoiseach, T&aacute;naiste and many others have engaged with the unions and Mandate trying to help with negotiations and put in place a process.  The Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, was the most recent one.  It has not borne fruit yet.  Again, the Taoiseach has said he wants more engagement around that.  However, this is a private agreement.  The State will honour, and has honoured, the statutory agreements by paying out.  There are other agreements there that are private agreements that the State does not get involved in, and has not in the case of many other companies.<\/p> <p>  The Senator referenced the potential for 1,000 liquidations.  I think there were potentially 8,000 already this year and there are thousands every year for different scenarios as well.  The State does not and has not in the past got involved in private agreements.  It will always get involved in honouring the statutory responsibilities of all employees - and rightly so.  That is what we are committed to doing and we are going forward with this to see if we can strengthen the legislation or make it more effective.  It is not yet proven that we can.  It is very clear that what is there is not being used.  What I really want to understand is why.  That does not mean that any of that can aid the Debenhams workers because they are very different situations.  The Duffy Cahill report references companies in relation to assets, the moving of assets and things like that.  There is no evidence of that that I have seen or that anyone has brought to my attention where Debenhams is concerned.  It would be very useful if there were assets there because then the employees would get greater payments.

The fact of the matter is that the EU Court of Appeal has found this State has failed to adequately implement EU legislation by failing to provide a procedure to protect employees' entitlements in the event of an informal insolvency of their employer.  What completely baffles me is why the Department has done nothing about it to date.  Today the Minister of State appears to be buying time again.  As I have only a minute or so left, I want an assurance that he will bring forward positive proposals to protect employees.  He should start with the first proposal Deputy Bruton mentioned, to insist that everyone has that right of consultation for 30 days.  Will the Minister of State at least give us a commitment that that will happen?  If he does, can he give a commitment for when it will happen because this tsunami of further liquidations is coming at us like a train, early next year.

I note from his contribution that he, like other members, specifically raised the issue of Debenhams.

I know the employees particularly well in this situation.<\/p> <p>  I will give one example of a constituent who contacted me.

It is not a nice place to be and, certainly, the workers feel strongly about it.  As the Senator said, they have been out on the picket lines for more than 200 days.  I have met and engaged with some of the employees and with the unions quite a lot around this.  I fully understand and sympathise with them.<\/p> <p>  The State will do all it can within the law and within our framework to try to help and work with that.  We are doing that as far as we possibly can in our role.  The difficulty, however, is enhanced redundancy, and negotiations around that are a private matter.  They are not something the State was part of, or part of that agreement.  We do not have a role in seeing that part of it out because it is a private situation and it varies from company to company.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the discussion around the fund, again, it is a suggestion that has been put forward by many and others have commented on it.  Some will be for it and some will be against it.  It is being teased through.  Will that fund help the situation?  No decisions have been made on that fund or a potential fund.  Senator Crowe and Deputy Shanahan asked how it will work and whether there will be different versions of it.  Again, it goes back to whether an arrangement is made to have enhanced redundancy or other enhanced entitlements.  Who pays for that?  If it is a private decision in a company, who should pay for it?  I believe employees in that situation who have agreed to it would fully expect and feel entitled to it, and feel it is theirs.  In that respect, therefore, one would say there should be some ring-fenced funding to guarantee it is paid out.<\/p> <p>  Regarding statutory entitlements, the State is fully supportive and is behind and part of that.  The State makes sure there is a ring-fenced fund to pay out on that.  It is called the Social Insurance Fund.  The role of the State is to provide a strong commitment there and it is well recognised.  The other fund is about enhanced redundancy entitlements or other issues.  One must ask the question then, who pays into that fund?  Who will pay for that?  I posed that question to all those in the discussion to hear their views.  I am sure the committee may also have views on it.<\/p> <p>  The Duffy Cahill report refers to employees having equality and one cannot have different types of rights for employees.   One must have equality.  If, therefore, that fund is in place for those who have enhanced entitlements and others do not have access to it, is that right and fair?  That is the kind of stuff we must tease out and that is being looked at.<\/p> <p>  It has been much asserted by people that were the Duffy Cahill recommendations implemented, Debenhams would not be in the situation it is.  I have not seen the evidence to back up that assertion.  I am being truthful on that.  That does not mean I am right.  I have seen no evidence.  People have claimed it and have joined the two together.  I have been through the Duffy Cahill report probably ten or 11 times at this stage.  I have read and gone through it and I cannot see the evidence.  I believe the authors of the report did not say that either because, again, they kept referring to the fact their report is about situations involving assets and the separation of assets.  That is what they were asked to report on and make recommendations on, and that is what they did.  They did not go into the policy, funding or cost of that.  They just made potential recommendations.  Our job is to go deeper than that and look at it all.  I have not, however, seen the evidence to say that if those proposals were implemented, we would not have the tragic situation that is happening in Debenhams, and it is tragic.  We do not want anyone losing his or her job.  So many people were committed, many of whom had 30 years-plus service.  It is difficult for any of us to lose a job.  It is, however, even more so when a person was committed to a company for so long and gave so much of his or her life, and probably grew up in the place.  In many cases, it was generations of families.  That is difficult to accept and hard to work on.  That is why the State has given this as much attention as it possibly can to try to help and to work with the unions.  We are not, however, privy to some of the private parts of that process.  We are prohibited by law to step in, in some cases.

It was up to the employees, shop stewards and unions to make a decision on that.  Negotiations have been on and off with the liquidator.  Again, it is the role of the liquidator, under the guidance of the courts, to do that within existing law.  Its job is to work with the unions, and the unions must do a good job to make sure everyone's entitlements are honoured.<\/p> <p>  The State's role is to make sure we honour the statutory entitlements and pay out as soon they are looked for.

Similar issues arose with Coca-Cola in Cork where workers had to protest and picket outside for months.  This issue is not confined to Debenhams, it is about workers' rights.  The Duffy Cahill report was published in 2016.  What the Debenhams workers are so upset about is that if the recommendations of the Duffy Cahill report had been implemented within the past four years we would know whether it was relevant to them or not, but we do not know because nothing was done in the past four years.

I am not sure that is the case and I have not seen the evidence to support it.  I wish to be clear in that regard.<\/p> <p>  Regarding resolving the Debenhams case, again, the State can only get involved to a certain extent in this situation under the law.  It is a private matter involving a private company.  I have absolute sympathy for those workers.  My heart goes out to them.  I have met with them and engaged with them.  What is more important, the State has stepped in to fulfil its responsibilities.  Some parts of the situation relate to a private arrangement the workers have had with their company.  They are working with the unions and others involved to try to resolve that.  The State cannot just fix that.  I wish it could.  I know the Taoiseach wishes we could too, as does the T&aacute;naiste, but we cannot do it just like that.  We are trying to help with the negotiations and to encourage the parties to get back to the table.  Where we did have a role, the various Departments immediately stepped up to answer that call.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Gould has asked about the recommendations.  When the Duffy Cahill report was brought forward it contained six recommendations specific to scenarios concerning assets.  The report authors said themselves they did not look at the wider policy context or address costs.  That was not part of their brief.  The brief of the Government and the Departments is to take the wider view on all of this and to look at the recommendations, the overall situation and the knock-on effect for policy and decisions on both employees and employers, the management of companies, assets and future jobs.  We have to look at all of that and to get the balance right.  That is what we are committed to doing to see if we can strengthen employees' rights.  That is what I am committed to doing.  Part of that work is reviewing these recommendations, which had been reviewed before and decisions were taken on them.  We are looking at them again in other contexts and we are having a wider discussion around redundancy and insolvency to see if we can make positive changes that will have a positive impact, not just for the sake of it.  We are here not just because of one situation and one company.  We are discussing the legislation in general and the Duffy Cahill report.  I was asked by Debenhams to do this and I said I would if I could find solutions that would be effective and worthwhile.

We believe there is already sufficient scope for strengthening the Union within the existing treaties, not least the Lisbon treaty, which remains to be fully exploited.  Our clear preference at this stage, therefore, is for a policy-led approach to the future work of the conference.  Again, it is encouraging that this approach is the dominant one among our partners.<\/p> <p>  The original intention on the part of the Commission and President von der Leyen had been to launch the conference on Europe day this year, 9 May.  Obviously, the pandemic has led to delay.  Six months on, deliberations are still continuing between the Council and Parliament to finalise arrangements and a work plan for the conference.<\/p> <p>  The Council, which agreed a common position on the conference last June, has advocated a policy first approach, which prioritises implementation of the EU strategic agenda.  The Council has also been clear that the role and prerogatives of each of the institutions must be respected, with full equality between them in how the conference is organised.  The Council is also keen that the ultimate outcome of the conference should be a report to the European Council at some time during 2022.  It has also been clear that the conference does not fall within the scope of Article 48 of the Treaty on European Union concerning the amendment of the EU treaties.<\/p> <p>  The Parliament, for its part, has stated that, in addition to consideration of the policy priorities set out in the strategic agenda, democratic and institutional aspects of the EU must also be addressed by the conference.  This is likely to cover such issues as the spitzenkandidat process and the question of transnational lists for European Parliament elections.  The Parliament also wants an early cross-institutional commitment to implement the conference's recommendations, including through treaty change if necessary.<\/p> <p>  Notwithstanding these differing perspectives, the German Presidency has made good progress in securing broad agreement on a mandate and programme for the conference.  The main outstanding issue relates to who should chair the conference.  On this issue, we have made clear we support the German Presidency and the Council in favouring an experienced, independent individual to take on this important role.  Opinions are sharply divided between the Council and the Parliament on this issue and it may require reference to the European Council to secure final agreement.<\/p> <p>  Realistically, therefore, it is now likely to be early next year at the earliest before the initiative is formally launched.  Once the programme and scope have been agreed between the Council and Parliament, member states will be encouraged to start preparing individual national plans for engaging ordinary citizens and relevant stakeholders including, in our case, this committee and the Oireachtas, within the framework of the conference.<\/p> <p>  In this regard, Ireland has an excellent track record of active engagement with citizens on the issue of Europe on which we can build.  We know from discussions with EU partners that many have been impressed with the work of our citizens' assemblies, and I have discussed them with my counterparts, and with the series of citizens' dialogues held during 2018 and 2019 to input into the national statement on Europe issued by the previous Government in April of last year.  We also have some excellent partner institutes here in Ireland with whom we have successfully collaborated in this area.<\/p> <p>  The difficulties presented by the pandemic undoubtedly present challenges in organising the type of public consultations and town hall meetings which were so well supported in the past.  However, as recent months have shown, there are plenty of alternative means, through virtual platforms, to interact with each other.  Indeed, online consultations may allow us to reach important target groups, particularly among the younger population who arguably should be most engaged about the future of Europe, in a manner which might be more effective than through traditional methods.  The structure of the engagement within each member state cannot be finalised until final agreement is reached between the EU institutions and the vision of the chair is outlined.<\/p> <p>  The Government is also determined that the Oireachtas must be fully engaged in the work of the conference since it is recognised across Europe that national parliaments have a key role to play as the democratically-elected representatives of Europe's citizens.  As Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs, I am very keen to hear the thoughts and views of the committee on how the conference should operate and how the committee and Oireachtas Members generally can most usefully input into its deliberations.<\/p> <p>  I would like to see today as the start of a dialogue which will continue in the coming weeks and months, as we prepare to launch the conference, we hope early next year, and plan for its conduct here in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  This is an important issue.  The last months have, I hope, only reinforced how central a role Europe plays in all our lives, as we work together to overcome the virus and lay the groundwork for a strong economic recovery.<\/p><p>I am sure that the Europe which will emerge from this crisis will be an even better and stronger Union, firmly based on the solidarity we all have all seen at the Brexit process but that now applies, and always applied, to other issues, partnership, and common values.  It will be crucial in 2021 and the coming years to engage actively with our citizens, act on that engagement and hear how exactly we can ensure that is the case.

I will divert slightly and say that much of the work of this committee has been focused on Brexit and the impact of Brexit in recent times.  One of the areas I have been banging a drum about for two years is connectivity.  As an aside, I welcomed the Minister of State's visit to Rosslare Europort last week but we have been working in consort on this, which was remarked upon by the T&aacute;naiste, and therefore it was jarring that he was accompanied only by Government Deputies.  The rest of us were not informed of his visit to Rosslare Europort.  It is an issue on which we have been acting in a collective manner.<\/p> <p>  I am interested in putting a couple of questions to the Minister of State in terms of the future of Europe debate.  First, I do not know whether he had a chance to read the speech made by the Portuguese Prime Minister, Ant&oacute;nio Costa, on Monday to the Catholic University of Portugal where he set out his view on what he classified as a smaller European Union of values post Brexit.  He talked about a two-speed Europe being required now with an inner core of Europe accepting debt transfers, migrant quotas and the rule of law and those who were not willing to subscribe to those being in a second tier, so to speak.  He described it as variable geometries because of the real dichotomy that exists in Europe that has to be recognised and addressed if we are to make progress.  I do not know whether the Minister of State has had a chance to reflect on that but it is a view he will have heard in any event and I would be interested to hear his perspective on it.  If, as I suspect, he is not in favour of a two-speed Europe, how do we address that real dichotomy Prime Minister Acosta has mentioned?<\/p> <p>  Second, I take it from what the Minister of State said that treaty change is not ruled out but not favoured by the Irish Government.  He talked about the unutilised aspects of existing treaties, which is an issue we have discussed previously, particularly the Treaty of Lisbon.  He might set out for us what specifically in the Lisbon treaty he regards as unutilised that could and should now be utilised.<\/p> <p>  Third, regarding the new election processes, particularly the spitzenkandidaten process, which I would suspect outside this House and a small coterie of people would be regarded as a complete unknown entity, I know that the internal dialogue within the Socialists &amp;amp; Democrats, S &amp;amp; D, Group between Frans Timmermans and Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efovi did not ignite the population of my constituents or anybody else and I do not see how they could in the future.  What is the Minister of State's view on that because if we are to have real involvement in elections we have to make them relevant and I am not sure that saying we are putting forward a candidate, from our perspective or that of the Socialists &amp;amp; Democrats Group,  Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efovi or Frans Timmermans is the way to do that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2020112500002#E00300","speaker":"1620"},{"type":"speech","time":1606262400,"counter":419,"content":"<p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it agus roimh a &uacute;s&aacute;id den Ghaeilge.  I have a couple of questions which are similar to those of Deputy Howlin.  First, by indicating that we do not want to go to treaty change are we not limiting the ambition of the convention and what we may be able to contribute to that?  Similar to the question Deputy Howlin asked, what are the existing provisions the Minister of State sees being used?  We had a good discussion on that last week with people like Brigid Laffan but in terms of the Government, what are the existing provisions that are unused that the Minister of State sees being used?  Why have they not been used to date and will suddenly now come into vogue, as it were?<\/p> <p>  Second, regarding Covid-19, we have seen the strengths of Europe but we will particularly see the strengths of the Union in the first quarter of next year.  The Union's approach to vaccine purchase, in particular, and research makes sure that a small country like Ireland will be at the vanguard of the vaccine.  However, we have also seen the weaknesses in the past few weeks in respect of the recovery fund being objected to as a consequence of the rule of law issue.  As we prepared to discuss the future of Europe, one that is based on values that are being challenged now by using the way that Europe operates, what is the Minister of State's position on that?  Have we been too quiet as a Government about the events of the past number of weeks that a recovery fund, which is vital for healthcare and for the citizens, could be objected to on the basis of two countries in particular having different views of values?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2020112500002#E00400","speaker":"1602"},{"type":"speech","time":1606262400,"counter":420,"content":"<p>I acknowledge the first point Deputy Howlin made.  The visit was organised at the last minute.  In future, I will make sure everyone is invited.  On that note, the French Minister, Clem&eacute;nte Beaune, is coming to the country on Monday week, I understand.  It is planned to have a visit to the Border.  With Covid-19 restrictions, we will make sure that every party is represented from the areas affected.  I am sure Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute; will be on the invite list when the French Minister comes to the Border.  We have not finalised the arrangements yet but I assume it will be in Louth.  I take on board the point made by Deputy Howlin.<\/p> <p>  I have not seen the Portuguese Prime Minister's speech but it is obviously a view I have heard previously.  It is not a new view to me or any of us who have been working on European affairs.  I was a member of this committee 11 or 12 years ago and I heard the view that we need a two-speed Europe, and we certainly hear members saying that.  It is clearly not something we would favour.  In respect of Brexit, for example, all we have seen is a one-speed Europe, absolute solidarity and full backing for our position but, importantly, full backing for the negotiators also.  If we had a two-speed Europe I believe it would divide Europe and make us weaker.  One point I and all my colleagues would make about the Brexit process, and now to be visited in the Covid situation, is that solidarity and unity makes us very strong and gives our citizens strength also.  Again, I have not seen the Portuguese Prime Minister's speech but not every member state will be on the same page on each of the issues the Deputy mentioned in terms of debt transfers, migrant quotas and rule of law.  I am not sure where he gets the one-speed and the two-speed approach.  A certain number of countries are on those three issues and a certain number are not.  <\/p> <p>  To be clear, we have to be tougher on the rule of law.  There is one speed on the rule of law and it is the treaty, which every country has signed up to, and those treaties have to be complied with by every country.  There is no two-speed process.  We have the Article 7 procedure and the Anglo rule of law report, which the European Commissioner, Didier Reynders, has said he is willing to go before national parliaments to talk about those issues, and the conditionality in the Multiannual Financial Framework, MFF.<\/p> <p>  Related to that, Deputy Calleary wondered whether we have been quiet on this issue over the past number of weeks.  We have been very strong on the rule of law.  I have written to my Polish colleague on the issue and in any of our interactions with Ministers we have raised rule of law issues, and at my interactions at the General Affairs Council also.  The Taoiseach has been very strong on that issue at the European Council, as have the vast majority of member states.<\/p> <p>  On the current events on rule of law and the MFF, the German Presidency has been taking a calm approach on that.  It has not overreacted.  It seems to be confident that it is working on something that will get agreement.  Everyone will have a veto on this issue.  It is a difficult situation for them.<\/p><p>Two countries have made their views known.  It was pleasing to hear it from Spain and I heard it directly from my Italian colleague as well.  They have been saying it in the media.  These countries are keen to ensure that European money is spent.  They will be major beneficiaries of what is coming in this multiannual financial framework and the next generation EU.  They are keen that the rule of law be complied with as well and they have been strong on that.  They have not wavered in any way.  Every country needs spending but they have been clear.  This is encouraging on rule of law.  Every member state is the same.  Let us see what happens with the German Presidency in the coming days.  There is no doubt this is urgent.  It is one of several urgent issues on the agenda, unfortunately.<br\/><br\/>I was asked about unused provisions of the Lisbon treaty.  Obviously, it will be for the conference chair to look at the treaty and see what elements could be used better.  There will be some arguing for provisions from the Lisbon treaty.  I have already seen this with the MFF and commentary on enhanced co-operation.  We had considerable discussion about the <i>passerelle<\/i>clause when the Lisbon treaty debate was going on.  These issues could work effectively in some areas but they may not work in other areas.  They may work to our disadvantage or to the disadvantage of other countries.  We will have to wait and see.<br\/><br\/>We will see with the pandemic as well.  This is a good example of why treaty changes are not the be-all and end-all.  We have seen extensive work at European level on the pandemic and the vaccine in a climate in which health is not really a competence of the European Union in the same way as other matters.  We believe there is major scope within the Lisbon treaty.  Climate change is another example.  I remember in the referendum it was mentioned as an item that could be dealt with.  It is only now really coming to fruition in terms of the actions the European Union is about to take.  That is one example of something that is about to take off.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2020112500002#E00500","speaker":"1503","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1606262400,"counter":422,"content":"<p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it.  I have a few questions and I want to pick up some of the points colleagues have raised.  They are consistent with the discussions we have had with the academic and societal experts who have come before the committee so far.<\/p> <p>  Will the Minister of State elaborate on when we expect a conference chair to be appointed?  Much seems to depend on who this person is or where the person comes from in terms of setting out the policy agenda.  It is interesting to look at this in advance.  I know much discussion and engagement is yet to happen.  Can the Minister of State indicate at this stage what the policy priorities for the Government will be?  The Minister of State has referred to the great work done at European level in responding to Covid-19.  This has been especially highlighted in the past ten days in respect of vaccines and the fact that the EU has secured so many vaccines.  It is stark.  We must remember that Ireland outside the EU simply would not have had this access to pre-ordered vaccines.  I hope they will be important in getting us back to normal sooner rather than later.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Howlin referred to some of the other areas that may be contentious, including our own resources and the future of the Union in a policy directive.  Has the Government started to formulate any positions?<\/p> <p>  I wish to pick up on the point made by Deputy Calleary on treaty change.  Understandably, the Minister of State gave a strong position to the effect that the Irish Government at this stage does not favour treaty change.  Is that decision political or rooted in the policies or, as Deputy Howlin said, because of what is available within the Lisbon treaty?<\/p> <p>  When it comes to discussing the EU and the future of the EU we need to put aside the fear that we are one of the few member states which, if there is treaty change, has to put the matter to referendum.  We need to accept that.  If that happens, then so be it.  However, we should not let it limit the conversation, especially if it leads to a better working European Union.<\/p> <p>  When we talk about a two-speed Europe, we need to be frank.  Europe operates at multiple speeds.  Some of us are members of the euro, some of us are not.  Some European member states are more involved in PESCO, while others embrace it in a different way.  This idea of a one-size-fits-all European Union of 27 different member states is a nonsense.  We need to accept that it moves in separate ways.<\/p> <p>  It has been made clear in recent days, as Deputy Calleary has mentioned, that the issue is really that certain people do not want to agree with the core principles of the EU.  We can move in different directions.  It does not matter in the wider scheme if we have the euro and Denmark does not, but it does matter if people in Poland or Hungary cannot have their rights recognised.  That is at the core and we need to stress it.<\/p> <p>  An interesting issue was raised relating to the Spitzenkandidat process.  I travelled to Helsinki two years ago for the European People's Party to have a big debate between whether we would run Alexander Stubb or Manfred Weber.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2020112500002#F00200","speaker":"1473"},{"type":"speech","time":1606262400,"counter":423,"content":"<p>Household names all.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2020112500002#F00300","speaker":"1620"},{"type":"speech","time":1606262400,"counter":424,"content":"<p>I imagine Deputy Howlin will remember when Martin Schulz came to Dublin in 2009 to campaign for the Spitzenkandidat.

I mean someone who was really directly elected rather than a Spitzenkandidat or electoral college, one in respect of whom people in Dublin, Drogheda or Gdansk could go into the ballot box and put an X beside the name.  Would that really bring Europe closer to the people?<\/p> <p>  I wish to refer briefly to one final issue that is important.  We are talking about the future of Europe and the potential of multispeed within member states.  We have to look at the relationship with the entire neighbourhood.  I am talking about accession states and countries like Serbia and North Macedonia.  We had many hearings in the last Oireachtas.  How do we ensure that candidate countries continue to engage with the EU, not only on an economic level but on a social level?  Again, this comes back to the rule of law and rights.

I do not believe anyone can deny it.  No one has led me to doubt in any way that the solidarity we have around Brexit is holding.  That is to be absolutely welcomed.<\/p> <p>  Obviously, people are happy with the work of the European Commission on vaccines.  We can see an organised situation as regards delivery across Europe and this can bring us to a better place.<\/p> <p>  The Minister of State spoke about the possibility of the conference becoming a conversation on economic recovery.  What are the views of the Minister of State on how people see this happening?  We can see that there has been an element of harmonisation around some of the health aspects.  There is no competence at European level in this area but we have definitely seen co-ordinated action that has been useful.<\/p> <p>  I am always somewhat apprehensive that we have varying views within Europe.  Some people have a highly conservative view on the stimulus we will need when we get through this gap and beyond it.  What is the view of the Minister of State on that?  How will the conference be part of that?<\/p> <p>  I am not entirely sure what some of the speakers who were before the committee previously said on the idea of the conference.  However, I understand reference was made to it being from the ground up in respect of where people want Europe to go or where they do not want it to go.  Nothing is ruled out or in.  I am always wary in respect of how much Lisbon or other frameworks can be stretched.  In fairness, most speakers said that nothing has been determined on whether the outworking will lead to referendums or whatever.<\/p> <p>  There are still major issues in Europe in dealing with migration and the rule of law.  We believe the rule of law is beyond the issues we have in the likes of Poland.  It is also an issue with Spain and Catalonia.  I am keen to hear the notions of the Minister of State on that.<\/p> <p>  The Minister of State also spoke about a plan for here whereby we would have engagement of the Houses of the Oireachtas and this committee.  How does the Minister of State see that happening?<\/p><p>A number of speakers, both internal and external, have spoken here about the fact that much of the scrutiny of European legislation was done at Westminster and that it will now not be done.  Therefore, there is a need for this State to raise its game.<\/p><p> When discussing the concept of a two-speed Europe, or an even more tiered Europe, a number of speakers believed there was probably a change of game in Europe owing to Brexit.  They expressed the view - I am not necessarily saying I agree - that there will be a main tier including all the big powers and that if a country is not part of it, it will be left behind.  However, that does not necessarily mean we are going to go along with what suits Germany and France on every occasion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2020112500002#F00500","speaker":"1498","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1606262400,"counter":427,"content":"<p>Deputy Richmond asked when a conference chair will be appointed.  There are two different positions.  Both the Parliament and Council have published positions so it is not just a question of a chair being appointed; it is a question of reconciling the two positions.  I am sure that can be done.  An agreement document will have to be produced.  I have not seen considerable work being done on this.  I believe this is because of the pandemic and Brexit, and also because of the multi-annual financial framework and the next-generation EU negotiations.  The Presidency is significant.  When I was first appointed as Minister of State, I expected this to be a major item on the General Affairs Council agenda.  It has not really been.  It is on the agenda for the informal video conference next week.  I believe it will be on the agenda of the main meeting of the General Affairs Council in December.<\/p><p>With regard to the conference chair, there is nonsense being circulated about Europe being for the elites but we certainly cannot have some grey-haired - I mean no disrespect in that I am going grey myself - elite person who has no relevance to every citizen.  Whoever takes on the position will have to be really relevant to all citizens.  We have to be very careful about who we pick.  It will have to be a listener and someone who works with people, not somebody who is going to tell us what to do or what to think.  It genuinely has to be from the ground up.<\/p><p>Most of my colleagues are aware that I have described the Citizens' Assemblies here as a genuine means not only of promoting debate among citizens but of promoting informed debate.  We were sceptical of the Citizens' Assembly in opposition but one thing I liked was that its meetings were informed by experts who gave unbiased analysis of the issues.  Discussions took place based on that expert input.  This is something I envisage.  There is obviously value in discussing and debating matters but this value is much enhanced if the process is informed by knowledge and unbiased advice given by experts.  This is something I would like to see when it gets to citizens.  If it does not get to citizens, it is not going to be very successful.<\/p><p>Policy priorities have to relate to issues of the greatest concern to our citizens.  With respect, I am aware that everyone in committees such as this is sceptical of the <i>Spitzenkandidat<\/i>process.  We do not believe something like that should be the focus of the conference.  That would have little relevance to our citizens.  The European Union necessarily has a complicated structure and I am not sure how it could be structured without an element of complication.  The European Union is multilingual and, as John Hume said, it is the result of the greatest peace process in world history.  The European Parliament clearly exists as an important expression of the democratic will of the citizens.  At the same time, the European Council retains power as the representative of the governments elected by the citizens.  Therefore, there are strong arguments to justify the complication of the European Union.  It is not a federal system.  Maybe direct election of a President is going too close to that.  I suspect many citizens are not in favour of it.  The bottom line, however, is that the system works.  Generally speaking, it has produced excellent candidates.  Nobody has had any difficulties with any of the individuals in position.<\/p><p>Issues raised at the conference should be issues of the greatest concern.  People tune out when it comes to institutional issues, mechanisms and ways of dealing with procedures.  At a time like this, I do not believe our citizens want to see us debating the ins and outs of processes and procedures; they want to see real action on real issues.  An example of this was when there was a proposal before the Citizens' Assembly to reduce the minimum age of those entitled to vote in an Irish presidential election from 35 to 18.  Most people around the table asked where it came out of and why it was relevant.  It was rejected.  It was not one of the recommendations made by the Citizens' Assembly at the time.  It struck me as something that was just not that relevant whereas genuine societal change did occur as a result of the Citizens' Assembly dealing with many relevant issues.  The assembly laid the groundwork for this change because people were interested and wanted to engage.  They want real actions on sustainability and climate that will make a genuine difference.  This is starting.  There will be major challenges associated with how we implement all our commitments, including in respect of innovation in our economy, the digital economy, privacy issues and economic growth that includes all citizens.  The ultimate outcome of the conference will be a report of the European Council, and then it will be up to the European Union to implement the recommendations.<\/p><p>The issue of own resources is a sensitive topic for many citizens, but certainly ours.  With regard to the multi-annual financial framework, there is a very limited own resource in terms of a plastics levy but we have no legally binding commitments to go beyond that.<\/p><p>With regard to accession, negotiations have gone well with the Republic of North Macedonia and Albania but there are difficulties.  I believe these can be resolved.  The difficulties involving Bulgaria and the Republic of North Macedonia can be dealt with bilaterally and should not hold up discussions.  We need to ensure that countries will be compliant and take on and embed the values of the European Union.  Why should such states not be members of the European Union?<\/p><p>Brexit negotiations are what they are.  People know what the main issues are.  They cover market access, governance and fisheries.  We constantly express our full support for the negotiating team.  It seems to us that it is in everybody's best interest that a deal be done.  It would be disastrous for Britain if it left without a deal.  It would also be highly damaging for Ireland and the rest of Europe.  We hope member states' interests are to the fore.  If they are, Britain will reach an agreement.<\/p><p>I thank Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute; for his comments.  It is very easy to talk about a main tier involving the big countries that is going to take over Europe and run our lives.  Deputy Howlin referred to a similar argument being made by the Prime Minister of a small country that is taking on the Presidency of the European Union in January.  It is not a case of big countries versus small countries.  Every member state, both big and small, has been very supportive of Ireland in regard to Brexit.  Every time their representatives open their mouths on Brexit, the two priorities are the Good Friday Agreement and the Single Market.  The solidarity has been tremendous.<\/p><p>Deputy Richmond said there are two speeds in that we are in the eurozone but not a full participant in respect of defence.  Regarding various policy issues that arise daily or monthly, various groups come together where there is a common interest.  Spain and Italy come together on issues of funding.  Generally speaking, there is a group including countries that support further cohesion funding.  There is the famous Frugal Four, or formerly the Frugal Five.  This involves a mix of countries, not all of them big.  Germany and France are not part of Frugal Four.  Ireland would come together with a group of like-minded nations on fishing.  This is a really important issue for Ireland.  It is a much more important issue for those states by the Irish Sea or North Sea than for those along the Mediterranean.  It is just a different issue.<\/p><p>We come together as issues arise but things are worked out in that complicated way in the European Council and European Parliament which, generally speaking, works out very successfully.  The notion that it is a big country versus a small country is absolutely not the case and is not my experience of how things operate.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2020112500002#G00200","speaker":"1503","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1606262400,"counter":429,"content":"<p>The contention had been made that one would be left behind.

The TII has asked Irish Ferries and Stena Line to stagger their arrival times but without much success.  The suggestion is that there will be a major snarl up of traffic in the Dublin Port tunnel, the M50 and the surrounding road networks, including motorways.  That would be an issue of concern.  Stena Line has raised concerns about the location of checkpoints in Dublin Port.  I note that Transport Infrastructure Ireland has set up a committee, a traffic management group, to consider the issue.  I appreciate that this is a matter for the Department of Transport but I say to the Minister of State that this is a crucial issue.  There is nothing surer that the citizens of Dublin will be very upset if the traffic is snarled up from day one because of the position in Dublin Port.  That is something we need to look at seriously at this stage and prevent any problems arising.  <\/p> <p>  I note what the Minister of State said about treaty change.  I support his view that the Government does not favour treaty change.  As he will have heard, this committee has discussed the Conference on the Future of Europe for several weeks with various points of view brought forward.  Some Members have suggested that we do not need treaty change, that we could exploit the existing treaties, including the Lisbon treaty.  In that regard, the issue of public health has certainly come on the agenda in the last year.  Does he see scope for public health becoming a competency of the European Union or is it a question of co-ordinating existing policies?<\/p> <p>  On consulting the citizens here in Ireland, the Minister of State made reference to citizens' assemblies and dialogues.  We are familiar with the citizens' dialogues that took place in 2018 and 2019.  They were organised by European Movement Ireland whose representatives have been before this committee to say how that worked.  Has he firmed up on how he wishes to consult with the citizens here in Ireland?  Obviously consultation with and engagement by citizens is really important.  Does he envisage something similar to 2018 and 2019 where citizens' dialogues were used or has he other ideas in mind?  When will he make a decision on that?  Will he wait for the formal structure to be put in place or is he giving consideration to that at this time?  <\/p> <p>  Several speakers have raised the issue of common values and the rule of law so I will not go into that.  I will make a final point about something that the Minister of State said in his last contribution on alliances across the European Union.  I think he said that Ireland is part of informal alliances for fishing.  Can he please give more detail on what alliances, informal or otherwise, we are involved in within the European Union?  What issues have we come together on with other EU states?  Presumably, agriculture is another one and the protection of the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP.  I know that it is all very informal and he will not be quoted by other EU states about formal alliances and so forth.   I am interested in hearing his views because the UK is leaving the European Union, which is a big loss from the point of view of an ally for several issues.  What alliances does he see Ireland, as a nation State, becoming informally involved in?  What are the issues in that regard?      <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2020112500002#H00600","speaker":"1552"},{"type":"speech","time":1606262400,"counter":434,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for coming here and sharing his views this morning.  The future of Europe was a germ of an idea that started many moons ago to bring Europe and the EU closer to the people of the European Union yet here we are, years later, still having a difference of opinion, tussle or disagreement as to what we should do from a policy perspective.  If there was ever a sign of a need to change how we do things and become closer to the people, it is that we need a hell of a lot more action but an awful lot less talking about what is going on.  The human rights veto that is being used by particular countries to hide and mask their infringements on human rights is probably a discussion that we could have collectively and individually, as member states, as to how to protect our people and bring the European Union closer.<\/p> <p>  I hope that we are coming to the end of a very long and arduous Brexit negotiation process.  Please God, it will bring forward not something that we will be happy with but something that we will be able to tolerate, and live with, from a trade perspective.  I am curious as to what plans, if any, have been put in place by the European Union officialdom and all of our agencies to continue our relationship with the parts of the United Kingdom that specifically voted to stay such as Scotland and Northern Ireland.  I am not specifically talking about trade.  I am talking about alliances where, as nation member states and neighbours, we need to continue to co-operate with each other. <\/p> <p>  In terms of the climate action proposals, I am lucky enough to be part of a research group that is helping the Scottish Government to create plans for it to reach out to the rest of the European Union and Europeans to make sure that we do not forget that they are still our neighbours and did not choose to leave.  What plans has the European Union to continue to foster its relationships with Scotland, Northern Ireland, Wales and, indeed, England well beyond the trade plans that will come out of Brexit?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2020112500002#H00700","speaker":"1653"},{"type":"speech","time":1606262400,"counter":435,"content":"<p>I take on board what was said about traffic in Dublin.  That is why I visited the ports of Rosslare and Dublin.  For Dublin Port, substantial planning has been done and co-ordinated by Dublin City Council.  I have checked this matter on a regular basis.  One can have all the arguments about rules of origin but the face of Brexit will be a lorry driver stuck in traffic or a fisherman stuck on a boat depending on which flag he or she sails under.  This is a crucial issue.  The Department of Transport and the Taoiseach have been constantly checking that this is going to be okay.  We have been assured that it is but will check it again on foot of what has been just said.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the location of checkpoints in Dublin Port, a massive amount of work and building has been done on Dublin Port.  We are not building it from scratch.  Due to Brexit one must place checkpoints on a site that was never designed for them so they are located in different locations, and we must comply with the European Union's customs code.  There are a lot of constraints and difficulties in terms of building infrastructure.<\/p><p>Much of what will come by lorry container will be registered in advance and these items are computerised.  Essentially, the Revenue Commissioners will check items they believe need to be checked, and they already do that to some extent when looking for contraband etc.<\/p><p> For example, a lorry driver on a ferry coming over here will have an app for this.  When the driver sees Tusker Rock lighthouse, a notification will come up on the phone that is green, orange or red.  If the notification is green, the driver knows he or she can more or less just go straight off the boat and there does not have to be a physical customs check, although it will be documented.  If the notification is red, the driver will have to go to a particular location either in Dublin Port or Kilrane if the driver is coming into Rosslare Port.  It is a similar distance in either case, although the driver technically goes outside the port in Rosslare.<\/p><p> It is not the case that every lorry will be checked and much of the checking will be done online.  There will be difficulties, including with the checking of animals.  Items that would not be allowed into the European Union, deal or no deal, would cause difficulties.  We are hoping traffic will not be snarled up but it is a constant issue.  I am glad it has been raised here and I will raise it again.<\/p><p> I will not go into the details of the fishing negotiations except to say this is one of the key priorities for us.  Economically and on a national scale, this is not a huge element but it is crucial in certain sectors and locations.  The Government is acutely conscious of that.<\/p><p> Deputy Haughey mentioned informal alliances.  There are quite a few of these.  I am not the line Minister so I do not engage directly, but I know from speaking to my European colleagues on items that are important to them that, for example, we are like-minded with a group of 16, mostly small, member states on the importance of the Single Market to us.  By the way, that is reassuring to them as well because they want to ensure the Single Market is protected after Brexit.  It is very much in our interest.<\/p><p> There was mention of agriculture and France has been a traditional ally on such matters, as members know, and we can also see Spain and Greece in that group.  With the fishing issue, there are coastal states affected by Brexit, generally taking in Spain up to Denmark.  I certainly know that geography.  Portuguese boats may fish in Norwegian waters, for example, so although it is affected by Brexit, it would not amount to the same concerns as ours.  I learned this by speaking to my Portuguese colleague.<\/p><p> There is a rule of law group and the committee will be delighted to hear we are a member of that.  It comprises Germany and the Benelux countries, and it is a strong rule of law group.  It is my intention to remain vocal on the matter.  France and the Nordic countries are also strong.  These are themes that would also arise in bilateral meetings.<\/p><p> We are also part of a climate group with Nordic and Baltic countries as well as France.  I believe a public joint statement was made by those member states and it would have involved the line departments.  There is another climate group that includes other countries that may have difficulties in agreeing some matters, but we are on the side of the angels in this regard.<\/p><p> There are informal alliances on policy matters and there are also political alliances that involve our political parties.  They are useful in the national interest, so every party is able to liaise with other groups.  Fianna F&aacute;il is part of the ALDE group and there is also the EPP group.  There is the group for socialists, of which the Labour Party is a member, and Sinn F&eacute;in is also in a group.  I apologise but the name escapes me.  These are very useful engagements for all parties.<\/p><p> It is no harm some to set out some of the health initiatives, if I have time.  Everybody has seen that the European Union has played a key role dealing with Covid-19.  The joint purpose in the vaccine, for example, will bring major benefits for a small country.  There are six agreements either signed or about to be signed, ensuring everybody in the European Union will have access to a vaccine.  This is transformative, and it would not be possible for us as a country on our own.  There is also travel co-ordination, and there has been and will continue to be financial support.  The conference on the future of Europe will support a greater run in public health and health in general.<\/p><p> We are open to exploring these matters.  Whenever trade agreements are discussed in the D&aacute;il or in public, or when European Union treaties are similarly discussed, somebody always argues there is a hidden privatisation agenda that will take over all our hospitals and they will all be run for profit over public health.  Inevitably, if there is any increase in the competences of the European Union in a health perspective, we will have to deal with the argument.  We would defeat the argument successfully, but we will have to deal with it.  Such arguments have always been completely false but we can see the European Union working for the public and public health.  We are trying to protect each and every one of our citizens through a vaccine, which is very welcome and I hope the public responds positively.<\/p><p> With regard to Senator Doherty's comments on plans in place to continue the relationships with parts of the UK that had hoped to stay, Northern Ireland is officially part of the United Kingdom and we want the strongest possible relationship there.  We do not want a border and it is not going to happen.  We want the movement of goods to be as free as it always has been.  We want people to move for educational purposes, for example.  It is one island and I certainly consider it one country.  The North-South Ministerial Council has been effectively reactivated and does really positive work.  There is much work going in various departments with colleagues from the North, which is really welcome.<\/p><p> The British-Irish Council has been reactivated, which is really useful, as that includes devolved governments from the North, Scotland, Wales and the Crown dependencies as well, including the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands.  It is a really useful engagement.  There is also the shared island initiative that has been set up in the Department of the Taoiseach under the programme for Government.  It is really important.  The bottom line is that although the United Kingdom is leaving the European Union, it is in all our interests to maintain the best possible relationship.  The relationship is in a kind of holding pattern and the plane is flying over the airport, waiting to land, but it has not landed yet.  It is in a difficult place currently and there are some very frustrating issues being discussed.  The relationship must be reset in the new year and I know this committee and the Government will be more than happy to do whatever it takes to do this.<\/p><p> The ties that bind are incredible and we have so many links.  Even last night I retweeted a tweet about a Manx-speaking school in the Isle of Man.  Its Gaelic language is a variation of ours.  There are many links, with hundreds of thousands of Irish citizens in Britain, so the links must be maintained in all our interests.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2020112500002#H00800","speaker":"1503","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1606262400,"counter":437,"content":"<p>I had a question on consultation with the public here in Ireland and when there might be a decision on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2020112500002#J00200","speaker":"1552"},{"type":"speech","time":1606262400,"counter":438,"content":"<p>Ultimately, we will have to wait for the format of the conference to be agreed.

He said that some people are overly concerned about the privatisation drive from Europe.  However, there is a fear about this and Europe being against state intervention.

If the vaccine is rolled out, then we will have public meetings.  As a young political nerd, I attended meetings on the Nice treaty back in the early 2000s before I was ever really involved in electoral politics.  I remember being at a packed meeting at the Westcourt Hotel in Drogheda.  It was a good model as there were many people at it.  This was for the Nice treaty, one which might not have engaged people as much.<\/p> <p>  The Lisbon treaty referendum failed.  What happened then was this committee, of which I was a member at the time, engaged with the issues and asked what were the problems the public had with it which caused it to vote \"No\".  The Government did its own research as well.  Those issues were addressed at the subsequent referendum.  Whenever one hears people say we had to revote on that treaty, we did but we addressed the four key issues which the public stated had determined why they had voted \"No\".  We have loads of examples.  I mentioned the citizens' assembly as a way of engaging with citizens.  That can happen.<\/p> <p>  I was at the forum on the future of Europe at Dublin Castle.  I am not sure that is the best locale for this type of thing.  The Westcourt Hotel in Drogheda or the parish hall in Duleek would be much more preferable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2020112500002#K00300","speaker":"1503"},{"type":"speech","time":1606262400,"counter":442,"content":"<p>What about the Carrickdale Hotel?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2020112500002#K00400","speaker":"1498"},{"type":"speech","time":1606262400,"counter":443,"content":"<p>We will be up in that area in a few weeks.

We want to ensure that European Union funding reaches communities.  That is another example of European engagement.<\/p> <p>  We will have legitimate debates on state intervention.  The European Union has always been neutral on whether something is publicly or privately owned.  Traditionally, European Union policy in the treaties has been not to give an unfair advantage to one company over another as that generally distorts the market and does not work well.  These are the types of policy that failed in the 1970s in Britain where it picked out particular companies.  Those rules have been eased off a bit in the context of the pandemic, obviously.  If a no-deal Brexit is as disastrous as we fear, we will also be looking for further easing of them to deal with the emerging situation.<\/p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute; is correct.  There has been a sea change at European and global level in this regard.  More than ten years ago, we had the banking crisis.  The priority was to save the banks.  To be honest, that was handed down.  It was a terrible policy which many countries were forced to adopt.  That has changed, however.  The genuine effort now seems to be to protect the citizen.  We are giving pandemic unemployment payments, which are significantly greater than the regular dole.  We are spending as much as we possibly can with the biggest budget ever.  That is the same in many European countries as well.  The European Union is there at the forefront trying to get people's health protected through vaccine contracts.  There has been a sea change for the better and those lessons have been learned.  We have to be constantly on our guard as well, however.  That is where citizen engagement comes in.<\/p> <p>  Of course there are items of government decision-making that people criticise and are wrong.  This is a pandemic which none of us alive have experienced before.  Generally speaking, European governments have reacted really well.  The European Union was probably a little bit slow off the mark at the start of pandemic.  Again, however, faced with this crisis, travel stopped immediately and people were not able to get together.  There were difficulties but the European Union has got things together and is actually providing a really effective response on behalf of all of us.  Long may that continue.  The public will engage with that as these are real policies that make real differences in their daily lives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2020112500002#K00700","speaker":"1503"},{"type":"speech","time":1606262400,"counter":446,"content":"<p>While he cannot give the entire plan now, how does the Minister of State foresee the future stimulus programme being rolled out?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2020112500002#K00800","speaker":"1498"},{"type":"speech","time":1606262400,"counter":447,"content":"<p>This is still under discussion.

They are being worked on at the moment, particularly by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and other line Departments as to how the money is spent.  Obviously, we have the multi-annual financial framework which provides certainty to the European Union budgets.

I understand that a large part of the agreement, 95%, is drafted and that there are place holders in terms of the outstanding issues that are well-rehearsed at this stage.  The agreement will have to be translated and read by every national parliament and the European Parliament.  The European Parliament will need to give its approval to it and, why not?  They are our democratically-elected representatives.  Even if that delays the process by a day or two, it is crucial we get that approval separate from the approval of the member states of the European Union.  That is the time pressure.

There has been no shortage of examples of EU representatives familiarising themselves with the real pinch issues for Ireland as a country, with a particular focus on the Border.  The Dutch ambassador and the Danish ambassador came to Donegal.  I know other ambassadors did too but I met the Dutch and Danish ambassadors when they were in the county.  Angela Merkel took time out to meet people on the ground, including, for example, George Mills from Culdaff, a strong advocate for the hauliers, and Kathleen Gillespie from Derry who lost her husband during the Troubles.  There was a concerted effort by representative voices throughout Europe and within the Commission to familiarise themselves with the main issues.  <\/p> <p>  There were strong citizenship engagement platforms organised by the Department of Foreign Affairs.  I do not know how meetings were held but there were a lot of them on a sectoral or issue-led basis.  The citizens' engagement was specifically on the act of doing.  As the Minister of State pointed out, there has to be a relevance to the discussion around the future of Europe.  We can have town hall meetings to talk about the future but the future will be about current issues.  There is no shortage of pinch points and relevant issues that we have to deal with for our citizens.<\/p> <p>  In opening up a discussion on the future of Europe we can get into very dangerous territory because people will question the validity and relevance of how it affects and impacts on their lives in the current times.  I will give an example.  The issue that is playing on the minds of hauliers is not Border checks, but an issue arising with regard to the certificate of professional competence, CPC.  The majority of hauliers got their certification in England and they have been driving on that basis for decades but there is now an insistence that they retrain and undertake another certification of competence which may take up to six months.  That costs money.  Hauliers and people involved in the industry see this as a revenue-creating exercise and one short on common sense.  I ask the Minister of State and his officials to follow up on this matter on behalf of the committee.  This is an area in which we can instil confidence in terms of being responsive and active in the interests of hauliers who are going to be facing a number of challenges come 1 January.  This is an added issue in respect of which we need to be responsive and vigilant.  I ask the Minister of State to highlight this matter with his officials as one on which the Government will need to react swiftly.<\/p> <p>  The final issue I want to raise is one I raised a previous meeting, that is, the start-up relief for entrepreneurs, SURE, fund, which the Minister of State will know is a &euro;100 billion loan fund to mitigate against unemployment risk as a result of Covid.<\/p><p>To date, &euro;31 billion has already been disbursed to Italy, Spain, Poland, Greece, Croatia, Lithuania, Cyprus, Slovenia, Malta and Latvia.  I note there is an application by Ireland.  Could the Minister of State confirm that figure?  If he does not have the figure, could he get back to the committee on it?  Most importantly, when will this funding be disbursed to Ireland?  It is an important fund for temporary jobs and short-term jobs, especially as the PUP payment now will be stretched out until the end of March.  We will need much more support post March as well.<\/p><p> The Minister of State mentioned an issue to do with the rule of law and the role of national parliaments.  We asked the Commissioner, Mr. Didier Reynders, a question at a recent meeting on the rule of law about the publication of a report on the rule of law and the role of national parliaments.  This issue was also raised by a number of parliaments and we will await feedback on that.<\/p><p> Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Aire St&aacute;it ar&iacute;s as ucht teacht in&aacute;r l&aacute;thair inniu.

Of course that is a loan and not a grant.  Thankfully, our financial position means we are able to borrow from other places but, as I understand it, there has been a drawdown.  I will get the Chairman the exact position.<\/p> <p>  On the rule of law, it is not my role to tell the committee what to do about it.

It is important that we are a strong voice for the rule of law and human rights in the EU.  I strongly encourage, and indeed the General Affairs Council strongly encourages, national parliaments to take a strong stance on that and to be involved.  As I have said, Mr. Reynders has said that he will address committees, etc.  That is a matter for the committee.  Mr. Reynders is more than happy to do whatever the committee wants to do.

As Deputies know, it has been an exceptional year, and there have been some significant and unforeseen factors that have impacted on the Revenue&rsquo;s funding.The Supplementary Estimate for Vote 9 is to meet the 2020 shortfall associated with appropriations-in-aid, which is expenditure that the Department would normally receive, and Brexit-related expenditure required as part of our no-deal preparations. The total shortfall to be met is &euro;7.819 million, which is less than half a per cent of the Estimate approved for the year.  While &euro;7 million is a significant figure, it is less than a half a per cent of the Revenue's normal operational budget.<\/p><p>To further explain the background, the Covid-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on trade, resulting in a projected shortfall in appropriations-in-aid income of &euro;7.1 million in 2020.  This shortfall is primarily a consequence of Covid-19 restrictions and their impact on<font color=\"#FF0000\"> <\/font>customs collection costs associated with appropriations-in-aid.  During the course of the year, the Irish customs collected a substantial amount in fees processing customs documents for imports into both Ireland and the UK, where the company doing the importing was located in Ireland.  As a result of the shortfall of trade in the retail sector, there has been a significant reduction in the lack of actual imports, with the knock-on effect of a reduction in fees that the Revenue Commissioners would have expected to collect but did not arise because of a reduction in trade.  Although Revenue has seen significant underspend in its current funding, these savings are now required to meet overspends in office premises expenses due to Brexit infrastructure requirements.<\/p><p>Revenue&rsquo;s 2020 budget has also been impacted by minor overspend in the category of motor vehicles and revenue instruments.  This increased expenditure has arisen due to required maintenance work for multiple years in respect of Revenue&rsquo;s three mobile scanners and the acquisition of personal protective equipment, PPE, for customs staff.  The total amount required under that heading is &euro;719,000.<\/p><p>I am satisfied that approval of the Supplementary Estimate of the Revenue will allow the Revenue Commissioners to deal with such requirements between now and the end of the year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2020112500002#A00300","speaker":"1590"},{"type":"speech","time":1606262400,"counter":477,"content":"<p>Are there any questions in relation to the Estimate?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2020112500002#A00400","speaker":"1496"},{"type":"speech","time":1606262400,"counter":478,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for bringing the Estimate before the committee.

Essentially, the Revenue expected some years ago that the required additional staff to deal with Brexit would have been in the order of 600.  The estimate during the course of the year was that that figure will eventually be 900.  Over 700 of those are currently in place and working.  The recruitment campaign has been ongoing for the other 200 in recent months and is expected to be completed as soon as possible in the new year to bring the full complement up to 900, which is the expected figure.  We are already well in excess of 700 as we speak, who will deal specifically with Brexit.  Most of those staff will be at clerical officer grade.

I have a query on table 1.  Can the Minister of State clarify the shortfall in terms of SASP, single authorisation for simplified procedures?  Can he clarify what occurred and give a bit more detail?<\/p> <p>  On the retail export scheme, I am sure many of us have been contacted by huge numbers of constituents on this.  The fact of the matter is that the hospitality sector, especially in the likes of Galway, has been massively affected by Covid-19 and the resulting restrictions.  This is another hit for the tourism industry.  I know an amendment has been submitted to change it to &euro;75 but we know that 50% of all transactions are for less than &euro;75 so it is another hit.  Since this scheme is operated by Revenue, will the Minister of State explain the rationale behind it?  I am concerned, as are many people in the Galway area, in particular.<\/p> <p>  We saw that the Central Statistics Office, CSO, published yesterday that there has been a 38% decrease in traffic volumes.  This is up to November so it does not include the level 5 restrictions currently in place.  The Minister of State knows well that there are insurance companies out there who have given just &euro;15 back in SuperValu vouchers for people who have not been able to use their car, such as people who are working from home and that kind of thing.  That is a huge cost and the insurance companies are ripping off ordinary customers at the best of times.  Now in the middle of a pandemic, when people have lost their income and are not using their cars and the CSO tells us there is nearly 40% less traffic on the roads, they are being hit again.<\/p> <p>  We need to see at least 20% of insurance premiums paid back.  Does the Minister of State agree?  What has he done about this?  We in Sinn F&eacute;in have written to the insurance federation on this but it is important that action is immediately taken.  People cannot afford this and 20% of premiums must immediately come back to the customers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2020112500002#A00700","speaker":"1579"},{"type":"speech","time":1606262400,"counter":481,"content":"<p>On VAT and the amount tourists can claim on spending in the country, that matter is coming up in the Brexit Bill in the Convention Centre later this afternoon.

There are amendments down and that matter will be discussed at that meeting because it cannot be dealt with here in respect of the context of the Estimates for 2020.  That is a 2021 matter, covered by the upcoming legislation.<\/p> <p>  On insurance, while it is not a matter for this debate, the committee has extended an invitation to me, as the Minister of State with responsibility for insurance, to come before the committee as soon as the date can be arranged and I am happy to do that.  We can have a full discussion on the insurance issue.  The Deputy's point is well noted.  As she said, there were some reductions but that matter will be discussed at a joint meeting of this committee as soon as we agree a date, which will happen very soon.<\/p> <p>  Finally, the Deputy asked a question about why there were some reductions.  There were some reductions in the appropriations-in-aid related to payroll because, as a result of Covid, there was a significant reduction in overtime for a number of staff in the Department.  This resulted in a reduction in superannuation contributions that normally accrued during the year.  That is why there is a slight reduction in that heading in relation to Covid.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2020112500002#A00800","speaker":"1590"},{"type":"speech","time":1606262400,"counter":482,"content":"<p>That is an interesting clarification in terms of SASP so I thank the Minister of State for that.  <\/p> <p>  On the insurance situation, the reality is that this is a crisis for people.

They are not ready for the responsibility they will have in the chain of the customs clearance process.  I encourage the Minister of State and his colleagues to press this sector of business people a little harder because the storage of parcels that cannot be cleared will cause immense problems, including in respect of the delivery of consignments etc.  An examination is required at the coalface to make sure arrangements are in place.  The bigger companies, such as the one I mentioned, should be encouraged to feed back to the Minister of State some of the data they have and their concerns regarding the Brexit-readiness, or otherwise, of their customers.

It might phone for a part when the importation truck is still in England but because no customs clearance docket will have been prepared in advance, it will find the part cannot be brought on that truck and that it will have to be brought on another two days later.  Delays will be caused, especially for small businesses, some of which have not fully grasped what is happening.  Serious delays will be caused to their business in January and February if they do not get Brexit-ready.  The Chairman's point is well made.  Through the Revenue Commissioners, we will get on to the small companies.  The Revenue Commissioners have a record of everybody who goes through customs every year.

L&eacute;ir&iacute;onn roinnt de na himscr&uacute;duithe at&aacute; d&eacute;anta ag an gCoimisin&eacute;ir Teanga le blianta beaga anuas c&eacute; chomh t&aacute;bhachtach agus at&aacute; na hachtach&aacute;in sin.  Tagra&iacute;m, mar shampla, don imscr&uacute;d&uacute; a rinne s&eacute; ar Acht an Gharda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, 2005 at&aacute; in ainm agus a bheith ag treisi&uacute; st&aacute;das na Gaeilge sa Ghaeltacht.  Tagra&iacute;m chomh maith don Acht um Plean&aacute;il agus Forbairt, 2000 a bhfuil an aidhm ch&eacute;anna ag for&aacute;il d&aacute; gcuid cosaint na Gaeilge sa Ghaeltacht.

Caithfear aghaidh a thabhairt ar an bhfadhb seo tr&iacute; fhor&aacute;il ar leith faoin nGaeltacht a chur sa Bhille n&oacute; tr&iacute; dul i ngleic leis an gceist sin sna caighde&aacute;in teanga.

Baineann sciar suntasach de na gear&aacute;in a fhaigheann an Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga leis an bhfadhb seo, 8% in 2018 agus beagnach 7% anuraidh.  In alt 4 den Bhille, luaitear dualgas a bheith ar chomhlacht poibl&iacute; leaganacha Gaeilge d'ainm agus de sheoladh a thaifeadadh agus a &uacute;s&aacute;id i gceart, ach n&iacute; leagfar an dualgas sin go huathoibr&iacute;och ar gach comhlacht poibl&iacute; n&aacute; n&iacute; thugtar sc&aacute;la ama maidir leis na c&oacute;rais faisn&eacute;ise agus chumars&aacute;ide.  Mar sin, d'fh&eacute;adfadh s&eacute; blianta a ghlacadh sara mbeadh an dualgas seo i bhfeidhm ar chomhlachta&iacute; poibl&iacute;.<br\/><br\/>Ina theannta sin, caithfidh ionada&iacute;ocht n&iacute;os leithne a bheith ar an gcoiste comhairleach um sheirbh&iacute;s&iacute; Gaeilge.

As &aacute;iteanna lasmuigh den Ghaeltacht a th&aacute;inig 82% de na gear&aacute;in a fuair an Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga anuraidh, rud a l&eacute;ir&iacute;onn t&aacute;bhacht an phobail mh&oacute;r sin, ach n&iacute; thugtar aitheantas do sin sa strucht&uacute;r molta.

N&iacute; l&eacute;ir, mar sin, c&eacute;n tuiscint ar riachtanais an phobail a bheadh ag an gcoiste molta.  Is ceist dhigiteach agus chasta &iacute; sol&aacute;thar seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; poibl&iacute; go d&aacute;theangach, agus le bheith mac&aacute;nta faoi, is beag taith&iacute; at&aacute; againn ar a leith&eacute;id in &Eacute;irinn.

They are very welcome.<\/p><p>Speaking not just for members of the committee but for all Members of the Oireachtas, I thank the witnesses and each and every member of their teams for the work they have been doing over the past nine months in processing claims for the pandemic unemployment payment as expeditiously as possible, as well as for dealing with queries raised by Members of the Oireachtas in a prompt manner.  It is not unusual for any of us to receive replies from officials in the Department late in the evening or on Saturdays indicating that documentation is outstanding or that something needs to be addressed.  I take this opportunity to thank each and every one of the staff for their work and their commitment.<\/p><p>The committee recently commenced an examination and a review of the pandemic unemployment payment scheme as administered by the Department of Social Protection and has sought public submissions on this matter.  Today's engagement will assist the committee as we work to present a report on our findings to the Minister in advance of the social welfare Bill coming before the Houses.  As part of our ongoing work, we are also examining the interaction of the pandemic unemployment payment with the temporary wage subsidy scheme and the employment wage subsidy scheme.  We will publish submissions on the committee's website.  There have been clear anomalies in the operation of the pandemic unemployment payment, which is understandable as it was introduced literally overnight.  There have also been issues in its interaction with the various wage subsidy schemes since those supports were introduced last March, and thousands of people and families have been impacted.  We look forward to engaging with the witnesses on these matters.<\/p><p>Members of the committee and of the Houses have absolute privilege in respect of statements made to either House of the Oireachtas or before a committee.

I thank him and members of the committee for the invitation to attend to discuss the pandemic unemployment payment scheme, or the PUP, as it is known.  My name is R&oacute;n&aacute;n Hession and I am the assistant secretary general in the Department of Social Protection with responsibility for working-age policy.  I am joined by my colleague, Teresa Leonard, who is assistant secretary general with responsibility for operational matters.<\/p> <p>  The PUP was introduced in March of this year as an emergency response to the huge and sudden increase in the loss of employment arising from the imposition of necessary public health restrictions to address the Covid-19 pandemic.  It was introduced first at a rate of &euro;203 per week as a means to fast-track payment of an unprecedented volume of claims.  The intention was that claims from people with qualified adults or dependants would then be prioritised and re-rated at an appropriate higher rate of payment.  When, given the claim load, it became evident that this would not be possible, the rate of payment was increased to &euro;350 and aligned with the rate for a two-person household on a standard jobseeker claim.  This payment rate was also broadly equivalent to the net weekly earnings in the two most affected sectors, namely retail and hospitality.  Within two weeks of the PUP being announced, we received and processed 389,000 applications.  This was equivalent to a 19-month claim load in one fortnight.  By the peak on 5 May, we were issuing payments to 602,000 people at a cost of some &euro;209 million per week.  By that time more than 1.1 million people were in receipt of State supports either via the live register, the PUP or the temporary wage subsidy scheme.<\/p> <p>  Changes were subsequently introduced in June to link the payment rate to prior earnings, and since the move to level 5 restrictions the PUP is paid at four rates as follows.  For those with prior weekly earnings of less than &euro;200 per week, the rate of the PUP is &euro;203 per week.  On average, this is 190% of prior earnings.  For those with prior weekly earnings between &euro;200 and &euro;299.99 per week the rate of the PUP is &euro;250 per week.  On average, this is 106% of prior earnings.  For those with prior weekly earnings between &euro;300 and &euro;399.99 per week the rate of the PUP is &euro;300 per week.  On average, this is 90% of prior earnings.  A person who previously earned &euro;400 or more per week receives a PUP rate of &euro;350 per week.  On average, this is 58% of prior earnings.<\/p> <p>  In addition to the changes to payment rates, and as outlined in briefing material provided last week, the Department has, since the PUP was introduced, enhanced the processes and systems used to verify prior employment status and earnings.  All claims are now checked against Revenue Commissioners records of employment and earnings to validate prior employment status and to set the correct rate of payment.  Where a person's employment status or earnings cannot be validated, he or she is contacted and invited to submit supplementary information to enable us to check his or her status and to process the claim to completion.<\/p> <p>  On 16 November we issued payments valued at &euro;103.8 million to 350,072 people in receipt of the PUP.  To date, numbers in receipt of the PUP have therefore increased by just under 150,000 since restrictions were introduced at the start of October and by just under 106,000 since the introduction of level 5 restrictions on 7 October.  These figures are in addition to the 203,172 people who were reported as being on the live register as of the end of October.<\/p> <p>  From a sectoral perspective, those most impacted sectors, measured in terms of PUP recipients during the initial onset of the pandemic, included accommodation and food, wholesale and retail, and construction.  All three recovered to varying degrees during the lifting of restrictions over the summer.  With the introduction of restrictions, the accommodation and food sector is impacted to the most significant extent, with wholesale and retail impacted to a lesser extent than may have been anticipated.<\/p> <p>  From a regional perspective, while the introduction of level 5 restrictions has seen increases across all regions, PUP numbers remain below peak levels in all areas.<\/p> <p>  In age terms, under-25s make up a proportionately higher share of current recipients than was the case at the peak.  Given the high concentration of young workers in hospitality and retail, this is unsurprising.<\/p> <p>  As for gender, at the peak just over 40% of recipients were female.  The most recent data, which capture the initial impact of level 5 restrictions, indicate that the proportion of males and females on the PUP is now almost equal.  This is likely a consequence of the different sectoral composition of those on the PUP compared with the initial peak.  For example, construction, which is a largely male-dominated industry, employs more than 148,000 people across the country and was closed at the initial phases but remains open under level 5.<\/p> <p>  A number of changes have been made to the PUP scheme in recent weeks.  Following the announcement in the budget, it is now possible for a self-employed person to earn up to &euro;480 in a four-week period without it affecting his or her PUP claim.  This addresses concerns raised in particular by taxi drivers and those in the arts and culture sector.  We have also revised the reference period for the calculation of prior earnings in order that those with employment records since February can receive the appropriate PUP payment.<\/p> <p>  We have a number of important projects under way, including payment of the Christmas bonus.  The bonus will be paid at 100% of the relevant PUP rate of payment.  The PUP bonus week is the entitlement week ending 3 December 2020.  A person who has been in continuous receipt of PUP since Friday, 7 August, will satisfy that condition.  In addition, any person in receipt of the PUP for the week ending 3 December who has returned to work and who has an aggregate of at least 17 weeks on the PUP will also qualify for the bonus on the pay date of 8 December.  In other words, the 17 weeks do not have to be continuous.<\/p> <p>  Before I conclude, I wish to pay tribute to the staff within the Department who have worked tirelessly since March to ensure that those affected by the Covid restrictions receive the financial support they need.  This has been demanding at a time when, as a Department, we have had to adapt our work practices in order to prioritise the safety and well-being of our staff and customers.  We have provided briefing to the committee setting out further detail on the scheme, which I hope is useful in informing the committee's deliberations.  We are happy to take any questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2020112500002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. R&oacute;n&aacute;n Hession"},{"type":"speech","time":1606262400,"counter":591,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Hession.

I think approximately 12,000 people from the arts and culture sector are currently claiming the PUP.  The size of the sector overall is approximately 55,000 people, according to the CSO data.  At the peak approximately14,000 were on the PUP, so the current figure is slightly below the peak.  A number of different issues have been raised with us by this sector.  Many of the people in the sector are freelance, and there was a question around their ability to do a small amount of work without losing the PUP.  Originally, when we were interpreting the legislation, we had given advice and guidance that people were able to do a small amount of work if it was intermittent, sporadic, etc.  In response to concerns raised by the sector, one of the measures announced in the budget was the introduction of a &euro;480 earnings limit for those people so they had clarity on what they could earn while still retaining their PUP payments.  There are further measures for people who earn beyond that limit through the part-time job incentive to allow them to return to a position of fuller employment.  There is a wide range of issues in this sector.  The Minister, Deputy Martin, has published a task force report which addresses a wide range of issues beyond social welfare, going into what that sector needs.  Clearly, the sector has been heavily impacted by the pandemic and faces a number of challenges, but overall we have tried to continue positive and constructive engagement with it.<\/p><p>Overall, we have tried to continue to engage positively and constructively with the sector.

There are several things at stake here.  We have been actively involved with the Aer Lingus staff since 1 September.  All the applications we have received in that period have now been processed.  More than 3,200 cases are involved.  To put the whole issue in context, two schemes to support employers and employees in employment are currently operating.  The temporary Covid-19 wage subsidy scheme was introduced early this year.  Aer Lingus took part and its employees were paid using that scheme.  The temporary Covid-19 wage subsidy scheme is not compatible with the Covid-19 pandemic unemployment payment.  A claimant cannot receive both.  The temporary Covid-19 wage subsidy scheme marks a recipient as employed.  At that point, some Aer Lingus employees made applications to the Department which have not yet been processed.  On 1 September the temporary Covid-19 wage subsidy scheme was replaced by the employment wage subsidy scheme, which is payable to the employer.  That payment is compatible with jobseeker's benefit.  The Department has processed all of those claims, which I referred to initially.<\/p> <p>  We have now set up a group of deciding officers to process the claims from the period prior to 1 September.  Each of these claims is quite complex and must be examined individually.  We must determine whether a claimant received the temporary Covid-19 wage subsidy scheme, the periods of time for which he or she did so and the periods for which he or she was employed.  Employers paid remuneration to some employees for some periods and actually increased their wages.  The temporary Covid-19 wage subsidy scheme allowed employers to top up employees' wages.  As such, claims made prior to 1 September are very complicated.  The only way to examine them with any thoroughness is to set up a group of deciding officers, which is now working on them one by one.  That work commenced last week.  We will go through each and every claim and determine an outcome for each individual. <\/p> <p>  We have also made an arrangement with Aer Lingus.  If we ask its employees for particular information, Aer Lingus is aware of what we require and will immediately supply it to the claimant via email.  It will take time, but we hope to get through the claims in the next several weeks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2020112500002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Teresa Leonard"},{"type":"speech","time":1606262400,"counter":595,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Hession for his opening statement.  I would like to ask a couple of questions arising from the statement and the briefing document.  The initial rate of the Covid-19 pandemic unemployment payment was &euro;203.  It quickly moved to &euro;350.  Would it be fair to say that it was acknowledged that a worker who had lost his or her job could not live on &euro;203, particularly in light of the fact that the highest rate of &euro;350 just about covers half of the average worker's prior earnings?<\/p> <p>  It was announced in the recent budget that people could earn &euro;480 per four-week period and retain the Covid-19 pandemic unemployment payment.  Do the witnesses have any idea how many workers have taken advantage of that and in which sectors it has been utilised?  That was referenced in the submission to this committee from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU.  The cuts, or \"calibrations\" as I think they have been called, are due to be introduced in February.  The Covid-19 pandemic unemployment payment rates will be reduced to &euro;250 and &euro;203.  Has that been reconsidered in light of recipients' prior earnings?<\/p> <p>  According to emails I have received, the issue for Aer Lingus workers did not so much concern the payments and their administration.  Employees were being actively blocked from getting their forms signed by their employer.  I raised this with the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Heather Humphreys, and she acknowledged that the Department had spoken to Aer Lingus on several occasions.  That kind of carry-on sets a very dangerous precedent.  Any future engagement with Aer Lingus must include how these things are resolved with employees.  All TDs received horrific emails from Aer Lingus employees who were in really difficult situations.  We do not want to see that happening again.<\/p> <p>  The briefing document makes several references to the fact that those currently on the &euro;203 payment, who had prior earnings of &euro;200 or less, are better off than when they were at work.  I have heard that said a lot and I do not think it is a good thing.  It points to much bigger issues of working poverty and the prevalence of low pay.  I do not like that kind of language and I have heard it quite a bit.  Since the legislation came in one of the qualifying conditions has been that a claimant must be genuinely seeking work.  How is that monitored?  Have referrals been made to job activation schemes?  Can the witnesses give us a little bit more information on what is actually required for a claimant to show that he or she is genuinely seeking work?  Are there sanctions or penalties if that requirement is not met, or are such measures being considered for the future?<\/p> <p>  Travel outside the State is also referenced in the briefing document.  In its submission to this committee, representatives of ICTU stated that they had sought clarification on the criteria used to identify which flights were to be checked by departmental officials.  People were really shocked by that operation when it was reported in the news.  I would like more information on who decided on that operation and how it worked.  I would also like an answer to ICTU's question.  <\/p> <p>  I have a further question about how claimants apply for the Covid-19 pandemic unemployment payment.  What was the rationale for removing the form from the website and asking claimants to send an email requesting it?  I welcome the efforts to pay arrears before the end of the year.  Do the witnesses have any idea of how many recipients will be due arrears?  Can they confirm that they will be paid before the end of the year?  I would like to clarify that to receive the Christmas bonus, a claimant does not need to be on the Covid-19 pandemic unemployment payment the week it is paid, once he or she has been previously been on it for four months, continuously or otherwise.  I think the bonus is issued on the week of 7 December.  Does a claimant need to be on the payment on that week to receive the Christmas bonus? <\/p> <p>  There has been a lot of mention of the social insurance fund.  The Parliamentary Budget Office gave us a great briefing on these matters.  How concerned should we be about the social insurance fund?  Is the Department looking at any ways to fix what will obviously be a big issue for the fund?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2020112500002#C00300","speaker":"1604"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1606262400,"counter":596,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  I will take some of the operational questions and then yield to Mr. Hession.  We may both comment on some of those issues.  The Deputy's first question was about the change in the rate of payment from &euro;203 to &euro;350.  I would like to provide some context for the change.  We introduced the Covid-19 pandemic unemployment payment very quickly, as the committee acknowledged.  The initial rate was &euro;203, which was the standard rate of jobseeker's allowance at the time.  The Covid-19 pandemic unemployment payment was initially introduced to ensure that people stayed at home when they were expected to or to compensate them when their employment disappeared.  With that in mind, the payment was increased to &euro;350 to make it equivalent to the rate for a two-family household and to make sure people did not feel they had to go to work.  Mr. Hession will explain the work issues a bit more.<\/p> <p>  We have been in constant communication with Aer Lingus on this issue.  The company is very aware of what will be needed if an employee approaches them seeking information for the review we are carrying out.<\/p><p>It has agreed the documentation with us, meaning there is no issue with that matter as far as we are concerned at this point.<\/p><p> The genuinely seeking work, GSW, conditionality has been brought into the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP.  It is being treated lightly and sensitively.  In fairness, we are not pursuing anybody at this point in time.  Activation services are available to anybody on PUP, should he or she require them.  However, we are not actively at that nor are we applying any penalties or reviews now.<\/p><p> It is a scheme, however, for which people are available for work.  That is part of the conditionality for it.  As of now, we have not done any review of anybody.  We are encouraging people, should they wish, to get any activation services as they are available to them.  We have not formally invited anybody to our activation services, however.<\/p><p> The arrears project is well in hand at this point.  We have done a huge amount of work over the past number of months to get it organised and ready for payment.  We hope to make a payment next week to most customers who are due arrears.  There will be some particular candidates who may not get arrears, however, because of the complexity of it and that the relevant information is not fully available to pay them should they have an entitlement.<\/p><p> It is important that the committee realises the complexity of doing arrears.  When calculating and issuing arrears for customers, we have to look back over the customer's whole record.  It is important to bear in mind that we have had over 800,000 customers with just under 1.4 million claims for PUP and we have issued over 13 million payments so far.  With that in mind, in the same period, the temporary wage subsidy scheme is in place, which is not compatible with PUP, but there was an interaction between the two.  Some customers have blanks in their records in that they may have been employed during that period and may have received the temporary wage subsidy scheme.  If they missed a week's period, they may have been paid by the community welfare service.  We have to check back on those payments over that period.<\/p><p> In addition to that, if a payment fell out, we did pay them the following week.  PUP is not compatible with other primary schemes with the exception of some schemes like carer's allowance, disability allowance, one-parent family and working family payments.  We have paid it in conjunction with these.  There are other schemes, such as jobseeker's and illness benefit, with which it is not compatible.  In those cases, we have to check to ensure somebody was not in receipt of those during the same period.<\/p><p> The actual complexity of arrears and getting them out the door lies with the comparisons and checking we have to do to make sure we are actually paying people appropriately, not overpaying or underpaying them.  We hope next week that the majority of cases will be paid.  There will be a small minority which we will have to do manually.  These will follow.  Due to the complexity of their actual cases, we feel an officer needs to look at them because we cannot programme any solution to pay them.  That will be done manually.<\/p><p> Somewhere between 250,000 and 300,000 is our expected number of customers to be paid.  We will know more later on in the week.<\/p><p> The Christmas bonus, as my colleague stated in his opening statement, will be paid on 8 December.  It is for anybody who has to be on PUP on the week ending 3 December.  The 17-week period to qualify for the bonus payment can be made up of any period in the past 36 weeks.  This is week 36.  Yesterday, we paid PUP for that week.  It is any week in that.  If there was a period of unemployment in that period, that can be used to add up to the actual 17 weeks.  It is very much a case of working through the 17 weeks and giving it to people.  However, they have to be on PUP the week of 3 December.  Even if they sign off to go back to work, anytime during the week, they will get their bonus payment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2020112500002#C00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Teresa Leonard","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1606262400,"counter":598,"content":"<p>Will Ms Leonard clarify her last comment on that?

The idea at that stage was that PUP would be a six-week scheme.  We needed to get money out to people quickly before we were able to put them on to a proper jobseeker scheme.  That was the standard rate.  The movement to the &euro;350 rate was not so much a commentary on the adequacy of the &euro;203 rate but more a recognition of the fact that it would take longer to do that and people had dependants and so forth.<\/p> <p>  We do not have numbers on the people availing of the &euro;480 threshold under PUP.  People are not required to report that to us.  They are required to keep records in case we need to check that.  That is why we do not have details available on that.<\/p> <p>  On the February rate change, the Minister said during the budget that the question will be revisited towards the end of year.  Over the coming weeks, the Government will have to assess the current situation in light of the trajectory of the pandemic and the economic situation and then take a position on that February change.<\/p> <p>  On the question of the working poor and the number on the &euro;203 rate, given the level of the minimum wage at &euro;10.10 an hour and moving to an extra increase in January, the chances are that the people in that cohort are part-time workers.  One can only get 20 hours on the minimum wage to be under the &euro;203 threshold.  Until recently, the Department was responsible for the national minimum wage.  We are conscious of the issues of low-wage jobs, employment rights and ensuring we avoid in-work poverty.  Many of our payments continue to be paid as people work, such as working family and jobseeker payments.  They allow for a degree of work.  We are always mindful of that issue.  The &euro;203 threshold is more likely, given the statutory minimum wage, to be a reflection of part-time workers.<\/p> <p>  On travel, we have not done inspections at airports for quite a number of months and we do not plan to resume them.  In the case of the flights that were inspected, a factor was the low level of flights coming in and out of the country at the time.  We also did inspections at ports at that time.  In terms of the criteria, it was a factor of the inspectors operating at the airports at the time, looking at what flights were available and making a call on the ground.<\/p> <p>  Since the legislation came in on 5 August, the full cost of PUP has been drawn from the Social Insurance Fund, SIF.  The total cost of PUP for this year is &euro;5 billion, along with &euro;94 million.  The latter is largely the budget for the Christmas bonus.  We are up to &euro;4.3 billion at the moment.  Clearly, this is a big draw on the SIF which we had not expected at the beginning of 2020.  That clearly is an issue which needs to be examined.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2020112500002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. R&oacute;n&aacute;n Hession"},{"type":"speech","time":1606262400,"counter":601,"content":"<p>I join in thanking the staff of the Department of Social Protection.  We certainly get a good and interactive service, which is important.  The staff are willing to talk to Oireachtas Members as they recognise we represent people.  When we get on to the Department on behalf of constituents, we obviously have their permission.  It makes our life a lot easier.<\/p><p>It is a pity that not all other agencies in the State operate with the same kinds of interactions.  It is not only that the Department comes back quickly, but it also comes back with comprehensive answers when we ask further questions.  There is a great willingness to deal in detail with the kinds of issues that arise.  Social welfare, by its nature, is complex.<br\/><br\/>I have a few questions.  One of the most significant things that jumps out to me is that those who are getting the full rate of &euro;350 on the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, are only, on average, getting 58% of what they were earning previously.  That is a significant loss of income.  I have mentioned this time and again.  Some of that cohort are renting and entitled to rent supplement, as far as I understand, if they qualify under a means test.  However, further up the income scale, a fair number of the people affected would have significant mortgages and young families.  I understand that such a person would not be entitled to child dependent allowance and there is no mortgage interest supplement.  I do not know if our guests covered the philosophy of the policy when it was introduced but was consideration given to reintroducing a scheme that existed for as long as I can remember until 2014, namely, mortgage interest supplement?  That would have been an option instead of depending on the banks.  We all know how kind banks are, as charitable organisations.  They are not.  They are run by hard-headed business people and if someone gets a moratorium on repayments, the banks will come after them, looking for that money back.  I am thinking of the cohort of people who might have been on &euro;1,000 a week and paying a big proportion of that on their mortgage, people with a family and the costs that go with it.  Those people were hit by the pandemic and, we now know, are only getting, on average, 58% of what they were earning.  The higher up the pay scale one goes, the lower that percentage.  The percentage is higher the nearer a claimant was to earnings of &euro;300 or &euro;400 a week.  Was consideration given to the reintroduction of mortgage interest supplement as a policy instrument?<br\/><br\/>I do not know whether our guests have the figures I am going to ask them about now but it is a matter about which we should think.  As Mr. Hession pointed out, there is a minimum wage in the country and any company that was not paying the minimum wage was breaking the law.  That means that people who were earning less than &euro;350 were, by definition, part-time workers.  That is a mathematical certainty.  Do we have any information as to how many of those are voluntarily part-time workers?  There are quite a number of those.  I often come across people who choose, for family circumstances or whatever, to work on a part-time basis.  On the other hand, how many are forced part-time workers - in other words, workers to whom the employer does not give the work and so the worker has no choice other than to be a part-time employee?  There is also a third cohort.  Do we have any idea how many part-time workers were students who were working to try to put themselves through college?  Those people worked particularly in fast food, retail and so on and lost out on that income on which they were totally dependent in order to keep the ship afloat while they were trying to get an education.  Those figures would tell us something about student grants and a whole lot of other things that are not the immediate concern of our guests.  We should learn from everything that has been going on with the PUP.  There are a lot of good lessons, and some hard lessons, to be learned.<br\/><br\/>The PUP was due to end and I now hear noises that this might not happen.  Can our guests confirm that if there are to be continuing lockdowns of sectors of the economy, or, for example, restaurants and so-called wet pubs are allowed to open over Christmas but are locked down again in January and February, that there will be a PUP for which workers in those affected areas will be able to reapply?  Workers might move away from the PUP before Christmas but be forced be back to it in the new year, although please God that does not happen.  Can our guests confirm that such people will be covered by the PUP?<br\/><br\/>I thought it was strange that the &quot;genuinely seeking work&quot; caveat came in, whoever was responsible.  I know it was said that the rule is not being applied, and I welcome that, but I hate rules that are not applied because some day, somebody will wake up and decide to apply it.  When asked why they are applying it, they can then say it was the rule for the past six months, or whatever.  My view is that if there is a rule, apply it.  If a rule is not going to be applied, do not have it.  Otherwise, we get into the area of <i>Alice in Wonderland<\/i>where we have a rule but do not apply it before some day, someone suddenly starts applying it, saying that we have had this rule for ages.  People are concerned about this.  Consider somebody who had a good job for all their life and worked for the past 30 years in a restaurant.  The job will be there for them when the restaurant reopens, please God.  The person does not need a job because they have one, albeit they are out of work in the short term, in the greater scheme of things, because of a situation that will not happen again on a recurring basis.  It is a pity that the caveat was put in.  These sorts of things seem perennially to get thrown in and it does not seem to make sense.<br\/><br\/>A valid question was raised about the Social Insurance Fund.  Back in 2010, the fund ran dry.  In the noughties, there was quite a lot of accumulated savings in the Social Insurance Fund.  In other words, the social contributions that were being put aside for the rainy day, pension budgets and so on exceeded expenditure out of the fund.  As a result of the downturn between 2008 and 2012, the Social Insurance Fund ran dry in 2010.  The Exchequer gave advances at that time and if one looks at Exchequer returns for the following few years, one can see the advances and their repayment.  Some time in the middle of the 2010s, all the money was paid back and no advances were needed during the year.  Can the witnesses tell us how much was saved in the Social Insurance Fund?  In other words, what was it worth on 1 January 2020, before we were hit by the Covid-19 tsunami?  The Department has stated that &euro;5 billion over and above has been spent.  Is the fund still in credit or has it gone into deficit?  If it is in deficit, I presume the Exchequer is temporarily funding it and will recoup its investment in the Social Insurance Fund as things get back to normal.  Those are my questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2020112500002#D00500","speaker":"1575","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1606262400,"counter":603,"content":"<p>I will quickly run through them because there are some housing issues there that I may be able to deal with up front and my colleague might come in on anything I miss.  We may have to come back to the Deputy on one or two points.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy made a legitimate point about the position of a cohort of those receiving the PUP at a rate of &euro;350.  Approximately 46% of PUP claimants are on that &euro;350 rate and, even with that support, we recognise there is a significant drop in income for a large number of people in receipt of the payment.  The means or income test for rent supplement was adjusted to reflect the payment of PUP at the &euro;350 rate so we were not giving people a PUP which was affecting or knocking out their rent supplement payment.   At the start of the year, rent supplement was approximately &euro;15,000 or &euro;16,000.  It went up to over &euro;20,000 and it now back to just under &euro;20,000.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked about reinstating mortgage interest supplement.  He is right that the scheme stopped to new entrants in 2014.  It is not an issue at which we looked.  I know that there have been various other statutory protections introduced by the Minister responsible for housing to try to address the position for people who are under pressure with their mortgages.  The mortgage interest supplement was not a part of our thinking at that stage of the process.  To be honest, in terms of the size of the problem we were dealing with, our immediate focus was primarily to lead on the income supports and try to make sure we could address those.  The wider housing complexity would have been difficult for us to take on at that stage.<\/p><p>I do not have the figures here with me on unemployment - voluntary, forced or otherwise - but I know there are figures produced by the CSO on the degree of underemployment among those who are currently working part-time but have the capacity or ability to work more than that.  I am happy to send those figures to the committee after the meeting.  The number of students receiving the PUP is around 26,000.  As the Deputy has said, there were many people who were studying but also working to try to support themselves through college.  Like others, they lost their employment after 13 March because of the pandemic.  They have an entitlement to the PUP and are being paid at a rate that is linked to their prior rate of pay.  I can confirm to the Deputy that, arising from a decision taken yesterday by the Government and announced by the Minister, the PUP will remain open to new applicants until the end of March 2021.  In cases like that outlined by the Deputy, where people go back to work for the Christmas period and then go into unemployment, the PUP will be available for them to submit a claim after that period.<\/p><p> I note the Deputy's points on the genuinely seeking work rule.  To some extent, I cannot comment on the merits of Government policy on this issue other than to say that the PUP is an unemployment payment with the standard features that entails, and the genuinely seeking work rule is part of that.  I accept Deputy's point that a rule is a rule and we should not decide in a spontaneous way when to apply it or not to apply it.  Bearing in mind that the pandemic is a very different economic environment, however, we do not think it is a problem for a person to fail to look for work while their sector is closed.  If a person is working in the hospitality sector, for example, their job is not available to them because their workplace is closed due to the shutdown of the wider sector.  We take a proportionate view of that.<\/p><p> I do not have the figures with me on the opening balance of the social insurance fund, but we will provide the Deputy with those figures in a follow-up response.  Perhaps my colleague, Ms Leonard, has something to add.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2020112500002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. R&oacute;n&aacute;n Hession","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1606262400,"counter":605,"content":"<p>I would like to make a point in respect of the &euro;350 rate and the actual income it amounts to.

I will return to the issue of the genuinely seeking work rule because I did not do a great job of answering the question the first time.  I was going to go back and clarify the matter for the Deputy.  Although the environment and the times we are in mean that we are perhaps not applying the genuinely seeking work rule as religiously as we normally would, it is there and it is a rule that is applicable to the PUP scheme.  I should say that activation supports are available to people if they want to interact with them directly.

The statistic that has struck me this morning from the two witnesses is that 18 months of work was carried out in two weeks.  That is a tremendous achievement.  The staff working in the Department are an asset.  I would like to express my thanks to them for their work, and also for their responses to the queries we raise.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Hession said that he was part of the task force on the arts sector.  He has told us that 12,000 people in that sector are currently in receipt of the PUP, which is just over 20% of the CSO figures.  Through his work as a member of this task force, does he have any idea what the other artists and people involved in the arts sector are on at the moment?  Are they struggling?  Are there issues with PUP that are causing them not to apply for it?  It seems to me that 20% is a very low figure.  At its height it was only 25%, which is low considering the emails we have received from people in the arts sector about the issues and concerns they have.  Has the task force come up with anything else in relation to the inability of artists and others in this sector to apply for the PUP?<\/p> <p>  I have another question, which I have raised before at this committee.  It concerns those under the age of 18 who are paying tax and PRSI, but do not qualify for the PUP because it is confined to those over 18 years of age.  Are any figures available on the number of 17-year-olds who may have lost their jobs but are not in receipt of the PUP?  Perhaps the witnesses have some figures on that.  It has been raised with me by a number of people that young people who have paid their taxes are not in receipt of the PUP.<\/p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v mentioned the issue of child dependants.  His question was not answered in the last round of questioning, so perhaps it could be answered now.  It is a serious concern for me, particularly in respect of low-income families.  I had a case yesterday which concerned somebody who is in receipt of &euro;203 - the lowest PUP rate - and is trying to survive with two children on this amount.  This person cannot get a child dependant payment.  Is there any other payment for which they can apply to bring up their income level, or anything else they can do?  It does seem that receiving a payment of &euro;203 with two children, and everything that goes along with Christmas, is a very low payment.  Perhaps the witnesses could address that issue.<\/p> <p>  I share the concerns raised by others on the genuinely seeking work rule.  Has an instruction been given to the staff of the Department's local offices not to enforce this rule?  It is important that this is clarified today, because we do not one member of staff to be telling applicants that it is being enforced because the rule is there, while another member of staff is telling them that it is not being enforced.  There must be one rule for all.  Like other members, I am asking for confirmation that that is the rule.<\/p> <p>  Do the witnesses have any comment on how the social insurance fund might affect the State pension age and qualification?  It has been mentioned before in commentaries that the fund will help us to reduce the age of qualification for the State pension.  Will the &euro;5 billion that has been taken out of the fund, as we have heard, be used for PUP payments only, or is it also for other Covid support payments?  The witnesses might clarify that.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Hession mentioned the 26,000 students in receipt of the PUP.  I have received queries from a number of students on the taxation implications of the PUP for them.  Will there be any such implications for that cohort of people?  Obviously, they are trying to get back to their education and to pay for it, other members of the committee have mentioned.  I ask the witnesses to comment on that issue.<\/p> <p>  Finally, the witnesses mentioned in their introduction that over 90% of claims for the PUP were received online.  That is a very interesting figure.  As public representatives, many people come to us with queries about making applications for social welfare payments online.  I know there have been difficulties with making online applications for medical cards, in respect of which I have encountered particular difficulties.  Have any lessons been learned with a view to rolling out the online facility to other payments?  Like other committee members, I have had queries about the actual application form being much easier to complete.  However, I am most interested in the fact that over 90% of claims were submitted online.  Is that somewhere that the social welfare and social protection authorities are thinking of going in the future?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2020112500002#F00400","speaker":"1684"},{"type":"speech","time":1606262400,"counter":608,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Wall.

He referred to someone who has two child dependants and is receiving just &euro;203.  It would probably be better for the person in question to apply for jobseeker's allowance directly and to claim for the children through this allowance.  As PUP is a flat-rate benefit, with one rate per individual, there is no rate for dependants.  I suggest that the Senator contacts me with the details of that person, and we will send out the proper application forms for jobseeker's allowance.  The person in question could possibly claim for the children, and maybe for a spouse or partner.  There are other payments to which he or she could be entitled.<\/p> <p>  The genuinely seeking work rule is there.  I am sorry that I caused confusion in my first answer in respect of how the rule applies to PUP.  We are not actually pushing it at this point in time because of the actual climate.  We are not forcing people who are temporarily out of work towards the genuinely seeking work rule right now.  The committee should recognise that the Department is really stretched in supporting the PUP.  We have staff all over the organisation who are backing up that particular scheme, and are working on it along with their other tasks to ensure it is paid promptly every week to all recipients.  There is not the facility to implement the genuinely seeking work rule effectively, efficiently or thoroughly at this point, for numerous reasons.  First, the climate is such that it may not be appropriate.  Second, the resources required to implement it limit how much action we can take on it at this time.  Nonetheless, the rule exists.<\/p><p>It is similar to a jobseeker's scheme.  Just to be clear on that, a jobseeker's scheme has a genuinely seeking work, GSW, requirement to it.<\/p><p> As for the 90% online applications for PUP, PUP has been very successful online.  I overlooked a question that the previous Deputy asked about why one had to send an email to get the form.  We started out initially with a form for PUP in mid-March of this year - at this point, it seems like last year - and within three weeks we had an online application process in place.  The take-up of that was substantial from day one to the point that in the resurgence in the past number of weeks, we primarily took away the paper application and encouraged people to go online.  The paper application was available but the percentage of people who used it, as the committee can see, is very low.<\/p><p> We are working in the Department on putting all our schemes online.  It takes a bit of time to get through them all because we have over 80 schemes in the organisation but this year we have made considerable progress in our presence online and the availability to our customers of online services.  We will continue with that.

I thank the Senator for his kind remarks about the work of the Department, and also Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, who made kind remarks.<\/p> <p>  On the task force on arts and culture, Senator Wall asked if the figure was surprisingly low given the size of the sector.  There has been work done by the Arts Council.  They had a report done by EY which pointed to a higher incidence in terms of the effect.  There is probably a number of factors at play.  First of all, the &euro;55,000 includes sport and recreation.  They are categorised together in terms of nomenclature of economic activities, NACE, codes.  Second, approximately half of the arts and culture sector are part time.  Some people are part-time workers and they will have either other work or other responsibilities.  Musicians, for example, typically will have sources of income other than performance or recording, most obviously teaching.  They will teach guitar or piano.  There may be some people whose arts income is not the majority share of their income in terms of what they earn from year to year even though they would consider it their primary role.  In those cases, it is perhaps that they are classified under education.  It means a bit of a deeper dive there.  The task force was only in place for six weeks and there was not really an opportunity to dig into the deep statistical context for that.  However, that is one possible explanation.<\/p> <p>  The Senator asked about the State pension.  In the budget, the full-year cost of retaining the current pension is &euro;453 million and the cost for next year is &euro;221 million.  Clearly, that is significant expenditure which will impact on the Social Insurance Fund, SIF.<\/p> <p>  The Senator asked about students and their tax status.  It is not a matter for our Department.  We do not have a deciding influence in terms of the tax treatment of the PUP payment.  The issue was raised in the context of the Finance Bill and the amendments that were made to the Finance Act 2018 about the tax treatment and the Revenue Commissioners.  That will apply, I would expect, to students in the same way that it will apply to other PUP recipients.<\/p> <p>  Between the two of us, I hope we have covered the questions.

I compliment the Department of Social Protection on the number of people who were given some kind of respite in the pandemic because it was quite a shocking occurrence.  The pandemic hit us overnight.  Nobody saw it coming at the level it did.  The Department did amazing work and kept many people sane and above water.  I thank the Department for all its efforts.<\/p> <p>  With regards to the student payments, it has been amazing for the students who usually have part-time work to be able to get the PUP.  That made a phenomenal difference to them.  It was really important for them to be independent of their parents.  Maybe they were independent of their parents anyway but they stood on their own two feet and they have worked.  It was amazing the Department did that.  I was curious about whether they will be eligible for the Christmas bonus because they will be dying to know that.<\/p> <p>  The second question I wanted to ask was about the arts and culture.  I would like clarity around the &euro;480.  Is it that they can earn up to &euro;480 sporadically and still be eligible for the PUP?  <\/p> <p>  Another issue that came to my notice from different people in my county who would have worked in different sectors, especially in the tourism sector, who were over 66 and who have always worked is that they were not eligible for the PUP payment.  That is shocking because those people have been working probably 50 years.  I felt so bad when they were approaching me saying that they have worked all their life and now they have nothing and the Department will not give them anything just because they are a bit older.  I would like to hear a response to that.  That is something we must look at in the long term.  How we treat our older people in this country needs to be looked at, especially with regards to the Department of Social Protection.<\/p> <p>  Seasonal staff missed out on the PUP.  In my county, we have a considerable tourism industry and there were people who missed out only by a matter of days.  As the part-time employment contracts that they have had for 30 or 40 years in the Cliffs of Moher or wherever did not start this year, they missed out by a couple of days.  They were not eligible.  I do not know whether that has been rectified or what the Department has done about that.  There is a significant number of people employed in the tourism industry and it would be seasonal work.<\/p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v mentioned mortgages.  This is probably not for this Department.  The &euro;350 will keep people above water but, as the Deputy said, for those with big mortgages, often half people's wages are going on their mortgage, sadly.  It is disgraceful.  I was wondering if there is any mortgage relief.  Is that a matter for the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage or where does one find information about that?<\/p> <p>  On the PUP tax, if people have to pay it back, whether they are students or otherwise, if Ms Leonard and Mr. Hession are saying it is not a matter for their Department, which Department do I go to to find out that?<\/p> <p>  Overall, I thank the Department.

As Ms Leonard has outlined, the qualifying conditions are not based on whether one is a student or not.  It is about whether one has the 17 weeks combined and whether one is on PUP for the relevant weeks.  If they meet those conditions they will get it.  The fact that they are students is not a complicating factor.<\/p> <p>  The &euro;480 applies to any self-employed person.  It is not limited to the arts sector.  It effectively works over a rolling four-week period.  We look back over the past four weeks to see if a person has stayed under the &euro;480 limit.  The language around the sporadic nature was, if you like, a formulation to describe a rule that ultimately has been replaced by a strict &euro;480 rule.  Therefore, if one earned &euro;480 or less over the past four weeks, one is all right.<\/p> <p>  On the 66-year-olds, we recognise this is an issue that has been of concern to Senators and Deputies.

The age range that applies for working-age payments is 18 up until pension age.  If one is above 66 and receiving the State pension, one can keep all one's employment income.  It is just that slightly different rules apply when people go past 66.  They get other payments that are there to support them and the two-person rate for a person on the State pension is a good bit above the payment rate of a two-person jobseeker payment.  That is not to diminish the concern.  We understand that but PUP is a working-age payment and the age range that applies reflects that.<\/p> <p>  On the seasonal worker issue, when PUP was first introduced that came up as an issue.  PUP applies to people who were in work on 13 March or thereabouts and who lost that employment suddenly because of the pandemic.  It was not really designed to deal with a situation for people who were not in work at that time but typically had a pattern of seasonal employment.  They may have worked during the summer, for example, in the tourist period.  There are other jobseeker supports that are available for those people.<\/p><p>I expect that people in that seasonal position, who might have gone back during the summer and now find themselves out of work, would be eligible for PUP.  That issue has somewhat timed out.<br\/><br\/>We formerly had a mortgage interest supplement but it was discontinued in 2014 or thereabouts.  It is not a support we provide as a Department.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v<b><\/b>raised this earlier.

Many of the questions I had intended to ask have been asked by the Chairman, Deputies &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v and Kerrane and others.<\/p> <p>  Our guests might clarify how many people have to be paid arrears.  They said the issue should be sorted out in the next couple of weeks but how many people are there?  I understand that the Department might have more investigating to do.  As Christmas approaches, if there are people on the longer term list who really want the money, can we do anything for them or make a case for them?  The investigations might not be fully carried out, but close to Christmas, people need that money more than at any other time of the year.<\/p> <p>  I join the Chairman and others in their remarks about the entertainment business, a business I know a little about.  I greatly appreciate the effort the Department has made in that regard but people in the industry have concerns about taxation.  While I accept what Mr. Hession said about it not being an issue for their Department and it being an issue for the Department of Finance and Revenue, they might make a note of it.  The continuation of PUP will be very important for these people.  I think we all accept that with regard to the recovery, vaccinations and so on, the entertainment industry will be at the end of line in terms of getting back into business.  Many of them face very serious financial challenges.  It is not only about putting bread on the table.  Engineers in that business who travel throughout the country when working at gigs have to have vehicles that are up to speed and roadworthy.  All of them are paying substantial fees on such vehicles.  They have hidden costs that people do not see.

In the case of most of the ones we cannot pay, they lack information, that is, the information available to us does not allow us to consider whether they are entitled to a payment.

That may be of interest to those the Senator has spoken to, and I am certainly happy to send him on the details of that.  We provided for about &euro;12 million for the grant for this year and the recent budget extended that into next year.  Thus far, about 7,000 people have applied, at a cost of about &euro;6.5 million.

We would print the document and send it to them.  While there may be a very low take-up, I do not understand why the form is no longer available to print for people who might need to use it.  I do not see it as an issue and it should be available online for people if they need the paper application as opposed to having to email.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of people genuinely seeking work, our guests mentioned the job activation schemes and how the Department might consider that in the new year.  Is there a specific plan?  I do not see the Department will work out, where sectors have been closed or have not fully opened, who is genuinely seeking work and who should be moved on to activation.  We will need to be really careful about how we consider that in the new year if it is not being pushed as much now.  I do not see the rationale for it to be there at all.<\/p> <p>  On the take-up of courses and returning to education, there should be full flexibility for all courses.

Someone else contacted me who wanted to do a bus-driving course at an education and training board but cannot do because that person is on the PUP.  I would like to see absolute flexibility for people who want to go back to education.  It should be made as easy as possible.  There are anomalies where people are encountering roadblocks.

We are all slower when filling out a strange form and we often wonder what information the questions are actually seeking.  I have seen this with people with PhDs and so on.  If a person has filled out a form 50 or 100 times, he or she knows the information the questions are asking for.  Many Deputies and Senators print off a form and start filling it out by going through the questions in such a way that the person for whom the form is being filled will know what is being put on it, or they start filling it our for their constituents on verbal basis.  I often do this in my constituency clinics.  When a form is filled, we send it to the constituent, who signs it and submits it.  The Department gets a better filled form but a Deputy or Senator cannot submit it online for their constituents because he or she cannot authorise it.  I often fill out various forms, such as pensions forms, manually for people.  Since we fill out forms so often, I would hope that we fill them out to a good standard.<\/p> <p>  One thing I could not understand is that I encountered somebody in the entertainment business who did not have much formal education and who wanted to do a one-year course.  I could have understood the Department's response if it had been a three-year or four-year course because we hope the pandemic will not go on that long, but in this case it became a choice between getting a basic payment of &euro;203 or forgetting about that and going on the course.  The individual could not afford to do the course without the payment.  It seemed to me a pity that if somebody was forced to be at home, he or she could not do a course of up to one year in duration.  I am not making the case for degrees, etc., because they last for three or four years and the pandemic is not expected to last that long.  We do know, however, that in the entertainment business, even if everything is resolved, it will be a slow burn before everything gets back to normal because the one place people will still be reluctant to go will be into a crowd, even if there are vaccines and cures.  I expect restaurants will open up faster than crowded entertainment venues, particularly indoor venues.  I realise it is a policy issue and that there is a policy formulation.  I would be interested in hearing about this.<\/p> <p>  I still want to discuss the mortgage interest supplement.  We were told the Department of Finance made arrangements with the banks but it was only pushing the can down the road because the mortgages still have to be fully paid.  Would it be possible to go back to the Department and ask whether it could send this committee the rationale, in 2014, for getting rid of two complementary schemes, namely, the rent supplement scheme, which supported the unemployed in paying rent, and the mortgage interest supplement scheme, which traditionally, or for as long as I could remember, helped those with a mortgage who became unemployed?  Perhaps the Department would send us the rationale for why there was a suspension in 2014.  I have dealt with welfare for many years but I could never understand the decision.  It was the strangest decision when it was made because, let us be honest, the crisis from 2008 onwards was largely about mortgages.  I have always believed we would have saved a lot of hardship if the scheme had been continued or had been beefed up.<\/p> <p>  The famous four-year plan we developed at the end of 2010 strengthened the mortgage interest supplement.  There was not an awful lot in it on this but there was a sentence that referred to strengthening the supplement because it was seen as the best safety net for those with a mortgage.  Something similar has happened now, but in a different way.  The mortgage interest supplement, which used to last for as long as a person was unemployed and ended the minute he or she went back to work, meant that person had no accumulated interest and would not be going cap in hand to the financial institutions, which are not charities.  I just do not understand the rationale for the suspension.  Maybe somebody in the Department could give us the policy reason for it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2020112500002#J00300","speaker":"1575"},{"type":"speech","time":1606262400,"counter":626,"content":"<p>Mr. Hession mentioned the 17-year-olds.

Do not hold me to this but my recollection is that it was a decision that came out of the Keane report produced by the Department of Finance at the time which looked at a wide range of issues.  I will certainly be happy to provide a note on that.<\/p> <p>  I will make one point on education and then ask my colleague, Teresa Leonard, to come in on some of the operational matters.  Generally speaking, we have been trying to support people going back to education as best we can.  In the July stimulus package, we waived the waiting period for people on PUP so they could get the back-to-education allowance.  It is done via the jobseeker's scheme because, as things stand, and Senator Garvey asked about the future of PUP, it is supposed to conclude at the end of March.  It will be open until then, but the current timeline for PUP is the end of March.  Therefore, we cannot put people onto longer schemes or education courses where the payment will not be available after March.  At the same time, as part of the July stimulus, we have said that a person on PUP will not have to wait for the normal period and can go straight into the courses.  If a course is short term, the individual can stay on PUP.  If it is for a longer term, the individual will need to switch to a jobseeker's payment.  I might ask Ms Leonard to come in on the other issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2020112500002#J00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. R&oacute;n&aacute;n Hession"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1606262400,"counter":629,"content":"<p>I have not thanked all the Deputies and Senators for their kind words about the operational staff and staff who have worked across the Department.

We have a very good process in place to supply application forms.  There is an email address and when we are emailed we send out an application form very quickly.  It is in the applicant's interest to apply online because we pay the week somebody applies.  If one applies online on a Monday, one will get a payment the following Tuesday.  The PUP week runs from Friday to Thursday.  We have the payment available the following week unless there is something seriously wrong with the application.  The online service forces people to put in the correct information and fill out the appropriate boxes.  Therefore, we do not have to go back to people for further information.  There is a lower likelihood of getting it wrong.  In the beginning, quite a number of applications were filled out very incorrectly by individuals and the only option available to them was to apply again, which delayed them somewhat.  We are very anxious to pay people as quickly as possible but we have a very good process in place such that there is absolutely no difficulty in getting a form.  We provide it very quickly.  I have two teams that work on it immediately.  The applications are processed on receipt so there is no delay.<\/p><p>That should be borne in mind.

My colleague, Mr. Hession, has mentioned job supports, the different job incentive schemes, back-to-education scheme, back-to-work scheme, enterprise allowances, enterprise grants and training support grants.  There is quite a range of stuff that would be of interest to some of the people on PUP and that might work in their interest.  That is the starting point for pushing activation.

The initiative would ensure that for anyone who contacts the office of a Deputy or Senator, we could print off the form and assist people to fill them out.<\/p> <p>  I will start by asking Mr. Hession about a cohort of people over the age of 66 who do not have PRSI contributions, are ineligible for a State contributory pension, will not receive a non-contributory pension because it is means tested and some of whom continue to work servicing loans on their businesses.  It is the policy of the Department and the advice from officials to Ministers over the years to increase the age threshold for receipt of the State contributory pension, yet a cohort of people who are over the age of 66, continue to work and are not in receipt of a State pension have been denied any support throughout the pandemic.  They are ineligible for the pandemic unemployment payment.  They are not in receipt of another social welfare payment.  They are ineligible for another social welfare payment.  That cohort must be shown some flexibility when it comes to the pandemic unemployment payment.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the music industry, Mr. Hession made the point that the &euro;480 threshold is a rolling threshold over a previous four-week period.  This issue needs to be reconsidered.  I ask that there is an average applied to the payment of the pandemic unemployment payment rather than using a four-week period because if some entertainers or artists are commissioned to do work and offered &euro;500 they must, unfortunately, automatically refuse.  Also, they may get payment in two separate calendar months but happen to be within the four-week period so yet again they are discriminated.  The most sensible approach to take is for the &euro;480 average to span the period of their pandemic unemployment payment.  The adoption of this approach would be a far better vehicle to help these people return to full-time employment, which is the primary objective.<\/p> <p>  I accept what Ms Leonard said about arrears, that it is a complex calculation and that the Department intends to pay the vast majority of people next week, which is welcome.  She said that the Department is going to deal with the other people who must be processed manually over the coming weeks.<\/p><p>The intention is to have those paid by the end of the year.  First, what sort of numbers are we talking about that will be processed manually?  Second, the witnesses need to be conscious of the fact that if those people are not paid before the end of the calendar year they could end up being taxed inappropriately in 2021 on those arrears because that income comes in in 2021 even though it is to supplement their income for 2020.  They may have a tax credit available to them in 2020 that, hopefully, may not be available to them in 2021 if they get back into full-time employment.  Every effort must be made to ensure that all of those people are paid this year.  I would actively encourage the witnesses to make contact with the Department of Finance to ensure that those people are not discriminated against in respect of the taxation code in 2021 because of that delay in paying their arrears.<\/p><p> I want to make two other points.  The first is to pick up on Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v's point about the mortgage interest supplement.  I know this is not for the witnesses to comment on but I was very surprised that the T&aacute;naiste suggested yesterday that there would be a further lockdown in the new year.  I believe he is throwing in the towel in respect of what we need to do to manage this pandemic.  We need to make every possible effort to ensure that there are no further lockdowns in this State in 2021.  In that context, and in light of his particular comments, does it not make sense considering that the payment guarantee that had been in place with the banks is no longer in place that we would reintroduce mortgage interest supplement, particularly for people in receipt of the pandemic unemployment payment?  That would make a significant difference to people, particularly to the more than half of those in receipt of the pandemic unemployment payment who have seen a dramatic fall-off in their basic income.<\/p><p> In her evidence Ms Leonard made the point that the temporary wage subsidy scheme did not correlate with the pandemic unemployment payment whereas the employment wage subsidy scheme did.  She might elaborate on that.  We are quite happy to take that in written format after the meeting but I want to flesh out those complexities because they are the very issues we want to see addressed as part of this process in which we are currently involved.

The employer could top that up with income to bring it up to a particular level.  That was part of the temporary wage scheme.  It was paid through an employer for an individual employee and it was attributed to an individual employee.  It was put in place to ensure that employers kept their employees attached to the workplace.  It was to supplement them with paying wages to keep them attached to the workplace.  That was the primary objective of that particular scheme.  As such, they are in employment when they are on it and they are not entitled to the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, when they are in employment.  The PUP, by its very definition, is for people who have lost employment due to the pandemic because their work has closed or whatever reason.  It is because they have lost work because of Covid-19.<\/p> <p>  On the employment wage subsidy scheme, I either misspoke or I misrepresented what I said.  It is an actual supplement to the employer to supplement wages for his or her employees but it is not defined directly to individual employees and, as such, it is not attributed in that manner.  It is claimed by the employer for, say, ten employees who fulfil a certain criteria.  They get the supplement towards the payment for those ten employees but it is not individually placed on them.  It is not compatible with the PUP because the individual is in employment.  The PUP is only paid when someone is out of work, when people have been let go because of the pandemic and their employment has been limited as a result of that.  It is in regard to jobseeker's that there is compatibility between getting the employment wage subsidy scheme and jobseeker's unemployment benefit.  That is in respect of the Aer Lingus workers where their employer may be claiming the employment wage subsidy but they can claim part-time or casual employment with us at the same time.  To be clear, the temporary wage subsidy scheme is not compatible with the PUP, neither is the new employment scheme from 1 September, but it is compatible with jobseeker's and they can be paid to someone who has periods of unemployment along with that particular scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2020112500002#L00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Teresa Leonard"},{"type":"speech","time":1606262400,"counter":642,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Leonard and call Mr. Hession.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2020112500002#L00500","speaker":"1603"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1606262400,"counter":643,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman.  Coming to his first point about people who are aged 66 and over and the PUP, the PUP is a statutory scheme and the Oireachtas has put those age limits on it so we do not have discretion as a Department to offer flexibility on that.  On the substance of the point, however, if a person does not qualify for a contributory pension because of their contribution record and then they do not qualify for the non-contributory pension because of the means test, that is the core feature of our system.  Someone is either getting a contribution based payment or a means tested payment and if they do not pass the means test it is because of their income.  I accept the point the Chairman made that people will have outgoings and demands but in terms of the way social welfare payments are assessed, it is very important that they are either contribution or means test based.  As a fallback we have the supplementary welfare allowance, which I know people have spoken of negatively as something they do not believe they should have to resort to, but it is a safety net for people to make sure that where people are under financial pressure and have difficulty they can apply for that but that, too, is subject to a means test.<\/p> <p>  On the point about the person in the music industry who might be offered &euro;500 for work, the &euro;480 limit is what one can earn and still get the PUP.  If somebody has a job that is worth &euro;500 they should be back in employment for that week.  Strictly speaking, if we look at the legislation, if one is self-employed and on the PUP one should be available for full-time work.  Somebody doing work worth &euro;500 is unlikely to satisfy that so the best thing for that person to do would be to sign off the PUP for that week.  The averaging will apply over the duration of the period on the PUP.  We are trying to be flexible but at the same time if somebody is consistently earning above the &euro;480 limit they may look at the part-time job incentive, which allows them to work 24 hours and keep a payment of &euro;128.  <\/p> <p>  I am mindful that when we are talking about these thresholds that they exist across social welfare schemes.<\/p><p>For example, the disability allowance is &euro;120, increasing to &euro;140 next year.  Jobseeker claims are roughly &euro;20 day.  It is consistent with the overall approach taken.  For somebody who has a pattern of having work every now and again, the best option for him or her is to sign off when he or she is working and to go on to the PUP when he or she is not working, as opposed to trying to squeeze the &euro;500 under the &euro;480 limit.<\/p><p> I acknowledge the point that is being made.  You are raising a wider point, Chairman, about the pressure people who have mortgages will be under as they go through this, and there were comments about the possibility that mortgage interest supplement could play a role there.  All I will say is that if we hit a point we will come back with a note.  It is not something that has featured in our thinking.  To some extent, a significant portion of the pandemic problem has fallen to our Department and our focus has primarily been on the income support, as opposed to the wider suite of housing measures that has been handled more widely across the Government.  We hear the point and we will produce whatever information we can to help the committee form its own deliberations and to implement its report.  I hope that has answered your questions, Chairman.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2020112500002#L00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. R&oacute;n&aacute;n Hession","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1606262400,"counter":645,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Hession and Ms Leonard for their assistance to the committee.

The culture and tradition that is Irish dancing has been thrown into total disarray by the pandemic.  The financial loss to teachers and many others connected with the sector can probably be estimated.  What cannot be quantified however are the long-term effects on the well-being of our dancers, who are our main concern.  The lack of dance classes prevents the students from experiencing a sense of achievement when they learn and perfect a new step or movement and the loss of interaction with their friends leaves many of them feeling sad and lonely.  The dancers normally involved in top level competitions are in danger of losing their motivation and confidence.  Dancers are missing something important in their lives that they love and enjoy.<\/p> <p>  Dance has often been described as &ldquo;the joy of movement&rdquo; and Irish dance is the chosen hobby of many young children, teenagers and indeed some adults.  Children need physical exercise and mental stimulation outside of their academic studies.  Irish dance classes are run in a professional manner by highly qualified people and teach not only dance but also discipline and good behaviour and encourage self-worth and self-esteem.  Young people are happier when they have structure and continuity in their lives. <\/p> <p>  As schools have now reopened safely, I am of the opinion that Irish dance classes should be permitted under level 3.  I appreciate the many difficult choices facing Government and elected representatives but I ask them to give children, whose chosen hobby is Irish dancing, a chance to pursue their dreams of winning a world championship or perhaps being part of Riverdance or Lord of the Dance.  <\/p> <p>  I thank members for the opportunity to speak to them today about something I am passionate about, that is in my blood and that I have been involved me for most of my life.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2020112500002#A00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Carol Carberry"},{"type":"speech","time":1606262400,"counter":656,"content":"<p>I am sure members will have many questions for you but before we get to that point I give Dr. N&iacute; Bhriain the opportunity to make her statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2020112500002#A00800","speaker":"1557"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1606262400,"counter":657,"content":"<p>A Air&iacute; agus a Theachta&iacute; Dh&aacute;la, &aacute;r mbu&iacute;ochas libh as ucht an deis a thabhairt d&uacute;inn labhairt libh inniu ar son na m&uacute;inteoiri in &Eacute;irinn at&aacute; cl&aacute;raithe leis an gCoimisi&uacute;n le Rinc&iacute; Gaelacha.  Irish dance is an art form which demands dedication of mind and body.  CLRG has in excess of 2,300 teachers registered worldwide with teachers across all the continents and 518 teachers registered on the island of Ireland.<\/p> <p>  In the current climate, the very future of Irish dance is in a precarious situation.  We want to highlight following on from our recent lobbies numerous formal educational benefits of Irish dance.  It is an integral part of the physical education curriculum at primary level and is sometimes taken as a choice subject for the leaving cert applied and for such awards as the Gaisce awards.  There is also a Bachelor of Arts in Irish dance at the University of Limerick, as well as MA programmes and the possibility to conduct doctoral studies in dance.  Without access to this training many senior cycle students are disadvantaged.  Additionally, organisations such as an coimisi&uacute;n provide educational training to future teachers, examiners and adjudicators of Irish dance.  This is done through a grade exams system.  <\/p> <p>  Second, we wish to highlight the various contributions made by the Irish dance industry to Irish society, tourism, and the economy more broadly.  For example, a world Oireachtas can bring in in the region of &euro;14 million to the host city.  Shows such as Riverdance and Lord of the Dance have also greatly increased our cultural capital and the long-term impact of dancers not being able to train in Ireland will lead to a considerable loss of cultural ownership, influence and impact globally.<\/p><p> Irish dance is vital for children&rsquo;s physical health and well-being.  It offers them the opportunity to build transferable and transversal skills that can serve them in so many areas of their lives.  In the current climate, children are having to engage on Internet platforms, thus increasing their screen time.  Many inequalities have arisen as a result of this.  By running Irish dance classes, we can help to combat to these issues and promote healthy lifestyle choices.<\/p><p> I reiterate that current restrictions are having a seriously damaging impact on the Irish dance industry.  We have not been able to hold in-person classes since we entered level 5 and a return to level 3 still precludes us from teaching indoors.  We seek guidance from this committee as to why dance has been excluded from activities allowed indoors at level 3, particularly when other comparable activities have been permitted to continue indoors.<\/p><p> Under the terms of the 2003 UNESCO Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage, it is the right of Irish citizens to expect the State to provide for and facilitate the preservation, through practice and transmission, of traditional Irish step dance.  In this context, we respectfully request that due consideration be given to the adverse effect of ongoing restrictions on our national cultural heritage, particularly our Irish dance form.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2020112500002#A00900","nonspeaker":"Dr. Orfhlaith N&iacute; Bhriain","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1606262400,"counter":659,"content":"<p>I thank Ms N&iacute; Bhriain.

I wholeheartedly support the case they make in describing Irish dance as an intrinsic part of our culture and a critical part of the educational offering we make to children all over the country.  I come from east Galway, where Irish dancing is very much an intrinsic part of local communities.  I partook in Irish dancing at an earlier age, rather unsuccessfully.  My wife was incredibly more successful.  We celebrate the cultural achievements of our communities through various different channels including music and dance.  The young people who excel in Irish dancing are always held up as wonderful representatives of our community, nationally and internationally.<\/p> <p>  As the current restrictions stand, at level 3 it is not possible to hold what are described as indoor gatherings.  The only concession that is made in that context is education, which is critically important to our young people.  What, if any, engagement have the witnesses had with the Departments of Education or Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media on the possibility of concessions being made to allow dance classes to take place?  What sort of conditions have they described that could be put in place to maximise the safety of such classes?  Even now, as we embark on the road of returning to level 3 over the next few days, amendments are being made to what was originally described as level 3.  Hopefully a significant amount of flexibility will be possible in terms of how we manage level 3 and level 2 going forward.  If we were to make the case, which I am open to doing, not only for Irish dance but also for music tuition, which is very close to my heart, that opportunities for these activities should be made available to young people at level 3, what safety measures could teachers commit to putting in place?

We have instructed all of our teachers to follow the guidelines at all times, whether they are applicable nationwide or in particular counties.  When dance classes reopened at the end of the summer, teachers were very particular about putting in place the necessary safeguards, including hand sanitising, social distancing, cleaning surfaces, wearing masks and so on.  They did all of that very safely for a considerable amount of time until they had to close down again in level 3.  That was a little bit of a surprise to us, if not a great shock because as far as I am aware, there had not been any problems.  There were not lots of cases of Covid-19 associated with dancing.  An Comhdh&aacute;il was very particular about the aforementioned safety measures and I am sure that our friends in CLRG were the same.<\/p> <p>  If we got permission to run classes in small groups, that would be good.

To be recognised as being educational, of value and of cultural value would be immense.  The problem is that dance, not just Irish dance, seems to have been singled out for particularly harsh treatment.  In level 2, we abided by the pod system.  We brought in a pod system and a return-to-class protocol because we wanted to play our part.  I wish to make it clear that teachers bought into this.  They rented bigger studios, secured more suitable venues with better ventilation, appointed Covid officers, drew up response plans, insisted on parental sign-off and so on.  Those strategies have been put in place but as the committee will appreciate, circumstances will differ depending on whether one is in the community centre in Ballydehob or in the middle of Dublin.  We have had to be quite expansive and allow for different circumstances and were willing to do so.<\/p> <p>  When we moved to level 3, we were forced into school sheds and outdoors for training.  The guidelines expressly say that dance cannot happen.  We had already cut out group dancing ourselves, of our own accord.  That was very difficult for some teachers who do a lot of group and c&eacute;il&iacute; work and the social cohesion obviously suffered.  The children so much wanted to dance that we facilitated pods of five or multiple pods of five.  We certainly could make that work.  The strategies we have put in place mean we have tracing abilities through the sign-offs.  We have followed those protocols, in line with our child protection policies which require us to appoint a designated liaison person.  We are more than willing to do all of that and believe that would be fair.<\/p> <p>  When it became clear in August that levels 3 and above were going to be a more regular feature of our lives, we started to lobby Members of the Oireachtas.  I am sure many committee members received multiple letters from me and I do not apologise for that because it is my job to represent our teachers.  We have engaged in lobbying and initially we sent letters to every Deputy.  We were advised that we should contact the Department of Health.

Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh na finn&eacute;ithe.  I thank them for the letters.  Not only are they nimble-footed on the dance floor, but they are also good with the letters.  They were heart-wrenching.  I read one from a six-year-old on the floor of the D&aacute;il, who said she loves to dance, wants to dance and is happy when she dances.  She epitomised the feelings of the dalta&iacute; &oacute;ga ar fud na t&iacute;re.  The witnesses do a great job.  I am glad that they mentioned the international convention that gives us that right, and that they are not one bit envious of other areas but are delighted for them.  However, there are clear inconsistencies which they mentioned, and I will not mention them again.  I speak for other dance studios.  I visited one in Clonmel on Monday, run by Alison Cronin, who teaches modern dance.  It is a fabulous studio.  It is bigger than this room.  It is amazing that one could not have six pupils in that.  I must declare that I have a niece, Kathy McGrath, who runs the McGrath School of Irish Dance, in case someone pulls me up on it afterwards.  She runs a school which has invested significantly in studios.<\/p> <p>  If dance studios do not reopen under levels 3 and 4, what impact will that have on many of the schools and jobs?  I know the witnesses answered the previous Deputy about the efforts that they have made already under the levels that we have, with appeals for sanitisation, pods, etc.  This is important for all children, and not all children are as academically-minded.  We can see the value of the dance that the witnesses referred to.  If the children can excel in dancing, it is important to them and there must be parity of esteem.<\/p> <p>  What employment opportunities do the witnesses see in the dance sector, including modern dance, and what impact do they think the lockdown is having on pupils with regard to getting tuition and reaching their potential, as well as getting employment in the sector?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2020112500002#C00200","speaker":"1612"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1606262400,"counter":668,"content":"<p>Ar an gc&eacute;ad dul s&iacute;os, we have definitely lost dancers, particularly some senior cycle students who have not been able to get to class.  They already spend much time on Teams and Zoom calls so they do not want to do whatever other activities they may be able to do virtually.  People between the ages of 15 and 17 are at a critical age, especially some girls who should be getting some sort of activity and are not getting that.  All of our activity has been cancelled, such as our anniversary world championships.  We understand that that needed to happen, but if pupils have nothing to focus on, with no focus to even get back into a class, then they drop off, so there has been a fall in numbers.  While I do not want to denigrate hobbies, for people who want to pursue dance, it is more than a hobby.  It is a way of life, a vocation and a professional practice.  If one looks at the foot of a ballet dancer or a hard shoe dancer, it is physical, punishing and disciplined.  People enjoy it but they are investing much into it and are not getting the opportunities to train for it.  We are already seeing teachers with greatly reduced numbers since parents will send them to whatever activity is actually happening rather than have the whole house fight over the one computer or two iPads to try to get all of their children into classes.  Ms Carberry may have more to say on that.  We have implemented quite strict return-to-class protocols.  If further recommendations come from this committee, we would be more than willing to take those on board, rather than a blanket ban on dancing without explanation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2020112500002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Orfhlaith N&iacute; Bhriain"},{"type":"speech","time":1606262400,"counter":669,"content":"<p>Are many young boys dancing?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2020112500002#C00400","speaker":"1612"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1606262400,"counter":670,"content":"<p>We have some very fine dancers but if they can go training with their football team but cannot go to their dance class, that is the end of them.

As well as that, in time, they would like to train as teachers and pass on our culture.  In my day, there were none of those shows or opportunities.  It is wonderful that Irish culture has now been brought to the world stage but if a whole generation loses out, it is not fair.  They are the future.  I have had my chances, such as they were in those times, but we need to look after our young people and ensure that they feel that there is something to look for.  It is wonderful that they are back in school.  I never thought I would hear a child saying that it is great that school is on again, although they were probably sorry after a few weeks.

Dance is not really a sport.  It is not really comparable to football or camogie.  Dr. N&iacute; Bhriain touched on the examination structure.  Apart from qualifying for teaching, we have a grade examination structure.  Both an Comhdh&aacute;il and the LRG have that.  Children across the spectrum take part in that annually.  We go from grade 1 onwards, which covers a little ceili dancing or figure dancing, a few questions as Gaeilge and a little music.  That is educational.  While a child might not win all the trophies or be top of his or her class academically, every child will be catered for and there will be a niche for them.  They will do their exam and it will give them confidence to speak up.  They will get a great sense of achievement, of going into do their dancing, answering the questions of the examiner and getting their certificate.  It may sometimes be a pass, it may be an honour, or it may be first class honours.  If they do not do so well in grade 1, then they will come to grade 3 or 4, it gets harder as it goes along, with more dances and more questions.  We knew there would be no feiseanna because of the numbers, so most of the children were preparing to do those grade exams before Christmas when level 3 arrived.<\/p><p>We knew we could not have the c&eacute;il&iacute; section - children could not even take hands for a four-hand dance - so we had already changed our curriculum such that we would give them more questions about c&eacute;il&iacute; dancing and dancing in general.  We had also changed the marking system.  Now, under level 3, we cannot do that.  Children had been looking forward to it and to getting their certificates.  It does not greatly lend itself to an online setting because there may be one child at home, in the kitchen, while the rest of the family are doing whatever else.  The child may be dancing on the tiles, perhaps doing a little bit in the kitchen, while someone else is on a carpet in the sitting room.  It is not the way to do an examination.  It is very important, from the child's and the teacher's point of view, that they get to do these grade examinations this year because it is the only thing they will have.  We have had all our big events cancelled, including our 50th celebration of An Comhdh&aacute;il this year, naturally, because the crowds were not permitted.  We would very much like to be able to do these exams.  The children go in and do them on a one-to-one basis with the teacher and the examiner, so we hope we might be able to find some way of doing the examinations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2020112500002#C00900","nonspeaker":"Ms Carol Carberry","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1606262400,"counter":676,"content":"<p>Dr. N&iacute; Bhriain would probably like to come in on that too.

I fully support, as we move down the levels, the creation of pods for Irish dancing.  We do it with childcare and so on and it can be done with Irish dancing.  I know this is something my local dance school, the O'Reilly Bransfield School of Dance in Longford, was planning to do prior to the changes being made.  I firmly believe it can be done safely.  The last thing any of us wants is something that will damage our culture.  As has been said, we have built this up internationally.  Irish dance is world-famous now through Riverdance, Lord of the Dance, etc., and that is the level we want to keep it at.  Were there any concerns prior to Covid?

Going back to Deputy Mythen's question as to whether dance is art or sport, I would like to think that the dancers think like artists but they have to train like athletes because dance is very physical.  We want our dancers to be thinking dancers.

I met the previous iteration of this committee in June of last year as part of the process leading to my appointment as chair of the Arts Council.<\/p><p>Since that date, the council has undergone significant change.  My early tasks as chair included overseeing the appointment of three new board members as well as the recruitment process for a new director.  I am pleased to be accompanied today by Maureen Kennelly, who took up her role as Arts Council director last April.<\/p><p> We are now living in a very changed world.  The Covid crisis has impacted hugely on jobs and livelihoods in the arts sector as well as undermining the financial viability of many arts organisations.  With the first lockdown last March, months and, in some cases, years of planning for events simply ended overnight.  Arts and entertainment remains one of the sectors most affected by the Covid-19 restrictions.  A recently commissioned report for the Arts Council by EY shows that in 2020, the decline in economic activity in the arts sector will be approximately 55% compared with 11% for the economy as a whole.  Latest CSO data shows a 67% decline in economic activity in the sector.  That is the scale of the challenge.<\/p><p> Against this huge challenge for the sector, artists have responded to lift all our spirits.  The public response to, and engagement with, the work of artists online have been overwhelmingly positive.  The value of the arts has never been more evident to each of us as citizens and as human beings.<\/p><p> At the outset of this crisis, the Arts Council fast-tracked payment to over 450 organisations and asked them to prioritise payments to artists with whom they had hoped to work.  With freelance artists also in mind, the council also focused on getting bursary decisions made quickly and funds distributed across all art forms.  Despite repurposing current and future spending plans, the council, at that time with a budget for 2020 of &euro;80 million, simply did not have the firepower to offer a medium-term response to the crisis.<\/p><p> Like other organisations, including the National Campaign for the Arts, the Arts Council worked to ensure the arts was elevated in public policy considerations and in the allocation of public expenditure.  There was extensive engagement with the political and governmental system to make the case for additional funding.  Following discussions with the previous Government, and then Minister and current Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, the council received an additional &euro;20 million in July.  With the support of the current Government, and the new Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, Deputy Catherine Martin, a further &euro;5 million was received in the summer months, bringing the council's 2020 budget to &euro;105 million.<\/p><p> The budget day decision to increase the Arts Council's budget for 2021 to &euro;130 million was a welcome and historic decision.  I said on budget day that money does not solve every problem, but this was an important endorsement of the value of artists and the challenges they face.  Certainly, having &euro;130 million as a baseline minimum budget beyond 2021 will be hugely significant for the sector.<\/p><p> As chair of the Arts Council, I am working on the assumption that the Covid-19 crisis will continue through 2021.  Restrictions will continue to impact on creative practice and public engagement with the arts.  Two points illustrate the demands the council is facing.  To the end of August last, the Arts Council had received requests for &euro;152 million in financial support from individual artists and arts organisations.  That figure will hit &euro;200 million by the end of the year.  There has also been a 56% increase in funding applications so far this year.<\/p><p> The Arts Council has provided emergency stabilisation funding for key organisations.  These organisations are household names.  They are essential for local communities to engage with the arts and for artists to show and display their work.  They include the Belltable in Limerick, the Everyman in Cork and the Pavilion in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  This emergency stabilisation funding from the Arts Council will prevent closure by the end of 2020 but with ongoing Covid-19 restrictions, these organisations will still face significant challenges in 2021.<\/p><p> In dealing with the crisis, the Arts Council has also given priority to increasing the number of bursaries to individual artists.  Bursaries are an excellent way to allow artists the time and space to create work.  Demand has always outstripped the available resources.  At this time of crisis, a bursary is a vital policy response to support livelihoods.  Ms Kennelly and I can provide more specific detail to the committee but by the end of the year, the Arts Council will have provided direct funding to 1,200 individual artists who otherwise would have been without work; funding to 750 different organisations right across the country supporting festivals, venues, production companies and resource organisations, which has a significant impact on 2,000 directly employed staff and a further 20,000 artists; and made 1,100 awards  to artists and arts workers to fund their professional development.  In the past month alone, over &euro;16 million in funding has been allocated across the sector and over the next few weeks, a further &euro;7 million in project awards will be distributed.<\/p><p> I assure the committee that the Arts Council remains committed to its current strategic plan, Making Great Art Work, and the two key policy documents in respect of paying the artist and equality, human rights and diversity.  The staff of the council, who have worked tremendously hard since the onset of the crisis, and the board are committed to the two main objectives to the current strategic plan, namely, the role of the artist and public engagement with the arts.  We will be able to provide the committee and the members with more detail on plans for 2021, which will continue to be a tough time for the arts sector, notwithstanding the increase funding from the State.<\/p><p> I indicated that I was appointed chair of the Arts Council in June of last year.  In the months that followed, I had the privilege of experiencing all that is good about the different art forms in various venues across the country.  Returning audience engagement and protecting the livelihoods of artists and arts workers are the challenges for the Arts Council for next year.  In that regard, I ask those in government who are tasked with examining and making determinations on the Covid-19 restrictions to reopen the doors of galleries and arts centres.  These are well-run, safe spaces with an ability to professionally manage numbers.  Having attended indoor performances at the Kilkenny Arts Festival in August and the Dublin Theatre Festival in September, which operated under strict safety procedures, I have the same ask for theatres.  Please open their doors and keep them open.  In moving from level 5 restrictions, the value and importance of in-person engagement in the arts across the country must be recognised and acknowledged.  It is hugely important.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2020112500002#E00600","nonspeaker":"Professor Kevin Rafter","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1606262400,"counter":694,"content":"<p>I thank Professor Rafter.

We have seen that it has been extraordinarily generous and graceful in its response, has turned to the public and found new ways to reach the public in the past eight or nine months.<\/p> <p>  Our immediate priority was to reassure organisations that their funding would be secure for the year and to make that available to freelance artists.  We have a policy known as \"pay the artist\" and we really wanted to make sure that freelance artists were looked after at this time.  Their need is the greatest one we have ascertained as the year has gone on.<\/p> <p>  As we move into 2021, our priority is to ensure the core infrastructure is protected and we protect and sustain the many organisations we support throughout the country, for example, the Baltimore Fiddle Fair, the Ramor Theatre in County Cavan, the Wexford Literature Festival and the Wexford Opera Festival, in order that they come out of this crisis in a healthy state and ready to deliver to their full potential to the public.  We have seen how much the public have missed the arts during the crisis.  The Joni Mitchell refrain, \"That you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone\", never rang more true.  The response has illustrated for the whole country that we are incredibly proud of the arts.<\/p> <p>  We are grateful for and delighted with the extra funding.  It will allow us to protect the core infrastructure through next year and realise a fully vibrant healthy sector as we move into the back end of 2021.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2020112500002#F00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Maureen Kennelly"},{"type":"speech","time":1606262400,"counter":698,"content":"<p>I welcome Professor Rafter and Ms Kennelly.  Talking about the resilience of artists is important.<\/p> <p>  I welcome the ESRI report yesterday on cultural activities for teenagers.  Perhaps the committee could have a separate meeting to discuss that important report on engaging teenagers and young people.<\/p> <p>  I will put a couple of direct questions.  The Government commitment was clearly shown through the additional &euro;50 million that will be provided next year.  One of our key concerns is that this funding gets into the hands of artists, artistic communities and venues.  Does the Arts Council have the capacity to ensure that happens and can the witnesses give us an assurance in that regard?<\/p> <p>  The role of the arts in rebuilding our communities will be very important.  Professor Rafter mentioned the important role the arts have played in helping us through this period.  As we emerge from Covid, the ability to socialise again will be a challenge.  I want him to talk about that, particularly capacity-building in community arts organisations.<\/p><p>The community and voluntary sectors in the arts have also been hit in a particularly big way.  I endorse the call with regard to galleries, theatres and arts centres being reopened.  We could go into the National Gallery next door and we are more on top of people in a supermarket than we would be there.  The space is there and it serves an important cultural function.<\/p><p> I have raised with the Department the ability of international performers and artists to travel and be treated in the same way as elite sports people so they would be allowed to travel for recitals or performances.  The Department seems to be very reluctant to grant them this particular status.  It is an issue of concern for a number of the major festivals.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2020112500002#F00700","speaker":"1638","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1606262400,"counter":700,"content":"<p>Every member has echoed the comments made on the importance of the arts and the challenges they face during this pandemic and the resilience they have shown.  My question is similar to that of Senator Byrne with regard to how the increased arts funding budgeted for next year will be administered and how it will filter down to the artists and the people who could benefit most from it.  I assume up and coming musicians can apply for the bursary.  I am from west Cork where we have a thriving organic music industry and the only arts funding many local musicians have been successful in getting is from the local authority arts department and the bursary there.  Very few were successful with regard to Arts Council funding.  I ask the witnesses to elaborate on the avenues available to them.<\/p> <p>  With regard to Arts Council funding applications in general, it is common to hear quite often from artists that it is quite arduous and there is a lot of paperwork, red tape and accounting involved.  They say they need to be more than just artists to apply for it and that they need to be solicitors, lawyers and accountants as well.  I totally empathise with this because they need to spend as much time as possible being creative and these lengthy application forms eat into that time.  I am sure this is something the witnesses have been made aware of.  Fast-tracking of funding to 400 artists was mentioned.  That is fine when the applications are in but is there any way we could streamline and fast-track the application process for this vital funding for the arts community throughout Ireland?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2020112500002#G00200","speaker":"1545"},{"type":"speech","time":1606262400,"counter":701,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for joining us and for the extraordinary work they have done in the past in nurturing the development of arts in Ireland, particularly the work they are doing now to support the community, which, as Mr. Rafter has pointed out, has found itself in probably the most challenging place ever in terms of being able to survive and thrive and, hopefully, come out the other end intact and ready to enthrall us with their work again.<\/p> <p>  I echo the words of Deputy O'Sullivan on the experience of local artists.  I am fortunate in that I own a small theatre in east Galway and I am the co-founder of our local Carrabane Arts Festival, where, with Arts Council support and the support of others, we are able to allow people in a small community to experience what I argue is some of the best art in terms of theatre and music that Ireland has to offer.  There is something special happening in rural communities throughout the country now in engendering artistic endeavour at local level and showcasing the best of what we have to offer as a country to local people.  I refer to what is happening in Clifden and the Shorelines Arts Festival in Portumna and there are many other examples.<\/p> <p>  My sense is that if we were to focus on nurturing this over the coming five to ten years, we could create an ecosystem of artistic endeavour at local level that we have not seen in this country previously.  I want to get the opinions of the witnesses on how exactly we can do this.  I would argue it is through our network of local authority arts officers.  They are charged with nurturing and developing artistic endeavour at local authority level and I hear they are constantly strapped for resources in Galway and throughout the country.  Should this be considered to rebalance investment in our arts?<\/p> <p>  With regard to what is happening now and the supports the Arts Council is offering to the artistic community, I echo Deputy O'Sullivan.  I hear that the application process is especially convoluted and particularly challenging for people whose expertise is in producing wonderful art and not in legalese or accounting practice.  Perhaps one example I suggest we might look to is that of the sports capital grant.  The Department has succeeded over the past four to five years of simplifying the application process for sports capital grants throughout the country.  It is all done online.  It is much more straightforward now than it was when it began.  There is a lot to be learned from that process and this experience.  Well done to the Arts Council on doing something really valuable and special.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2020112500002#G00300","speaker":"1483"},{"type":"speech","time":1606262400,"counter":702,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for all the work they have done because it is very important that we look after our artists.

I am concerned that the witnesses have said they did not have the firepower when the Arts Council had &euro;80 million to handle.  Now it has almost double that at &euro;130 million, how will it handle it?<\/p> <p>  The council funds the First Music Contact organisation, which is responsible for the music industry stimulus package.

They provide fantastic performances and sell out every event they do.  My first question is on guarantees that they will be supported so they will be there after Covid.  I fully agree with opening theatres and it is something about which I have spoken to Ms Considine.  It can be done quite safely by marking out the seats for social distancing.  I am fully in favour of doing this.<\/p> <p>  Significant extra funding has been put in place and Mr. Rafter mentioned that &euro;200 million would be needed.  Is there sufficient funding to support everyone in the arts sector?  I have spoken to some people, in particular a gentleman I know who is in the rigging and lighting end of things, and they were not getting full support.  Has everyone been covered with supports from the Department of Social Protection?

Performing professional artists depend so much on live events, bums on seats and audience participation, whatever it might be.  For that to suddenly disappear overnight was absolutely devastating.  There has been a massive emphasis on online and virtual events and that is wonderful but I never want us to lose sight of real events and live events because they are completely different experiences.  I am not equating the value of them but they are a different experience and we need to do everything we can to get back to them.<\/p><p> That leads me to my next point.  I worked in the Garage Theatre for a number of years before I came to Leinster House.  The Garage Theatre, the Ramor Theatre and other such places are beautiful, magnificent buildings.  They are state-of-the-art.  I am concerned about what the future holds for them.  I am aware that the Arts Council will be doing everything to help them to open their doors and turn the lights on again.  As for providing the guidelines on living with Covid, I am aware there are bright lights in that there is hope regarding a vaccine but we do not know how quickly it will arrive.  We need to get people back into our theatres and get artists back on the stage as quickly as possible.  The crews and backstage people who make shows happen also need to get back to work as quickly as possible.  While virtual and online offerings are wonderful, and while they have got us over the hump of venues being closed, the artists and I would prefer real, live events.  We must do all we can to make sure that we get back to these.<\/p><p> The first session today involved the Irish dancing organisations.  I would like to hear the delegates' views on their sector.  I was involved in arts and performing arts education in respect of different dance genres, including ballet and hip-hop, and also in speech and drama classes and art classes.  I have always believed children who are not into sports can usually tap into the arts.  All the arts classes have been wiped off the scene.  A very good case was made in the first session today for bringing all the classes back in some form at level 3.  I would like to hear the delegates' views on the importance of arts education.  The practitioners and professionals have no jobs.  The dance, arts, and speech and drama teachers should have an opportunity to get back to work.<\/p><p> I compliment the Arts Council on reacting and responding very quickly and openly to artists who found themselves in awful circumstances.  I compliment the arts officers in local authorities throughout the country.  Could the delegates comment on what additional resources, both financial and human, have been given to these officers?  Is the council planning to give resources in this regard?  How is it helping?  The officers are on the ground dealing not only with professional arts practice but also with local and amateur arts practice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2020112500002#G00600","speaker":"1557","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1606262400,"counter":706,"content":"<p>I am catching up on Mr. Rafter's opening statement.

That was an important and welcome step at the time.<\/p> <p>  I have a question regarding yesterday's announcement by First Music Contact.  The Arts Council obviously funds First Music Contact.  When the Minister was here, I asked her whether there is a template for the live entertainment moneys that will be invested in the sector.  There was not really a template, as I could see it.  I wondered whether the money should be distributed by the Arts Council instead for popular music.  Is that part of the plan for future funding?<\/p> <p>  Many have been knocking on the door for many years asking for Arts Council support.  I have spoken to many who have received support for the first time this year.  The council is very often criticised for how it spends money but many of the problems can be traced to the lack of money.  The extra money gets to people and it is proving to be welcome and much needed by many artists across the State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2020112500002#H00200","speaker":"1686"},{"type":"speech","time":1606262400,"counter":707,"content":"<p>There was an array of comments, questions and observations.

We will work together.<\/p> <p>  As I said at the outset, the Arts Council has gone through a lot of change in a very short space of time.  It has a new chairman.  I have been in my position for only 17 months, and Ms Kennelly has been in hers only since April.  Then Covid hit.  We have seen a significant increase in funding.  Thanks is due to all the political parties in the Oireachtas in that regard.  In the space of 12 months, the budget has increased by 77%, notwithstanding that this is in the context of the Covid crisis.  The increase has led to a significant increase in the ability of the Arts Council to deal with the sector to support artists.  The board, in conjunction with the new director, is investigating organisational capacity.  We have had a number of additional meetings in recent weeks in this regard.  I assure members that the work is in train.  It is the focus of the director, my focus as chairman and the focus of my board colleagues.<\/p> <p>  All the members have thanked us but thanks is also due to the staff of the arts Council, who have worked really hard since March to get money out to the sector.  I was asked about money getting down to the ground.  It has.  It has got to the organisations.  We were asked to make sure it gets to artists.  That has been a priority, and that is the reason we have put a lot of the additional money into bursaries.  It gives the artist the ability to have the headspace to work.  That has been a priority, and it will continue to be one into 2021.  The council is formulating budget plans for 2021 and determining where the money is to be spent.  Some will be spent on increasing the capacity of existing schemes and there will be some new schemes.  The director and her staff are in discussions with the sector.  There has been ongoing communication across the art forms.<\/p> <p>  With regard to audience engagement, reopening is important.  I hope we will have good news but there is no reason why galleries and art centres across the country should not be open.  I was at the Kilkenny Arts Festival in August.  Social distancing was adhered to at the performances and there were limited numbers.  The organisers did a tremendous, safe job.  The arts sector can deliver in this regard and it has shown that it can live with Covid and keep the doors open.  We are minded to believe that, irrespective of levels, the sector should be trusted to open the venues for the public.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Cannon mentioned the Clifden Arts Festival.  It is one of the first events I attended as chairman of the Arts Council.  Regional spread is important to the council.<\/p> <p>  Regarding collaboration with local authorities, the authorities put about &euro;30 million plus into the arts.  It is important that they continue with this expenditure in 2021 and that it works alongside the increased expenditure by the Arts Council.  There is a good, positive relationship between the council and the local authorities.  We co-fund arts centres, bursaries, and residencies.  That relationship is exceedingly important.  It helps to get money into the hands of artists.<\/p> <p>  I realise other issues were raised but perhaps Ms Kennelly could contribute before I contribute again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2020112500002#H00400","nonspeaker":"Professor Kevin Rafter"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1606262400,"counter":709,"content":"<p>The range of the members' questions reassures me greatly that the plans we have in place are absolutely hitting the buttons.  I was nodding vigorously at everything the members were saying.  There are many plans in train that will take on board their concerns.<\/p> <p>  Two members mentioned youth education and the ESRI report.  The effect of the pandemic on young people, including children, is enormous.  It is fantastic that formal schooling can continue but, as the Chairman said, there is genuine worry over the extracurricular activities.  We have seen the massive, positive effect they have had on children's lives, both through cognitive development and the sense of satisfaction and well-being in life.  We are anxious that extracurricular activities be allowed to restart as soon as possible, along with more structured arts events.<\/p> <p>  We talked about international travel.  I agree that the hampering of international travel, both inwards and outwards, is a factor.  Since we have a small market here, the international marketplace is important to artists.  I welcome the suggestion that artists should be treated in the same way as elite sportspeople.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the difficulty with the application process, we have heard about this before, as the members have all acknowledged.  It is a matter that we are very much taking on board.  We will be launching a new IT system.  There is a major transformation project ongoing in the council that will certainly make things easier and more flexible.  In tandem with that, our very dedicated and highly motivated staff have delivered far more webinars this year for the various constituencies, including the dance, music and theatre sectors.  Paradoxically, Zoom makes all this much easier.<\/p><p>One can invite hundreds of artists, arts administrators and arts workers to events like this.  We will be doing more of those really essential, hand-holding exercises.  Additionally, we are looking to appoint a number of access officers, although they may not end up being called that.  They will be located throughout the country and will be dedicated to helping people with the application forms.  We will streamline and simplify them, but we will put in place extra resources, saying to people that we hear them, that these are too difficult and that we want to make those key resources available.<\/p><p> Deputy Cannon talked about Clifden.  I want to highlight that Tuam has been a creative place all this year and has done astounding work.  We are in wholehearted agreement with the Deputy about the absolute impact that communities on the ground can have.  We will be nominating more creative places over the next few years because, as we have seen, the impact in Tuam has been terrific, with people taking over the town hall.  It has been a really positive result for us.  <\/p><p> We have seen that the way we all live is going to change dramatically in the coming years.  More people will live closer to their homeplaces and live away from cities.  I am from a small village in north Kerry and I have lived all over Ireland.  That is a subject so close to my heart and that of the rest of the team at the Arts Council.  We are looking at the whole country as a sort of civic forcefield whereby there will be fantastic pockets of activity.  We are coming down with thousands of gifted artists and we have a necklace of art centres where we can stitch the Backstage, the Garage, the Ramor Theatre into their communities of artists.  We are going to do powerful work in years to come.<\/p><p> On the specific topic of First Music Contact, it is one of our key strategic funded organisations.  It brought together an independent panel to disburse those funds.  That panel consisted of a very wide range of expert people and we were consulted on the make-up of that panel.  It was able to disburse those funds very quickly, to a very wide range of artists, including those who would never have seen those funds as being available to them.  Similarly, the live music stimulus has been delivered separately by the Department.  We are in close contact with the Department all the time about them because everything has changed so much and there are new ventures.  We have full confidence in and applaud First Music Contact on the Trojan work it did in disbursing those funds.<\/p><p> We had a Covid award earlier this year, which we introduced very quickly upon the onset of Covid-19.  A total of 67% of applicants to that fund were entirely new, many from the music industry.  That is what one finds.  The pandemic hit just as St. Patrick's Day was about to fall.  Everybody from the Altans of this world to Jack Lukeman are all now in desperate need of funding, because their source of income has been obliterated.  <\/p><p> It is a new vista for us because there are people who would never have seen us as a viable source of funding.  We will be looking at the ways we work in terms of how we can allocate for these people in this new dawn.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2020112500002#H00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Maureen Kennelly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1606262400,"counter":711,"content":"<p>That brings us to a natural conclusion.

Since April of this year, Eir has connected 150,000 new customers to fibre broadband and repaired 200,000 faults.  Eir&rsquo;s team of approximately 1,000 field engineers has worked continuously throughout lockdowns and travel restrictions, following rigorous safety guidelines without losing a single day in the field.  Given the challenging wider circumstances, we are extremely proud of our field force and of their commitment to carrying out their essential roles and of the milestones they have achieved which have so vastly improved the lives of many who, as a result of Covid-19, depend on Eir's essential services.<\/p> <p>  Eir completed its rural fibre broadband programme during the summer of 2019, delivering fibre to the home, FTTH, to approximately 340,000 rural homes and businesses on time and on budget.  Eir invested &euro;250 million to deliver rural fibre, and as a result of this investment, 40% of rural premises in Ireland entered the pandemic with the opportunity to access high-speed fibre broadband at no cost to the taxpayer.  In recent months we have seen a significant increase in uptake on this network, which means, as a result of our investment, thousands of rural homes and businesses have been able to connect and continue to work and learn from home throughout this crisis.  The pandemic has reinforced to us all how vitally important this connectivity is.<\/p> <p>  In July, Open Eir reduced the wholesale cost of a standard FTTH connection on this network by &euro;70 and reduced rental charges by a further &euro;5 per month, which has led to increased affordability of these packages for customers.  We know members get representations from their constituents who have homes or businesses close to, but not included in the Eir rural fibre network and many of those people are desperate to be connected.<\/p><p>I, too, receive those representations and, given the world we find ourselves in today, I sincerely wish we could connect them all.  However, as a private company, we had a budget of &euro;250 million to invest and we developed the programme in a way that connected the most people possible.  We extended the programme from 300,000 to more than 340,000 homes and premises, ensuring we could connect as many as possible, but that programme is now complete.<\/p><p> Since then, the baton has been handed over to National Broadband Ireland, NBI, and our teams have moved on to our next fibre roll-out programme, which is the build of Ireland's fibre network, IFN.  The IFN programme is bringing the same FTTH gigabit fibre broadband to thousands of households every month in other parts of the country.  We are also supporting NBI fully in delivering the national broadband plan and we are confident that it will deliver fibre broadband to rural homes in the fastest possible way.<\/p><p> For those households within the national broadband plan, NBP, intervention area that have longer to wait for fibre broadband, we are investing &euro;150 million to upgrade and expand our mobile network, and we continued to do so throughout the pandemic, to maximise the connectivity we can offer to customers.  While not as reliable as fixed broadband, our 4G mobile data coverage enables speeds fast enough for most office-based workers to work remotely, and we have seen data usage increase by 80% over this time last year as more people use this network for high-speed data connectivity.  We have been increasing coverage week by week throughout the pandemic as we push towards our target of outdoor coverage for 99% of the geography of Ireland.<\/p><p> Following the completion of Eir's rural FTTH programme last year, our networks team immediately turned to the &euro;500 million investment in the IFN urban and suburban FTTH programme.  Once this programme is completed within the next four years, Eir's gigabit FTTH network will extend to 1.8 million homes and business or approximately 75% of the total in Ireland.  The total fibre footprint, including fibre to the cabinet, will be approximately 85%.  In total, Eir has now passed 690,000 premises with FTTH broadband and is currently passing 60,000 premises per quarter, delivering gigabit fibre to enough people in those homes to fill Croke Park every month.<\/p><p> As is the case with the national broadband plan, Eir's FTTH network is future-proofed and, once completed, will push Ireland towards the top of the international leader board for broadband connectivity, making the country an even more attractive place to live, learn, work or to open a business.  While Ireland competes with other countries for telecoms investment, our shareholders have committed to continuing to invest in the highest quality networks for as long as the regulatory environment ensures a fair return on that investment.  The future regulatory challenge will be to ensure that there is a clear, cohesive policy developed that provides a clear path to allow legacy services to move to those more modern networks for the benefit of all users.<\/p><p> I will now move on to talk about customer care.  Every business in Ireland has been challenged profoundly by the pandemic.  Eir's challenge has not been in managing our network or keeping customers connected, it has been providing a quality care service to our customers at a time when our retail stores were closed, we moved hundreds of care agents to remote working overnight, we had an effective freeze on new hiring and training because of health regulations, and we saw a 30% increase in call volume versus the same time last year.  The result was longer than acceptable wait times for our customers and I apologise unreservedly for that.  I also welcome the opportunity today to explain why this has happened, what we have done, and what we will do to address these longer wait times, and to give my personal commitment that this is being resolved.<\/p><p> When I was appointed CEO of Eir in 2018, I was determined to make customer care a point of difference for the company.  Like most large telecoms operators, Eir had long before followed the trend of outsourcing its customer care to specialist operators.  This led to a continued high turnover of staff and customer service that was not up to standard.  Two years ago, we decided to take those jobs back in-house to improve the experience for Eir's customers.  We opened a new multimillion euro care hub in Sligo, creating hundreds of new jobs, and expanded our regional centres in Cork and Limerick, adding additional jobs in both those locations.  Bringing these jobs back in-house was challenging.  It took time, but it did deliver a better experience for our customers by this time last year.  We believe it is the right long-term strategy for Eir and for our customers.  The insourcing programmes across care and other customer-facing roles have brought hundreds of staff directly into long-term, sustainable, pensionable jobs, with good career prospects, in regional locations.<\/p><p> When the pandemic hit and the lockdown restrictions were put into operation, Eir was first to move all care centre staff to remote working to ensure their own safety.  As a result, we also did not lose a single day of service throughout the pandemic.  This time last year, our care agents, many of them only new to their roles, and used to the on-site support of their colleagues, trainers, IT and team leaders, were delivering call wait times for customers of five minutes or less and handling an average of 40 calls a day.  Today, working from home, they no longer have that on-site support network, and so we have seen increased wait times and a reduction to 30 in the average number of calls handled.  For example, if an agent faces a systems issue today, we have to courier their computer back to our IT team, which means that an issue that could have been resolved in a few minutes pre-Covid could now take a day.<\/p><p> Working from home can be challenging for care centre staff, most of whom are younger and often working from a shared apartment or a busy home with young children.  Working in a bedroom or at a kitchen table is not the job that our staff signed up for, and we have lost 80 staff between March and July when we were unable to recruit due to lockdown restrictions.  On top of this, during the period that our retail stores were closed, queries that would have been generally managed in-store now have to be managed by our care agents, for example, simple SIM card replacement.  With more people working from home and relying on our service for meetings, home schooling and entertainment, queries have increased dramatically.  This initially led to a 30% increase in calls to our centres versus the same time last year.  From March to July, the restrictions meant we were unable to hire and train new staff to replace leavers and manage the increased demand.  To account for the increase in calls and the lower productivity of working from home, we needed to add 70 new staff and instead we lost agents during the lockdowns.  When all these factors are added up, the result has been unacceptable wait times.<\/p><p> The protection of jobs throughout this challenging year is an absolute priority for Eir.  Staff in roles that could not continue as usual during lockdown, such as retail, were redeployed to support care.  We introduced a wide range of additional routes to support customers, including online forms for logging faults and requesting refunds.  When we reopened our retail stores, we extended the customer care services we offer in-store and introduced special hours for vulnerable customers, but as members know, footfall in retail is down across all businesses.<\/p><p> Once restrictions began to lift, we launched a national recruitment drive, and we have been hiring and training staff across Sligo, Limerick and Cork efficiently and while adhering to safety guidelines.  Travel restrictions, social distancing and the requirement for initial on-site technical training limit the pace of hiring.  These are real challenges facing all businesses as restrictions continue for longer than anyone anticipated.  By the end of this month, we will have hired and trained almost 120 new staff.  This is something we are proud of, particularly in light of the economic shock and job losses Covid has brought to Ireland.  Today we continue to hire throughout the country.<\/p><p> Our average call wait times have decreased as a result of these measures, from an average of 30 minutes during the early stages of the pandemic to less than ten minutes today for our main care line.  There are some variations to those times depending on the service required, but general care is the main point of customer contact.  With new hires starting all the time, we expect the wait times on our main care line to average five minutes before Christmas.  This is still not where we would like it to be, but resolving care wait times has been our number one priority and we have worked hard in an environment where every call centre in the country has longer than acceptable wait times because of Covid-19.<\/p><p> I do understand the frustrations of members as constituents contact them regarding Eir.  We know the service we provide is essential, and for many, especially the most at risk, their phone and broadband is a lifeline to their loved ones and the outside world.  We have more than 3,200 people working in Eir and every person, from the 1,000 field engineers through to our retail staff and care agents in Sligo, Cork and Limerick, hears these stories from friends, family and neighbours.  We are all disappointed at the service levels we have provided.  We are determined to rectify this and return wait times to acceptable levels and to continue to improve from there.<\/p><p> Once again, I thank the Chairman and members for the opportunity to address some of these points here today.  I look forward to answering any questions they might have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2020112500002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Carolan Lennon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1606262400,"counter":719,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Lennon very much for coming in.

Second, what is Eir doing to remedy that?

We had representatives of National Broadband Ireland, NBI, before us this time last week.  They are agreeable to working with Eir to see if it can effectively speed up the connection of these gap intervention areas, where there are customers who are looking over their ditch at their neighbours with broadband, into the Eir fibre network.  Is Eir willing to discuss such an arrangement with National Broadband Ireland to connect these people who have been left out in the cold by Eir?  We have been in touch many times, trying to get the extended connection.  Eir was doing it for a period but certainly over the past year or two that changed.  I put those two questions.  What is Eir doing to remedy the complaints about wait times so people can get access to Eir?  It is a communications company so by definition it should be promoting quick access.  Second, will Eir work with National Broadband Ireland to look to expedite connection of the people in the gap areas, where there is Eir network literally 100 yd. up the road, or less?

When we first moved people home, we did not know if that was going to be for two, three or nine months.  Initially, in April, our productivity levels were actually pretty good, people were relieved to be out of a contact centre environment and there was a novelty factor to working from home.  However, as that progressed, a number of people said it was not for them, so they left.  One could not hire safely and train safely during that time, so that gave us a gap.  Over time we have also seen the number or calls people have been able to handle from their home in a day decrease, and that is in no way a criticism of them.  I understand completely how difficult it must be for them; they do not have tech support, some of them do not have great connectivity where they are and we did not hire them to be working from their homes.  To be fair to them, we hired them to be working from a contact centre.  Of course, we also saw an increase in the number of calls.  What are we doing about it?  On hiring, once the restrictions were lifted we started hiring.  We have hired 120 people.  We are not done yet and we continue to hire.  Six people start on our tech support team this week and we have more people starting on the care desk.  We will continue to hire until we have enough people to manage that.  That is what we are doing.  It is much slower than it used to be.  We hire in teams of five now because that is what we need to do to keep to the 2 m and all of that.  We used to be able to have much bigger teams when we were recruiting in the past.  That is the first point.<\/p> <p>  The second point is that we are working with the teams in their homes, we are trying to make things easier for them with the technical stuff, we are trying to keep them motivated and we are trying to encourage them.  We are trying to put our arms around them and ensure they do not feel all on their own in dealing with customers who, obviously for good reasons, are not happy with Eir.  They are at the front line of that.  We are absolutely trying to increase that productivity but are doing it in a way that is very conscious of what our staff are putting up with.<\/p> <p>  The third point is trying to take calls away from the contact centres.  We have briefed everyone in retail on care issues.  All the retail systems have been updated to be able to deal with care queries.  We have introduced hours in retail before 11 a.m. for vulnerable users to try to give people another outlet to ring, and not just the contact centre.  Unfortunately, not just in our business but across lots of businesses, with the current restrictions retail footprint is down so we are not getting many people going into our stores at the moment.  We have also put many of the key activities, like getting a refund and reporting a fault, online so customers can use an online form.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2020112500002#C03800","nonspeaker":"Ms Carolan Lennon"},{"type":"speech","time":1606262400,"counter":758,"content":"<p>I will let my colleagues follow up on that.

To follow up on the Chairman's point, the difficulty many people have is that they see fibre from Eir on a pole 30 m from the entrance to their homes and they cannot understand clearly why Eir is not in a position to provide a service to them.  We are not asking it to go a mile or three miles up the road.  We are asking it to review where its service terminates and to look within close proximity to that to see if it can do any extension.  We all understand that NBI now has a contract but we would like Eir to consider that.<\/p> <p>  I will move on to the customer care issue because there is no doubt that people are concerned about their inability to report faults to Eir and get an adequate response.  Ms Lennon said that Eir has had 200,000 faults since April.  That seems a very high number.  She has given an explanation for that but could it be argued that there has been a lack of investment in infrastructure over recent years?

It is for the trouble-shooting tech support team.  Those people are qualified in terms of tech support.  In terms of care, mostly it is a query about a bill, with people saying it is not what they expected it to be.

Eir has a serious problem which has to be addressed.  It has a problem with its customers, with its image and with its service and, if it does not move to correct these problems, it will do serious damage to the long-term future of the company.  The only thing saving it at the moment is that its customers are effectively hostages to fortune.  They are with the company and are signed up to it and have no avenue out.  If they had, people would be deserting the company on a great scale.<\/p> <p>  Ms Lennon was appointed CEO in 2018.  One of the major initiatives she identified was customer care.  She said she wanted to ensure that she made a difference in respect of the company's customer care.  She made a decision to move from outsourced and subcontracted customer care services to in-house customer care.  I will not dispute whether it was the correct decision or not, but it is obvious to me and to all of us here that she did not think this decision through, that she did not understand the extent of the service Eir needed to provide and that she did not gear up for it.  The proof of that can be seen in the opening statement where it says: \"Once restrictions began to lift we launched a national recruitment drive and we have been hiring and training [...] while adhering to safety guidelines.\"  This in itself tells me that the company never had enough staff in the in-house service to deal with the level of problems it faced.  It is effectively reacting now rather than having had services prepared, designed and rolled out when they were needed.  <\/p> <p>  All of us, as public representatives, are inundated with calls.  I can only imagine what Ms Lennon's people are dealing with on the telephone.  Out of pure frustration and anger, people become abusive when dealing with issues regarding Eir.  The main reason for this is that they feel they are not getting a reaction.  My impression is that there is massive incompetence in the customer care programme, which seems to be in an absolute shambles.  Eir's customer care was bad when it was outsourced but, since being brought in house, it has gone from bad to worse.  Does Ms Lennon consider the initiative she took to have been ill-thought-out and that preparation was lacking?  Does she believe that, effectively, it has been a failure and that she needs to do something to correct it?<\/p> <p>  I acknowledge the point Ms Lennon made about making financial concessions.  Connection fees were lowered to make them more affordable.  It is not really a matter of affordability, however.  It is about accessibility, maintenance and customer care.  Those are the issues.  People will gladly continue to pay what they are paying if they get a proper service.  It is about a proper service.<\/p> <p>  What is Eir's relationship to National Broadband Ireland, NBI?  In 2018, Eir put fibre broadband cables into Terryglass.  I mentioned this to NBI when it was last before the committee.  It is a beautiful village and tourist destination with a strong local economy.  At the end of 2018, Eir's broadband infrastructure was 90% complete and the village was due to be fully connected in March 2019.  In November 2019, the new national broadband plan was announced and Eir effectively walked away from the area.  It never completed the works in Terryglass, even though they were 90% complete.  Terryglass has now moved from a blue designation on the map on which Eir had indicated its plans to deliver services into the amber designation under the new plan.  Terryglass will now have to wait to get broadband through the national broadband plan and NBI.  Why would Eir, a very strong company, walk away from Terryglass and not complete these works?  To the locals it looks like a reactionary commercial sulk as a result of NBI getting the new contract.  Eir left the people of Terryglass without a service.  It turned its back on them.  Can Eir return to Terryglass and consider providing a service?<\/p> <p>  I know of multiple examples of the kind of gap the Chairman mentioned earlier.  I live in the townland of Cormackstown, near Holycross.  There is a gap area in the locality.  There are 30 houses in this gap area, all of which seek connection to the service.  Eir's fibre-optic cables run by both sides of this group of 30 houses.  It would take very little to connect them to it but, again, Eir has refused point-blank to fill that gap.  I do not understand the logic of that decision.  Surely a company with a reputable reputation which is concerned with customer relations should be more considerate of people who do not have a service.  Among the owners of those 30 houses in Cormackstown are farmers, people who work from home and business owners.  They need a connection.  I have been on to Eir's operations people on numerous occasions and I just get a stubborn point-blank refusal to join up these areas in the middle which have missed out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2020112500002#F02200","speaker":"1609"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1606262400,"counter":831,"content":"<p>The Deputy asked whether insourcing has been a failure.

It took longer for us to set it up than we expected, particularly the greenfield operation in Sligo.  We will put our hands up in that regard without a doubt.  Do I still believe having customer care in-house and outside of Dublin is the right strategy?  I absolutely do.  We did not implement the decision as well as we should have, but I still believe it is the right decision.  We now have to get it right and prove that it was the right decision.

It is up to NBI to fill in those gaps.

It is literally cables from one corner of the room to the other corner and these areas in the middle do not have access.  They will be waiting for years for NBI to get to them.  If Eir made a decision to provide resources to do this, it could fill in many of these gaps without any big outlay on its part and would give a service to the people who have been deprived of one and, as a result, have been disadvantaged in their business and social lives and every other aspect of their lives.

In some ways, the witnesses and members on opposite sides of the room have similar jobs.  Members face people at election time, they vote for us and they do not really know how good we are until they need us.  It is the same with Eir.  People sign up to Eir and become its customers but the real litmus test is when something goes wrong with network, their billing or something else and they phone Eir's call centre.  Politicians get in trouble if we drop the ball and miss a constituency issue.  Eir is dealing with that multiplied several times over.  To have ComReg on its back, to be referenced on \"Prime Time\" and to be here today before an Oireachtas committee, all in the space of one week, is hugely embarrassing for Eir.  This is not personal.  This is about a company - corporate Eir - in front of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Transport and Communications Networks effectively being hauled over hot coals for letting down its customer base in Ireland.  It is embarrassing.  I have only been in the D&aacute;il since February.  This is a first for me.  I have never seen this.  We have dealt with trade unions and airlines as we try to get planes back in the sky and discuss transport networks but here we see a company that has let down its customer base.  Whether someone is in politics and lets down his or her constituents or in telecommunications and lets down customers, it is an unforgivable error that needs to be addressed.<\/p> <p>  In the past 12 months, I had to call Eir out twice on Twitter to get it to respond to me on an essential issue for a constituent.  This is also unforgivable.  I think it took a few days before I realised that I was not talking to Eir but a chatbot on Twitter.  It was not a real person.  The same names featured twice so Eir is either paying two people to run its Twitter account, which I doubt, or it is using chatbots.  Like the Chairman, on some days, I probably waited 30, 40 or 50 minutes.  Recently, I was on a call to Eir on my way to the D&aacute;il, which sometimes sits in the national convention centre.  When Eir eventually answered after about 50 minutes, I was going down the hill into the underground car park, and all members of the committee can relate to this, when the line cut out after Eir's representative answered because I had gone into an underground car park.  I nearly tore out what little hair is left on my head because it was utterly frustrating.  Try dealing with that several times a week.  It is infuriating.  <\/p> <p>  I also find it incredible that on 26 March, the then Taoiseach declared not just the workers in Eir but all workers in telecommunications to be essential workers who had certain privileges in terms of showing up in the workplace, being able to work and not having their work discontinued.  I find it incredible that this was the same month that Eir lost just under one fifth of its call centre workers and it took it almost until the last few weeks of this year to start to replenish them.  I get emails on Monday morning, and I am sure other Deputies and Senators here can testify to this, from people asking whether there are any jobs and telling me that their husbands or wives have lost their jobs.  I find it incredible that Eir lost 80 employees who have been deemed essential workers and did well-paid work.  The salary may be questionable but that is for these workers and Eir to work out in contract terms.  To have lost 80 workers and to have waited months to replace them, I find incredible.  <\/p> <p>  I would like to hear more about Eir's customer care service.  I know Ms Lennon referred to Eir's call centres in Ireland and we know where they are located.

For example, making a 12 m tower into a 24 m one, which is the application currently in my community, and it is a controversial one, and doubling the height of a tower suddenly makes it possible to sell off perhaps ten or 12 antennae spaces on it, each carrying a fee of perhaps &euro;6,000 to &euro;10,000.

It is a bit like Aer Lingus.  People will always look at Eir and Aer Lingus and say, \"Those are our companies.\"  That is a responsibility and it adds to Eir's job but the idea is out there among people, so there are extra demands.  That is just a fact.<\/p> <p>  We have spoken a lot about the reputational damage but it cannot be overstated.  The Ceann Comhairle broke protocol a couple of weeks ago to refer to Eir from the Chair.  That has never happened before.  Our Ceann Comhairle is fantastic.  I think people on all sides of the House would agree he is straight down the middle, so these are issues.  I have been a Teachta D&aacute;la only since February but I have been working in politics for nine years.  There has always been a reputational issue with Eir.  It has exploded this year but it always was the sick child, so to speak, across not just telecommunications but any kind of company we deal with regularly.<\/p> <p>  I will move on to the staff who were lost earlier this year because it is quite head-scratching.  To lose a large percentage of one's staff in a place such as Dublin, where even during the pandemic there may have been the odd chance of picking up another job, is different from losing staff in places such as Sligo or other large regional towns, where jobs are not as plentiful, even in good times.

It is bigger than we would like it to be and bigger than we think it should be.  We have tried a number of things because, again, such calls clog up the system.  We have an initiative with our contact centres to the effect that we try to get it right and get it done on the first call and the customer leaves happy with his or her problem solved or the thing we have agreed to do done so we do not give them reason for complaint.  We have also done other things.  For example, if the same person has called us, say, twice, before he or she can get to call us again, we try outbound-calling him or her to say: \"We know you have been on to us.  There is obviously something wrong or something that did not get fixed the last time.  What is going on?\"<\/p><p>I believed that was a great idea.  What we found was that people do not always take outbound calls, for example, and then we get a call back again.  We are trying to minimise the number of inbound calls in the first place.  The reality, however, is that if we do what we say we are going to do when we receive calls from customers, and if they get through to us promptly, there should be no reason for them to ring back.  Members will have seen the number of ComReg complaints last night.  It is now down to under 100.  It means the majority of problems were not that difficult to fix.  Some are very hard to fix in that planning permission or whatever may be required.  Such cases are in the minority.  Most problems are straightforward enough to fix.  It may involve closing accounts, as Deputy Dooley mentioned.  It is a matter of doing what we say we are going to do, such as changing someone's promotion.  Where it is not being done, maybe it is because people are under great pressure, or another reason, and this gives customers a reason to all us back.  We are all over the question of how to prevent the calls coming in by doing what we say we are going to do.

The subcontractor then said it was on the way but when he checked with Louth County Council, he discovered no application had been made.  He then contacted Eir, which said it was the responsibility of KN.  On contacting Eir, we were given information to the effect that the company is working on the issue.  That is the sort of issue arising.  We need clarity on this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2020112500002#L01600","speaker":"1498"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1606262400,"counter":966,"content":"<p>Because of the two.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2020112500002#L01700","nonspeaker":"Ms Carolan Lennon"},{"type":"speech","time":1606262400,"counter":967,"content":"<p>Exactly.<\/p> <p>  Elderly people, in particular, are encountering difficulties, specifically with telephone line questions that are not being dealt with.
