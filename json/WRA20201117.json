There are a\u00a0number of countries, which do not allow for the formation of representative associations in their armed forces and others which allow full Union membership.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  However, there is a common theme in that restrictions on the right to strike are generally accepted and this has been confirmed by the European Committee of Social Rights.\u00a0In 2017, the European Committee of Social Rights, in a non-binding ruling, found that Ireland was not in violation of the European Social Charter in respect of the prohibition of the right of military personnel to strike. However it found that Ireland was in violation of the\u00a0Charter\u00a0in respect of the right to organise, that is to affiliate to certain organisations, and the right to negotiate collective agreements.<\/p>  <p>  It should be noted that the basis for the complaint pre-dates a number of significant change in how the\u00a0Permanent Defence Force representative associations\u00a0engage in collective bargaining. In the past, contemporaneous negotiations, referred to as a parallel process, were conducted with non-ICTU affiliated members, including the Permanent Defence Force representative associations.\u00a0In a change to previous practice, in the course of the negotiations which led to the Public Service Stability\u00a0Agreement 2018-2020,\u00a0the Permanent Defence Force representative associations were represented alongside the other public service unions and associations at the negotiations,\u00a0which were held under the auspices of the\u00a0Workplace Relations Commission.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the right to organise, that is to affiliate to certain organisations, the\u00a0European Committee of Social Rights, in arriving at its decision, took into an account a statement made in the complaint which claimed that ICTU had stated that &ldquo;PDFORRA could be affiliated to ICTU with whatever conditions the Government deemed necessary&rdquo;.<\/p>  <p>  This was considered as part of an independent\u00a0review of the Conciliation and Arbitration scheme for members of the Permanent Defence Force which was completed in 2018.\u00a0\u00a0One of the recommendations from that review was that the official side should, with the consent of the Minister, engage in discussions with ICTU to explore the practicalities of a Permanent Defence Force representative association forming association\/affiliation with ICTU, while giving due consideration to any likely conflict that might arise between such an arrangement and the obligations of military service.<\/p>  <p>  Defence management (civil and military) have engaged in discussions with the Permanent Defence Force representative associations and ICTU regarding the practicalities of a Defence Forces representative association forming association\/affiliation with ICTU.

There are important measures in place at all times to ensure that our budgetary targets are being met. These measures continue to be in place for all public expenditure, including core expenditure as well as additional expenditure allocated as part of the response to Covid-19. As is usual, my Department is in regular contact with all other Departments and offices to ensure that all expenditure is being managed within the overall fiscal parameters. There is regular reporting to Government on expenditure levels. <\/p>  <p>  As set out in the most recent Fiscal Monitor, published by the Department of Finance, total gross voted expenditure at end-October 2020 was &euro;65,547 million. This is &euro;8,604 million, or 15.1% ahead of profile. It should be noted however, that expenditure profiles for the year were published in February and are based on the expenditure allocations set out in the 2020 Revised Estimates Volume. This means that the impact of additional resources allocated in respect of Covid-19 are not reflected in these profiles. As such, spending can be expected to run significantly ahead of profile for the remainder of the year. Gross voted current expenditure of &euro;60,000 million, is &euro;8,662 million, or 16.9% above profile. Gross voted capital expenditure of &euro;5,547 million, is &euro;58 million, or 1% below profile and up &euro;886 million, or 19% on October 2019.<\/p>  <p>  The vast majority of identified overruns in 2020 to date relate to expenditure allocated in response to Covid-19. Current expenditure in the Department of Health is ahead of profile by &euro;1.36 billion at end October 2020. This is due to the drawdown of funds to the HSE, to support maximising capacity within the system and to allow for the purchase of necessary equipment such as PPE. The Department of Social Protection is ahead of profile by almost &euro;6.9 billion at this point in the year. This is due to payments introduced in respect of Covid-19 to support employees and businesses. There is a Covid-19 related impact on the Department of Transport, for which current expenditure is &euro;307 million ahead of profile at end October. This is due to the drop in passenger numbers and associated revenue as a result of public health measures. <\/p>  <p>  Looking at capital expenditure, the impact of Covid-19 can also be seen.\u00a0Capital expenditure in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is ahead of profile for end-October by &euro;587 million. This relates to the additional funding which was allocated in light of the impact of Covid-19 on businesses. The Department of Education is ahead of profile on capital expenditure by &euro;91 million. The main driver of this is the issuing of additional minor works grants in light of Covid-19.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has allocated significant additional resources to Departments in response to Covid-19. Expenditure Report 2021 set out total gross voted expenditure of &euro;87.1 billion for 2020, with additional expenditure of &euro;16.7 billion primarily driven by Covid-19. These allocations are being made in the usual way, with Estimates agreed by Government and voted on by the D&aacute;il. A number of Revised Estimates and Further Revised Estimates have been approved by the D&aacute;il in recent weeks and months to give effect to these increased allocations for 2020. A number of Supplementary Estimates have also been presented to the D&aacute;il in the last number of weeks and work is currently ongoing to finalise the last number of Supplementary Estimates for 2020.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700066#WRD04400","answer":true,"speaker":"1459"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Flood Relief Schemes","counter":133,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700066#WRD04500"},{"type":"question","counter":134,"qnumday":111,"qnumall":"[36705\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700066#WRD04600","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the status of flood relief measures for Carlingford, Greenore, County Louth; and the progress to date.","asker":"1498","askee":"1459"},{"type":"speech","counter":135,"content":"<p>Carlingford and Greenore was one of 300 communities that had their flood risk assessed by the Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) Programme.

The position remains as I set out in that response.<\/p>  <p>  The Criminal Assets Bureau is a multi-agency statutory body established under the Criminal Assets Bureau Act 1996. The Criminal Assets Bureau&rsquo;s remit is to target a person's assets, wherever situated, which derive, or are suspected to derive, directly or indirectly, from criminal conduct. <\/p>  <p>  In accordance with the Proceeds of Crime Acts 1996-2016, all funds collected by the Criminal Assets Bureau are forwarded to the Central Exchequer Fund. It is this Central Fund from which the Government draws for expenditure on all necessary public services and investment, including the provision of drug prevention programmes. The Constitution requires, and Government accounting principles provide, that public moneys be spent only as voted or approved by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, unless otherwise provided by statute.<\/p>  <p>  While there have been calls from time to time for moneys confiscated by the Criminal Assets Bureau to be ring fenced, a policy of ring-fencing moneys obtained by the Exchequer, and the reallocation of same for a specific purpose, runs contrary to the normal Estimates process. While allowing for a small number of very specific targeted exceptions, it is a general principle of public financial management that earmarking revenues for a specific expenditure programme would tend to\u00a0constrain the Government in the implementation of its overall expenditure policy.<\/p>  <p>  I understand that there would also be practical difficulties owing to the variable and uncertain nature of the value of the assets seized by the Criminal Assets Bureau in any given year. In addition, the potential delays caused by legal challenges to court disposal orders would also be problematic in terms of continuity of provision of funding to specific programmes or projects, whether drug related or otherwise. Therefore, because of the variable value and nature of assets seized by the Criminal Assets Bureau in any given year, such a revenue source would not be reliable for facilitating the proper planning of drug prevention programmes and the delivery of such services.\u00a0 Accordingly, there are no proposals to change the existing arrangements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700067#WRE04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1459"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Expenditure Policy","counter":200,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700067#WRE05000"},{"type":"question","counter":201,"qnumday":135,"qnumall":"[36703\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700067#WRE05100","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the analysis his Department has carried out into the expected additional cost implications to the Exchequer as a result of our role in the planned European Peace Facility further to the spending review carried out by his Department on expenditure on overseas peace support missions; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1577","askee":"1459"},{"type":"speech","counter":202,"content":"<p>The primary purpose of the recent Spending Review on Expenditure on Overseas Peace Support Missions carried out by my Department was to identify the direct and indirect costs of overseas operations by the Defence Forces.

The majority of capital projects are delivered on budget and on time and there is a high level of professionalism across the sectors. \u00a0Following last year&rsquo;s update of the Public Spending Code and in line with the principle of proportionality, the process for smaller projects in the Public Spending Code has been streamlined and the process for larger projects supports a better consideration of options, risks, costs and deliverability. <\/p>  <p>  However, the update of the Public Spending Code last year combined with lessons learned from domestic projects and international best practice highlighted the need for more structured scrutiny of major public investment projects, particularly in the areas of planned delivery, costing, and risk.\u00a0 Major public investment projects are considered to be those with an estimated project cost in excess of &euro;100 million. There are over 40 projects in this category in the Exchequer funded element of the National Development Plan. <\/p>  <p>  All the evidence shows that the greatest impact on improving project outcomes comes from careful project preparation and that external reviews from an independent party can be instrumental to enable good project and investment governance.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The new process is being informed by international practice and consultation with public sector stakeholders.

The Commission has informed Amazon of its preliminary view that it has breached EU antitrust rules by distorting competition in online retail markets.<\/p><p>It is important to state at this juncture that Amazon has not been found to hold a dominant position in the relevant retail market. The Commission in the first instance must prove dominance and only then can it investigate any alleged exclusionary behaviour and abuse of this dominance. <\/p><p>These cases form part of the Commission&rsquo;s wide-ranging competition agenda which is intended to ensure that there is fair competition in all EU markets.  This agenda also includes a forthcoming legislative proposal which aims to both ensure a fair-trading environment in the EU platform economy by tackling the market power of certain platforms and increasing the innovation potential and capacity of the EU online platform economy. This proposal, termed the Digital Markets Act (DMA), will seek to ensure that certain large platforms behave fairly and can be challenged by new entrants and existing competitors, so that consumers have the widest choice and the Single Market remains competitive and open to innovations. I understand that the Commission's proposals will cover online marketplaces and are due to be published next month.<\/p><p>In relation to a proposal to establish a new platform for retailers here, I think there is broad consensus concerning the benefits for retailers brought about by online platforms. These platforms can lower the costs of starting and especially scaling a business and can facilitate cross-border trading and access to new markets. The importance of these platforms has become even more apparent during the global Covid-19 pandemic.<\/p><p>I want to flag an important piece of legislation aimed at the users of online platforms including online intermediaries. The EU Platform to Business (P2B) Regulation came into effect on 12 July 2020 and aims to promote fairness and transparency for business users of online platforms. Under the Regulation, platforms are required to make their standard terms and conditions more transparent, and easily available to business users. The Regulation also provides effective and quick means to resolve disputes between businesses and online platform intermediaries via:<\/p><p>- platforms establishing internal complaints handling systems; <\/p><p>- commitments by platforms to engage mediation in good faith; and <\/p><p>- allowing businesses to be represented by associations or organizations in cases against platforms to stop or prohibit any non-compliance with the requirements of the Regulation. <\/p><p>The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission have been designated the national public body designated with enforcing the Regulation under - European Union (Promoting Fairness and Transparency for Business Users of Online Intermediation Services) Regulations 2020.<\/p><p>The Retail Forum was established in 2014 to provide a platform for engagement between retail representative bodies, retailers and the public sector on key concerns for the retail sector. The Forum,  which is chaired by the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment with responsibility for Business, Employment and Retail, enables key issues affecting the retail sector to be discussed, with a view to identifying practical actions which could be taken by Government, or by industry itself, to support sustainable jobs growth in the sector.<\/p><p>The work of the Forum has led to the introduction of the very successful Online Retail Scheme which supports retailers in growing their sales through online channels domestically and internationally. The Forum continues to focus on a range of policy issues including digital transformation. This important support combined with the continuing emphasis on digitalisation ensure Irish retailers are well placed to avail of the benefits online intermediaries and marketplaces present to them. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700069#WRG01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1474"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Data Centres","counter":289,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700069#WRG01700"},{"type":"question","counter":290,"qnumday":165,"qnumall":"[36680\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700069#WRG01800","dept":"Department of Trade, Enterprise and Employment","minister":"Minister for Trade, Enterprise and Employment","question":" the number of data centres by county; and the average monthly and yearly power usage in tabular form.","asker":"1579","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":291,"content":"<p>The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment does not collect or store the type of detailed information requested but the Deputy may wish to follow this up with the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications.<\/p><p>There may be some scope for different definitions of what could be considered a data centre or multiple data 'halls' on particular sites might be counted.

These are important loan schemes which remove the requirement of collateral for businesses in loans which can be used for liquidity and investment purposes.<\/p>  <p>  The CGS has operated since 2012 with variations in the level of contingent liability. Its current annual contingent liability is set out in S.I. 70 of 2017, Section 4(2). Here, the maximum annual lending amount is &euro;150 million with a risk share of 80 percent. It further indicates that the aggregate amount liable to be paid by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is set at 13 percent. This results in a maximum annual contingent liability for the Department of &euro;15.6 million. One claim of &euro;89,000 was received in 2020 so far under the 2015 CGS Scheme. In 2020, no other claims have been received.  <\/p>  <p>  The CCGS was passed through both Houses of the Oireachtas in July of this year as a scheme to establish stability to the lending market as a result of the COVID-19 health emergency. Since its launch on the 7th of September 1,817 applications for over &euro;104 million have been received by the three participating banks. More lenders are being evaluated and will be coming online over the next weeks. In order to give  businesses certainty, &euro;2 billion was agreed by government as the size of the Scheme.

This should allow more Irish businesses to access finance at reduced interest rates through the Scheme but may have implications for increased demand on the contingent liability levels.

I am aware that these closures can have secondary effects impacting landlords and I recognise that many landlords have debt repayment obligations as well as other ongoing costs.    <\/p>  <p>  The issue of commercial rents is primarily a contractual matter for the parties involved. However, the Government has urged landlords and tenants to talk to one another and come to some arrangement, as it is in everybody&rsquo;s interest that terms are amicably agreed. Landlords should be willing to do what they can to help their tenants to continue to operate rather than facing the risk of a vacant premises and inability to obtain new tenants.  Equally, tenants should pay what they can and speak with their landlord when difficulties arise.   <\/p>  <p>  On 1st October, I published the Code of Conduct between landlords and tenants for commercial rents, which has been agreed with landlords and business representatives for commercial renters.

To date, over &euro;24 billion had been made available in support measures for businesses, including a package of over &euro;7 billion worth of measures as part of the July Jobs Stimulus, and a total budgetary package of over &euro;17 billion announced in Budget 2021 to help those impacted by COVID-19 and related public health restrictions.

Based on these projections, it is expected that natural gas demand will increase by circa 10% to 15% by the middle of the decade before dropping back to current levels by 2030. The increased demand in the near term is primarily driven by the growth in electricity demand along with natural gas replacing coal, peat and oil in electricity generation. The reduction in the second half of the decade is expected as a result of increased levels of renewable electricity displacing generation from natural gas. <\/p>  <p>  The National Energy and Climate Plan projections indicate that by 2025 circa 80%, and by 2030 over 90%, of the natural gas consumed in Ireland will be imported via the two pipelines from Scotland. The expected reduction in domestic production is a result of the closure of the Kinsale gas field earlier this year, the forecast decline in production from the Corrib gas field and the Programme for Government commitment to end the issuing of new licences for the exploration and extraction of natural gas.<\/p>  <p>  The National Energy and Climate Plan set a target of 1.6 TWh of natural gas use (equivalent to 3% of total use) to be replaced by biomethane produced from agriculture and food waste and injected into the gas grid by 2030.

This represents an increase from the 150Mbps committed to under the Contract. The deployment plan forecasts premises passed in all counties within the first 2 years and over 90% of premises in the State having access to high speed broadband within the next four years. \u00a0<\/p><p>  I am advised by NBI that, as of 9 November 2020, over 126,000 premises across every county in Ireland have been surveyed, which is ahead of the full year survey target of 120,000 that had been projected by the company.\u00a0This activity involves physically walking the routes and documenting images, notes and measurements of the poles, cables and underground ducts in each area. This is informing design solutions for provision of the fibre network. This detailed design is then used to initiate the &lsquo;make ready&rsquo; project with eir for the area, where eir ensure any poles and ducts being reused are fit for purpose. It is also used to initiate works with the subcontractors deploying the actual fibre in the area.  The first fibre to the home connections are expected next month in Carrigaline, Co Cork\u00a0and they will be subject to technical testing and validation prior to a wider release of the area. I am advised that from the end of January retailers will be able to resell the service and householders in these areas will be able to order high speed broadband provided via the NBI network.<\/p><p>  In County Westmeath, I can advise that surveys have commenced in the areas of Mullingar, Sonna, Stonehall, Taghmon, Jamestown, Hopestown and Athlone. Surveys are\u00a0due to start in areas around Devlin in early 2021. I am advised that build works are\u00a0scheduled to begin in the summer 2021 in the Mullingar area. Further details are available on specific areas within\u00a0Westmeath through the NBI website which provides a facility for any premises within the Intervention Area to register their interest in being provided with deployment updates through its website . Individuals who register with this facility will receive regular updates on progress by NBI on delivering the network and specific updates related to their own premises when works are due to commence. <\/p><p>  Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network.

Since the publication of\u00a0the report, my Department, in conjunction with the IMDO, has been keeping the issue of direct shipping routes to the Continent under close review, particularly in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.<\/p>  <p>  The IMDO recently reviewed the conclusions and recommendations in the 2018 GB Landbridge Study and in particular the issue of direct maritime connectivity and capacity to Continental Europe at the end of the transition period.\u00a0 The IMDO analysis shows that there is more than sufficient capacity on existing direct services in the RoRo network between Ireland and mainland Europe to cater, if required, for all of the landbridge traffic currently estimated at around 150,000 trucks per annum.\u00a0 The shipping industry serving Ireland have shown that they are resilient, responsive and capable, without State intervention, of adjusting to and satisfying market demand.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has had very regular discussions with shipping companies and other maritime stakeholders about this issue since January 2019. \u00a0We have consistently received strong assurances from the shipping companies that if there is an increase in demand for shipping capacity on direct routes to Continental Europe, they will respond.\u00a0\u00a0Additional shipping links were added on direct routes to Continental Europe even during the Covid-19 pandemic in Summer 2020, with further improvements and increases in capacity announced to take place starting from January 2021. \u00a0Indeed in the last week, we have seen moves from Irish Ferries and Stena Line to change and increase their direct sailings to Cherbourg from January 2021 so that between them there will be a daily service available from Ireland to France.\u00a0 This will\u00a0further increase\u00a0capacity on that direct Continental Europe route.<\/p>  <p>  The Government considers that direct State intervention to establish State shipping links in the context of Brexit would\u00a0likely\u00a0undermine a market response resulting in an insufficient, inadequate and costly intervention being put in place.\u00a0Such an intervention would\u00a0be likely to result in legal challenges from incumbent shipping providers,\u00a0would result in breaches of EU state aid rules and consequent requirements for repayment of the state aids with interest, with resulting adverse impacts on the viability of any companies receiving such aid.\u00a0 It could also create difficulties for the State in extricating itself from the shipping market.<\/p>  <p>  As set out in the Government&rsquo;s updated Brexit Readiness Action Plan, published on 9th September 2020, businesses are being asked to consider moving,\u00a0in advance of the end of the transition period, to direct route options for the movement of goods from Ireland to the Continent, to avoid potential delays and the new procedures that will be introduced associated with using the UK landbridge. \u00a0Shipping companies\u00a0should also continue to assess expected future demand requirements and remain ready to respond to increased capacity demands, and all the indications are that this is happening.<\/p>  <p>  A communications campaign is currently underway, \"ACT now and Prepare to switch\", which encourages importers and exporters to focus on the direct route option now. This campaign\u00a0encourages stakeholders to Assess their current routes to market, Communicate their future needs clearly to shipping companies, and\u00a0Trial alternative services so that disruption to the GB Landbridge route does not preclude Irish businesses from accessing foreign markets.<\/p>  <p>  My Department will continue to closely monitor and keep under review the evolving situation regarding maritime connectivity to continental ports and will remain in close consultation with the maritime sector and other relevant stakeholders, including\u00a0importer\/exporter\/freight logistics associations and companies,\u00a0as we\u00a0all\u00a0prepare for 1 January 2021.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700072#WRK04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1578"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Road Tolls","counter":494,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700072#WRK04400"},{"type":"question","counter":495,"qnumday":234,"qnumall":"[36807\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700072#WRK04500","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if his attention has been drawn to plans to place a toll on the northern ring road in Cork.","asker":"1453","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":496,"content":"<p>As Minister for Transport I have responsibility for overall policy and securing exchequer\u00a0funding in relation to the National Roads Programme.\u00a0 Under the Roads Acts 1993-2015 and in line with the National Development Plan (NDP), the planning, design and construction of individual national roads\u00a0is a matter for Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII), in conjunction with the local authorities concerned.<b><\/b>This is also\u00a0subject to the Public Spending Code Guidelines and the necessary statutory approvals.In this context, TII is best placed to advise you on the status of this project.<\/p><p>Noting the above position, I have referred your question to TII for a direct reply.\u00a0\u00a0Please advise my private office if you do not receive a reply within 10 working days.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700072#WRK04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Motor Tax","counter":497,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700072#WRK04700"},{"type":"question","counter":498,"qnumday":235,"qnumall":"[36840\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700072#WRK04800","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the appeals process for appeals of motor tax arrears; the responsibilities of the office of Motor Tax and its Principal Officer in terms of timelines for dealing with such appeals; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Provision of the grant for M1 vehicles ceased in October 2019; however, grant support is still available for new N1 (vans and light trucks) commercial EVs.<\/p>  <p>  In Budget 2019,\u00a0the Minister for Finance\u00a0announced that fully electric commercial vehicles would be eligible for a 0% Benefit-in-Kind rate, up to &euro;50,000, without mileage conditions until the end of 2022. This announcement represented a significant financial incentive to many operating business vehicles. The Accelerated Capital Allowance Scheme also represents a substantial financial benefit to businesses, allowing the cost of commercial EVs and their related infrastructure to be written down in the year of purchase instead of over the traditional eight years. In addition, commercial EVs can avail of toll reductions up to a maximum of &euro;1,000 per annum, as well as lower annual motor tax.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The Minister recently approved the introduction of a grant for electric vehicle (EV) demonstration cars in recognition of the important role that such cars play in familiarising consumers with EVs. An EV Purchase Grant of &euro;3,800 is provided in respect of Category M1 demonstration cars registered by EV dealerships approved by the SEAI. The SEAI have notified EV dealerships of the terms and conditions of the grant and the means by which dealerships may apply for and receive the grant.<\/p>  <p>  An EV Spending Review published by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, found that Irelands current range of EV financial incentives are among the most generous in the world. As the Deputy is aware, care must be taken to ensure that a balance is struck between improving EV sales and not placing unsustainable costs on the Exchequer. Priority must remain on the most cost-effective measures that aid in Ireland's transition to a low carbon economy. Under the existing incentive regime we have seen the highest ever EVs sales in the last two months, despite the challenging times we are facing with COVID-19. <\/p>  <p>  I am committed, in my role as Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications and Minister for Transport to continue to\u00a0review the EV support schemes on an on-going basis as it is critical that we set Ireland on course to achieving the EV targets outlined in the Climate Action Plan. To this end, an Electric Vehicle Policy Pathway Working Group was established to consider the optimum mix of regulatory, taxation and subsidy policies available to Government to significantly accelerate EV sales. I am given to understand that the Working Group gave\u00a0consideration to the role of the commercial sector in helping to hasten this transition.

In line with this mandate, the Central Bank introduced macro-prudential measures for residential mortgage lending by such institutions in February 2015. The objective of these macro prudential measures is to mitigate systemic risk and promote financial stability, to increase the resilience of the banking sector and households to the property market and to reduce the risk of credit spirals from developing in the future. These macro-prudential measures apply certain loan-to-value (LTV) and loan-to-income (LTI) restrictions to residential mortgage lending by financial institutions regulated by the Central Bank. In general, the maximum mortgage limits are 3.5 times the borrower&rsquo;s income and, for first-time buyers, 90% of the value of the residential property. For second and subsequent buyers the maximum mortgage are 3.5 times the borrower&rsquo;s income and 80% of the value of the residential property. <\/p>  <p>  However, under the mortgage lending rules framework, banks and other mortgage lenders have a certain flexibility to provide a mortgage loan in excess of the specified LTV and LTI regulatory limits.\u00a0 For example, the rules allow lenders to provide up to 20 per cent of their mortgage lending to second and subsequent buyers in excess of the 80 per cent LTV threshold.\u00a0 In addition, borrowers who are currently in negative equity and want to move home by purchasing another property are exempt from the LTV limits.<\/p>  <p>  These, however, are discretionary exemptions and it is a commercial matter for each individual lender to decide, having regard to its own lending policies and loan underwriting criteria, whether or not it wishes to avail of those various discretions.\u00a0 Ultimately, subject to the requirement to comply with the provisions of the macro-prudential mortgage lending rules, the Central Bank Consumer Protection Code and other regulatory requirements, it is a matter for each lender to decide whether or not to provide a loan in any particular case, or how much mortgage credit to provide in any particular case. I as Minister for Finance, do not have a role in the commercial decision making processes of credit institutions . This is a commercial matter for each individual credit institution having regard to the relevant legal and regulatory requirements which apply.<\/p>  <p>  The\u00a0lending rules were last reviewed in November 2019 with the Central Bank Commission concluding that the mortgage measures as calibrated at that\u00a0time continued to be effective and no change to the mortgage lending\u00a0regulations was made. It\u00a0is expected that the Central Bank&rsquo;s 2020 review of the macro prudential\u00a0mortgage lending measures will\u00a0be\u00a0concluded before the end of the year.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank&rsquo;s consumer protection framework also includes a number of measures to protect consumers who are taking out a mortgage and seeks to ensure that lenders are transparent and fair in all their dealings with borrowers and that borrowers are protected from the beginning to the end of the mortgage life cycle. The Consumer Protection Code 2012 requires regulated entities to carry out affordability and suitability assessment, prior to offering, recommending, arranging or providing a credit product to a personal consumer. Separately, the European Union (Consumer Mortgage Credit Agreements) Regulations 2016 require that creditors assess the creditworthiness of the consumer before concluding a credit agreement. <\/p>  <p>  However, subject to the requirement to comply with the relevant legal and regulatory requirements which govern the provision of residential mortgage credit to consumers, as indicated it is ultimately a commercial matter for an individual lender to decide whether to offer particular\u00a0products or whether to provide a new mortgage loan or decide on how much credit to provide in any particular case.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700073#WRL03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic Supports","counter":549,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700073#WRL03800"},{"type":"question","counter":550,"qnumday":252,"qnumall":"[36307\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700073#WRL03900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if the Covid restrictions support scheme will be adjusted to include business sectors (details supplied);

Certain other conditions will apply, including that the person has a tax clearance certificate.<\/p><p>Where businesses ordinarily operate from a business premises (generally a building) located in a region for which restrictions are in operation, they may qualify under the scheme provided they meet the eligibility criteria, including the requirement that customers are either prohibited, or significantly restricted, from accessing their business premises to purchase goods or services due to the specific terms of the Covid restrictions announced by Government. <\/p><p>Where a business does not ordinarily operate from a fixed business premises located in a region that is subject to restrictions, such as an outside caterer or an events company, that business will not meet the eligibility criteria.  A business that does ordinarily operate from a music or entertainment venue (for example, a company that operates a theatre) or a business in the tourism sector carrying on a trade consisting of, for example, the operation of a gallery or other cultural attraction, located in a region subject to restrictions, and who meets the eligibility criteria, will however be able to claim support under CRSS.<\/p><p>The scheme will not apply to a business in the events industry or in other sectors, which does not ordinarily operate from a fixed business premises located in a region subject to the restrictions, but rather supplies goods or services to a business that does qualify for support under CRSS because, under the Covid restrictions, that other business is required to temporarily close or significantly reduce its activity.  Each business must satisfy the eligibility criteria in their own right.<\/p><p>It is not sufficient that the business supplies goods or services to another business that qualifies for the support because, under the Covid restrictions, that other business is required to temporarily close, or significantly reduce, its activity. <\/p><p>I would also point out that the CRSS is an additional measure for businesses in a region subject to significant Covid-19 restrictions.<b><\/b>Companies and self-employed workers who do not qualify under this scheme may be entitled to support under various measures put in place by Government, including existing supports available under the and the and the range of measures announced as part of Budget 2021 to support particular sectors including Tourism and live entertainment. They may also be eligible to warehouse VAT and PAYE (Employer) debts and also excess payments received by employers under the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme, and the balance of Income Tax for 2019 and Preliminary Tax for 2020 for self-assessed taxpayers if applicable.<\/p><p>Deputies will be aware that the Finance Bill is at Committee Stage of the legislative process this week but I have no plans to extend the scheme in the ways suggested.<\/p><p>There are two steps required to make a claim under the CRSS. The qualifying person must first register for CRSS on Revenue Online Service&rsquo; (ROS) and then complete a claim in respect of a claim period or claim periods. Revenue has been accepting registrations for the scheme since 1 November, and claims will be accepted from today with payments made shortly thereafter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700073#WRL04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Reliefs","counter":561,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700073#WRL05000"},{"type":"question","counter":562,"qnumday":253,"qnumall":"[36536\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700073#WRL05100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the tax relief subsidy that parents can avail of if they use a registered childminder.","asker":"1449","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":563,"content":"<p>There is no income tax measure that parents can avail of\u00a0that\u00a0provides relief in respect of their use of registered childminding services.

The cost of the scheme in 2019, excluding motor tax, was &euro;72m.<\/p>  <p>  The Scheme is open to severely and permanently disabled persons as a driver or as a passenger and also to certain organisations. In order to qualify for relief an organisation must be entered in the register of charitable organisations under Part 3 of the Charities Act 2009, be engaged in the transport of disabled persons and whose purpose is to provide services to persons with disabilities.<\/p>  <p>  In order to qualify for relief the applicant must hold a Primary Medical Certificate (PMC) issued by the relevant Senior Area Medical Officer (SAMO) or a Board Medical Certificate (BMC) issued by the Disabled Driver Medical Board of Appeal. Certain other criteria apply in relation to the vehicle and its use, including that the vehicle must be specially constructed or adapted for use by the applicant.  <\/p>  <p>  The terms of the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994 set out the medical criteria, and that one or more of these criteria is required to be satisfied in order to obtain a PMC.<\/p>  <p>  A Supreme Court decision of 18 June found in favour of two appellants against the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal's refusal to grant them a PMC. The judgment found that the medical criteria set out in the Regulations did not align with the regulation making mandate given in the primary legislation to further define criteria for &lsquo;severely and permanently disabled&rsquo; persons.<\/p>  <p>  On foot of the legal advice received, it became clear that it was appropriate to revisit the six medical criteria set out in Regulation 3 of Statutory Instrument 353 of 1994 for these assessments. In such circumstances, PMC assessments were discontinued until a revised basis for such assessments could be established. The medical officers who are responsible for conducting PMC assessments need to have assurance that the decisions they make are based on clear criteria set out in legislation. While Regulation 3 of Statutory Instrument No. 353 of 1994 was not deemed to be invalid, nevertheless it was found to be inconsistent with the mandate provided in Section 92 of the Finance Act 1989.<\/p>  <p>  In order to allow for the PMC assessments to recommence I am bringing forward an amendment to the Finance Bill to provide for the existing medical criteria in primary legislation.

While I am very aware of the importance of this scheme to those who benefit from it, I am also aware of the disquiet expressed by members of this house and others in respect of the difficulties around access to the scheme. With this in mind I have asked my officials to undertake a comprehensive review of the scheme, to include a broader review of mobility supports for persons with disabilities, and on foot of that review to bring forward proposals for consideration.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700073#WRL05900","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Budget 2021","counter":571,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700073#WRL06100"},{"type":"question","counter":572,"qnumday":256,"qnumall":"[37129\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700073#WRL06200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the amount of additional ring-fenced funding to be provided to domestic violence services under budget 2021 in order that services can respond adequately to increased incidence of domestic violence through Covid-19 and beyond; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1599","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":573,"content":"<p>My Department is not responsible for setting funding for domestic violence services and therefore did not apportion funding under the 2021 Budget.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700073#WRL06300","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic Supports","counter":574,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700073#WRL06400"},{"type":"question","counter":575,"qnumday":257,"qnumall":"[36141\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700073#WRL06500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of firms that availed of the temporary wage subsidy scheme that the authorities are currently investigating to ensure they fulfil the criteria for access to the scheme; the number of firms that have availed of the scheme that have submitted audited accounts to the Revenue Commissioners; and the number of firms that have availed of the scheme and that are also in receipt of other State aid, including the Covid restrictions support scheme, rates waiver and sector specific supports.","asker":"1486","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":576,"content":"<p>The Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS), which operated from 26 March 2020 to 31 August 2020, provided over &euro;2.9 billion of financial support to more than 66,500 qualifying employers on behalf of approximately eligible 664,000 employees. <\/p>  <p>  As provided for in the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid 19) Act, Revenue is responsible for the administration of the TWSS and in exercise of this responsibility, has since June 2020, engaged in a phased programme of compliance checks on all participating employers. Revenue has advised me that over 70% of these checks are fully completed at this time, and have, for the most part, confirmed high levels of compliance by employers with the conditions of the scheme.<\/p>  <p>  As part of the compliance checks, Revenue requested employers to confirm eligibility for the TWSS by reference to the decline in their turnover in Quarter 2 of 2020 due to COVID-19 related restrictions, and to provide sample payslips confirming payment of the subsidy to their eligible employees. This level of detail should have been readily available to employers as they formed part of the core eligibility criteria for the TWSS. Revenue has confirmed that it did not request employers to submit audited accounts as part of the compliance checks as this was not an eligibility requirement for the scheme. Revenue has also advised me that approximately 1,000 employers were subjected to a more detailed review following the initial compliance checks. Of these, almost 500 are completed at this point with enquiries continuing in respect of the remainder. <\/p>  <p>  Regarding the Deputy&rsquo;s question on TWSS recipient employers availing of &lsquo;other COVID-19 State aided schemes&rsquo;, Revenue has confirmed that, at end September 2020 (the latest date for which the analysis has been completed), approximately 20,000 (30%) of the total number of former TWSS recipient employers were in receipt of the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS), which replaced the TWSS from 1 September 2020.

As indicated, lenders continue to process mortgage applications and have supports in place to assist customers impacted by COVID-19. Therefore, if mortgage applicants have any queries or concerns about the impact of COVID-19 on their mortgage application, they should in the first instance contact their lender directly on the matter.<\/p>  <p>  However, within the parameters of the regulatory framework, set out as follows, the decision to grant or refuse an individual application for mortgage credit is a commercial decision to be made by the regulated entity. Also a formal loan offer may contain a condition that would allow the lender to\u00a0withdraw or vary the offer if in the lender&rsquo;s opinion there is any material change in circumstances prior to drawdown. In such cases, the decision to withdraw or vary the offer is also a commercial and contractual decision for the lender.<\/p>  <p>  The European Union (Consumer Mortgage Credit Agreements) Regulations 2016 (CMCAR) provide that, before concluding a mortgage credit agreement, a lender must make a thorough assessment of the consumer&rsquo;s creditworthiness with a view to verifying the prospect of the consumer being able to meet his or her obligations under the credit agreement.\u00a0 The CMCAR further provide that a lender should only make credit available to a consumer where the result of the creditworthiness assessment indicates that the consumer&rsquo;s obligations resulting from the credit agreement are likely to be met in the manner required under that agreement.\u00a0 The assessment of creditworthiness must be carried out on the basis of information on the consumer&rsquo;s income and expenses and other financial and economic circumstances which is necessary, sufficient and proportionate. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code 2012 imposes &lsquo;Knowing the Consumer and Suitability&rsquo; requirements on lenders.\u00a0 Under these requirements, lenders are required to assess affordability of credit and the suitability of a product or service based on the individual circumstances of each borrower. The Code specifies that the affordability assessment must include consideration of the information gathered on the borrower&rsquo;s personal circumstances and financial situation.<\/p>  <p>  Where a lender refuses a mortgage application, the CMCAR requires that the lender must inform the consumer without delay of the refusal. In addition, the Code requires that the lender must clearly outline to the consumer the reasons why the credit was not approved, and provide these reasons on paper if requested.<\/p>  <p>  If a mortgage applicant is not satisfied with how a regulated firm is dealing with them, or they believe that the regulated firm is not following the requirements of the Central Bank&rsquo;s codes and regulations or other financial services law, they should make a complaint directly to the regulated firm. If the mortgage applicant\u00a0is still not satisfied with the response from the regulated firm, he or she\u00a0can refer the complaint to the statutory Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700073#WRL06900","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":580,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 259 and 260 answered with Question No. 252.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Reliefs","counter":582,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700074#WRM00300"},{"type":"question","counter":583,"qnumday":261,"qnumall":"[36209\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700074#WRM00400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the amount of relief a person will receive from the new e-working tax relief; the level of expenditure on heating, electricity, broadband and other vouched expenses required to qualify for &euro;3.20 a day that could be paid by the employer; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

As indicated, lenders continue to process mortgage applications and have supports in place to assist customers impacted by COVID-19. Therefore, if mortgage applicants have any queries or concerns about the impact of COVID-19 on their mortgage application, they should in the first instance contact their lender directly on the matter.<\/p>  <p>  However, within the parameters of the regulatory framework, as set out below, the decision to grant or refuse an individual application for mortgage credit is a commercial decision to be made by the regulated entity. Also a formal loan offer may contain a condition that would allow the lender to\u00a0withdraw or vary the offer if in the lender&rsquo;s opinion there is any material change in circumstances prior to drawdown. In such cases, the decision to withdraw or vary the offer is also a commercial and contractual decision for the lender.<\/p>  <p>  The European Union (Consumer Mortgage Credit Agreements) Regulations 2016 (CMCAR) provide that, before concluding a mortgage credit agreement, a lender must make a thorough assessment of the consumer&rsquo;s creditworthiness with a view to verifying the prospect of the consumer being able to meet his or her obligations under the credit agreement.\u00a0 The CMCAR further provide that a lender should only make credit available to a consumer where the result of the creditworthiness assessment indicates that the consumer&rsquo;s obligations resulting from the credit agreement are likely to be met in the manner required under that agreement.\u00a0 The assessment of creditworthiness must be carried out on the basis of information on the consumer&rsquo;s income and expenses and other financial and economic circumstances which is necessary, sufficient and proportionate. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code 2012 imposes &lsquo;Knowing the Consumer and Suitability&rsquo; requirements on lenders.\u00a0 Under these requirements, lenders are required to assess affordability of credit and the suitability of a product or service based on the individual circumstances of each borrower. The Code specifies that the affordability assessment must include consideration of the information gathered on the borrower&rsquo;s personal circumstances and financial situation.<\/p>  <p>  Where a lender refuses a mortgage application, the CMCAR requires that the lender must inform the consumer without delay of the refusal. In addition, the Code requires that the lender must clearly outline to the consumer the reasons why the credit was not approved, and provide these reasons on paper if requested.<\/p>  <p>  If a mortgage applicant is not satisfied with how a regulated firm is dealing with them, or they believe that the regulated firm is not following the requirements of the Central Bank&rsquo;s codes and regulations or other financial services law, they should make a complaint directly to the regulated firm. If the mortgage applicant\u00a0is still not satisfied with the response from the regulated firm, he or she\u00a0can refer the complaint to the statutory Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700074#WRM02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":602,"qnumday":270,"qnumall":"[36733\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700074#WRM02300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he or the regulator have plans to develop a public information campaign to highlight the potential savings available through mortgage switching as outlined in a recent Central Bank report; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1599","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":603,"content":"<p>The Department of Finance, as part of its remit to ensure that consumers\u00a0are protected\u00a0within the financial sector in Ireland, facilitates the Switch Your Bank public awareness campaign.

AIB and Permanent TSB provide the\u00a0funding for the campaign as part of a range of competition measures agreed with the European Commission under their respective EU restructuring plans.

My Department is currently undertaking a tender competition, using the services of the Office of Government Procurement, to engage a firm to complete this research.\u00a0<\/p><p>The Central Bank has advised me that while financial education is within the remit of the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC), the Central Bank is committed to raising awareness of the savings that consumers can make by switching their mortgage, as is evidenced by the recent publication of\u00a0 the Economic Letter entitled . \u00a0<\/p><p>The Letter estimates the potential for savings available to mortgage holders and highlights some of the potential barriers to mortgage switching in Ireland. The research undertaken by the Central Bank demonstrates that a large number of mortgage holders could see significant reductions in repayment costs by switching.

The new and enhanced requirements took effect on 1 January 2019. The changes made to the Code are as follows:<\/p><p>- For consumers with fixed rate mortgages, regulated entities are required to inform their consumers\u00a0at least 60 days in advance that they are about to come off their fixed rate and provide details of the new rate applicable from the expiry date.\u00a0The regulated entity should provide information on other possible options\u00a0that may be available to the consumer.<\/p><p>- For consumers on variable\u00a0rate mortgages (other than on a tracker rate), regulated entities are required to notify consumers every year as to whether they can, or cannot,\u00a0move to a cheaper interest rate as a result of a move in their Loan to\u00a0Value interest rate band, subject to the provision of an up-to-date\u00a0valuation and any other requirements that may apply.<\/p><p>-In relation to potential\u00a0switching savings, regulated entities must provide, on request, an indicative comparison of the total interest payable on the consumer&rsquo;s\u00a0existing mortgage and the interest payable on the new mortgage or\u00a0alternative interest rate on offer by that regulated entity. Where the\u00a0regulated entity provides this information, it must also provide a link to the relevant section of the CCPC&rsquo;s website to allow consumers to compare\u00a0potential mortgage switching savings available from other lenders.<\/p><p>- The changes impose a\u00a0time-bound mortgage application process on regulated entities, including\u00a0 requirements to acknowledge receipt of a completed mortgage application\u00a0 within three business days and make a decision within 10 business days\u00a0following receipt of all required information for assessment of a mortgage\u00a0application.<\/p><p>- In relation to incentives,\u00a0the existing provision 6.12 in the Code has been extended to apply the\u00a0same protections to all mortgage holders i.e. for new, existing and\u00a0switching mortgage holders. This is to ensure that consumers have\u00a0sufficient clarity about the precise nature and scale of the benefit of an incentive to them, including the potential impact of an associated incentive on the cost of their mortgage.\u00a0<\/p><p>The Central Bank has also introduced a number of increased protections for variable rate mortgage holders. The enhanced measures, which are provided for in an Addendum to the Consumer Protection Code 2012, and became effective in February 2017, require lenders to explain to borrowers how their variable interest rates have been set, including in the event of an increase. The measures also improve the level of information required to be provided to borrowers on variable rates about other mortgage products their lender provides which could provide savings for the borrower and signpost the borrower to the CCPC&rsquo;s mortgage switching tool.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700074#WRM02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":604,"content":"<p>Question No. 271 answered with Question No. 252.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic Supports","counter":605,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700074#WRM02600"},{"type":"question","counter":606,"qnumday":272,"qnumall":"[36761\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700074#WRM02700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his plans for changes to the stay and spend scheme given the level 5 restrictions; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

These arrangements are therefore of long-standing. <\/p><p>Choices which are now available to individuals in relation to their pension savings (after taking the tax-free retirement lump sum) include the option to purchase an annuity, if they so wish, to receive the balance of the pension funds in cash (subject to marginal rate tax, as appropriate), to invest in an approved retirement fund (ARF) or an approved minimum retirement fund (AMRF), subject to certain conditions.<\/p><p>Under the regime, the options to invest in an ARF or receive the balance of the pension fund in cash are subject to conditions. The conditions include the requirements that the individual be over 75 years of age or, if younger, that the individual has a guaranteed minimum level of pension income (&ldquo;specified income&rdquo;) actually in payment for life at the time the option to effect the ARF or cash option is exercised. The purpose of the specified income requirement is to ensure, before an individual has unrestricted access to their remaining retirement funds via an ARF or by way of the cash option, that they have the security of an adequate guaranteed pension income throughout the period of their retirement. The specified income requirement is &euro;12,700 per annum and this income requirement can be satisfied, in part at least, by the amount of the State pension in payment to an individual in his or her own right (for example, excluding any payment being received on behalf of a dependent). <\/p><p>Where the minimum specified income test is not met, and an individual does not wish to purchase an annuity, then an AMRF must be chosen into which a &ldquo;set aside&rdquo; amount must be invested. The maximum amount of the &ldquo;set aside&rdquo; is &euro;63,500 or the remaining pension fund amount, if lower, after taking the permissible tax-free retirement lump sum. The funds in an AMRF can be used at any point, in full or in part, to purchase an annuity, including an annuity sufficient to meet the minimum specified income requirement. <\/p><p>The purpose of the AMRF is to ensure that an individual without the minimum guaranteed pension income for life has a pension &lsquo;safety-net&rsquo; to provide for the latter years of his\/her retirement. Up to Finance Act 2014, the capital invested in an AMRF could not be accessed until the AMRF owner reached age 75 (or meets the guaranteed pension income requirement before then) at which point the AMRF becomes an ARF with unrestricted access to the funds, subject to taxation. While the capital sum in an AMRF could not be accessed, as set out, any income, profits or gains accrued from the investment of the capital could, until recently, be withdrawn by the AMRF owner, subject to tax at the marginal rate.\u00a0 <\/p><p>My predecessor changed the arrangements for AMRFs so as to allow AMRF-owners voluntary, tax-liable access to a maximum of 4% of their AMRF assets each year until it becomes an ARF. This change provides AMRF owners with access to a definitive and certain level of income from their AMRF rather than the uncertain level of income which access to the accrued income, profits and gains in the AMRF provided.<\/p><p>Under the previous access arrangements for AMRFs, the extent of any income, profit or gains would depend on the performance of the investment options taken and could, therefore, be highly volatile with the possibility of little or no gains accruing in certain years. In addition, the scale of the capital allowed for in an AMRF, at a maximum of &euro;63,500, would not always permit for investment returns of any significant scale to be made using a prudent investment policy.\u00a0 <\/p><p>The change allowing access to a specified percentage of the capital in an AMRF is primarily aimed at those individuals whose AMRF constitutes a significant part of their retirement funds and who, while not wishing to purchase a pension annuity with those funds, may require access to a portion of these funds to provide a more certain form of supplementary pension income prior to reaching age 75.

This reflects the positive work done by the CIWG, and it is the Government&rsquo;s intention to build on this success.<\/p>  <p>  In conclusion, seeking to secure a more sustainable and competitive market through deepening and widening the supply of insurance in Ireland remains\u00a0a key priority issue for this Government. \u00a0Minister of State Fleming and my Department will continue to play a lead role in this policy area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700075#WRN02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Motor Insurance","counter":654,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700075#WRN03000"},{"type":"question","counter":655,"qnumday":292,"qnumall":"[36699\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700075#WRN03100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the status of the implementation of the recommendations made in the report of the working group on reducing the cost of motor insurance; the number of recommendations that have not been implemented to date; the reason for same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1455","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":656,"content":"<p>At the outset, I want to emphasise the key importance that Government places on the insurance reform agenda. This is reflected in the Programme for Government which identifies a range of issues that need to be tackled on a Whole-of-Government basis, including inter alia: continued reform of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board (PIAB); review of duty of care; the need to reduce award levels for general damages; and tackling fraud. I also look forward to the Judicial Council&rsquo;s Personal Injuries Guidelines being adopted and implemented by mid-2021. <\/p>  <p>  This ambitious reform agenda is being led by the Cabinet Committee on Economic Recovery and Investment&rsquo;s sub-Group on Insurance Reform.\u00a0 It is chaired by the T&aacute;naiste, and includes Minister Donohoe, Minister McGrath, Minister McEntee, Minister O&rsquo;Gorman, Minister of State Troy and myself as standing members.\u00a0\u00a0 I strongly believe this cross-departmental approach provides the best opportunity to address the cost and availability of insurance and will build and expand upon previous commendable work done by the Cost of Insurance Working Group, which was established in July 2016 and produced two primary reports, the first on the cost of motor insurance and the second on the cost of employer and public liability insurance.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  My Department published the CIWG&rsquo;s Eleventh and Final Progress Update Report on 30 October.\u00a0 This showed that the vast majority of recommendations had been completed.\u00a0 It was also noted that taking account of the new Whole-of-Government approach, that the outstanding CIWG recommendations will now be implemented through the Cabinet Committees Sub-Group on Insurance Reform.\u00a0 In that context, the four outstanding recommendations from the CIWG&rsquo;s Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance, including the reason for their delay, are as follows:<\/p>  <p>  - Recommendation 16 &ndash; Ascertain and set out the measures necessary to implement Pre-Action Protocols (PAPs) for personal injury cases:\u00a0 The Department of Justice has advised that draft regulations on PAPs for medical negligence actions remain under discussion with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel (OPC). \u00a0It has advised that they intend to move this work forward as a matter of urgency. \u00a0The finalisation of these Regulations will then inform the work on the PAPs for personal injuries actions.<\/p>  <p>  - Recommendation 22 &ndash; Examine the impact of legal and other fees on personal injury awards: \u00a0The implementation of this recommendation was contingent on the establishment of the Office of the Legal Costs Adjudicators (OLCA), as provided for under the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015. The OLCA came into operation with effect from 7 October 2019. \u00a0The Department of Justice has outlined that a period of at least one to two years from the time this new body became operational will be required before they will have an appropriate data baseline to commence a meaningful review.<\/p>  <p>  -Recommendation 24 &ndash; Examine the setting of the discount rate (in personal injury lump sum awards), without prejudice to the outcome of relevant proceedings, and to be reviewed at regular intervals:\u00a0 The Department of Justice recently ran a public consultation and will provide a report once its review of the discount rate has concluded in the context of the new reform agenda.<\/p>  <p>  - Recommendation 25 &ndash; Establish a fully functioning integrated insurance fraud database for industry to detect patterns of fraud:\u00a0 This recommendation has been delayed as a result of a number of data protection issues.\u00a0 These are currently being examined by the Department of Justice and other stakeholders.<\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding these outstanding recommendations, the Deputy will be aware that many positive reforms have been introduced to address the cost and availability of insurance through the CIWG.\u00a0 These include legislation to: strengthen the role of PIAB; to clarify and widen the role of the Insurance Compensation Fund; to provide access to information regarding claims; to provide more information to consumers at renewal; and to make it easier for businesses to challenge fraudulent claims.\u00a0 The cumulative impact of these changes has undoubtedly been a factor in helping to reduce motor premiums over the last number of years. The most recent CSO data indicates that the cost of motor insurance is now almost a third lower than it was at its peak in July 2016.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  In conclusion, the CIWG&rsquo;s remaining recommendations will be part of the Cabinet Sub-group&rsquo;s work.\u00a0 The Deputy can rest assured that seeking to secure sustainable competition through deepening and widening the supply of insurance in Ireland is a key priority issue for the new Government and that Minister of State Fleming and I will play a lead role to ensure that progress is made in this policy area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700075#WRN03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","counter":658,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700075#WRN03400"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Contracts","counter":657,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700075#WRN03300"},{"type":"question","counter":658,"qnumday":293,"qnumall":"[35865\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700075#WRN03400","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if his Department has lease arrangements with co-working real estate companies; and if so, the details of the leases, including the terms of the lease, location, price and duration.","asker":"1489","askee":"1459"},{"type":"speech","counter":659,"content":"<p>`The Commissioners of Public Works (OPW) have not entered into lease arrangements with co-working real estate companies.\u00a0 A number of licences have been agreed with companies in respect of serviced offices to meet urgent, specialised, generally short term requirements which cannot be met from within the existing portfolio or through traditional lease arrangements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700075#WRN03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1494"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"EU Funding","counter":660,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700075#WRN03600"},{"type":"question","counter":661,"qnumday":294,"qnumall":"[36298\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700075#WRN03700","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the various EU funds available for cross-Border purposes; and the way in which they are and will be structured and managed pre Brexit and post Brexit.","asker":"1473","askee":"1459"},{"type":"speech","counter":662,"content":"<p>Cross-border EU funding on the island of Ireland is currently provided via two 2014-20 cooperation programmes, PEACE IV and INTERREG VA.\u00a0 These two programmes cover an eligible area of Northern Ireland, the border counties of Ireland (Counties Cavan, Donegal, Leitrim, Louth, Monaghan and Sligo) and, (in the case of INTERREG VA only), western Scotland.\u00a0 The PEACE IV programme has total funding of &euro;270 million, and supports the fostering of peace and reconciliation. \u00a0INTERREG VA has total funding of &euro;283 million, and supports economic and social cohesion.\u00a0 Funding on both programmes is now fully committed to 130 projects across the eligible region. <\/p>  <p>  \u00a0The\u00a0PEACE IV\u00a0and INTERREG VA\u00a0programmes are managed by the Special EU Programmes Body (SEUPB), a North South Implementation Body which is jointly sponsored by my Department and the Department of Finance in Northern Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  The January 2020 Withdrawal Agreement between the EU and the UK provides for the full completion of the PEACE IV and INTERREG VA programmes following Brexit.\u00a0 The current implementation structures for both programmes will\u00a0be maintained\u00a0post-Brexit, with SEUPB continuing to manage the programmes.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to these ongoing programmes, the European Commission, in its May 2018 proposals for the Multi-Annual Financial Framework (MFF) and Cohesion Policy for the 2021-27, proposed a special new PEACE PLUS programme.

There are important measures in place at all times to ensure that our budgetary targets are being met. These measures continue to be in place for all public expenditure, including core expenditure as well as additional expenditure allocated as part of the response to Covid-19. As is usual, my Department is in regular contact with all other Departments and offices to ensure that all expenditure is being managed within the overall fiscal parameters. There is regular reporting to Government on expenditure levels. <\/p>  <p>  In terms of other EU jurisdictions, in the five years prior to the Covid-19 pandemic, Irish General Government expenditure as a proportion of GNI* had moved to be broadly in line with the EU average figures for General Government expenditure as a percentage of GDP. In terms of capital expenditure, the overall public capital allocation set out in the 2020 Revised Estimates Volume was &euro;8.2 billion. At this level, core gross voted capital investment in 2020 was projected to reach c. 4 percent of national income (GNI*) compared to an EU average in recent years of 2.9 percent (GDP). While these indicators have been impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic, they give an indication of Ireland&rsquo;s position relative to other EU countries in terms of core expenditure. <\/p>  <p>  As set out in the most recent Fiscal Monitor, published by the Department of Finance, total gross voted expenditure at end-October 2020 was &euro;65,547 million. This is &euro;8,604 million, or 15.1% ahead of profile. It should be noted however, that expenditure profiles for the year were published in February and are based on the expenditure allocations set out in the 2020 Revised Estimates Volume. This means that the impact of additional resources allocated in respect of Covid-19 are not reflected in these profiles. As such, spending can be expected to run significantly ahead of profile for the remainder of the year. Gross voted current expenditure of &euro;60,000 million, is &euro;8,662 million, or 16.9% above profile. Gross voted capital expenditure of &euro;5,547 million, is &euro;58 million, or 1% below profile and up &euro;886 million, or 19% on October 2019. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The vast majority of identified overruns in 2020 to date relate to expenditure allocated in response to Covid-19. Current expenditure in the Department of Health is ahead of profile by &euro;1.36 billion at end October 2020. This is due to the drawdown of funds to the HSE, to support maximising capacity within the system and to allow for the purchase of necessary equipment such as PPE. The Department of Social Protection is ahead of profile by almost &euro;6.9 billion at this point in the year. This is due to payments introduced in respect of Covid-19 to support employees and businesses. There is a Covid-19 related impact on the Department of Transport, for which current expenditure is &euro;307 million ahead of profile at end October. This is due to the drop in passenger numbers and associated revenue as a result of public health measures. <\/p>  <p>  Gross voted current expenditure in Education is ahead of profile by &euro;83 million. This relates to higher than anticipated drawdown in relation to teacher salaries and pensions, as well as payment of &euro;66 million in Covid-19 grants to primary and post-primary schools in August. In terms of core current spending, expenditure on Asylum Seekers Accommodation is over profile by approximately &euro;74 million at end-October due to underlying financial pressures, linked to the numbers to be accommodated.\u00a0 Expenditure has also been impacted by the Covid-19 emergency, with additional measures being implemented including the provision of self-isolation facilities.<\/p>  <p>  Looking at capital expenditure, the impact of Covid-19 can also be seen. Of the 16 vote groups which have capital allocations, 12 are below profile for capital expenditure at this point in the year. Capital expenditure in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is ahead of profile for end-October by &euro;587 million. This relates to the additional funding which was allocated in light of the impact of Covid-19 on businesses. The Department of Education is ahead of profile on capital expenditure by &euro;91 million. The main driver of this is the issuing of additional minor works grants in light of Covid-19, as well as bringing these grants forward to July and August for primary and post-primary schools. &euro;10 million\u00a0has also been provided for Student Devices.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has allocated significant additional resources to Departments in response to Covid-19. Expenditure Report 2021 set out total gross voted expenditure of &euro;87.1 billion for 2020, with additional expenditure of\u00a0&euro;16.7 billion primarily driven by Covid-19. These allocations are being made in the usual way, with Estimates agreed by Government and voted on by the D&aacute;il. A number of Revised Estimates and Further Revised Estimates have been approved by the D&aacute;il in recent weeks and months to give effect to these increased allocations for 2020. A number of Supplementary Estimates have also been presented to the D&aacute;il in the last number of weeks and work is currently ongoing to agree the last number of Supplementary Estimates for 2020.\u00a0 <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700076#WRO03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1459"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":708,"content":"<p>Question No. 309 answered with Question No. 303.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":709,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 310 and 311 answered with Question No. 308.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Strategies","counter":710,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700076#WRO03700"},{"type":"question","counter":711,"qnumday":312,"qnumall":"[37072\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700076#WRO03800","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the extent of reforms he has in mind to streamline the cost-effectiveness and efficiency of all Departments and bodies under their aegis; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1459"},{"type":"speech","counter":712,"content":"<p>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that significant innovation and reforms in the\u00a0Public Service\u00a0have been\u00a0brought about since the establishment of this Department.

COVID-19 spreads when individuals and groups come into close contact with one another, enabling the virus to move from one person to another. The risk of infection spread is greater in certain environments than others e.g. uncontrolled environments, crowded and noisy places, indoor environments, poorly ventilated spaces.<\/p>  <p>  Given the current epidemiological situation with high incidence of disease, widespread community transmission, and high numbers of both hospitalisations and deaths, it has been necessary to put in place very significant restrictions to arrest the current trajectory of the disease and break transmission chains. This means asking people to stay at home and eliminating as much activity and contacts as is possible to ensure that opportunities for the virus to transmit are minimised, while allowing essential activities to continue. Unfortunately, this means minimising discretionary activities including indoor sports training and exercise.<\/p>  <p>  Currently, in Level 5 sporting competition is not permitted except for defined exempted athletes and teams, as set out in the public health regulations. In addition to this, non-contact outdoor sports training, including athletics,\u00a0is permitted for school aged children in pods of up to 15.

Gyms were also allowed to provide for individual training only under the No. 7 Regulations, they were not allowed to run exercise or dance classes.<\/p>  <p>  At present the Government has made no decision regarding which level or particular restrictions will apply after 1 December as that will depend on the epidemiological situation at the time.\u00a0 The impact of any and all restrictions for every sector, including dance, will be considered carefully as the Government seeks to balance the public health risk posed by COVID with economic, social and wellbeing considerations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700078#WRQ02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1471"},{"type":"question","counter":816,"qnumday":350,"qnumall":"[37118\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700078#WRQ03000","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the reason for the closure of outdoor sporting facilities for athletics available for all but exempted activities; her views on whether it is fair that such outdoor sporting facilities remain closed while other local sporting facilities operated by other similar organisations (details supplied) remain open; her views on whether the same rules should be applied for all similar and comparable facilities; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1599","askee":"1471"},{"type":"speech","counter":817,"content":"<p>Given the current epidemiological situation with high incidence of disease, widespread community transmission, and considerable numbers of hospitalisations and deaths, it has been necessary to put in place very significant restrictions to arrest the current trajectory of the disease and break transmission chains.

Unfortunately, this means minimising discretionary activities including sporting activity.<\/p>  <p>  Currently, in Level 5 sporting competition is not permitted except for defined exempted athletes and teams, as set out in the public health regulations. In addition to this, non-contact outdoor sports training, including athletics,\u00a0is permitted for school aged children in pods of up to 15.

The 2011 Regulations do not provide local authorities with any discretion to exceed the limits that apply to their administrative areas.<\/p>  <p>  Under the Household Means Policy, which applies in all local authorities, net income for social housing assessment is defined as gross household income less income tax, PRSI, Universal Social Charge and Pension-Related Deductions within the meaning of Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009. The Policy provides for a range of income disregards, and local authorities also have discretion to decide to disregard income that is temporary, short-term or once-off in nature.<\/p>  <p>  The income bands are expressed in terms of a maximum net income threshold for a single-person household, with an allowance of 5% for each additional adult household member, subject to a maximum allowance under this category of 10%; and 2.5% for each child, subject to a maximum allowance under this category of 10%.<\/p>  <p>  The income bands and the authority area assigned to each band were based on an assessment of the income needed to provide for a household's basic needs, plus a comparative analysis of the local rental cost of housing accommodation across the country.

From this sum, &euro;110 million was ring-fenced for a new national Affordable Purchase Shared Equity Scheme and a new<b><\/b>Cost Rental Equity Loan facility<b><\/b>to help deliver Cost Rental homes. Both of these programmes will begin in 2021.\u00a0<\/p><p>&euro;75 million will be allocated to the affordable purchase shared equity scheme. I intend to target the scheme at first time buyers, who are seeking to buy a new home but who cannot quite secure the full mortgage amount to do so at the present time. Subject to the final qualifying criteria, the scheme would see the State take a limited equity stake in a property, in order to help more people meet the cost of buying a new home with their available mortgage.\u00a0<\/p><p>To this end, significant preparatory work has already been carried out by my Department working primarily with the Housing Agency and the Department of Finance. Intensive engagement continues with key stakeholders informing the final detailed parameters of the scheme, as well as with home builders to seek to increase the output of new homes in response to the new scheme.\u00a0<\/p><p>In addition, &euro;35m has been allocated to the\u00a0new Cost Rental Equity Loan (CREL) facility\u00a0to support Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) to deliver approximately 350 Cost Rental homes at scale from next year.\u00a0 Added to the 50 Cost Rental homes that will be delivered in Enniskerry Road, Stepaside in Q3 2021, it will accelerate delivery in this new sector in advance of the Land Development Agency's planned future output and the work of local authorities. This scheme will leverage the proven expertise and capacity of the AHBs, demonstrated in their development and management of social housing units.\u00a0<\/p><p>The CREL scheme will see financing made available to AHBs on favourable terms to cover 30% of\u00a0the costs for Cost Rental homes. CREL funding will be provided on similar terms\u00a0to\u00a0the existing Capital Advance Leasing Facility (CALF) model which is extensively used by AHBs for social housing. In terms of the\u00a0remaining 70% of capital costs,\u00a0subject to appropriate conditions, it is anticipated that long term competitive financing will be made available to the AHBs by the Housing Finance Agency. This will allow cost-covering rents to be set at a lower level and so making them more affordable for tenants. Further details on the scheme will be announced in due course.\u00a0<\/p><p>I intend to bring forward any necessary provisions to underpin these schemes in a forthcoming Affordable Housing Bill which will be brought to Government in the coming weeks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700080#WRS02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Land Development Agency","counter":926,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700080#WRS02700"},{"type":"question","counter":927,"qnumday":387,"qnumall":"[36804\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700080#WRS02800","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the estimated cost of establishing a land development agency in Cork city; the number of staff to be assigned; the specific roles and grades of staff; and the timeline on the delivery of projects; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

This includes engaging with homeless families and individuals on issues arising in their accommodation.<\/p>  <p>  In this regard, I understand that since January 2020, the DRHE has carried out 126 unannounced night inspections of privately operated emergency accommodation facilities.\u00a0\u00a0This monitoring work is ongoing to ensure the health and safety of the clients\u00a0who are using the facilities.<\/p>  <p>  Guidelines for Service Users in Emergency Accommodation were recently reviewed by the DRHE and issued to clients in private emergency accommodation. The DRHE has assured me that it has a thorough complaints procedure in place, and that each complaint is fully investigated and\u00a0addressed in a timely manner.<\/p>  <p>  Separate to the service standards expected of providers via service level agreements, all homeless service providers must meet the requirements of statutory codes, in particular the requirements of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 and the Fire Services Acts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700081#WRT02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":983,"content":"<p>Question No. 407 answered with Question No. 363.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":984,"content":"<p>Question No. 408 answered with Question No. 405.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","counter":986,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700081#WRT02700"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Maritime Jurisdiction","counter":985,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700081#WRT02600"},{"type":"question","counter":986,"qnumday":409,"qnumall":"[36740\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700081#WRT02700","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he will bring the 2013 agreement between Ireland and the UK establishing a single maritime boundary between the exclusive economic zones of the two countries and parts of their continental shelves, before the Houses of the Oireachtas at the earliest opportunity for debate and ratification or rejection by D&aacute;il and Seanad Eireann following the Supreme Court judgment of 27 October 2016 (details supplied).","asker":"1463","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":987,"content":"<p>The judgment referred to by the Deputy concerned fishing in the 0-6 nautical mile zone of the State&rsquo;s 12-mile territorial sea, while the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) is the body of water that stretches from 12 miles out to a distance of 200 miles.<\/p>  <p>  Under the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea a coastal State has exclusive rights within its EEZ over fishing (although all EU Member States have transferred their competence for conservation and management of sea fisheries to the EU), the production of energy from water and wind, the protection of the marine environment and the conduct of marine scientific research.\u00a0 A coastal State also enjoys exclusive sovereign rights to the recovery of oil and gas from the seabed beneath the EEZ, although this is governed by the separate legal regime of the continental shelf.<\/p>  <p>  The 2013 Agreement established the agreed 1988 continental shelf boundaries as the boundaries for both the continental shelf and the EEZ above, with some small technical adjustments of the former which were necessary to take account of the 200 nautical mile EEZ limit.<\/p>  <p>  The Agreement was signed on 28 March 2013.\u00a0 It was ratified on 31 March 2014 and entered into force on the same day.

In addition,\u00a0an\u00a0order for 28 Armoured Utility Vehicles\u00a0AUVs\u00a0was recently\u00a0placed with Centigon, a French company,\u00a0and these will provide a level of\u00a0\u00a0protected mobility between the levels of soft-skinned light transport and heavier armoured vehicles.<\/p>  <p>  There is also continuous investment in the non-armoured vehicle fleet. In 2019 a contract was signed with Toyota Ireland for the replacement of the Army's fleet of 3\/4 tonne 4 X4 vehicles, the first of which entered service in early 2020. In March of this year a tender process was completed for the supply of one hundred and twenty (120) new 4 X 4 Troop Carrying Vehicles, with the award of a contract to Westward Scania, based in Strokestown, Co. Roscommon. The first vehicles are scheduled for delivery in\u00a02020 with delivery of all 120 vehicles concluding by 2023. Funding is provided on an on-going basis for the required maintenance of vehicles in the military transport fleet, both at home and overseas.<\/p>  <p>  A step change in military air-based capability is being achieved through the acquisition of Pilatus PC-12 aircraft.\u00a0 While nominally a replacement for the Cessna, the new aircraft move capabilities considerably ahead of the present level.\u00a0 The original order of three aircraft which were delivered in September 2020\u00a0was augmented on an urgent basis by an additional aircraft delivered in April 2020 to enhance fixed wing capacity to meet demands arising from Covid-19.\u00a0 The PC-12 has proven itself an effective and versatile asset.<\/p>  <p>  The White Paper also provides for the replacement of the CASA 235s with consideration to be given to their replacement with larger more capable aircraft which would enhance maritime surveillance and provide a greater degree of utility for transport and cargo carrying tasks. A contract for the supply of two C295 Maritime Patrol Aircraft was entered into with Airbus Defence and Space in December 2019, with delivery of the aircraft expected in 2023.<\/p>  <p>  The White Paper\u00a0on Defence also sets out an ambitious programme of capital investment in the Naval Service\u00a0\u00a0including the\u00a0mid-life refit and upgrade of the P50 class vessels, L&Eacute; R&oacute;is&iacute;n and L&Eacute; Niamh, as well as, in due course, the replacement of L&Eacute; Eithne.\u00a0\u00a0The P50 mid-life upgrade programme is well underway.\u00a0 The replacement of the\u00a0flagship L&Eacute; Eithne with a\u00a0multi role vessel (MRV) is the next scheduled component of the White Paper fleet investment programme.\u00a0 Projects for other vessel replacement will be considered over the life-time of the White Paper in the context of overall capability development and funding and the Equipment Development Plan (EDP) process.\u00a0 The EDP outlines that the MRV project is in the planning ongoing stage\u00a0with an indicative timeframe for progression from the current year through to 2024.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to Defence Forces communications systems, there is continued investment in the development of suitable network enabled communications in order to meet the challenges of an increasingly complex operational environment. In July of this year a tender competition was commenced  for the supply of Software Defined Radios to the Defence Forces and the\u00a0competition is currently underway. The scope of the project consists of two main requirements; Personal Soldier Radios and Multi-Band Handheld, Manpack, Vehicular and Airborne radios. Given the complexity of the requirements the procurement process is expected to be comprehensive in nature with the first radios not expected to enter service before 2023. <\/p>  <p>  The examples given, whilst not exhaustive, demonstrate my commitment to update and upgrade the Defence Forces equipment and capability, within the financial envelope available. In accordance with the National Development Plan, the capital allocation for Defence was increased to &euro;113 million for 2020, an increase of &euro;7 million. The National Development Plan provides for a total of &euro;541 million for Defence over the period 2018-2022.\u00a0\u00a0 Budget 2021 provides for a further increased gross allocation to &pound;131m in the defence capital budget in respect of equipment and barracks infrastructure.\u00a0 This level of capital funding will allow the Defence Organisation to undertake a programme of sustained equipment replacement and infrastructural development across the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service as identified and prioritised in the Defence White Paper and builds on the significant investment programme over recent years. <\/p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the Defence Forces have the necessary modern and effective range of equipment available to them which is in line with best international standards in order to fulfil all roles assigned to them by Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700083#WRV01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1084,"content":"<p>Question No. 445 answered with Question No. 43.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Defence Forces Personnel","counter":1085,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700083#WRV01200"},{"type":"question","counter":1086,"qnumday":446,"qnumall":"[37065\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700083#WRV01300","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"the extent to which gender balance is being achieved throughout the Army, Naval Service and Air Corps; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":1087,"content":"<p>It is the policy of the Defence organisation to increase female participation rates at all levels of the Defence Forces in order to increase capability and to better reflect the society from which the Defence Forces are drawn and serve. <\/p><p>As of 30 September 2020, the strength of the Permanent Defence Force (PDF) stood at 8,529 Whole Time Equivalent (WTE) personnel.

It recommended 12 actions that focus on support for schools, teacher training, research and awareness raising and aims to ensure that all forms of bullying including identity based bullying are addressed.\u00a0 National Anti-Bullying Procedures for Primary and Post Primary schools, were published in September 2013 and are being implemented in all 4,000 primary and post primary schools throughout the country. The procedures are designed to give direction and guidance to school authorities and school personnel in preventing and tackling school-based bullying behaviour including identity based bullying amongst their pupils.\u00a0 The procedures make clear that the definition of bullying behaviour includes identity-based bullying such as racist bullying. The procedures require that the prevention of bullying must be an integral part of a school&rsquo;s anti-bullying policy. <\/p>  <p>  As part of the National Traveller and ROMA Inclusion Strategy 2017-2021 (NTRIS) published by the Department of Justice and Equality, which aims to improve the lives of Travellers and ROMA in Ireland, my Department has commissioned research on the effectiveness of the Department&rsquo;s Anti-Bullying strategy on experiences of Traveller and Roma Children. The project was developed in consultation with the Traveller representative groups. The research project has commenced and involves engagement with children and their parents and with schools.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  My Department will continue to address the areas of anti-racism, identity-based bullying and cultural awareness through a suite of supports including the recently revised Stay Safe Programme and the Continuing Professional Development (CPD) to teachers at Primary and Post-Primary level and in initial teacher education. It will ensure that such programmes enable teachers to deal with teaching and learning needs of all students from all cultural backgrounds and provide support for pedagogical practices that promote inclusion.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, curriculum at both primary and post-primary aims to foster inclusivity where equality and diversity are promoted.\u00a0 The Primary Curriculum acknowledges the importance of a balanced and informed awareness of the diversity of peoples and environments in the world. Such an awareness helps children to understand the world and contributes to their personal and social development as citizens of a global community. The curriculum promotes tolerance and respect for diversity in both the school and the community.\u00a0\u00a0 The Social Personal and Health Education Curriculum (SPHE) supports students learning in the areas of inclusion, diversity and counter racism. The SPHE content is complemented by the work carried out in social, environmental and scientific education (SESE) at primary SESE enables the child to live as an informed and caring member of local and wider communities.<\/p>  <p>  Under the Framework for Junior Cycle, there are twenty four statements of learning which should inform the programme designed by all schools.\u00a0 One of these statements is: (The student) appreciates and respects how diverse values, beliefs and traditions have contributed to the communities and culture in which she\/he lives.\u00a0 This junior cycle short course in CSPE focuses on supporting students in become active citizens through their learning in three strands: Rights and responsibilities, Global citizenship, and Exploring democracy. <\/p>  <p>  As part of the Departments ongoing curricular reform consideration of issues in relation to inclusivity\/diversity etc. will be considered as part of the ongoing reviews in relation to the primary curriculum and senior cycle at post-primary. <\/p>  <p>  My Department will continue to provide guidance and information on supports such as the Yellow Flag Programme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700084#WRW01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1152,"content":"<p>Question No. 468 answered with Question No. 457.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"DEIS Scheme","counter":1153,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700084#WRW01800"},{"type":"question","counter":1154,"qnumday":469,"qnumall":"[36243\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700084#WRW01900","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"when she will allocate additional funding to DEIS band one primary schools in recognition of the additional burden the schools have to deliver the best educational experience possible for pupils in those disadvantaged areas; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1485","askee":"1582"},{"type":"question","counter":1155,"qnumday":470,"qnumall":"[36244\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700084#WRW02000","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the additional funding she has allocated to DEIS band one schools in budget 2021; the way in which the funding is being distributed; the amount received by each school and college; and the number of pupils in each of the schools chosen.","asker":"1485","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":1156,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 469 and 470 together.<\/p>  <p>  I am pleased to advise the Deputy\u00a0that under Budget 2021 I have announced a general reduction in the mainstream staffing schedule to 25:1.\u00a0 While there has been a reduction in mainstream class size in recent years, there has not been a corresponding reduction for those Urban Band 1 DEIS schools who are already allocated a preferential staffing schedule of 20:1 for schools catering for junior classes only and 24:1 for schools catering for senior classes only.

Individualised data on pupils at primary level is of fundamental importance to fulfil our need for relevant and timely information to ensure the educational welfare of primary school children, to monitor adequately and cater for the needs of vulnerable subgroups, and ensure that all children are making the transition from the primary to post-primary system.<\/p><p>Using PPS numbers as unique identifiers, the database will assist the Department in compiling vital information about the progression of primary pupils through the education system, and the impact of educational interventions. It will be used to provide indicators on what is working and what is not in our educational system, as well as relevant, up-to-date information for future planning and resource allocation. Similar databases are in place already at other levels of education. In time, the Department is very confident that the database will not only reduce administrative burden and form filling for both schools and parents, but will play a vital role in underpinning the provision of education for all primary school pupils.&rdquo;<\/p><p>It should be noted, however, that it is not necessary for\u00a0a child\u00a0to have a PPSN to be enrolled in a school and to have their details entered on POD. In a case where a\u00a0pupil\u00a0is waiting for a PPSN to be issued to them their details can still be entered on the POD system to create a pupil profile. In this instance the mother&rsquo;s maiden acts as a placeholder until the PPSN is received and the\u00a0pupil's POD\u00a0profile can be updated at that stage. Such a pupil will still be counted towards capitation and allocation purposes provided they are enrolled in the school on the Census date, 30<sup>th<\/sup>September for academic year 2020-21, and are expected to continue to remain in attendance for the remainder of the school year.<\/p><p>Provision is also made, as per POD Circular 25\/2015, for parents of children who do not want their details recorded on POD, extract below:<\/p><p>1.

Schools that are in receipt of a letter from a parent outlining their objections to the onward provision of data to POD can create a partial record for that pupil on POD, using the guidelines available on request from the POD Helpdesk.

A third of 17 year olds were found to rely totally on school-based RSE to get their information on sex and relationships, with no parental input.<\/p>  <p>  Further findings include a significant variation in the provision of RSE at a school level. This was not found to be along the lines of school size, gender mix or ethos, which suggests that school policy and leadership play an important role in determining the level of RSE provision in schools. This is in agreement with previous research in this area. However, there was no significant link found between the level of RSE provision in schools and young people&rsquo;s sexual behaviour and competence.<\/p>  <p>  The report referenced that the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA)&rsquo;s review into RSE a number of times. The NCCA review, along with the focus on wellbeing in the Framework for Junior Cycle was stated to provide an opportunity to consider the issue of how information and support on sex are provided in schools. However, the report cautioned that without significant parental involvement, even the most comprehensive and high quality RSE provision in schools is limited in the effectiveness it can have. <\/p>  <p>  The National Council for Currriculum and Assessment (NCCA) conducted a thorough and transparent review, and published its report, &ldquo;Report on the Review of Relationships and Sexuality Education (RSE) in primary and post-primary Schools&rdquo; in December 2019. This Report was developed on foot of extensive consultation which was conducted between June 2018 and March 2019.<\/p>  <p>  The NCCA report makes a number of recommendations. This includes primarily the development of a single integrated curriculum for RSE and Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) in schools. Work on updating or developing new specifications for SPHE\/RSE will commence in the NCCA in 2021, beginning with a focus on Junior Cycle. This work will include engagement with all the key education stakeholders as well as a further process of public consultation before any new curriculum specifications are finalised.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The NCCA has established two development groups, one for primary and one for post-primary, to oversee the work in this area and support the development of guidance material for schools. These groups were unable to commence their work until recently due to the COVID-19 restrictions on public gatherings. However, meetings of these groups have been convened and will continue to be convened from December on an ongoing basis. This will allow them to review significant work that has been progressed.<\/p>  <p>  The NCCA is currently developing interim guidance for SPHE and RSE across primary and post-primary levels. These support materials will be made available in the form of an online toolkit. They will provide guidance on how the current curriculum can be approached in a more holistic way. The materials have been to the development groups from October. It is anticipated that some guidance materials will be published before the end of 2020 and that they will be supplemented incrementally during 2021.<\/p>  <p>  The NCCA has worked collaboratively with the teacher professional development support services and other relevant groups in completing an audit of current teaching and learning resources relevant to SPHE\/RSE and compiled a comprehensive resource list which will be published as part of the online toolkit for SPHE\/RSE.

In the absence of these examinations, every effort has been made to make the system as fair as possible for as many students as possible.<\/p>  <p>  The process of national standardisation, which forms a key part of the Calculated Grades process, was applied to the information provided by schools in order to ensure comparability between the standards applied by individual schools and the national standard.\u00a0 In order to be fair to the class of 2020, the teacher judgements made at the level of the school had to be adjusted so that a common national standard was applied. It was inherent to the system of calculated grades that school estimates would be subject to adjustment through this standardisations process.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  These adjustments resulted in the school estimates of subject percentage marks staying the same or being revised upwards or downwards. The standardisation process operated on the premise that the school estimates should only be adjusted through the standardisation process where there was credible statistical evidence to justify changing them.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  A standardising\u00a0process\u00a0happens every year and\u00a0would\u00a0have happened\u00a0in 2020\u00a0had\u00a0the Leaving Certificate examinations been run as normal.\u00a0\u00a0 In the system of calculated grades, the standardisation process applied uniformly across all subject and levels and school types. \u00a0The degree to which mark changes occurred related to the degree of over or underestimation in the school estimates for each subject and each level.\u00a0 This means that some students experienced mark changes from the school estimates but no changes to the grades based on the school estimates; while others will have experienced marks changes from the teacher estimates leading to grade changes in one or more of their subjects.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Following standardisation, the estimated percentage mark was converted to a calculated mark and subsequently, a calculated grade which was provided to students on 7 September. It is only at this point that students were awarded a grade.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Therefore, it is not accurate to state that student(s) were downgraded, or upgraded, through the standardisation process.\u00a0 Rather the grade that was awarded following the standardisation process is the grade for the 2020 Leaving Certificate (Calculated Grades).\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The appeals process for Calculated Grades was open to students who were disappointed with the Calculated Grades they received in one or more subjects.

In this regard, it will remain at 66 years pending the report of the Pensions Commission and I will introduce legislation shortly to give effect to this.  <\/p>  <p>  The Commission's Terms of Reference includes the examination of sustainability and eligibility issues with the State Pension and the Social Insurance Fund.  More broadly, it will also consider the issue of retirement ages in employment contracts and consider how the pension system can further accommodate carers, who are predominantly women.  <\/p>  <p>  The membership of the Commission, approved by Government, reflects the need to have subject matter experts to deal with the complex social and public policy issues arising in pensions, as well as stakeholder representation which will keep the work of the Commission grounded.  This includes representation of workers, employers, civil society, academics and those with technical and policy expertise.  In this regard, the membership also includes those with involvement in organisations supporting older people.  The Government was keen to ensure that the Commission had strong female membership in its membership. It will be chaired by Ms. Josephine Feehily.  I am satisfied that the Commission, with its gender-balanced membership and extensive experience of social and public policy, will be keenly aware of the gender dimension of pensions policy and delivery and will bring this perspective to bear in its work.  <\/p>  <p>  The Commission will also engage with a range of key stakeholders to ensure that it has a genuine understanding of not only the fiscal sustainability challenges involved, but also the associated social sustainability challenges of implementing potential policy reforms.  The exact mechanisms for this engagement will be shaped by the Chair and by Commission members.<\/p>  <p>  It should be noted that while this Government is acutely conscious of the need to consider the sustainability of the State's finances, this is not the only consideration when thinking of the State pension age.  The State Pension is the bedrock of the pension system in Ireland.  It is extremely effective at ensuring that our pensioners do not experience poverty.

It is a whole-of-government support system for those seeking international protection in Ireland. \u00a0Notwithstanding the criticisms levelled at the system, it has proven effective in ensuring that those who come to our country seeking international protection receive food and shelter and have immediate access to our state services. Over 65,000 people have been provided with shelter since its inception.<\/p>  <p>  The Direct Provision system ensures that all applicants can be offered immediate shelter, full board accommodation and a range of services, such as health and education while their applications are being processed. Not every person who seeks international protection chooses to accept this offer, and some choose to live independently or with friends in communities across the country, as they are entirely free to do.\u00a0 Persons accommodated are free to leave the accommodation provided at any time.<\/p>  <p>  The improvements to living conditions for applicants for international protection have been significant over recent years.

This allows for access to laundry, food-storage and cooking facilities for the use of residents. It also allows for the provision of a food-hall where residents may obtain food and other essentials free of charge on a points system based on family composition. Own-door accommodation is prioritised for families and is the preferred option for new accommodation offered to the IPAS under the regional tender competitions which were held in the past year.<\/p>  <p>  Information on centres opened in the past year can be found on the following website: www.accommodationcentres.ie.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Programme for Government contains a committment\u00a0to ending the Direct Provision system and replacing it with a new International Protection accommodation policy, centred on a not-for-profit approach.\u00a0 The Government has also committed to the development of a White Paper which will set out how this new system will be structured and the steps to achieving it.<\/p>  <p>  The Advisory Group on the Provision of Support, including Accommodation, to Persons in the International Protection Process was established last year.\u00a0 It was tasked to examine best practice in other European States in the provision of services to international protection applicants, to examine likely longer term trends and to set out recommendations and solutions.\u00a0 The chairperson, Dr Catherine Day, submitted the group's\u00a0report to the Minister for Justice, Helen McEntee T.D., and myself in late September and,\u00a0following consideration of the report, Minister McEntee and I submitted the report to Government on 20 October.\u00a0The Government\u00a0accepted the Advisory Group&rsquo;s conclusion that the current system of Direct Provision is not fit for purpose and must be replaced.\u00a0 I published the report on 21 October.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is currently developing the White Paper which I expect to publish by the end of the year.\u00a0 The recommendations of the \u00a0Advisory Group\u00a0will inform the White Paper.\u00a0 We will also consider a number of other relevant reports including the Inter-Departmental Working Group Report on Direct Provision (November 2019) and the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice &amp;amp; Equality, Report on Direct Provision (December 2019).\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Consultations are currently underway and include discussions with the relevant Government Departments and agencies,\u00a0the Offices of the Ombudsman and the Ombudsman for Children, the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, relevant NGOs and housing bodies and representatives of residents of Direct Provision centres.<\/p>  <p>  The replacement of the Direct Provision system is complex.\u00a0 It is recognised by all involved that it will take some time.

It also provides opportunities for workers to be granted leave to care for relatives who need support. By modernising the existing EU legal framework in the area of family-related leaves and flexible working arrangements, it is envisaged that parents and carers will be better able to reconcile their professional and private lives, and companies will benefit from more motivated workers. Member States have three years to adopt laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with the Directive (2 August 2022).\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Member States are to provide for an individual right to 18 weeks of parental leave per parent,\u00a0nine weeks of which must be non-transferable and paid at an adequate level, before the respective child reaches an age to be determined by the Member State (eight years minimum age). The right to request flexible uptake is enshrined in Article 5.\u00a0This provision must be transposed within\u00a0five years.<\/p>  <p>  The Government intends to extend parent's leave from two weeks to five weeks for each parent of all children born or adopted on or after 1 Nov 2019. The Government also intends to extend the period in which parent's leave can be taken up until that child turns two or, in the case of an adoption, two years after the adoption placement date of the child.

The Act provides a modern statutory framework to support decision-making by adults with capacity difficulties. The 2015 Act was signed into law on 30 December 2015 but has not yet been fully commenced. The Act provides for the establishment of new administrative processes and support measures, including the setting up of the Decision Support Service (DSS) within the Mental Health Commission (a body under the Department of Health).<\/p>  <p>  \u00a0A number of provisions of the 2015 Act were commenced in October 2016 in order to progress the setting up of the Decision Support Service and enable the recruitment of the Director of the DSS. Ms &Aacute;ine Flynn was appointed Director of the DSS on 2 October 2017. The commencement of Part 8 of the Act, which provides a legislative framework for advance healthcare directives, is a matter for the Minister for Health. <\/p>  <p>  The implementation of the 2015 Act requires that the DSS is fully operational and in a position to offer services including the new decision-making support options. A high-level Steering Group comprising senior officials from my Department, the Department of Health, the Mental Health Commission, the Courts Service and the HSE, together with the Director of the DSS, is overseeing the establishment and commissioning of the DSS and this work is ongoing. The DSS, led by its Director, is working on putting in place the necessary infrastructure to support the full commencement of the Act. The infrastructure required includes, amongst many other elements, ICT capability for the DSS. These preparations are being implemented under the oversight of the Steering Group and will allow for commencement orders for the main operative provisions of the 2015 Act to be made when the necessary preparations have been completed. This will enable the DSS to roll out the new decision-making support options. <\/p>  <p>  My Department has, through the Estimates process, sought and received increased funding in 2021 to allow the DSS to work towards the commencement of services in mid- 2022. In the interim, my Department, in conjunction with the DSS, the Mental Health Commission and other stakeholders have agreed to an implementation plan that anticipates the commencement of DSS services in mid-2022. There are also critical dependencies for the DSS on other organisations, including, for example, the Courts Service, the HSE and the Department of Health amongst others, which need to be delivered in order to achieve this timeline. The Steering Group has been meeting regularly to ensure a coordinated approach to the implementation of this project.\u00a0 In tandem with this work, progress is also being made to finalise the amendments to the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 to streamline the processes envisaged under the 2015 Act and to support the DSS to become operational.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700091#WRDD02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Youth Services","counter":1559,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700091#WRDD02100"},{"type":"question","counter":1560,"qnumday":609,"qnumall":"[36295\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700091#WRDD02200","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"when the additional &euro;5 million announced in budget 2021 for youth services will be made available; and the way in which the funding will be distributed.","asker":"1626","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":1561,"content":"<p>I am pleased to confirm that I secured an additional &euro;5 million in current funding for youth services nationally as part of Budget 2021.\u00a0 My officials are currently working on the apportionment of these funds in the context of the publication of the Revised Estimates Volume later this year.

Many HEIs also participate in the Higher Education Access Route (HEAR) and Disability Access Route to Education (DARE) schemes which offer places on courses on a reduced points basis to school leavers from socio-economically disadvantaged backgrounds and students with disabilities.

The student contribution fee is currently set at &euro;3,000 per annum and can be paid in instalments. In addition, the Exchequer pays the contribution in full or part, through SUSI, for approximately 44% of students eligible for free fees.<\/p><p>Graduate Entry Medicine (GEM) is one of the pathways to study undergraduate medicine. Students pursuing GEM programmes do so as second degree courses and consequently are not eligible for free fees funding or for student grants. However, in order to widen access to GEM programmes, and give assistance towards the financial burden on each student pursuing these programmes, the fees of participating EU students are partly subsidised by the State via the HEA. Currently, the subsidy is &euro;11,200 per student with the balance of fees payable by the student.<\/p><p>Where students do not qualify for free fees funding, they pay the appropriate fee, either EU or Non-EU, as determined by each HEI. The institutions are autonomous bodies and the level of fee payable by students who do not meet the requirements of the free fees scheme is a matter for the relevant institution to determine in accordance with their own criteria.<\/p><p>An annual quota applies to the intake of EU students to medical education in the State. Thereafter, the\u00a0number of places allocated\u00a0to non-EU students\u00a0is a matter for the individual HEI concerned with the availability of clinical placements being an important factor in this regard.<\/p><p>In broader terms the HEA has also provided data detailing course enrolments on health and welfare related courses in higher education in 2018\/2019.

Other options\u00a0being explored include greater automation of the process including ICT improvements, revision of key documentation and greater use\u00a0of remote interviewing. <\/p>  <p>  Efforts to improve processing times have been impacted by the\u00a0COVID-19 pandemic, which has reduced the output of decisions\u00a0considerably and has impacted on the\u00a0target set by the IPO to make\u00a0\u00a0first instance decisions\u00a0in the vast majority of cases within 9 months.\u00a0 COVID-19 has also impacted those applications at\u00a0appeal stage.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The IPO&rsquo;s main focus going forward is to get its processing system functioning as effectively and efficiently as possible, while adhering to all measures in place to combat the spread of COVID-19.\u00a0\u00a0However, it must be\u00a0acknowledged that the processing of applications is complex and that each application deserves and receives an individual assessment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700093#WRFF02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Domestic Violence Services","counter":1675,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700093#WRFF02150"},{"type":"question","counter":1676,"qnumday":650,"qnumall":"[37133\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700093#WRFF02200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the amount of additional ring-fenced funding to be provided to domestic violence services under Budget 2021 in order that services can respond adequately to increased incidence of domestic violence through Covid-19 and beyond; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1599","askee":"1502"},{"type":"question","counter":1677,"qnumday":659,"qnumall":"[36347\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700093#WRFF02250","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the additional ring-fenced funding to be provided by her Department to domestic violence services in Budget 2021 in order that services can respond adequately to the shadow pandemic of domestic violence through Covid-19 and beyond; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1598","askee":"1502"},{"type":"question","counter":1678,"qnumday":675,"qnumall":"[36881\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700093#WRFF02275","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the exact amount of ring-fenced funding across all relevant Departments to be provided to domestic violence services in Budget 2021; and the additional funding that is being allocated in order that services can respond adequately to the shadow pandemic of domestic violence through Covid-19 and beyond.","asker":"1628","askee":"1502"},{"type":"question","counter":1679,"qnumday":680,"qnumall":"[36948\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700093#WRFF02287","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the amount of additional ring-fenced funding to be provided to domestic violence services in Budget 2021; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1572","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":1680,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 650, 659, 675 and 680 together.<\/p>  <p>  Combatting domestic, sexual and gender-based violence is a priority for this Government and for me as Minister for Justice. <\/p>  <p>  To date my Department has provided &euro;327,590 in Covid specific funding to help organisations working to support victims of crime, including victims of domestic abuse and\u00a0I\u00a0have\u00a0secured an additional &euro;400,000 to continue this Covid specific support in 2021. <\/p>  <p>  This Covid specific funding has provided additional resources, support, enforcement and services to key organisations in the\u00a0area of domestic,\u00a0sexual and gender\u00a0based violence\u00a0in response to the increased demand for services during the pandemic.

The increase in\u00a0domestic abuse incidents during the pandemic\u00a0has been born out in figures reported by frontline services, such as the one referred to by the Deputy, by statistics released by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, by the courts and most recently by the Director of Public Prosecutions at the annual Prosecutors Conference.<\/p>  <p>  Tackling domestic abuse and supporting victims\u00a0is a key\u00a0priority for me as Minister for Justice and for the Government as a whole. \u00a0This is true in terms of commitments and additional\u00a0resources made available during the pandemic and\u00a0as regards\u00a0the longer-term planning to ensure we have a comprehensive and holistic approach to the provision of services for victims of domestic, sexual and gender based violence and a system that support vulnerable victims at every point\u00a0throughout\u00a0the criminal justice system. <\/p>  <p>  While for most people the advice was to &lsquo;stay home, stay safe&rsquo;, my Department recognised at he outset of the restriction on movement that for those for whom domestic abuse is a risk, home could be far from safe. In recognition of this, my Department developed an inter-agency plan to address and prioritise tackling domestic abuse during the pandemic, and is leading efforts to identify lessons which can be learned, with input from the community and voluntary sector.<\/p>  <p>  During the pandemic my Department provided additional resources, support, enforcement and services to key organisations in the\u00a0area of domestic,\u00a0sexual and gender\u00a0based violence\u00a0in order for them to adapt and\u00a0respond to the increased demand for services during this period. This support is maintained and increased in budget 2021 and\u00a0I can assure the Deputy that domestic abuse\u00a0was\u00a0of primary consideration in the context of\u00a0the move to level 5 in the National Framework for Living with Covid-19.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  My Department initiated and continues to run the 'Still Here' public awareness campaign, in partnership with public sector organisations and the NGO sector. The &lsquo;Still Here&rsquo; campaign\u00a0is about getting the message out that services continue to be available to victims of domestic abuse and sexual violence and to spread the message that the COVID travel restrictions do not apply to victims of domestic abuse seeking help.<\/p>  <p>  During the pandemic, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have continuously attached the highest priority to domestic abuse through Operation Faoiseamh&rsquo;, which is an active, ongoing operation and\u00a0both the Courts Service and the Legal Aid Board\u00a0are prioritising domestic abuse cases. The Legal Aid board has established a Helpline to ensure victims of domestic abuse get legal advice and representation in proceedings where required.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  I want to reassure the Deputy,\u00a0but more\u00a0importantly\u00a0to reassure anyone who is a victim,\u00a0or\u00a0at risk of, domestic or sexual abuse, that help continues to be available. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Courts and other services, including the vital supports provided by our highly skilled and committed community and voluntary services are \"Still Here\" for them - regardless of the level of\u00a0restriction the country is at.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that primary responsibility for funding frontline services, including refuges for victims of domestic abuse, rests with Tusla and I\u00a0understand that in addition to the &euro;25.3 million of funding\u00a0provided by Tusla for frontline services in 2020, an additional &euro;2 million euro was provided in Covid specific funding.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to funding more generally, in\u00a02020, my Department committed almost &euro;1.9 million to support services for victims of\u00a0crime, including sexual and gender based violence.\u00a0 These services provide important information and support to victims of crime, including emotional support, court accompaniment, accompaniment to Garda interviews and to sexual assault treatment units, counselling and referral to other services.\u00a0&euro;2 million has been allocated to support such services for victims of crime in Budget 2021.<\/p>  <p>  I have also secured just over &euro;2 million euro in Budget 2021 for combatting domestic sexual and gender based violence and\u00a0an additional &euro;2.3 million to support the implementation of the O'Malley review which will support vulnerable victims, including victims of domestic, sexual and gender based violence. <\/p>  <p>  I recently published Supporting A Victims Journey - A plan to help victims and vulnerable witnesses in sexual violence cases which is a detailed roadmap for the introduction of the recommendations contained in the O'Malley review which, when implemented, will\u00a0\u00a0protect vulnerable witnesses, during the investigation and prosecution of sexual offences. This work is being\u00a0 progressed as a priority under the Programme for Government commitments in consultation with our stakeholders.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  As regards planning for the future, the Programme for Government commits to an audit of how domestic, sexual and gender based violence services are organised. Terms of reference have been agreed and the Department of Justice has commenced a procurement process to engage an independent consultant to undertake the audit. Candidates have 3 weeks to apply and the contract will be awarded before the end of the year with a requirement to conduct the audit within 3 months. The audit will include input from all stakeholders and will be presented before the end of March 2021 in line with the Programme for Government commitment. <\/p>  <p>  Without prejudice to the outcome of the audit, the Programme for Government also commits to the development of the third National Strategy on Domestic, Sexual and Gender Based Violence, which will place a priority on prevention and reduction and will include a National Preventative Strategy. A review of the outstanding actions has been conducted to inform the forthcoming 3rd National Strategy on DSGBV, to be developed and agreed by Government before the end of 2021.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700093#WRFF06100","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Prison Investigations","counter":1716,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700094#WRGG00200"},{"type":"question","counter":1717,"qnumday":663,"qnumall":"[36417\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700094#WRGG00300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if she has set up an inquiry under section 31(2) of the Prisons Act 2007 to examine a category A complaint on foot of a report of allegations of serious malpractice made by the Inspector of Prisons regarding  events in the D&oacute;chas Centre; if so, if the report will be received from the inquiry; the actions taken in the meantime to ensure the well-being of all prisoners in the centre; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1575","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":1718,"content":"<p>I would like to take this\u00a0opportunity to clarify\u00a0that what the Deputy is referring here are two separate matters. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In terms of the Category A complaint, as\u00a0the Deputy\u00a0may be aware, all prisoners have the right to make a complaint at any time and all complaints are treated with the utmost seriousness and confidentiality.

However, I am aware that there has been some attention on issues arising in the context of video gaming. In particular, whether in-game purchases or micro-transactions, described as \"loot boxes\", \"skins\" etc., designed to improve the players&rsquo; chances of success in inter-active online games, might encourage gambling like behaviour. <\/p>  <p>  The issue is whether such micro-transactions constitute gambling or are a form of e-commerce. \u00a0It is not clear that these offers fall within the current Irish legal definition of gambling or that purchases are essentially an e-commerce activity. <\/p>  <p>  Different approaches have been adopted to the issue of whether and how \"loot boxes\" might be defined and regulated in the context of gambling activities in Europe, with no definitive outcomes. This matter is one which my Department and ultimately the new Gambling Regulator will keep under review. <\/p>  <p>  This is a position, which is shared by other EU Member States. Ireland supported the 2018 Declaration by the Gaming Regulators European Forum that video gaming products should be licensed and regulated appropriately, if they can be shown to fall into the category of gambling. In preparing the declaration, member states were aware of reports that third party actors, not authorised by the video game developer or under their control, may seek to commercialise certain elements of video gaming in a manner akin to gambling. <\/p>  <p>  With regard to protection of children and age limits for video games, the Pan-European Game Information (PEGI) age rating system was established in 2003 to help European parents make informed decisions on buying computer games.

In essence, this means that all mothers should be supported to breastfeed at anytime and anywhere.<\/p>  <p>  The National Strategy for Women and Girls 2017-2020 re-affirmed the commitment to advance public support of breastfeeding and includes an action to extend provision for breastfeeding breaks under employment legislation (currently available to mothers of children under 6 months).<\/p>  <p>  The HSE&rsquo;s National Women and Infants Health Programme, in collaboration with health promotion and improvement and public health services in the HSE, supports the implementation of the WHO\/UNICEF 10 Steps to Successful Breastfeeding using a model suitable for the promotion and support of breastfeeding in Ireland.

Vaccines are being administered via GPs and pharmacists, as in previous years. <\/p>  <p>  This season, 1.95 million doses of influenza vaccine have been purchased, which is double the amount administered last season. The HSE has procured 1.35 million doses of the Quadrivalent Influenza Vaccine (QIV) for the forthcoming winter. This vaccine is being made available to all persons in an at-risk group and aged from 6 months up. In addition, the HSE has also purchased 600,000 doses of the Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine (LAIV), which is delivered via nasal drops rather than by injection and is being made available to all children aged from 2 to 12 years old inclusive.<\/p>  <p>  Deliveries of this vaccine from the manufacturer were not as quick as we would have liked, due to the very challenging international market for flu vaccines.  It is also true that demand for vaccination this year is unprecedented.  This is the case across Europe and beyond, and in this context it is unlikely that additional supply will become available.  <\/p>  <p>  I can confirm that 1.3 million of the 1.35 million doses of flu vaccine available this winter have been distributed to GPs, pharmacists and other vaccination sites since early October.  In addition, 420,000 doses of the LAIV for administration to children aged from 2 to 12 have been distributed. <\/p>  <p>  Demand for vaccination remains strong at this point and may exceed available supply. It is likely that the full amount procured, 1.35 million doses, will be distributed and administered. As a consequence, from the fourth round of deliveries which started on 23 October, GPs and pharmacists have been asked that of remaining patients in at-risk groups, priority should be given to the over-65s and healthcare workers with direct patient contact, in line with WHO advice. <\/p>  <p>  Each year a certain amount of vaccine is &ldquo;held back&rdquo; to ensure those in at-risk groups receive vaccines. With the unprecedented demand this year it is important that the HSE manage the distribution of the remaining doses in order to target administration to the at-risk groups who need it the most. The distribution of the final 50,000 doses will commence by the end of this month. The significant increase in uptake among those in the at-risk groups, combined with the addition of vaccination for children aged from 2 to 12, will help reduce the impact of influenza on the community and the health system.<\/p>  <p>  Vaccinations are ordered well in advance &ndash; the HSE placed its order for the vaccine for those in at-risk groups in February. The HSE order for the 2020\/21 season was 20% greater than the order for the 2019\/20 season and about 35% more than 2019\/20 uptake. These figures do not include the additional 600,000 doses of vaccine ordered for children aged from 2 &ndash; 12, which would bring to almost 75% the additional number of doses of vaccine available this year. Given the demand on the international market for influenza vaccine, it is not realistically possible to procure more vaccine at this point.<\/p>  <p>  When the vaccination programme is complete, we will have vaccinated more people in at-risk groups than ever before.  Current trends suggest that at least 350,000 more individuals in the at-risk groups will receive the flu vaccine this winter than last, including those over 65 and healthcare workers. In addition, over 100,000 children have already received the vaccination which is being provided without charge this year for the first time.  I expect this number to increase significantly in the coming weeks also.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700096#WRJJ03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic","counter":1857,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700096#WRJJ03300"},{"type":"question","counter":1858,"qnumday":713,"qnumall":"[36262\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700096#WRJJ03400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when the results of the SCOPI: COVID-19 antibody research study will be finalised and published;

Every effort is made by the HSE, within the framework of the Health Act 1970, to support applicants in applying for a medical card and to take full account of the difficult circumstances, such as extra costs arising from an illness.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, since 2015 medical cards are awarded without the need of a financial assessment to all children under 18 years of age with a diagnosis of cancer.<\/p>  <p>  It should also be noted that the Programme for Government &lsquo;Our Shared Future&rsquo; contains a commitment to extend discretionary medical cards to those with a terminal illness. A HSE Clinical Advisory Group (CAG) was established in December 2019 to review eligibility for medical cards in cases of terminal illness. The final Report of the CAG was recently submitted to my Department which I intend to publish imminently. The Report notes that there are practical and legal challenges with extending eligibility for medical cards for terminally ill patients within the framework of the current process. However, I wish to assure the Deputy that I am committed to ensuring that terminally ill patients have access to the services they need.\u00a0 In that regard, my Department has devised an ambitious work programme to be initiated immediately, which will look to address the policy and legal findings of the Report and deliver on the Programme for Government commitment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700097#WRKK03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ambulance Service","counter":1920,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700097#WRKK03800"},{"type":"question","counter":1921,"qnumday":736,"qnumall":"[36376\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700097#WRKK03900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of ambulances in service in County Kildare;

The HSE has procured 1.35 million doses of the Quadrivalent Influenza Vaccine (QIV) for the forthcoming winter. This vaccine is being made available to all persons in an at-risk group and aged from 6 months up. In addition, the HSE has also purchased 600,000 doses of the Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine (LAIV), which is delivered via nasal drops rather than by injection and is being made available to all children aged from 2 to 12 years old inclusive.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Deliveries of this vaccine from the manufacturer were not as quick as we would have liked, due to the very challenging international market for flu vaccines.\u00a0 It is also true that demand for vaccination this year is unprecedented.\u00a0 This is the case across Europe and beyond, and in this context it is unlikely that additional supply will become available.\u00a0 \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  While I cannot comment on individual providers, I can confirm that 1.3 million of the 1.35 million doses of flu vaccine available this winter have been distributed to GPs, pharmacists and other vaccination sites since early October.\u00a0 In addition, 420,000 doses of the LAIV for administration to children aged from 2 to 12 have been distributed. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Demand for vaccination remains strong at this point and may exceed available supply. It is likely that the full amount procured, 1.35 million doses, will be distributed and administered.

My Department and the HSE's Sexual Health and Crisis Pregnancy Programme (SHCPP) and HSE Education Lead work closely with our partners in the Department of Education to support health and wellbeing in schools, including supports for the Junior Cycle Wellbeing Curriculum, Social and Personal Health Education (SPHE) and Relationship and Sexuality Education (RSE), which is currently being reviewed by the NCCA. <\/p><p>With regard to the type of information campaigns suggested by the Deputy, the SHCPP has implemented a number of sexual health information campaigns aimed at children and young people, in particular through dedicated websites such as sexualwellbeing.ie and B4UDecide.ie.

These can be used both in schools and at home, providing advice to parents and teachers on discussing relationships and sexuality with children.

This includes 600,000 doses of the vaccine delivered via nasal drops to children aged from 2 -12.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The approach taken by the HSE and the Government is to ensure that all of those most vulnerable to the winter flu will have access to vaccination without charge. This includes all of those in the at-risk groups and healthcare workers. The extension of vaccination to all children aged from 2 to 12 years will provide additional protection, as younger children (along with the elderly) are among those most at-risk from flu. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  1.35 million doses of the injected vaccine are being made available for those in the HSE-defined at-risk groups, including healthcare workers.\u00a0 For comparison purposes, just under 1 million doses were administered last winter.\u00a0 Notwithstanding the large increase in available vaccine this year, it is likely that the full supply will be used, representing an increase of 35% in uptake over last year.\u00a0 This is expected to increase the population health benefit from the vaccination campaign, as well as helping to reduce the pressure on the health service, particularly when combined with the uptake among children.<\/p>  <p>  I can confirm that 1.3 million of the 1.35 million doses of flu vaccine available this winter have been distributed to GPs, pharmacists and other vaccination sites since early October.\u00a0 In addition, 420,000 doses of the LAIV for administration to children aged from 2 to 12 have been distributed. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Demand for vaccination remains strong at this point and may exceed available supply. It is likely that the full amount procured, 1.35 million doses, will be distributed and administered. As a consequence, from the fourth round of deliveries which started on 23 October, GPs and pharmacists have been asked that of remaining patients in at-risk groups, priority should be given to the over-65s and healthcare workers with direct patient contact, in line with WHO advice. <\/p>  <p>  Vaccinations are ordered well in advance &ndash; the HSE placed its order for the vaccine for those in at-risk groups in February. The HSE order for the 2020\/21 season was 20% greater than the order for the 2019\/20 season and about 35% more than 2019\/20 uptake. These figures do not include the additional 600,000 doses of vaccine ordered for children aged from 2 &ndash; 12, which would bring to almost 75% the additional number of doses of vaccine available this year. Given the demand on the international market for influenza vaccine, it is not likely that we will be able to procure more vaccine at this point.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  When the vaccination programme is complete, we will have vaccinated more people in at-risk groups than ever before.\u00a0 Current trends suggest that at least 350,000 more individuals in the at-risk groups will receive the flu vaccine this winter than last, including those over 65 and healthcare workers. In addition, over 100,000 children have already received the vaccination which is being provided without charge this year for the first time.\u00a0 I expect this number to increase significantly in the coming weeks also.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700104#WRRR01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disability Services Provision","counter":2285,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700104#WRRR01100"},{"type":"question","counter":2286,"qnumday":865,"qnumall":"[37139\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700104#WRRR01200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if the HSE altered the criteria and amount of refunds for the purchase of glasses and optical examinations that parents of children with disabilities can claim back in April 2020 as occurred in the case of a person (details supplied);

These Regulations were welcomed by the ISPCA and other welfare organisations, and put into law certain requirements for sellers and suppliers of pet animals, including minimum ages for sale of certain mammals; record-keeping; registration with the Department;  and provision of certain information about the pet in advertisements. <\/p>  <p>  Under the Regulations, anyone who sells or supplies six or more pet animals in a calendar year (this includes third-party sellers) must register with the Department, unless they are subject to the requirement to register with their local authority under the Dog Breeding Establishments Act 2010. The Department is actively considering the issue of publication of the register, but must ensure that such is compliant with all data protection regulations.<\/p>  <p>  The Dog Breeding Establishments Act falls under the remit of the Minister for Rural and Community Development.  In relation to registered microchips, under the Microchipping of Dogs Regulations 2015, four companies are authorised by my Department to register owner details of dog microchips, and there is no central database.  These companies provide details of the chips they hold to Europetnet which is a group of national and local associations throughout Europe that register owner information about pets that have been uniquely identified. Certain persons such as dog wardens and those who microchip dogs have access through this portal to the databases to enable the identification of microchipped dogs. <\/p>  <p>  There is further work to be done on effective enforcement of the Regulations and no infringement orders have been taken to date. However, the requirement to include certain information about a pet animal in an advertisement will assist potential pet owners in deciding the appropriate seller with whom to engage.  Potential pet owners should carefully conduct comprehensive research before acquiring a pet.  <\/p>  <p>  My Department participates in the Irish Pet Advertising Advisory Group (IPAAG), a group formed in 2015 by a number of animal welfare organisations, veterinary professionals and classified advertising websites to address irresponsible advertising of pets online.  Officials of my Department have engaged and will continue to engage constructively with members of IPAAG, on the issue of online advertising and enforcement of the new Regulations.  IPAAG has published practical, comprehensive advice on their website for anyone thinking of acquiring a pet, including what to check for in advertisements for pet animals.  The sale and purchase of a pet is a commercial transaction between a seller and a buyer.<\/p>  <p>  Any evidence of animal cruelty or neglect of an animal&rsquo;s welfare should be brought to the attention of my Department by calling the animal welfare helpline on 0761064408 (Call Save) or 01 6072379 or by emailing animalwelfare@agriculture.gov.ie.  All such reports are followed up on.  This Government is committed to advancing animal welfare.

Therefore, costs related to projects under the Transitional Programme are likely to be met from the provision in my Department&rsquo;s Vote in 2022 and 2023, as well as in 2021. <\/p>  <p>  The details of the Transitional Programme are currently being finalised and I hope to be in a position shortly to announce the full details of project and administration allocations under the Programme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700106#WRTT05300","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Development Companies","counter":2444,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700106#WRTT05600"},{"type":"question","counter":2445,"qnumday":921,"qnumall":"[36941\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700106#WRTT05700","dept":"Department of Rural and Community Development","minister":"Minister for Rural and Community Development","question":"if she will consider allocating funding to a company (details supplied) in order that it can maintain existing levels of service; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1592","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":2446,"content":"<p>LEADER is a multi-annual programme with a budget of &euro;250 million over the period 2014-2020.\u00a0 &euro;225 million of this budget was allocated at the outset of the programme to\u00a0Local Action Groups (LAGs) who deliver the programme and approve projects at local level.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The funding allocated to each LAG covers both core project expenditure and the administration costs of the LAG and its Implementing Partners.\u00a0 No additional funding is available to the LAGs or their Implementing Partners under the current LEADER\u00a0programme which concludes in December 2020.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Due to delays in agreeing the post-2020 EU budget, the next EU-funded LEADER programme will not commence until January 2022 at the earliest.\u00a0 The Programme for Government includes a commitment to prioritise a State-led programme to bridge the gap between the current LEADER programme and the next EU programme.\u00a0 The objective of this commitment is to allow local-led rural development projects to be delivered under a Transitional Programme until the new EU programme commences.<\/p>  <p>  An extra &euro;4 million has been provided for LEADER in Budget 2021, to bring the total allocation for next year to &euro;44 million.\u00a0 I can confirm that this allocation will be used to fund a combination of existing projects as they come to completion, as well as for new projects to be approved under the Transitional Programme.\u00a0 The funding will also support the administration costs of the existing LAGs and their Implementing Partners in closing out the current programme and delivering the Transitional Programme.<\/p>  <p>  The details of the Transitional Programme are currently being finalised and I hope to be in a position shortly to announce the full details of project and administration allocations under the Programme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111700106#WRTT05800","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"}]
