On 29 May, more than 1,000 passengers missed their flights.  That chaos flows directly from the actions of the management of Dublin Airport Authority, DAA, two years ago.  It chose to slash staff numbers and drive wages and conditions down taking advantage of the pandemic to drive through a shock doctrine.  That is what it did.  We have been warning about this from the moment it happened.  However, the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, would not listen.  He knew that the DAA, while receiving huge amounts of public funding during the pandemic, was using the pandemic as an excuse to cut directly employed, unionised workers and replace them with workers on low wages and poor contracts.  The Government allowed the DAA to get away with that.  When the DAA announced plans to sack hundreds of workers, I spoke out multiple times in the D&aacute;il and warned that it would be disastrous.  I talked to many workers in the DAA who told me that it would be a disaster.  They also told me of the terror tactics that were being used by the company to drive people out.  Real fear was put into workers by telling them they had the option of voluntary severance, a career break of up to five years, reduced hours or, alternatively, remaining in their jobs and agreeing so-called new ways of working that involved big changes in terms of contracts, roles and a threat of pay reductions of up to 60%.  It was clear, and we warned at the time, that these workers would be needed again in the future but the DAA, being run on a commercial basis by a guy on close to &euro;400,000 a year, including pension entitlements, was focused on getting rid of unionised, directly employed workers and replacing them with contracted agency staff on lower wages and less favourable conditions.<\/p>  <p>  In regard to security workers, the DAA got rid of 248 workers out of a pre-pandemic total search and security workforce of 858.  Close to a quarter of the total workforce was let go.  That is why we are in the current crisis in terms of the massive queues.  The crisis in regard to cleaning the airport is the consequence of a similar approach.  The DAA has been advertising to hire new security staff who must be available 40 hours a week but who are only guaranteed 20 hours' work a week on a salary of &euro;14.14 an hour.  The weekly salary for 20 hours' work at that rate amounts to just &euro;283.  The company has not been able to get the staff on that basis, and the result is the disaster we have seen.<\/p>  <p>  The Government's answer is to send in the Army.  This is papering over the problems that are consequences of the DAA's decisions.  It is a short-term approach that could temporarily deal with the issues but at the cost of long-term problems.  The issue is the poor wages and conditions offered by the DAA and the need to have more directly employed, full-time security staff.  In effect it is a further attack on workers.  The Government, which stood by and let DAA put profit before workers and the efficient operation of the airport, is planning to compound that attack by allowing the Army to do the work that directly employed workers had done prior to, in effect, being made redundant.  It is ironic that the Government's response to problems caused by low pay and poor conditions is to bring in other workers on low pay and with poor conditions.  Some 85% of Irish Defence Forces personnel earn less than the average industrial wage.  It adds insult to injury.  I welcome the reports that security staff at Dublin Airport are warning that they will resist attempts to use the Army at the airport.  I offer them our full support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070600003#A00500","speaker":"1628"},{"type":"speech","time":1657095120,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to update the House on this topic.  As Deputies are aware, the Government last week supported a request for members of the Defence Forces to undergo appropriate training and certification to enable them to be on standby to assist the DAA with security activities at Dublin Airport, if required, over the coming peak summer weeks.  Putting this emergency contingency measure in place does not mean that members of the Defence Forces will automatically be deployed to the airport.  Instead, they will be ready for deployment if required by the DAA.  This decision comes on foot of a proposal from the DAA for the potential deployment of the Defence Forces as a prudent step primarily because of the risk of the resurgence of Covid-19 and the effect that could have on its staff and the operations at this exceptionally busy time.  During the Omicron wave in early 2022, more than one in four Dublin Airport security staff were absent.  Given the high numbers going through the airport every day any recurrence of such high absence levels could have a significant impact on the airport&rsquo;s continued ability to process passengers through security.<\/p>  <p>  The programme for Government acknowledges the value of aviation in supporting economic development, international connectivity and tourism via our airports.  In view of this the Government is committed to do what is necessary to ensure that flights do not need to be cancelled at Dublin Airport, as has been the case at other European airports, and that passengers have the assurance that they will not miss their holidays or other travel arrangements where they arrive at the airport within the advised timeframes.<\/p>  <p>  On foot of the Government decision, the Defence Forces will be available on standby from this week for a defined period over the peak summer months.  This is a short-term emergency-related contingency measure to protect passengers&rsquo; travel arrangements as well as to avoid reputational damage to Ireland&rsquo;s aviation sector.  Training and certification of the Defence Forces will be appropriate to the assigned aviation security tasks but will take account of the existing training and skills of Defence Force personnel.  If deployed, members of the Defence Forces will be involved in specific, non-public-facing roles, relieving DAA staff for security and screening duties in the main terminals.  In the event of significant staff shortages due to Covid-19 it is envisaged that the Defence Forces personnel could be deployed to operate the external gate posts into the security-restricted area of Dublin Airport, thereby potentially freeing up approximately 100 staff who could be deployed to the main terminals.  The exact number of Defence Force personnel who will be trained and available to undertake these roles is being finalised.  It is expected that 130 personnel will be involved.<\/p> <p>As this is purely a contingency measure, while members of the Defence Forces will be deployed, they will only be deployed to Dublin Airport if requested by the DAA and in a scenario where there is a significant deterioration in passenger queuing times, with a risk of large numbers of passengers missing their flights.<\/p> <p> Regarding longer-term security resourcing at Dublin Airport, I reassure Deputies that this emergency measure will not take away from the DAA's plans for the recruitment and training of additional security staff.  The DAA is continuing in this regard, with the expectation that optimal staffing levels will be realised by August.  The DAA has advised that, by that time, 480 new security staff will have commenced employment at the airport since October 2021.  As a precautionary measure, particularly in the context of the ongoing uncertainty regarding the impact of Covid-19 on the availability of staff, this level of resourcing includes additional staff over and above the 2019 staffing levels.  Passenger numbers at Dublin Airport are now at over 90% of the 2019 levels, and it is expected that approximately 50,000 people will travel through Dublin Airport every day during the coming peak period.  The DAA's ongoing recruitment campaign, supported by this emergency contingency measure, will ensure that passengers can travel safely through Dublin Airport over the busy summer period ahead.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070600003#A00600","speaker":"1578","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657095720,"counter":12,"content":"<p>Has the Government learned any lessons from this situation?  Does it acknowledge that it was a mistake not to oppose the DAA slashing the terms and conditions of workers, slashing the numbers of workers and using the pandemic in the way that it did?  Has the Government investigated why we have this shortage of staff?  Why is it that the DAA cannot recruit the security staff it needs?  Why does the Government think that the company will be able to have 480 new security staff in place?  From talking to workers, the answer seems to be very simple.  It will be found to be very difficult to recruit workers with a requirement for them to be available to work for up to 40 hours a week, while they may actually only get 20 hours a week at a rate of &euro;14 an hour.  It is not possible to make a life on that basis.  It will not be possible for people to commit to pay a mortgage or for childcare, and particularly so in the context of the cost-of-living crisis.  That is not an attractive prospect for workers.<\/p>  <p>  The problem with the Government&rsquo;s approach in respect of sending in the Army personnel, who are also low-paid workers, is that it is letting the DAA away with what it is doing and with not addressing the central issue here.  This is that the company used the pandemic to attack wages and conditions.  It is not now able to attract staff and will still not be able to do so unless it offers decent terms and conditions.  Will the Government be asking the DAA to ensure that people will be guaranteed 40 hours a week to enable them to build a life around that?  Will the Government be asking the DAA to restore decent pay and conditions?  Will the Government be opposing the attempts by the DAA, and we are also hearing news in this context about Aer Lingus, in respect of plans to freeze workers&rsquo; pay for five years?  Right throughout the aviation industry we have seen attempts to use the pandemic to undermine the terms and conditions of workers.  This has been negatively affecting not only the workers, but society at large, in respect of everybody who has been attempting to go on holidays, etc.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070600004#B00200","speaker":"1628"},{"type":"speech","time":1657095720,"counter":13,"content":"<p>Regarding pay and conditions, these are matters for the DAA to address directly with the trade unions.  When we look at what the CEO said to the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications several weeks ago regarding the projections concerning aviation passenger numbers, if he knew then what he knows now regarding the pickup in the numbers of passengers travelling, then he would have made different decisions.<\/p>  <p>  Additionally, since the removal of Covid-19-related travel restrictions in March 2022, there has been a significant recovery in aviation passenger numbers throughout Europe.  Between January and June 2022, passenger numbers at Dublin Airport have increased from approximately 200,000 per week to almost 650,000 per week, which represents a 220% increase in passenger traffic over five months.  As of last week, the airport has been processing almost 90% of 2019 passenger levels.  While welcome, the pace of recovery is proving to be extremely challenging operationally for the aviation industry.  Industry forecasts had predicted that this level of recovery would not occur until 2024 or 2025.  I reiterate, however, that the Government is committed to doing what is necessary to ensure that passengers' expectations are met in the coming weeks and that they do not miss flights due to security queues at Dublin Airport.<\/p>  <p>  As part of the planning of any potential deployment of the members of the Defence Forces, a service level agreement will be agreed between the Department of Defence and the DAA.  The envisaged remit of the deployment is for non-public-facing security gate duties, to free up approximately 100 existing DAA personnel for a proposed six-week timeframe.  The DAA will pay the Department of Defence the entire and related costs of this service provision, including costs for salaries, training, certification and management, as well as the costs associated with having the Defence Forces personnel on standby.  I also assure Deputies that the full details of this agreement are currently being worked out between the Department of Defence, the Defence Forces and the DAA.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070600004#B00300","speaker":"1578"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Services","time":1657095720,"counter":14,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070600004#B00400"},{"type":"speech","time":1657095720,"counter":15,"content":"<p>I thank the Ceann Comhairle and his office for selecting this matter.  I also thank the Minister of State, Deputy Feighan, for being here, but I must ask where the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, is.  Where is he and could he please come out?  He came to County Kerry like a thief in the night.  He stood in for a couple of quick pictures and then disappeared.  He did nothing for University Hospital Kerry, UHK, when he came and did nothing for it when he left.<\/p>  <p>  Why is it acceptable in Ireland that if a cow, a bullock or a dog has an injury, it can be quite safe to assume that, within two hours, a vet, a qualified person, will be giving care to that animal and providing treatment, and rightly so?  Why does it seem acceptable in the Ireland of today that older people can break hips or sustain other fractures or that children can suffer injuries and have to go to accident and emergency departments, but that they might not be seen that day, never mind within the hour?  It could be the following morning or the day after that they would be seen.  Why have we come to this state of affairs in respect of healthcare?  It is not an exaggeration to say that the family pet can get quicker and more immediate healthcare treatment than a grandparent, a mother, a father, a son or a daughter.  This is not acceptable and it is not right.<\/p>  <p>  In his absence, I would like to direct a question to the Minister for Health.  I thank the Minister of State, and I respect him very much, as he knows I do, but he will see why I am pointing out these facts.  Yesterday, the Minister was notified that University Hospital Kerry was going to be discussed on the floor of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  He failed to turn up here today to answer questions, but he has failed to turn up for that hospital since he became a Minister.  Therefore, I am not surprised that he is not here, because he is not interested in his portfolio.  He is not interested in our hospital.  He is not interested in our community hospitals.  He is not interested in the GP network that is crumbling in County Kerry because we cannot recruit staff.  I wish to raise these issues with the Minister.<\/p>  <p>  We need a recruitment drive for nurses and incentives for them to come back to work in County Kerry.  I would like to ask the Minister why it was that 16 were waiting for beds last night and why was there no capacity in the relevant department.  Why was it the case yesterday that there was no orthopaedic bed for a person who fractured his or her hip in County Kerry?  It has been proven that a direct result and consequence of prolonged trolley waits is an increase in mortality and morbidity rates, and, consequently, also longer average lengths of stay in hospital.  We need more GP access in County Kerry to try to steer people away from having to go to our accident and emergency department.  We need two new candidate advanced nurse practitioners as a matter of urgency.  We need a new acute floor model and surgical assessment system in County Kerry.  We need to advertise for two new consultant microbiologists, posts in which there seems to be no interest in at present.  What is the plan for new management in our university hospital in County Kerry if the current management regime is changing?<\/p>  <p>  Turning to our ambulance service, the men and women there provide an excellent service and do their jobs to the best of their ability, but we need more ambulances in County Kerry because of the geography and size of the county.  We seem to be relying more and more on private ambulances and taxis.  This is not the proper way to run a healthcare service.  Again, we need to incentivise the recruitment of nurses and of other staff for our hospital.  I appreciate so much the maintenance people, the catering people, the nurses on the wards and all the people who diligently go about their work.  Shame, shame, shame on the Minister for not turning up for our hospital and for not turning up here today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070600004#B00500","speaker":"1487"},{"type":"speech","time":1657095720,"counter":16,"content":"<p>Regarding personal comments and robust debate, I do not know why the Minister is not here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070600004#B00600","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1657095720,"counter":17,"content":"<p>Because he is both ashamed and a disgrace.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070600004#B00700","speaker":"1487"},{"type":"speech","time":1657095720,"counter":18,"content":"<p>I do not know why he is not here, but we will avoid personal comments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070600004#B00800","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1657095720,"counter":19,"content":"<p>Tell that to the people waiting in-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070600004#B00900","speaker":"1487"},{"type":"speech","time":1657095720,"counter":20,"content":"<p>I am sorry, we are over time.

These challenges have continued to hamper UHK&rsquo;s efforts to provide safe, timely and effective care for its patients.  At certain periods, elective surgeries have had to be cancelled, high numbers of patients have been recorded on trolleys and staff shortages have been ongoing.<\/p>  <p>  Direct action has been taken since September to address these issues.  As an immediate response, the South\/South West Hospital Group interim chief operations officer has been onsite at the hospital directly supporting management and clinicians, initially on a two days a week commitment.  This process has focused on identifying delays as well as solutions within UHK patient flow streams.  Furthermore, the HSE has confirmed that the South\/South West Hospital Group management team are also providing support to the various members of the UHK management team on an ongoing basis.  The national director for acute operations and members of the South\/South West Hospital Group management team also met with the executive management board of UHK, clinical directors, representatives of the consultant group and other key stakeholders in November 2021 in UHK to discuss the challenges facing the hospital.<\/p>  <p>  A HSE review team was established comprising members from HSE acute operations, the special delivery unit, the national integrated care programme for older persons and representatives from the South\/South West Hospital Group, and it has been asked to report on its findings.  As part of its work, the HSE review team was on site in UHK and engaged with stakeholders in the hospital.  I am pleased to confirm that the report, which is to set out the priorities and related critical dependencies, has been completed and its recommendations are being considered at a local level.<\/p>  <p>  Two further measures being undertaken by the South\/South West Hospital Group are also worth noting at this point.  First, a health planning process, which is being overseen by a steering group comprising key stakeholders, is nearing completion.  This report examines current and future infrastructural capacity requirements over the next 15 years and will align future investment with evidence of demand factors.  Second, the South\/South West Hospital Group has also engaged the expertise of an external consultancy group to assist with the development of a strategic plan.  All staff have had the opportunity to have their say and I look forward to watching these developments.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy also raised several other issues and I will bring them back directly to the Minister today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070600005#C00100","speaker":"1608"},{"type":"speech","time":1657096320,"counter":22,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.  I again ask what the Minister has done for the hospital since the day of his visit, when he came to stand for silly, stupid picture.  What actions has he taken to improve the situation for people in accident and emergency?  I will ask and ask until this stops.  Why is it acceptable for people to say to a person who has gone to accident and emergency: &ldquo;How many hours or days were you there waiting to be admitted?&rdquo;  That is wrong.  That is not the fault of the staff who work so diligently and hard, late into the night and in the early morning, and who are worn to a thread from trying their best.  Management is the problem.  HSE management is the problem.  The Minister is the problem.  If University Hospital Kerry was a private company and he was the CEO, he would have been sacked long ago and he would be gone down the road with a P45 in his pocket having been told &ldquo;We no longer require your services.&rdquo;  If you are not fit for a job, if you are not fit for purpose, you should move left and get off the stage because you are either able to do your function, you are either able to do your job, or you are not.<\/p>  <p>  Again, when the vets of County Kerry can give more direct and immediate attention to animals than we can give to people, something has to stop.  The buck stops with the Government.  It does not stop with a nurse or a doctor.  It is the people in charge.  The taxpayers of Ireland are putting so much money into the healthcare service and it is failing despite this.<\/p>  <p>  I again highlight the fact that we need to encourage more GPs into our rural communities.  We need more ambulances, more nurses, more help and we need a positive recruitment campaign.  However, if someone was a young nurse in England or Australia, when they hear what is happening in University Hospital Kerry, why would they want to come there?  How could it be attractive for them?

It was held outside the gates of the Cork University Maternity Hospital, CUMH.  I spoke to several of the fathers and mothers, and they are absolutely at a loss.  It is worth stating, and I am sure the Minister of State will understand, that these are parents who had already suffered significant pain, significant trauma and significant loss.  Some of these babies were stillborn and some died a day or two after being born due to complications.  There were various different tragedies and losses, with a very particular kind of pain for those parents.  We must add to that the sense of betrayal and hurt they felt after they discovered what happened to their babies' remains.  That is now compounded by the fact they have not been able to get answers, despite being promised this numerous times.<\/p>  <p>  This first came into the public eye in September 2021, when an &ldquo;RT&Eacute; Investigates&rdquo; programme outlined that 18 families whose babies' remains had been incinerated in Europe had been contacted by CUMH.  This had primarily happened around March and April 2020 and CUMH said it was confined to that period.  Having said that, it appears another mother has come forward to say something similar happened in 2018.<\/p>  <p>  To give an example, one family, in trying to find meaning for the loss they had suffered, had donated their baby&rsquo;s remains and organs for medical research but were to get the remains back for burial.  It was an enormous pain to them that they found out this had not happened and that their baby&rsquo;s remains had been incinerated.<\/p> <p>In all instances, the parents understood that the protocol that should have been in place was that they were to be contacted to give consent.  We have also found out in the past week that this has potentially happened in other locations, such as the maternity hospital at University Hospital Limerick.<\/p> <p> The report was first promised in November.  Then it was promised in the spring and now we are not sure when the parents will get it.  These parents deserve answers.  It is two years since this happened.  It is nine months since the report was first due to come out.  When will the parents get the report?  When will they have answers?  At present, they have no sense when the report will be published.  Surely the minimum they deserve is to know why this happened, to have it ensured it will never happen again and to get the truth.  There should be accountability for what happened to them and the trauma they suffered on top of the trauma of pregnancy loss and the loss of their babies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070600005#C00400","speaker":"1460","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657096920,"counter":27,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this very difficult issue, which has been the subject of much discussion in the House.

Today is another day we discuss policy that deeply affects their lives.  There are few groups in society whose opportunities and quality of life is so profoundly shaped by the Government.  Decisions voted on in this House can provide or restrict healthcare, facilitate or deny employment and assign payments that keep people in poverty or allow them to live with dignity.  Even more significant is the fact that individuals and cohorts most impacted have the least say.<\/p><p>We try to do things differently in the Social Democrats.  Our motion is based on engagement with the Oireachtas disability group, which has helped us understand the specific and large policy context.  Disabled people, their representative organisations and advocates are the experts.  At all stages, our decisions on disability matters should be guided by them.  I hope this motion shows to those in the Gallery and watching online that the Social Democrats are serious about evidence-based policy directly informed by the lived experience of those affected by those policies.<\/p><p>Today we are going to talk about different statistics.  Each of these is necessary and important but we must remember there are individuals, groups and families behind these figures.  Each number hides the lived experience of almost 750,000 people, not to mind their families, partners, carers and communities.  This morning's discussion will highlight that disabled people are three times more likely to live in consistent poverty, that Ireland has the lowest employment rate for disabled people in the EU at 32% and that families have to fundraise for basic equipment and vehicle adaptions the State should be providing.<\/p><p>Statistics and examples only hint at the lived experience of a person being denied the right to full participation in society.  Numbers do not represent the stories of capable, complex humans who want to contribute to society and who want to live independent lives.  They do not relate the stories of parents who have had to fight for every basic State service from the moment their child was born.  Each one of these cases is about rights.  Appropriate payments, healthcare, education, housing and employment opportunities are not optional.  They are not charity.  They are the basics each person is entitled to.<\/p><p>The United Nations Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities, UNCRPD, guarantees the right to equal treatment, access to services and to participate in decision making.  Every week at the disability matters committee, the Oireachtas committee that oversees the implementation of the UNCRPD, we hear about how the State is failing to meet its obligations.  Nearly one in four people did not use the personal assistance public service as it was not available or suitable.  The most recent figures I received from the HSE indicate that more than 1,700 children were overdue an assessment of need, itself a system that has been thrown further into further disarray after the recent High Court ruling on its inadequacies.  More than 1,300 people under 65 years are living in nursing homes because of a lack of suitable supported housing.<\/p><p>Crucially, this is not just about a breach of rights and these examples are part of a system that creates disability.  Our understanding of the UNCRPD is through a social model lens that shows us how people are disabled by barriers in society, not by their capacities or differences.  An extreme lack of accessible toilets and changing places restricts people from being able to socialise and leave home and an absence of flexible work arrangements prevents people from entering employment, with vastly insufficient social protection payments trapping people in poverty and worsening conditions.  Until Ministers, Departments and State bodies demonstrate that they understand what a rights-based approach and the social model is, these fundamental issues will continue, creating and compounding disability.<\/p><p>Disabled persons' organisations, advocacy and support organisations, and local campaign groups, such as West Cork Special School, Families Unite for Special Services, FUSS, and the Parents Cork Advocacy Network help illustrate state failures.  They reveal the daily breaching of rights and predominance of the medicalised model of disability in public bodies and paternalistic treatment of disabled people.<\/p><p>Significantly, the scale of the issues are catalogued by two Government reports.  The first is the disability capacity review, published just under a year ago, which quantifies the current and future need for disability support services.  One of the key issues highlighted is:<\/p> <blockquote> \tsignificant levels of unmet need for disability services, and that changes in the size and age profile of the disability service population will add to unmet need over the coming decade.  Addressing demographic change alone would not be sufficient, as the current level of unmet need is not sustainable. <\/blockquote>  <p>There is a need to spend between &euro;550 million to &euro;1 billion extra each year to meet the needs of the growing and aging population between now and 2032.  This funding is needed for residential services and supported housing, adult day programmes, multidisciplinary therapy services, personal assistance and respite.  The disability capacity review outlines the position and it is up to the Government to respond quickly and sufficiently.  Unfortunately, despite this report being published almost 12 months ago and being with the Department of Health for substantial time before then, there is no clear plan.<\/p><p>On 5 April, the Minister for Health informed the D&aacute;il that a working group, tasked with developing an action plan for the period 2022 to 2025, had completed its work.  Nearly three months later, that action plan has not yet been published.  Where is the plan?  Where is the urgency to meet current unmet need not to mind future need?  Our motion is calling for the immediate publishing of this plan, which must be supported by adequate resourcing and a commitment to implementation.<\/p><p>It is not just a matter of funding announcements.  There is a massive gap between Government press releases and services on the ground.  Recent cases of eating disorder treatment funding and other mental health programmes show us that funding can be reassigned and unspent.  There is ambiguity around how HSE budgets are allocated and spent.  For example, I and many other Deputies deal with cases where individuals are granted home support hours but only get a fraction of what they should.  There is also the question of staffing.  No service can happen without staff, including doctors, nurses, therapists, clinicians and management and support staff.  Children's disability network team places are unfilled.  Our motion has to specifically ask for a plan to fill the 732 vacant posts for therapists providing services for children with disabilities.<\/p><p>It is important to say that the failure of progressing disability services is not a representation of the amazing staff working in these teams; we simply need more of them.  There is a pressing need to address retention and recruitment.  Excellent people who want to help people and who chose a caring profession are leaving because of the poor conditions, low pay and plummeting morale.  Students in healthcare, especially nursing and therapies, receive little to no remuneration and their first experience of working in the Irish health service is off-putting straight away.  We also must have greater recognition and support for the role of healthcare assistants.  Any action plan in response to the disability capacity review must include a comprehensive strategy and accompanying packages to recruit and retain staff.<\/p><p>The second key Government document is the Cost of Disability in Ireland report, published in December and only after considerable pressure from disability organisations and Opposition parties.<\/p> <p>It found that actual costs faced by individuals ranged between &euro;8,700 and &euro;12,300 every year.  This is worth repeating.  It can cost more than &euro;12,000 annually to have a disability in Ireland.  Combine that with systemic underemployment of disabled people and the massive unmet needs in care, and it is no wonder we have disgracefully high rates of consistent poverty and social isolation among disabled people.<\/p> <p> The Cost of Disability in Ireland report, written before the cost-of-living crisis, stated that households, including a member with a disability spent over 8% more on food and almost 10% more on fuel and electricity.  This has been exacerbated by skyrocketing energy and food prices.  Disabled people are among those who most acutely experience the cost-of-living crisis.  This is not to take away for one second from the challenges and sacrifices of other families, but we know that households with a disabled member are feeling this much more.  There is a glaring need for an action plan to address this crisis.  After working with the Oireachtas disability group and looking at all the information available to us, we are pushing for an effective comprehensive course of action today.  Money needs to be put into the pockets of people with disabilities.  The Government must introduce a cost of disability payment in budget 2023 of at least &euro;20 per week as well as an increase in the disability allowance of at least &euro;15 per week.  For a more long-term response, we want an action plan on the cost of disability report that outlines increased social protection and health payments, and introduces tax breaks for disabled individuals and their families.  We also need the promised action plan to implement the disability capacity review to provide the public services required to help people live full independent lives. <\/p> <p> We know what needs to be done.  We are calling on the Government to bring in the necessary short-term and long-term changes to help people exercise their rights and live with dignity. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070600008#F00200","speaker":"1525","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657098720,"counter":40,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Cairns for bringing forward this motion and acknowledge those in the Visitors Gallery who have travelled here today to stand once again for their basic rights.  In particular I acknowledge my friend, Emilie Conway, from the Disabled Artists &amp;amp; Disabled Academics Group and her colleague, Jackie Conboy, who for the second week have come to the D&aacute;il to demand basic service provision and respect.  One in seven people in this country has a disability.  That is 13.5% of our overall population.  All of us will have a family member or friend with a disability.  It is a very normal part of the human condition.  It can be challenging at times, for sure, but disability can and should be celebrated too.  In that vein, July is one of those times and I take a moment to wish everyone in this community a happy Disability Pride Month.<\/p>  <p>  Disability in all its forms and inflections should unite us in common solidarity, yet people with disabilities continue to battle shame, stigma, discrimination and equality that is forced on them by an uncaring State.  The pace of change is far too slow as a result of systematic failure and successive Governments choosing not to prioritise people with disabilities and their families.  We have a real way to go before people will be able to access and participate fully in all aspects of our society.  A good start would be supporting and acting on our motion today, which calls for the urgent establishment of a universal cost of disability payment.  This would constitute a step in the right direction, acknowledging what people with a disability have been telling us for many years, that they are living in crisis and need action now.  Let us be very clear that a payment would only begin to acknowledge this extra cost of disability.  It is not charity.  It is not because we feel sorry for people with disabilities and their families.  The extra costs simply would not exist if our world was more accessible. <\/p>  <p>  We stand with people with disabilities and demand that all barriers be broken down.  There is much work to do if we are to reimagine and redesign a more equal and inclusive society.  A cost of disability payment would be a very strong start in that regard.  Our vision and hope in bringing forward this motion today is that this payment would be expanded and improved significantly over time.  The programme for Government acknowledges the extra costs that are an issue.  The Department of Social Protection commissioned a comprehensive Cost of Disability in Ireland report, which was published last December.  It provides a very detailed yet stark picture of the challenges and struggles of day-to-day life for people with a disability and their families.  Disabled people are more likely to be living in poverty and to be unemployed.  The extra cost of disability can range between &euro;167 and &euro;237 every week.  This does not add up.  It is not sustainable for any household.  It is shameful that more is not being done urgently to address this gaping inequality.  The people with disabilities community have spoken about this issue for years.<\/p>  <p>  Members will have read the European Disability Forum report from 2020 that examined the extent of poverty and social exclusion among disabled people.  It looked at European countries and it will come as no surprise that Ireland did not score very well at all but was fifth worst on the list.  It found that almost 40% of people with a disability in Ireland are at risk of poverty and social exclusion.  That is a massive number by any standard and indicates that disability becomes the basis of a person's poverty.  The report also tells us that during austerity times our disability community suffered more than most.  It was and remains incredibly difficult to access appropriate housing suitable to their needs.  They lost jobs and educational opportunities, like so many others.  They felt the brunt again when public services were slashed, healthcare and transport to name but a few.  They experienced direct cuts to disability supports and payments and, while the economy recovered for many over the intervening years, people with disabilities remain in a crisis situation as the report states.  That is why the Visitors Gallery is full today.<\/p>  <p>  Already on the back foot, since 2020 the community has faced the chaos of a global pandemic, the war in Ukraine, inflationary pressures and a cost-of-living crisis that by any standard is raging out of control.  All of these additional stresses have imposed unprecedented and impossible challenges on a community that has absolutely no more to give.  The Minister of State must see that this issue needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency.  However, that does not appear to be the case.  The Minister for Social Protection was asked in February of this year for an update on progressing action on the cost of disability report.  The response was that the findings will inform the direction of future policy.  The same wording is in the programme for Government.  Like the programme for Government, there was no timeline given, no budget, commitments or promises, just the statement that a whole-of-government approach is required.  We understand the words are there but not the actions to go with them.  Given the seriousness of the report, the Minister's response at the time was insulting to those who are barely keeping their heads above water.  People with disabilities are drowning.  We know why they are drowning and they are going to be the ones who drown first but there does not seem to be any urgency.  Why is no one listening to the lived experience of people with disabilities, their families, the disabled persons organisations, DPOs, the NGOs, the academics and other experts?  The Minister of State should make no mistake that doing nothing is a policy choice and everyone can see it is the one that has been made.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070600009#G00200","speaker":"1560"},{"type":"speech","time":1657098720,"counter":41,"content":"<p>I acknowledge our guests in the Visitors Gallery this morning.  We know that a cost of disability payment is not a new concept.  To achieve equality for people with disabilities, it is fundamental that the additional costs that come with disability are not paid by them alone.  It is the responsibility of the State to cover those additional costs.  The payment was originally recommended in 1996 and again in 2004, that is 26 years.  It is a lot of Governments and a lot of time in which action has not been taken.  The Cost of Disability report published last December revealed the amount that is required.  It also found that meeting these higher costs is particularly difficult for the 152,000 people dependent on the disability allowance of &euro;203 per week.  The way in which social welfare payments are currently allocated is also a complete barrier to employment and financial independence.  Supports such as disability allowance, invalidity pension, and the blind pension are reduced as soon as the person in question earns more than &euro;140 a week, and for some that would also mean the loss of a medical card.  That has to be looked at and changes have to be made.  The more they earn, the more they lose.<\/p>  <p>  The disability capacity review was published in July 2021 and is still awaiting an action plan.  These reviews provide valuable information but without an action plan, nothing will change.  It is past time for change.  There has been a historical underspend in disability support services.  We know that services are fragmented, there is a postcode lottery.  We know all of that.  There is a major job that needs to happen.  All future investment into disability support services needs to be personalised and person-centred in line with the UNCRPD.  It is a badly needed and massive increase in expenditure and it will not be achieved without a roadmap.  Can the Minister of State be clear with us today on when exactly this action plan will be published?<\/p> <p>We need to see action this year.  Last year, people were disappointed because the plan was revealed but there was nothing in the budget.  We need to see action in the budget this year.<\/p> <p> I acknowledge the section 38 employees who are out on strike today.  There is an issue there that must be addressed.  On services, we know from dealing with people just how threadbare are the services.  One ends up with emergency responses rather than a planned system.  Emergency responses can be more expensive and chaotic.  We cannot keep going on in that way.  We need action on those two plans.  We need to see action in the budget this year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070600009#G00300","speaker":"1489","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657099320,"counter":43,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to address the House on the important matter of the cost of disability.  I, along with my colleague the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, welcome all those who have travelled here this morning.  They had an early start.<\/p>  <p>  At the outset, it is important to state that this issue spans government and several Departments.  Several Departments have contributed to the Government response to the motion and that is indicative of the breadth of cross-departmental working involved in addressing this issue.  As Minister of State with responsibility for mental health and older people, I am acutely aware of these challenges across my brief.  One of the things we learned very quickly in the context of our new policy for mental health, Sharing the Vision, is that responsibility for people with mental health difficulties, in the same way as that for people with disabilities, does not only lie with the Department of Health.  It is important that we have input from the Departments of Social Protection, Housing, Local Government and Heritage, and Education.  It lies across all the different briefs.  It does not only rest with the Department of Health, although a significant part of it does.  We certainly need that cross-departmental support for people, whether that is in the context of disability or mental health.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to state that the Government is committed to informing future policy on disability through research such as that on the cost of disability, which touches on many aspects of the life of persons with a disability and the lives of their families.  That was mentioned earlier.  This is why a whole-of-government approach is required.  It is why the cost of disability in Ireland research report was commissioned and published by the Government in December 2021.  The report provides important and much-needed research that enables a better understanding of the extent and composition of these costs, and the ways in which they affect disabled people.  The cost of disability report, prepared by Indecon international research economists, identified that additional costs of disability run across a number of areas of public expenditure.  Those costs includes housing, equipment, aids and appliances, care and assistance services, mobility, transport, communications, medicines and additional living expenses.  Furthermore, Indecon found that there is not a single typical cost of disability.  Rather, there is a spectrum from low to high additional costs of disability, depending on individual circumstances.  The analysis showed that, on average, the costs faced by individuals with profound disabilities range from &euro;9,600 to &euro;12,300 per annum, while for those with limited disabilities they range from &euro;8,700 to &euro;10,000 per annum.  Although some of the costs reported through the survey are already met by the State, further improvements cannot be delivered through income supports alone.  Indecon identified that solutions will require a multifaceted and broader perspective, covering areas such as housing, transport, education and health.<\/p>  <p>  As the findings of the research have implications for many areas of public policy, a whole-of-government perspective is needed to address the cost of disability.  That is why the Government referred the report to the national disability inclusion strategy steering group chaired by my colleague, the Minister of State with responsibility for disability, Deputy Rabbitte.  The group comprises relevant Departments and agencies, a disability stakeholder group and disabled people themselves.  It will consider and monitor recommended actions required by the various Departments on a biannual basis.  In light of these findings, I can confirm to the House that all options will be explored during the preparation of budget 2023 measures.<\/p>  <p>  Another of the conclusions reached by Indecon is that any additional supports should be targeted at those who are most in need and face the greatest additional costs of disability.  Given this conclusion, and in line with the Government's roadmap for social inclusion and the Pathways to Work strategy, the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Humphreys, and her Department have committed to developing and consulting on a strawman proposal for the restructuring of long-term disability payments.  The main objective is to simplify the system, remove anomalies, take account of the continuum of disability and support employment.  A public consultation on the strawman will commence at the end of this year or early in 2023.<\/p>  <p>  In July 2021, the disability capacity review to 2032 was published by the Government.  This report outlines how levels of service provision will have to be increased to meet growing demand into the future, as well as the necessity to address levels of unmet need that currently exist.  It contains invaluable data that shine a light on the level of need for disability services which we, as a country, have a duty to address.  It allows us to plan for increased capacity in our services and ensure that we meet the needs of those requiring specialist disability supports and services now and into the future.  In the programme for Government, we committed to working towards the recommendations of the capacity review as its findings are simply too urgent.  That is why we published the framework action plan alongside the capacity review and established an interdepartmental working group to develop a detailed action plan to put the capacity review findings into practice.  This working group comprised senior officials from the Health Service Executive, the Department of Health, the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, the Department of Social Protection, the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.<\/p>  <p>  As I said, the cross-government approach to this work is, and was, key.  Ensuring appropriate supports and services for our citizens with disabilities is not simply a health matter, but one that reaches across the whole of government, ensuring that the totality of the individual is taken into account.  It is also key that we listen to the voices of those directly affected, namely, those who use disability services and their families and carers.  That is an important point.  In order to achieve this, an extensive consultation was undertaken which attracted participation from almost 800 people, including people with disabilities, their families and carers, people who work in disability services, and umbrella and representative organisations.  This information was then fed into the working group in order to inform its work on the action plan.  The feedback received from the consultation was invaluable and I wish to take this opportunity to thank of all those who contributed their time and effort and helped make this such a collaborative piece of work.  The working group has now concluded its work and the action plan is currently being progressed through the appropriate channels in the Department of Health for finalisation.  The Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, will be in a position to publish it and begin acting on its recommendations in the near future.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to pick up on a couple of points raised by Deputy Cairns.  She is totally right in respect of home care and how important it is to older people and people with disabilities.  I currently have a budget of &euro;672 million to deliver home care supports.  Unfortunately, there are challenges.  Some 55,000 people receive home care daily, but there are 5,000 other people waiting.  Their package is funded but we do not have the staff to deliver it.  In that regard, I put in place a strategic workforce planning group that made interim recommendations to me last week.  I will be in a position to publish that document very soon.  It addresses different measures we will take to try to support more people to move into home care and to see it as an attractive career choice.  I am working closely with the office of the T&aacute;naiste, as well as the Minister of State, Deputy English, to consider whether it is possible to allow permits be issued to people living outside the EU to come to Ireland to deliver home care.  That is already being done in the context of nursing homes.  The problem is that 75% of those who work in home care do so part time.  In order to meet the conditions of the permit, the employer would have to guarantee a minimum working salary of &euro;27,000 per year and also guarantee two years of work.  I am anxious to progress this, even as a pilot programme, to see whether it is worthwhile.  We are moving on that at the moment.<\/p> <p>I will be bringing forward a Bill on standards in home care, regardless of whether they are delivered through public, private or voluntary means, fairly soon in quarter three and coming into quarter four.  I look forward to the support of the House on that matter.  <\/p> <p> We had a very good debate two weeks ago in the D&aacute;il on respite care and older people.  I know the Leas-Cheann Comhairle will be interested in this.  I have undertaken a review of the number of respite beds across all nine community healthcare organisations, CHOs, to see where we are.  Not all of them have reopened since Covid and I am very anxious to get all that up and running to support older people, people with disabilities and their carers.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070600010#H00200","speaker":"1614","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657099920,"counter":45,"content":"<p>I welcome the motion and thank my colleague, Deputy Cairns, for bringing it forward.  I welcome everyone watching today in the Gallery and elsewhere.  This is a very important motion highlighting the huge inequalities, injustices and exclusion faced by people with disabilities.  All of us as Deputies are hugely aware of the impact of this on people with disabilities.  We hear from people with disabilities and parents of children with disabilities all the time who have been let down badly.  We hear about children waiting for assessments for years before they can get any supports, children who when they finally get their assessments get minimal levels of support, parents who cannot afford to get private support for their children being woefully left behind and parents being left in the dark and not getting the information they need to support their children.  All too often, we hear from families trying their best to support their family members with disabilities who face other challenges.  I was contacted recently, for example, by a parent who is struggling to get supports for her child and who is living in a single room in her mother's house with her partner and two children because they cannot afford to rent privately at the moment.<\/p><p>As the Social Democrats' housing spokesperson, I will focus on the impact of the lack of proper financial supports for people with disabilities on housing.  Deputy Cairns referenced earlier the excellent report by the Ombudsman, Wasted Lives:Time for a better future for younger people in Nursing Homes, which found that more than 1,300 people with disabilities aged under 65 are living in nursing homes that are completely inappropriate for their needs.  One of the key findings of the report was that personal finance was one of the key issues facing people with disabilities living in nursing homes.  The report said that disposable income of people with disabilities fell by 7.4% between 2010 and 2015, a drop of more than &euro;1,000.  I will list a few examples from that report regarding how this directly affects people.  The report states:<\/p> <blockquote> \tCharles is a 53 year old man with a progressive neurological condition.  He has been in a nursing home for just under two years.  Prior to this, he was living in council accommodation.  Because he is unhappy in the nursing home, he continues to pay rent for his council accommodation, even though it is not wheelchair accessible. <\/blockquote>  <p>It goes on to state, &quot;He says that he has very little disposable income and his parents assist him with expenses such as clothing&quot;.  This is a 53-year-old man.<\/p><p>The report goes on to highlight the case of Liam, a 52 year old man with a rare progressive neurological condition.  It states:<\/p> <blockquote> \tLiam had been attending swimming outside the nursing home and he enjoyed this but he said that he had to pay for the swimming pool and for transport to and from the pool.  He stopped going as he felt that he could not afford this.  His activities are now very limited. <\/blockquote>  <p>The report continued with the example of Rose, a 52-year-old woman with a brain injury.  The report stated: <\/p> <blockquote> \tWhen my Office visited Rose, she was visibly in a lot of pain and she said that she had hurt her lower back.  Her advocate was present and suggested that she attend the Accident and Emergency Department.  She said that she could not afford this.  The nursing home had assessed her and told her that she would need to be accompanied by an escort if she left the nursing home, due to difficulties with her mobility.  The nursing home charged &euro;23 per hour for this escort [which she could not afford]. <\/blockquote>  <p>Another example in the report is the case of Leah, a 49-year-old woman with multiple complex diagnoses including physical disability, intellectual disability and cancer.  The report states:<\/p> <blockquote> \tHer wheelchair is too big for wheelchair taxis and so she needs a minibus to get to hospital appointments.  This costs &euro;300 or &euro;500 per trip, depending on where her appointment is. ... Leah's mother advised my Office that she had to subsidise Leah but this was difficult as she was in receipt of an old age pension ... Leah is [therefore] restricted to her room. <\/blockquote>  <p>That is the lived reality of some people with disabilities in nursing homes who should not be there.  One person was paying their rent to the council for social housing they could not physically access.  Another person who was in pain and needed medical care was unable to access that because of transport costs.  <\/p><p>Yesterday, the T&aacute;naiste said that there should not be time in the D&aacute;il to discuss motions like this.  That is what he said.  I want to say in the strongest possible terms that these motions are needed.  We do need time in the D&aacute;il to discuss these issues and highlight this.  We need action from Government on this because it is just not acceptable in a modern republic that people with disabilities who need medical treatment cannot afford to get it and that a person had to stop the one activity he was enjoying, namely, going swimming, because he was not getting sufficient financial support for that.  That is not acceptable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070600011#J00200","speaker":"1550"},{"type":"speech","time":1657099920,"counter":46,"content":"<p>I also thank Deputy Cairns for bringing forward this motion and welcome all those in the Gallery and those looking in today.  We have all heard the saying that a disability does not disable someone; society disables people.  It is an important point to acknowledge today because it is clear that the skyrocketing cost of living everyone is seeing at the moment is making life very difficult, particularly for people with disabilities.  We want the Government to step in and support those people.  Disabled people are among those who experience the cost of living crisis most acutely.  The cost of disability in Ireland report published on 7 December 2021 found that the additional cost of disability ranges from &euro;8,700 to &euro;12,300 per annum.  As a result of this cost, the gap is widening between the standard of living a disabled person will experience compared to that of someone without a disability.<\/p>  <p>  Over the past number of months, the Social Democrats have raised the cost of cancer, back-to-school costs and the rising cost of living in many of our D&aacute;il contributions.  People across Ireland are all experiencing financial hardship but the added cost of disability on top of this really makes this struggle very deep to the point of impossibility for many.  <\/p>  <p>  In ratifying the UNCRPD, Ireland committed to providing the highest attainable standard of healthcare for people with disabilities and comprehensive housing and rehabilitation services to enable disabled people attain or regain maximum independence.  The living experience of any single person with a disability in Ireland, however, shows that we are very far from attaining that vision.  <\/p>  <p>  I want to discuss the cost of disability in the context of our substandard healthcare service and how this takes away from the maximum independence we have committed to attaining for disabled people.  I have worked with a number of constituents in Wicklow who are struggling to get the basics, that is, new wheelchairs when their existing ones are broken down.  The system in the HSE for getting a replacement wheelchair is long and arduous meaning those waiting are less independent and more isolated from society.  Only this week, I received a letter from a local man who is a wheelchair user.  He has been waiting over five months to hear back from the HSE about a new wheelchair as his current one is broken.  He says he no longer feels safe when using his wheelchair and told me \"this wheelchair may not mean much to you\" - meaning the HSE - \"but it is my freedom, my way of getting into the community.  It is my legs.\"  I also want to mention Leo Dixon, a brave and inspiring young boy from Arklow who was forced to travel to Leinster House with his family to ask for a wheelchair.  I find it very hard that we are forcing people whose focus should be primarily on their families and looking after each other to come to the D&aacute;il to ask for basic services.  We need to move away from that and the investment needs to be there to ensure they do not have to do that because there are many stories likes that of Leo Dixon and the man I mentioned.  It is happening all across the country because the Government has failed to put in the systems to make sure that costly equipment like wheelchairs is provided in a timely way in order that people can get on with their lives.  We need to radically improve health and care services for people with disabilities in this country.  <\/p>  <p>  In terms of implementing disability policy, the Government is incredibly slow to ensure that the rights of disabled people are vindicated.  Just drafting disability legislation or policy or signing up to a UN convention is not enough.  We need State-backed resources to ensure these policies are implemented.  Disability organisations, including Sunbeam House in Wicklow, are expressing their deep concern at the pace of planning for the implementation of the disability capacity review to 2032.  <\/p> <p>This plan was due to be completed in December 2021.  No publication is in sight, despite the budgetary process being under way.   An action plan is urgently needed to make sure that the important recommendations in the review are carried out.<\/p> <p> The action plan to implement the cost of disability report still has not been published.  Furthermore, Ireland still has not signed up to the optional protocol, which would enable further accountability of the Government on disability rights on services.  Now is the time for a clear commitment and a roadmap by the Government on the publication, implementation and resourcing of these crucial policies.<\/p> <p> I also want to briefly mention, as spokesperson for climate action, that as we start moving towards a zero-carbon society, we need to make sure that those who are least able to make those the actions that we require are supported.  That includes people with disabilities.  I have mentioned this to the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications.  Policies and legislation need to be done in conjunction with people with disabilities and with those who have lived experiences in order that the policies can best reflect what they need. <\/p> <p> I hope that the Government can speak to all those who are attending the Gallery today and that it has something concrete and tangible to contribute.  We are asking for action in this area.  I want to acknowledge the hard work that has been done by many disability activists who have been campaigning for an equal footing and for an equal standard of living, to which they are entitled.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070600011#J00300","speaker":"1627","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657100520,"counter":48,"content":"<p>I also wish to acknowledge the people in the Gallery and pay tribute to the work they do in advocating for equality and inclusion.  I thank the Social Democrats for tabling this motion and for providing the opportunity to speak on the challenges that disabled people face with additional cost of disability and the level of unmet need.<\/p>  <p>  The Indecon cost of disability report confirmed what was widely known but frequently not acknowledged, namely, that there is a significant additional cost to disability.  This is the extra spending that a disabled person faces in dealing with day-to-day life that non-disabled people do not, in order to achieve the same standard of living.  The cost of disability report states that the average additional cost of disability for a person with a disability, depending on its severity, is anywhere from &euro;8,700 to &euro;12,300 per annum.<\/p>  <p>  Currently, the rate of poverty and social exclusion for disabled people in Ireland is one of the highest in the EU.  We also have the lowest employment rate of persons with disabilities in the EU.  Why is this the case?  It is because disabled people fear the loss of, or severe reduction in, their core payments and secondary benefits if they take up employment.  The loss of the medical card is especially worrying for disabled people.  This is a disincentive to work.  It keeps disabled people in a poverty trap.<\/p>  <p>  One woman who came into my constituency office this week said that she had been told by the Department of Social Protection that she would not lose her reduced disability payment if she returned to work for one or two days per week.  Guess what?  She lost it.  She ended up receiving the same income from work as she lost from the social protection payment.  Yet, she had the extra cost of transport to get to work.  There is therefore no incentive to work.  <\/p>  <p>  Disabled entrepreneurs and disabled artists are particularly discriminated against, because the entitlements to employ a disabled person are not afforded to the self-employed to employ themselves.  They deal with the loss of payments on a continual basis.  There needs to be a cost of disability payment immediately.<\/p>  <p>  A year ago I, and indeed others, called for the publication of the capacity review.  We all welcomed it when it was published.  This identified the scale of unmet need, which is significant.  We were informed in April 2022 that an action plan for implementation was being finalised.  We are now three months on and there is no sign of this action plan.<\/p>  <p>  The United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities was ratified in this country in 2018.  This underpins the rights that individuals should expect to have realised, irrespective of the nature or the complexity of their disability.  However, children are not being supported, whether this is through primary care or the children&rsquo;s disability network teams.  There is an insufficient number of places for children with additional needs in our schools and, in particular, for autistic children.  The right to live independently with the choice of where and who to live with is extremely important.  It is underpinned within the UNCRPD.  However, thousands of people are still living in congregated settings, despite a Government commitment to transfer all of those people into accommodation within the community.  Approximately 1,300 people under the age of 65 are living in nursing homes.  The practice of putting people into nursing homes continues.  In addition, there is an unquantifiable number of adults living with aged parents in the family home.  They have no choice but to remain there.  Many of these adults have been on social housing lists for perhaps ten to 15 years.  They have no prospect of being housed any time soon.  The parents are anxious from the time the child is born until they are in their 80s or 90s about what will happen to their son or daughter when they pass.  This is because proper provision has not been made for the person to live independently and to be supported in their community, as is their wish and their right.<\/p>  <p>  I know of one woman whose daughter was in her 40s.  She had complex needs.  She was on the social housing list for years.  When her mother became ill and ended up in hospital, she spent her time doing the lottery.  She was hoping against hope that a win would mean she could provide for her daughter after her day.  Suitable accommodation is not provided when the disabled person is young.  Instead, it is left to this emergency situation, when the person is trying to deal with the grief of the loss of a parent, as well as coping with moving into an unfamiliar setting. <\/p>  <p>  A number of issues require addressing immediately.  One of them is workforce planning, because the level of recruitment and retention within disability services is dismal.  There is an urgent need for pay parity within section 39 organisations.  There has to be cross-departmental co-operation between Departments, but particularly between local authorities and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, with the Department of Health and the HSE, to provide suitable accommodation for disabled people who wish to live independently.  Personal assistance service needs to be made statutory and needs to be properly funded.  <\/p>  <p>  I have limited time to speak on these issues.  I feel that I am not doing the people affected by this issues justice, because I could speak for hours about any one of them.  Yet, words are not important; action is needed here.  I fully support the motion but we need action on these issues.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070600012#K00200","speaker":"1513"},{"type":"speech","time":1657100520,"counter":49,"content":"<p>If ever there was a case which showed that the two-tier system of providing healthcare in Ireland, as well as the lack of Government dealing with an issue, it is the case of Alexis O&rsquo;Mahony, who is a six-year-old girl living in Killarney.  She has a pyruvate dehydrogenase, PDH, deficiency.  She has a brain injury.  She has cerebral palsy quadriplegia.  She has visual impairment, the subluxation of her hip and a high risk of aspiration.  Her family applied for a grant from the local authority.  They were told that because of a Government decision a number of years ago, the local authority can fund the structural works in the rafters but cannot fund the equipment for a ceiling track hoist in order that she can be lifted.  She needs daily washing and turning to avoid her getting bedsores.  This is taking a massive physical toll on her family.  In April 2021, they asked about this and were told that negotiations are ongoing between the Department of Health and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  They asked again in July and got the same answer.  They asked again in October and got the same answer.<\/p>  <p>  In May of this year, we submitted a parliamentary question, to which I have the reply to hand on my phone.  It starts off by saying that the HSE and the Government are committed to providing disability services.  It concludes by saying that they will reply directly as soon as possible on whether she can be helped.  There is still no reply.  There has been no decision.  Somebody needs to grasp the nettle on this.  Negotiations are ongoing between various Departments.  In the meantime, her family have to lift her and turn her five, six or seven times per day. <\/p>  <p>  I commend the Social Democrats on tabling the motion to allow us to put extra pressure on the Government in this regard.  This is an issue whereby people who are not directly affected and who can afford the extra &euro;8,700 per year, as stated in the motion, come to my office and tell me that while they can afford it, an awful lot of people cannot and they would like to advocate on their behalf.  This is therefore an issue whereby people are so upset by the lack of the development and the lack of services being provided to other people that they come to us to ask if we can help to sort them out.  The case of Alexis O&rsquo;Mahony shows that nothing is being done about it. <\/p>  <p>  I note that the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, states that lone parents who cannot afford it, and working-age adults with disability have higher rates of poverty, deprivation and consistent poverty.  They are more likely to have urgent housing needs.  They are more likely to have intensive healthcare treatments and because of those costs they are falling behind.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070600012#K00300","speaker":"1488"},{"type":"speech","time":1657100520,"counter":50,"content":"<p>I too commend Deputy Cairns and the Social Democrats on tabling this motion.<\/p>  <p>  The latest data we have from the survey on income and living conditions were published in May.  While the Minister of State was quick to welcome the reductions nationally across the rates for the key social inclusion indicators, those same data alarmingly show increases across the board for people with longstanding health issues, as the Central Statistics Office, CSO, calls it.  The figures relating to who is at risk of poverty are up to 39%.  The deprivation rate is up to 39.6%.  The rate of consistent poverty was up to 19.2%.<\/p> <p>Almost one fifth of people in Ireland today with a disability live in consistent poverty in one of the richest countries on the globe.  That is a shameful reality in this day and age.  It is more shameful that the income supports on which these individuals rely are set well below the poverty line.  As was mentioned already this morning, the low levels of employment are typically due to the simple fact that there is a real fear about losing those income supports and, in particular, losing the medical card<\/p> <p> We got an insight into that last week when disabled artists and academics presented to us in the audiovisual room.  They are afraid to display their talents and gifts for fear of losing their income supports.  If they win money in prizes or bursaries, it impacts their disability allowance.  All work and income from that work hugely impacts people when it comes to the disability allowance as regards holding on to the medical card, to give one example.  If someone with a disability is offered more hours or a promotion at work, that person actually has to step back and think about whether he or she can take that promotion.  People could be doing really well at work but must ask themselves whether they can take it because they will lose their additional supports.  That is not a position into which anyone should ever be put.<\/p> <p> The cost of disability in Ireland report is really important.  It was published seven months ago and we still have not seen that implementation plan. Of course, this is not the first cost of disability plan to be published.  Indecon published one 18 years ago.  There was one published 36 years ago in 1986.  This upcoming budget cannot leave out the cost of disability payment and a recognition of that.  I welcome what was said about restructuring the long-term disability payments.

The Opposition is united on this issue.  However, here we are again having a debate on another motion.  What the people in the Gallery demand and need today is to see the urgent action that is required to help people with disabilities to have a better quality of life.<\/p>  <p>  As was said already, the average cost for a person living with a disability is between &euro;9,000 and &euro;12,500 per year.  This is just the average cost.  Some people are paying much more.  Currently, the rate of poverty and social exclusion for people with disabilities in Ireland is one of the highest in the EU.  We also have one of the lowest employment rates for people with disabilities in the EU.  Institutionalised barriers to education have resulted in disproportionately lower academic attainment for people with disabilities.<\/p>  <p>  I speak as person who is living with a disability.  The Minister of State and I had this conversation previously.  I can testify that I have had to face many of these barriers to get the basic services and supports I need just so I can get on with my life and have an improved quality of life.<\/p>  <p>  The marginal increases that were introduced in the budget in 2022 for disabled people have been wiped out by inflation.  Additional expenses to living with a disability are not recognised by the State, which means that people with disabilities are often caught in a poverty trap.  The lack of public services for children with disabilities is also pushing people into poverty.  In my area, for example, as the Minister of State knows, there are huge waiting lists for people trying to get occupational therapy, speech and language therapy, psychology and dietetics.<\/p>  <p>  We heard from representatives from the Quarryvale Family Resource Centre from my area when they appeared before the Committee on Children, Disability, Equality and Integration this year.  They spoke about how parents are accessing the food bank in the area because they have to get the supports privately that they should be getting publicly, and it is pushing them into poverty.  A figure of 17% of people who used the food bank to feed their families cited the reason for doing so as increased health costs, including having to pay for private assessment needs and speech and language therapies.  Imagine having to put yourself into debt simply so that your child has a chance to reach his or her developmental milestones.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070600013#L00200","speaker":"1469"},{"type":"speech","time":1657101120,"counter":53,"content":"<p>I welcome the guests in the Gallery.  I thank the Social Democrats and Deputy Cairns for bringing forward this important motion, which we will be supporting.  It is one of the many motions on legislation on the rights of people with disabilities we have debated recently in the House.  Far too often, these life-changing issues are raised before the D&aacute;il but to no avail.  If the Government will not listen to the Deputies who raise these issues on a daily basis then it must listen to the 150,000 people on disability allowance and, indeed, the people in the Gallery today.<\/p>  <p>  Currently, the rate of poverty and social exclusion for people with disabilities in Ireland is one of the highest in the European Union, resting currently at 38.1% and rising.  People with chronic illnesses or disabilities are more than twice as likely to be at risk of poverty than other adults and approximately twice as likely to experience basic deprivation and constant poverty.  From employment to sport to accessing transport, people with disabilities face additional risks of social isolation and discrimination.  The hardship and pain caused by these barriers is socially and morally unjustified.  We also fail to value the skills, talents and resilience of people with disabilities and what they bring to the table.<\/p>  <p>  I have spoken many times about the Families Unite for Services and Support, FUSS, group in County Wexford, which campaigns for their children's rights.  When will that group and the 445 children awaiting disability services in County Wexford see proper services provided to them?  When will we see the vacancies in occupational therapy, speech therapy and psychiatry in the county filled?  This motion calls for a plan to fill the 732 vacant posts for therapists and provide a service for children with disabilities.  I cannot stress enough today how urgent this work is.  The services and those trying to hold them together are worn out.  They cannot continue like this.  Then, there are also services like Windmill in Wexford town, which supports 55 people with intellectual disabilities and their families.  It contacted me last week to outline how important the publication and resourcing of the action plan to implement the cost of disability in Ireland report is, for which this motion calls.<\/p>  <p>   It is imperative that the Minister of State gives a clear and concise commitment today on this publication and a decisive timeframe for delivery.  When we speak about these issues, we often miss the most important things of all.  We are missing out on the supports needed for children to flourish.  We are missing out on the adult who just needs that little bit of extra support to be able to live independently and take his or her rightful place in society.  We are missing out on the potential of artists with disabilities - musicians, painters, writers - and our Paralympic athletes.  Recognising the rights of people with disabilities  and providing support is an essential part of all our well-being.  Let us do that today by supporting this motion before the House today on the cost of disability.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070600013#L00300","speaker":"1621"},{"type":"speech","time":1657101120,"counter":54,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion this morning.  I commend Deputy Cairns and the Social Democrats on bringing this motion forward.  I also welcome the people in the Gallery.  I remember being here in 2018 when we ratified the UNCRPD, although the optional protocol was kind of left out of it.<\/p>  <p>  I listened to all the speakers today.  From my own experience, unfortunately, a disability is just a label for people because this is not about what condition a person has; it is about what rights a person should have.  That is the difference.  We are not giving resources to those people who need extra sources and, therefore, they are labelled, tagged and tucked into a corner.<\/p>  <p>  I spoke in the previous D&aacute;il about a gentleman in his 60s who is a double amputee.  Like one of the other speakers said earlier, people often have to come here to the D&aacute;il to get something.  This gentleman had an electric wheelchair but it was broken.  The HSE said it did not have a budget to fix it.  We actually went on local radio to raise awareness and a fabricating company in west Cork said it would fix it.  The HSE said it would not stand over it because of insurance.  That man spent six months in a reclining chair before we had to come in here and raise the issue with a particular Minister before things were done.  That is not the way to do business for people who want fairness, respect and equality all in one go.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to mention a good friend of mine who was involved in politics on the other side for many years, who through her own life experiences started up a summer camp.  That will be 30 years ago this year.  It started with three or four children and they now have more than 250 children and nearly 400 volunteers.  They run a summer camp every year in Midleton.  Ms Margaret Trundle deserves a massive amount of praise for her work with friends and families of people with intellectual difficulties.<\/p>  <p>  Going back to this motion, unfortunately, we are in the Chamber again discussing people with disabilities.  As the Minister of State mentioned earlier, it is about having a bit of joined-up thinking and engaging with all the services but also with local authorities.  Another gentleman in his 60s, who asked not to be named or identified because of embarrassment, is in receipt of the housing assistance payment, HAP.  We sometimes hear Government members say we have great increases in disability allowance or the invalidity pension or whatever but this gentleman pointed something out.<\/p> <p>I will read what he said:<\/p><blockquote>\tCork County Council obliges me to notify them of any changes of my circumstances.  Whereas my bank statements have shown the council that I nonetheless did experience a pertinent material change in circumstances in the last annual budget the Government increased my weekly disability allowance by &euro;5.  When the council scalded me by phone for not advising them earlier of this change of circumstances I said I was unaware that central Government welfare increases counted.  Taking account of the &euro;5 increase in my disability allowance, the council increased my official weekly rent contribution by exactly &euro;5. <\/blockquote> <p>That is giving with one hand and taking with the other.  Now, with inflation going up, these people are going backwards.<br\/><br\/>I have spoken to many people and have listened to them.  When I was on the town council we brought in service users to discuss mobility.  When we did our streetscape, and it is not finished yet believe it or not, the section we completed won a European mobility award.  That was because we listened to everybody and took account of what everybody needs.  That is how it should be and that is what this motion is about.  It is based on the needs of people.  However, it is not even just the needs, it is the fairness that is missing here that is really annoying.  I look at the Gallery and I see each of the people there.  It is all about being treated with respect.  In this day and age, why should any of those people have to beg for what should be an initial right?  Everything should be given to them on the basis of their needs, not on the basis of their means.  I support the motion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070600013#L00400","speaker":"1452","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657101720,"counter":56,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Cairns and the Social Democrats for tabling this timely and important motion.  I also welcome our visitors in the Gallery for this debate.<\/p>  <p>  In the last few days, when I became aware of this motion being brought forward and after engaging with groups I have been speaking with for many months, I asked them what areas they would like me to focus on in my contribution.  The response was the disability capacity review and the action plan therein, as well as the section 39 workers in the area.  We fully support the cost of disability requests in the motion.  The argument for them is unanswerable, and I will not repeat what has been said previously.<\/p>  <p>  I will focus on the disability capacity review action plan and the residential supports therein.  What is galling everybody about this and the lack of progress on an action plan is that the disability capacity review was not put together by organisations represented in the Gallery or by Sinn F&eacute;in, the Social Democrats, the Labour Party or some independent group.  This report is the Government's report.  It was published nearly a year ago; we are nine days shy of the first year anniversary of when it was published.  We were supposed to have an action plan by the end of 2021.  There was an announcement in April that a plan would be published but, nigh on a year later, it has not been published.  The figures in the capacity review are massive and they are not being contested.  Nobody here or in the Gallery is contesting the figures.  They are huge.  The figures for unmet need are through the roof across the range of services - residential services, day services, PA home help, therapies, respite care and community services.<\/p>  <p>  The lack of an action plan being published, debated and, most importantly, being delivered is a source of unbelievable frustration and increasing anger, particularly now as we are again in the midst of a cramped and crowded D&aacute;il schedule as we hurtle towards another D&aacute;il recess.  Even if this is published within the next nine days, the D&aacute;il will go into recess.  It will be back in September and then we will have a budget that is being brought forward to 27 September, which means that it will be cramped to have time to debate it then.  Time for much-needed debate on this is eking away.  In fact, this two-hour debate is the most time we will get to spend debating this issue between now and the recess and probably before the next budget, which is why this is so important.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the budget, and I ask the Minister of State to hear this loud and clear, can it be an accessible budget announcement for people with disabilities, so individuals with disabilities, their supporters and the groups can understand how many existing and new supports, be they residential, day places or respite supports, will be provided in budget 2023?  Do not bamboozle us on the day with grand announcements on workers, therapists and places and not make it clear in the announcements what are existing and what are new.  Most importantly, the Government has to tell us how it is going to deliver them.  It is no use saying the Government is going to allocate &euro;500 million for 200 residential supports or X amount of therapies when we know the workers are not there.  Let this budget be a new departure in terms of how it is announced, how it is published and how it is discussed.  None of us, whether we are in the Chamber, in the Gallery or at a work desk at home, wants to be scrambling around amidst a very deliberate forest of misinformation.<\/p>  <p>  I would like to see something clear regarding residential supports within the action plan.  In its submission to the Department on this, the National Federation of Voluntary Service Providers has set out clearly what needs to be done and what recommendations should be included in the action plan.  Last Friday, I visited an Irish Wheelchair Association day service in Balbriggan.  A young man there, Conor Dillon, just before we had our conversation, wanted to know about his long-term housing needs.  As a man and a human being he needs to know, but he does not know what is going to happen when his parents pass away.  He is young and his parents are still relatively young, but that is what he is thinking about now.  As I said, we had not even settled into the discussion we were about to have, which was the most powerful two hours I have ever spent in the company of any other human being.  I was with Conor, Naomi and Louis that day.  We cannot articulate any louder or clearer the need for the action plan to be published.  The Minister of State knows the groups and the individuals that have to be consulted on this, who will be able to talk to the many disabled people and their family support networks.  They need the information from the Minister of State as soon as possible.<\/p>  <p>  Yesterday, workers in the Irish Wheelchair Association were out on strike.  It is a section 39 organisation.  This is going to be the start of what I believe will be a summer, autumn, winter and beyond of discontent if the Government and the HSE do not take real control of this.  These are the Minister of State's workers in every meaningful way.  When someone presents to the State as a disabled person and says he or she needs assistance, respite care, a day service, a night service or a therapy, the State goes to these companies or organisations.  The State cannot provide the services through the HSE service so it asks them to provide them, and they step in with their workers, who are on brutal pay and brutal conditions.  The organisations are unable to keep staff.  The staff are going to the HSE.  The HSE is then unable to keep staff because the staff are either going to private healthcare providers, who, by the way, are coming around back into the sector to provide services because of the emergency element to the care that is provided, or they are going abroad to work elsewhere or they are going to other sectors.  We are losing staff everywhere.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State cannot wash her hands of this.  These are her workers, except when it comes to pay and conditions.  That is when the Government says \"No\" and that it is down to the organisations themselves.  When I met Prosper Fingal this week with Deputy Bacik, that was its ask, as well as the disability capacity review.  This organisation is just one provider of disability services for intellectual disability in my constituency.  It is struggling to get much-needed workers and struggling to retain them.  This is a blue ribbon organisation, one of many that exist throughout this country.  If it or the Irish Wheelchair Association or the other organisations did not exist tomorrow, our health service, which is already in crisis, would absolutely flounder on the floor, and the people who would suffer are disabled people and their families and support networks.  The Minister of State and everybody here know this, yet we remain without an action plan and we retain a hands-off approach to sections 38 and 39 organisations.  In a cost-of-living crisis and in every other crisis, we are happy to allow them to flounder and struggle in an environment that is absolutely crippling them.  It has to stop.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070600014#M00200","speaker":"1564"},{"type":"speech","time":1657102320,"counter":57,"content":"<p>I thank the Social Democrats for tabling this motion.  It is very worthwhile to debate what is going on with disability services.  As the Minister of State knows, people who have a disability are twice as likely to face discrimination than me and her.  That is a fact.  They will face discrimination in respect of consistent poverty, deprivation, isolation, employment, access to public services and housing.  Those who have a disability who try to access housing is one of the key issues.  There is a dearth of housing in South Dublin County Council for those who have a disability.  I could tell many horror stories regarding those who have a disability who cannot get access to proper housing.  The situation in South Dublin County Council is not an isolated one.  I am sure it is the same throughout the State.<\/p>  <p>  On income and disability, the disability allowance is &euro;208 per week.  I always found it very weird that during the pandemic the vast majority of people got &euro;350.  That was the bar at which most people could live.  The disability allowance should be far more than &euro;208; it should be up to the level of &euro;350.  That should be looked at in the context of the budget.  The cost-of-living crisis is having a major affect on those who are living with a disability.  That has to be heeded.<\/p>  <p>  I will touch on the local authority housing adaptation grants.  The income thresholds for those grants are far too low.  The cost of adaptations goes far beyond the grant that is currently available.  There is also a knock-on effect as regards the cost of living.  I know families who just cannot afford the adaptation they need for their children or themselves.  The thresholds for the grants, whether someone is in a public local authority house or owns his or her home, are far too small.  They have to be looked at because families are going into debt.  Families simply cannot afford the adaptation, or have to cut back on certain modifications, and sometimes it takes a long time to get these grants.  I would like the Minister of State to look into that because it is very important for families, adults and so forth.<\/p>  <p>  There are many other matters I could mention.  I do not understand why we have not ratified the protocol to the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, CRPD.  Only two other countries in the European Union have not ratified it.  The action plan needs to be published without delay.  That is very important.  As I said, the income for those who are on disability or illness benefits has to be reviewed.  That is probably out of the Minister of State's remit, but she will understand where I am coming from.  For somebody who is on such payments for a considerable time, it is not a huge amount of money in the context of the cost of living in Ireland.  It is actually very small.  Some people want to contribute but sometimes, because of circumstances, they cannot, due to their disability.  The disability allowance should be looked at.  It should be much further north of &euro;208 and closer to the level of payments made during the pandemic.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070600015#N00100","speaker":"1565"},{"type":"speech","time":1657102320,"counter":58,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this very important matter.  I compliment my colleague on the Joint Committee on Disability Matters, Deputy Cairns, on tabling this motion.  It follows on from a motion the Regional Group tabled a number of months ago.  It is important we keep this matter on the agenda.  Since this debate began, we have heard the Minister of State say that the Indecon report set out that the cost of living, above and beyond normal living, for people with disabilities is in the region of up to &euro;12,000 per annum.  That report was done some time ago.  Increases in the cost of living mean that sum is probably more now.<\/p>  <p>  The question is how we will address this in a meaningful way.  Disabilities are very complex.  We cannot just have one-size-fits-all.  The Minister of State will be aware of Councillor Gabe Cronnelly in County Galway.  He lives in Athenry and is a local county councillor serving on Galway County Council.  He is an amputee.  Of the 900-odd county councillors in the country, he is the only one serving who is an amputee.  As he is getting a salary from the county council, he is unable to get any support to replace his prosthetic limb when he needs to do that.  Last week, he got a quotation of &euro;38,000 to replace the prosthetic limb.  It is guaranteed for five years.  It will, therefore, cost him &euro;7,600 per year, in addition to the maintenance cost to maintain that limb.  He has to pay for that himself.  The reason he has to do so is he is over the income threshold to get a medical card.  One of the questions he keeps asking me is how the discretionary medical card is defined.  How is it defined?  How do people know whether they are entitled to one on a discretionary basis?  It seems to be open-ended without any particular way of adjudicating on it, other than being left to discretion.  That is it.<\/p>  <p>  Anybody who has a disability should be entitled to a medical card, full stop.  Somebody who has a permanent disability, such as an amputee, should be entitled to a medical card for life.  As Councillor Cronnelly often says to me, his leg will never grow back, therefore, he should get the medical card.  It is as simple as that.  If people who are amputees were given medical cards, the cost of the prosthetic Councillor Cronnelly needs to get this year would be borne by the State.  We are supposed to encourage people from the disability sector into politics and public life.  This is a case where Councillor Cronnelly cannot afford to get involved in politics because any money coming in from the few pounds he gets as a councillor is actually penalising him.  It will cost him &euro;38,000 over the next five years to get the prosthetic limb in place, which he needs.  The parts are guaranteed for six months, while the prosthetic overall is guaranteed for five years.  In the meantime, he has to pay for any maintenance or any parts that break after five years.  When we talk about the cost of living with a disability being in the region of &euro;12,000, that is a generalisation.  We need to individualise all this to make sure people who really need assistance get what they are entitled to under the UN agreement.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome Jackie and Emilie who are in the Gallery with others to listen to the debate.  They are people who are living with the experience of disability and their families.  It is important to state that over the past two years the Joint Committee on Disability Matters has heard from people with disabilities and their families who have recounted their experiences, which are not very good and are not improving.  Money is going in but the output is not coming around.  The results are not there.<\/p>  <p>  Disabled Artists &amp;amp; Disabled Academics, DADA, is a particular group.  When a disabled artist applies for a grant or bursary to do some project, their disability allowances are taken as means.  That is absolutely wrong.  If we are to encourage people back into work, and to use the skillset and special skills they have, we should encourage them by giving them, possibly, a double bursary and not touch their disability allowances.  These should not be touched when we give people a bursary, support or grant.  A scheme for disabled artists with disabilities should remove income earning limits and allow them - this is from the artists themselves - to keep their core payment, such as the blind pension, disability allowance or invalidity allowance, to pay for their disability and compensate them for reduced earning powers.  Anything like that, where people with disabilities get support and allowances, should not be touched.<\/p> <p>These people are very fearful as to whether they will retain their medical cards when they apply for certain grants or for bursaries to enable them to do projects.  As a result, we should be safeguarding the provision of medical cards on the basis of medical need rather than income thresholds.  That is most important.  Discretionary medical cards are causing major problems.<\/p> <p> It is important that we look at how we can help people with disabilities who want to help themselves and engage in living their lives and being independent, whether it is through employment, self-employment, music or the arts.  We must encourage them.  We should not put barriers in the way of their progress.  We must ensure that disabled artists can perform in front of people and can spend time completing whatever works they need to enable them to live independently.  We must ensure that any grants provided to people with disabilities are treated as something that they are using to give back to society.<\/p> <p> We have put many barriers in the way of people with disabilities.  We need to strip all that back, whether it is in the area of social welfare, arts grants or disability payments for housing adaptations.  We must front-load supports in order to give people the opportunity to complete the necessary works to enable them to live independently.  I know of a young woman in Tuam.  She was a child when I first met her and is now 18 or 19 years of age.  She is still awaiting the completion of an extension to her council house.  She is in a wheelchair and cannot have her friends round to visit because there is not enough space in the house.  There is a kitchen and a living room, and that is about it.  We must ensure that we treat people equally and with respect.  The Minister of State has been active in getting things done.  I ask her to listen to disabled artists and Gabe Connolly.  We must make changes now that will have a good effect on people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070600015#N00200","speaker":"1482","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657102920,"counter":60,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Cairns and the Social Democrats for bringing forward this most important motion in such a timely fashion.

I pay tribute to Mr. Tony Darmody, who gave so much of his time to the organisation over the years.  I am asking for the immediate publication of the action plan on the disability capacity review and its inclusion in budget 2023 to ensure that another year does not pass with families and individuals left without any indication of when or how the urgent needs that they are experiencing will be met.  An accessible disability budget must be announced in order that individuals with disabilities and their families can understand how many existing and new residential supports, day-care places and respite supports will be provided for in budget 2023, and how this relates to the needs set out in the capacity review.  The Kerry Parents and Friends Association is classed as a section 39 organisation.  It receives a lot less funding for the organisation and its workers than it would if it were a section 38 organisation, even though it is doing the same work.  The association is helping people with disabilities in places like Gneeves, Gullane and Faha whose parents are now in their 70s and 80s.  If it were not for this wonderful association, these people would be completely lost.

The roadmap and schedule of works, as it were, must be published.  It is urgently needed for both the service users and the parents of service users in County Kerry.  I wish to highlight the excellent facility at St. Mary of the Angels in Beaufort, and the fact that it is being closed by stealth.  We have discussed the matter previously.  As the Minister of State is aware, no new residents are being admitted to the facility.  This beautiful facility was created many decades ago by the very generous Beaufort family, who gave over their land for the provision of services for disabled persons.  It is a centre as excellence, and I have regarded it as such for many years.  I ask the Minister of State to keep this centre of excellence open for the great people from Beaufort, Killorglin, Killarney, Faha and Fieries who have worked there for generations and who provide great services there.  It is a dedication and a vocation.  I ask that the centre remains open and is not closed by stealth, which is what is happening currently.<\/p>  <p>  I also want the Minister of State to address the fact that we desperately need respite services for people who have disabilities and are being cared for, in many cases, by aging parents who need a break.  We need more respite facilities in south Kerry.  A certain number of services are provided in north Kerry, but it is not enough.  We need more.  People must be taken care of.  More funding must be provided for disabled persons grants to allow people to remain at home, whether it is for adaptation grants for bathrooms and bedrooms, stair lifts or grants for the provision of mobility aids.  The facilities must be provided to enable people to remain in their own homes.  We also need more people working on the ground to deliver healthcare to people with disabilities who are living at home.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070600016#O00300","speaker":"1487"},{"type":"speech","time":1657102920,"counter":62,"content":"<p>I welcome our guests in the Gallery.

I think of the words of the T&aacute;naiste, the iar-Thaoiseach, who said that we are wasting time in here.  He wants to shut down debate and deny the good people in the Gallery and their families all over the country the right to be heard.  He said we should not be wasting time on debates like this.  It is a very valuable and important debate.  Our guests do not want to listen to empty words from me or anyone else; they want the services to which they are entitled.  People with disabilities do not want to be discriminated against when they get a job or employment, or when they get a gig as an artist.  I welcome Mr. Jackie Conboy, of the Music and Entertainment Association of Ireland, MEAI, to the Gallery.  That is what we need.  Has this country got to the stage now that it will not provide services?  The Minister of State has failed utterly to provide any services.  Yet, the T&aacute;naiste lectures us and states that we should not even raise these issues in the House.  Should we just shut down this Chamber and forget the people all together?

We heard earlier about the &euro;5 increase in disability allowance and the &euro;5 increase in the weekly rent contribution for a claimant on social welfare benefits.  How cruel-hearted and cruel-minded have we become?  The system is so unwieldy.  I have read stories of families waiting for ten years to get supports.  Deputy Verona Murphy recently highlighted the case of a child in Country Wexford who does not have a wheelchair that is suitable for him.  We know about Cara Darmody from Ardfinnan, who fundraised for Ardfinnan National School and Scoil Chormaic Special School to provide access to services and therapies for students with additional needs.  I salute the volunteer groups around the country, and, in particular, Positive Steps Together in Caisle&aacute;n Nua.  The organisation has set out on a journey to fundraise for a respite unit for the local people.  These organisations do not want us to pay lip service to them; they want support.  They want us, as advocates for them, to raise these issues here in the Parliament to which we are elected.

Indecon International produced a report on behalf of the Department of Social Protection looking at detail of all of the extra day-to-day costs faced by people with disabilities.  An extensive survey, incorporating feedback from thousands of disabled people across Ireland, was completed by consultants from Indecon in early 2021 and a report was submitted to the Government.  We have been told that each Department has since examined the report.  However, it appears that the report has not yet been presented to Cabinet by the Minister for Social Protection, as promised.  Four years after the research was first announced, not a single additional financial support has been made available to people with disabilities in Ireland.  As every day passes, disabled people can justifiably feel that they are being left behind and that their inclusion is not important.  Failure by the Government to publish and act upon the report prior to budget 2022 meant that the disabled people were not properly factored into the financial planning for 2022.  Only for families trying their best to get support and put pressure on every Department, one wonders where people with disabilities, such as Mr. Jim O'Mahony from Kilbrittain and others, would end up.<\/p>  <p>  The people of west Cork are trying to put together local funding to build an autism centre in the area.  I must acknowledge what the Minister of State has done for the people in the area in fairness and the fact that she continues to engage with them to help them further their cause.  They greatly appreciate that.<\/p> <p>This is a major issue in west Cork.  I would appreciate it if the Minister of State would continue with the good work she has been doing there so far.<\/p> <p> We have other problems in the context of adults with disabilities who are growing up and living with their elderly parents in some cases, through no fault of their, own getting aggressive with their elderly parents.  There should be services available for these situations.  I can inform the Minister of State about some of them in my area.  While Ireland is a great country for so-called inclusion, we should be ashamed of how our disabled people and families are treated here.  The Parkinson's Association of Ireland will be before us today.  Parkinson's is a disability in its own right.  The association is looking for specialised nurses.  It will be in the audiovisual room at 1.30 p.m. fighting that cause.  It has had an uphill battle in this regard.  I was contacted by a lady from Bantry this morning who has a child availing of services offered by CoAction.  She has been looking for respite for four years and cannot get it.

I welcome and thank the people in the Gallery.  Their work on the ground is recognised and is not wasted.  There are more and more voices on their side in the D&aacute;il.  I know it is slow, but they are making progress.<\/p>  <p>  This motion is a basic one.  I understand that the Government is accepting it and that there is no amendment to it.  The motion notes our legal obligations, it acknowledges what has been done so far with the reports, the capacity review and the cost of disability in Ireland and it asks for four specific things, which are very basic.  The first is to introduce a cost of disability payment of at least &euro;20 per week, which I will come back to.  The second is to increase the disability allowance.  The third is to publish an action plan pursuant to the disability capacity review, and that should be a basic action for the Government.  The Government should also publish an action plan to implement the cost of disability.  The fourth is to honour the programme for Government commitment to make the results of the cost of disability report part of Government policy.<\/p>  <p>  Theoretically, we have made great strides.  I will use Galway as an example.  The Barcelona Declaration was agreed 20 years ago in order that we would stop the division and discrimination.  We adapted the motto that good design enables and bad design disables and we passed the Barcelona Declaration.  Theoretically, that was a brilliant step forward but the declaration was not implemented in full.  When Covid came, it was simply thrown aside when we placed a major emphasis on businesses operating outdoors.  The Barcelona Declaration has gone by the wayside.  The same happened with the UNCRPD.  A huge amount of time has passed since we signed it, although we have not ratified the protocol.  The language in that document is wonderful, but we are still going on the basis of a piecemeal approach and charity as opposed to making that language a reality.  As a practical example, if we had really embraced the Barcelona Declaration, it would have been uppermost when the Government encouraged businesses to move their operations out into public spaces.<\/p>  <p>  The Indecon report was published in December.  There is a background to that, as has been set out.  Deputy Catherine Murphy mentioned a report from 1996.  The one I have is from 2004.  That report, also compiled by Indecon, related to the National Disability Authority.  An estimated cost of &euro;143 per week was outlined in it.  In 2015, the Cullinan and Lyons report used the data from the survey on income and living and found that the average additional weekly cost was &euro;207.  Then we have the Indecon report.  I will run out of time, but Indecon says that there is no single cost of disability due to a wide range in the severity of disabilities and so on.  However, the figures are astronomical.  They go up to &euro;16,000 per year for those who have severe limitations as a result of their disabilities.  The Indecon report goes on to say that income supports will not be sufficient and that there is a need for a multifaceted approach, which I fully agree with.  I am worried that in the lovely speech made earlier, there was no commitment to an action plan, to production and publication and to making this a reality.  I welcome that as I was getting out of my chair the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, announced that she intends to carry out an audit of respite services.  She might clarify that point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070600017#P00200","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1657103520,"counter":66,"content":"<p>She does.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070600017#P00300","speaker":"1484"},{"type":"speech","time":1657103520,"counter":67,"content":"<p>That is positive news.

When we refer to the cost of disability, what are we talking about?  We are talking about the extra costs that a person with a disability incurs in their day-to-day lives simply because they have a disability.  There is something deeply unfair about that because having a disability in the first place is often a massive extra challenge for that person.  In addition, they face extra financial costs.  In most cases these are costs that they cannot afford.  As I said, there  is just something deeply unfair about that.<\/p>  <p>  In the Indecon report on the cost of disability to which many previous speakers referred, an important point is made about the participation of people with disabilities in the labour market.  The level of such participation is one of the lowest in Europe.  Therefore, we have a double-edged sword because of the extra costs that people incur on foot of their disabilities.  Due to the fact that the vast majority of them are not able to access employment, they cannot cover those extra costs.  While it is not mentioned in this motion and while it is a separate issue, the fact that the number of people with disabilities in Ireland participating in the labour market is among the lowest in Europe is an extremely important issue.  Not having access to work denies people the chance to be independent.<\/p>  <p>  Because of the situation we are in, the State has to step in.  It must represent society and the common good and provide the extra assistance that is asked for in this motion.  I fully support the call for a disability payment of at least &euro;20 per week in budget 2023 and for an increase in the disability allowance of at least &euro;15 per week.  Those are short-term measures that can be brought in when we get to September.  Longer-term measures are outlined in the motion, which calls on the Government to look at the Cost of Disability in Ireland report and ensure that will inform policy decisions in the future, particularly as it is based on good information.  The Indecon report tells us that households where a member has a disability spend an average of an additional &euro;9,000 per year.<\/p>  <p>  I was privileged to launch a report on the cost of disability with Family Carers Ireland and the Vincentian Partnership for Social Justice a few months ago in the audiovisual room.  The report looked at the minimum essential standard of living for a two-parent household caring for an adolescent child who had a profound intellectual disability.  It found that the extra cost - and this was detailed work - was approximately &euro;12,000 per annum.  As Deputy Connolly stated, extra costs vary across different types of disability.  If people look at the Indecon report and its granular detail, they will see that families spend a higher proportion of their incomes on food, clothing, fuel, light, transport and household goods.  We all know that the price of food, fuel, electricity and transport have significantly increased in the past 12 months.  Households that have a member who has a disability are being hit harder by inflation and cost-of-living increases.  That is just another reason why I fully support the motion tabled by Deputy Cairns.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070600017#P00500","speaker":"1605"},{"type":"speech","time":1657103520,"counter":69,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on Deputy Cairns' motion.  I also welcome the motion.  I want to raise three issues.  Week after week, the witnesses who come before the Joint Committee on Disability Matters talk about the medical card and the possibilities for people with disabilities if they were to get outside incomes.  The medical card is gold for a person with a disability.<\/p> <p>Their fear is secondary benefits would be removed for disabled artists, writers, photographers or whatever.  It is hugely important that that is protected.  We need a serious discussion on how medical cards are provided for people with disabilities and how they can be guaranteed into the future and not have to come back looking for information year after year.<\/p> <p> Section 39 organisations and pay parity constitute a major stumbling block for people with disabilities and the lack of services.  As we see regarding recruitment for section 39 organisations the length and breadth of the country, pay parity has to be a huge priority for Government because unless we get that rectified, we have an unbalanced system and a difficulty.<\/p> <p> I refer to residential care for people with disabilities who have been on five days' care but, because family circumstances have changed, now need seven-day care.  These are people who are getting on in years, as are their parents.  I have had instances recently where some people in the HSE said when it comes to a crisis point, they would then look at it.  Does everything have to come to a crisis point before a decision is taken?  We have seen that in relation to many decisions.  I made the point to the official that it is going to emerge as a crisis point, so why not avert it?  It will have to be made anyway, but we have to have this crisis at every level.  It is grossly unfair on the person, the families and the system to expect we have to go to a crisis at every stage.  Why are we not dealing with it?<\/p> <p> I have looked at the disability allowance and the income disregard and reached out to different groups.  An innovative scheme, the rural social scheme, was developed some 20 years ago.  There were income disregards in that to make sure people kept their entitlement to it.  The disability allowance needs to be looked at in a major way to see what income disregards can be put in place.  What can be done to ensure persons can keep their disability allowance even if they get therapeutic work, which it is in many instances?  The model of income disregards in the rural social scheme can be used and should be looked at by Departments to ensure there is a better system.

I thank the Social Democrats, particularly Deputy Cairns, for giving me the platform to have a conversation about this on the floor of the D&aacute;il.  The ongoing cost-of-living debate has a tendency to focus on other aspects of society but Deputy Cairns can be assured that I, as Minister of State for disability, and all my ministerial colleagues across Government are acutely aware of the significant cost, both financial and human, to disabled people and their families and how critical that is in the current context.  The key to all of this is to look at all these issues through the lens of the UNCRPD.  Disability is not just a health issue, but affects all aspects of one's life and the issues must be addressed holistically across Government.<\/p>  <p>  In the time I have, I have to get to the nub of it in relation to Deputy Cairns' asks from Government.  One ask is to publish the action plan and implement the disability capacity review, including setting out a plan to fill the 732 vacant posts for therapists providing services for children with disability.  I will do that.  I am within three or four weeks of providing that action plan around 732 posts.  That will be done.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the cost of disability, I have signed off on it.  It has gone to the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, and is with him.  My officials beside me are meeting with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform tomorrow on it.  We are within weeks of having it published.  It is not just an action plan; it is backed with money.<\/p>  <p>  I have mulled over it for some time and think it talks to the piece that Deputy Duncan Smith spoke about, making sure we have proper signposting signage to tell us exactly where we can.  I have put in extra pieces from early years right through to the older person to ensure that when we talk about residential care and respite, it is the whole package and, when one enters services, one can transition; and to ensure that when we look at respite, we also look at alternative respite and at what that looks like.  When we look at transitioning to residential, what does residential look like?  Is it supported and independent?  Is it the complex residential piece?<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Michael Moynihan is so right that not everything has to come to a crisis but, at the moment, there is not that forward-planning and capacity-building in the system and we need to have it.  In the same way, when children hit the age of 17 they exit children's services but fall off a cliff and go nowhere.  They have been used to respite and now go into adult services and there is no respite available for them.  We need to look at that 18-25 piece, which I call the transitioning care piece, and that is put into it.  I am putting in a proper ladder so when a parent gets the news they have a child with a disability or complex needs, parents know how the State supports them and how it can be done.  This capacity review has it.<\/p>  <p>  I take responsibility for the fact that it has been too long in publication, but there was a lot missing within in.  There is no point in having a number such as that we need 800 emergency residential places today.  How can we achieve that and build it in?  How can we ensure we have equity of access, whether one is in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway or Donegal?  Everybody has to have it.  Every county council has to have the same message.  That is why in the publication of the disability policy within housing there is an acknowledgement that it is not working.  However, when you start going forward, you have a UDA.  Is it UDA-plus or is it plus-plus?  Has that been built into it?  Every county manager talks on the same page so there is no difference and when they take on a Part V, we talk about social, affordable and disability.  It should not be limited.  That is the piece I talk about regarding housing.<\/p>  <p>  I do not want to give figures out but I know I need 740 houses today to stand still and move forward in relation to disability houses.  It is the requirement in the health budget to provide the funding to ensure people have the supported independent piece or the complete 24-hour service.  Then you are creating capacity.  We need to start creating capacity at all levels, from the early years.  The earlier you make the intervention, the longer you have and the less of a need on that critical piece because families do not get burned out or feel let down.  We can only implement it if we have the money so the money is being sought as part of the Estimates process.<\/p>  <p>  The motion calls on the Government to \"honour the commitment in the Programme for Government: Our Shared Future to use the findings of the Cost of Disability in Ireland report to 'inform the direction of future policy'\".  Absolutely, it has to be.  Deputy Canney spoke about prosthesis.  Prosthesis is at the second highest level within the cost of disability, in terms of the cost for an amputee who does not have a medical card to replace it.  At all times we have to break down barriers preventing people returning to the workforce.  While I am only one Minister of State standing here, I have to work with all other Ministers because I have to talk about disabled artists, the disregard, the inclusion of them and how we can encourage positive involvement in the workforce without penalising, putting up barriers and breaking down those barriers.  That is why I talked to the T&aacute;naiste, the Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, the IDA and IBEC to ascertain what the barriers are for people returning to the workforce.  I am not talking about the cost of disability from the point of view of the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, in relation to those fundings.  From talking to our officials this morning, that is an ongoing conversation within budgetary negotiations.<\/p>  <p>  I have heard under-65s are going into nursing homes.  That should not be happening and has been outlawed within the HSE.  If a Deputy has a case of it, please tell me and I will take it up.  We have put funding in to ensure people can be moved out.  While it is slow, we are trying to build that capacity.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to PAs, I did not wait for the development of the disability capacity report for the publication of the PAs, because I put sixfold into it in last year's budget to ensure we could give people choice to live where they want in the community.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070600018#Q00200","speaker":"1484"},{"type":"speech","time":1657104120,"counter":72,"content":"<p>There is no doubt that disabled people and their families find themselves at the sharp end of the cost-of-living crisis.<\/p> <p>While all households have been affected by inflation, the fact of the matter is that not everybody starts from the same position.  Even before the current increase in the rate of inflation, people with disabilities experienced one of the highest rates of poverty at over three times that of the general population.  Too often, the needs of those with disabilities are shamefully neglected and viewed through a very narrow lens.  Policy is not based on the voices and experiences of people living with those disabilities and their carers.  If we were to shift that focus, it would quickly become clear that it is the way in which State services are structured and inadequately resourced that causes the most exclusion and inequality rather than the disability itself.  <\/p> <p> The assessment of need process is a clear example of this.  The importance of this service cannot be overstated.  It is supposed to be the first step in providing children with therapeutic and educational supports but the State constantly reneges on its obligations in this regard.  Just yesterday, we heard that 4,000 children are waiting for a diagnostic assessment just to get a school place.  This abject neglect has serious consequences.  Delays in the assessment of need process not only result in many children being denied access to services, but also frequently mean that these children need more costly and complex interventions down the line as their conditions are allowed to deteriorate.  By law, once an assessment of need application has been received, the assessment must start within three months and finish within a further three months but we know that this is simply not the case in practice.  Some people have to wait years, and very often three to four years, for that assessment of need.  This is a deplorable situation and it is the reason we must urgently ratify the optional protocol to the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  <\/p> <p> In those areas where early intervention and school age teams are still operating, many children are still waiting to be seen.  These services are distinct from the assessment of need system and, crucially, no statutory timelines are set out in the Disability Act.  Parents very often do not realise that when filing a complaint until they are told by the HSE.  Wide variations in service regionally only add to the frustration for parents and to the sense of unfairness they feel.  Access to adequate services should not depend on your address.<\/p> <p> The delays in the assessment of need process also brings our two-tier health service into sharp focus.  The failure to ensure assessments take place within a reasonable timescale means that many families are forced to go private.  These families often have great difficulty in scraping the money together despite making sacrifices and frequently have to borrow the money.  For many others, this is just not an option.  The money is simply not there.  It must be borne in mind that, the more this happens, the greater the pull factor for staff to go into private practice.  I was concerned to hear the Minister of State speak at the weekend about her intention to outsource assessments of need.  This will inevitably accelerate the creeping privatisation we see right across our health services.  In addition to the pull factor I have mentioned, there is low morale among staff because of the high levels of stress and the high number of vacancies.  All of that combines to make the job much more challenging.  What is needed is a properly functioning and resourced universal public service that is available to all those who require it as of right.  Difficulty with recruitment is not an acceptable excuse.  It is a central role of a Minister to ensure proper workforce planning. <\/p> <p> This stumbling from one crisis to another cannot continue.  Instead, we must embed rights-based supports and services for all of those with disabilities.  We need action now.  This is not just about having a conversation; it is about looking for action from the Minister of State and her ministerial colleagues.  We need to see that action as a matter of urgency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070600018#Q00300","speaker":"1567","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657104720,"counter":74,"content":"<p>This motion is about taking steps towards providing the changes we need to be a more inclusive and equal society.  It is about the budgetary measures and policies that allow people to exercise their rights.  The scale and depth of the issues are known.  What we need is the political will.  This budget must address the cost-of-living crisis but it must also address the cost-of-disability crisis.  Even before the current crisis, it cost between &euro;8,700 and &euro;12,300 extra every year to live with a disability in Ireland.  These figures are from the Government's own report, which supports everything which the people and organisations in the Gallery and watching at home have been saying for years.<\/p>  <p>  A major component of the additional costs faced by disabled people and the families of children with disabilities relates to grossly inadequate education, healthcare, social welfare and housing services.  A core pillar of Social Democrats policy is the provision of public services.  In our alternative budget last year, we proposed the idea of universal basic services based on the principle that all people are entitled to a range of public services that are free at the point of use, provided by the State and funded through taxation.  Public disability services are required now.  They are central to respecting rights and empowering children and adults. <\/p>  <p>  The disability capacity review outlines the considerable unmet needs in the health and care sectors.  The review was published almost a year ago.  Where is the action plan?  Is this plan based on engagement with the disabled persons organisations, advocacy organisations, parents' groups and service providers?  Any response to unmet needs in this sector has to work with the people most affected and service users.  For too long, Departments have made decisions for people and not with them.  Regrettably, we saw this again last week when the Government rushed through the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) (Amendment) Bill 2022 with little or no input from disabled people.  We need a comprehensive and resourced action plan that responds to the needs identified and to larger systematic issues around the recruitment and retention of therapists and communication with families.  The provision of the services people have a right to would be transformative.  It would help children develop, adults gain independence and relieve the unimaginable stress and pressure that parents of all ages are under.  The provision of appropriate local school places for children and young people has to be a pillar of this intervention.  Members of the West Cork Special School campaign have travelled here today to highlight this key issue.  <\/p>  <p>  The cost of disability report also requires an action plan to adequately deal with the substantial range of matters raised.  Social protection payments, healthcare grants and other supports need to be tailored to meet the needs of disabled people.  This motion calls for a &euro;20 weekly cost-of-disability payment across relevant payments, including domiciliary care allowance, carer's allowance and the invalidity pension, and an additional &euro;15 for the disability allowance.  These are the just the most basic increases needed to keep up with skyrocketing inflation.  The Government has to outline a costed and long-term plan developed in co-ordination with disabled people to address the systemic and crippling cost-of-disability crisis.  The 2023 budget will be focused on the cost-of-living crisis but it will also be crucial for addressing the structural barriers around disability.  For too long, people have waited for proper homes, school places, therapies, respite and payments that cover household expenses.  Unless there is a significant and impactful change of direction in the budget, the suffering, the exclusion and the denial of rights will continue unabated.   <\/p>  <p>  I acknowledge all those tirelessly campaigning for equality.  Whether it is people who are disabled themselves, parents, carers, family or friends, there are countless groups and campaigns out there all striving for disability rights.  I thank my amazing team, Tara Constantine, Richard Scriven and Claire.<\/p> <p>I extend huge thanks to all the organisations that could make it here today, including Independent Living Movement Ireland, the Disability Federation of Ireland, Inclusion Ireland, Mental Health Reform, the National Disability Services Association, the National Federation of Voluntary Service Providers, AsIAm, Early Onset Parkinson&rsquo;s Disease Ireland, the Down Syndrome Centre Cork, West Cork Special Schools, and the Irish Wheelchair Association.  I also thank those who travelled from Cork South-West.  Their presence is a testament to the work that needs to be done.  The scale of issues and solutions are known.

T&aacute; f&aacute;ilte rompu go l&eacute;ir.<\/p>  <p>  Parents across Ireland are under enormous pressure to meet extortionate back to school costs.  It is a big source of stress for families every summer but this year is exceptional, given the ever worsening cost-of-living crisis.  For weeks, we have been telling the Government that parents face huge back to school costs now and that an autumn budget would be far too late for families.  Time and again, Ministers lined up to parrot the Government mantra that budget 2023, which is almost three months away, was the only way for the Government to help.  Then, at dinner time yesterday, after weeks of stubbornness and just two hours before a Sinn F&eacute;in motion calling on the Government to act, its position changed.  Suddenly, it was possible for the Government to step in with an increase in the rate of the back to school allowance for those already in receipt of that payment.  The Minister could have saved all those families weeks of worry by making this announcement and taking this decision sooner.  However, I welcome the Government's U-turn.  I am glad it has finally listened to the Opposition, at least in part.  Any extra financial support for families on fixed and low incomes struggling to make it to the end of the week is a very good thing.<\/p>  <p>  There is problem, however.  The Government has left behind middle-income families, who are in dire straits.  Any family with a household income of &euro;621 a week will not get a red cent of back to school allowance.  A household income of &euro;621 a week is modest.  These are families who receive very little support from the State but are now fighting to stay afloat.  The Government has left behind these families, who struggle to pay the mortgage or rent and who cannot afford to put fuel in the car to get to work or pay extortionate energy bills.  These families' grocery bills are through the roof to such an extent that many have started to cut back on basics.  Many of these families have used their savings or maxed out their credit cards trying to keep up, and now they have nowhere left to turn.  When the Government had an opportunity to make a big difference, it settled instead for half measures.  Middle-income parents went out to work this morning feeling let down again.  Many of them have no idea where they will get hundreds of euro to send their children back to school in September.  When they ask why they have been left out, what will the Minister's answer be?<\/p>  <p>  N&iacute; m&oacute;r an li&uacute;ntas &eacute;ada&iacute; agus coisbhirt don scoilbhliain nua a mh&eacute;ad&uacute; chuig teaghlaigh at&aacute; ar mhe&aacute;nioncaim, at&aacute; f&aacute;gtha ina dhiaidh ag an Rialtas.

The D&aacute;il will rise for the summer next week so time is running out for us.  I am asking the Minister at this juncture to listen to the Opposition again and do the right thing.  I am asking him to expand the back to school payment to cover an additional 500,000 children, whose middle-income parents are in desperate need of support.  The Minister holds the purse strings.  He can make this happen.  This is an existing scheme.  We want the Government to expand it.  We are appealing to the Government not to pack up for the summer having left these families behind.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070600020#S00400","speaker":"1466"},{"type":"speech","time":1657105320,"counter":79,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy McDonald for raising the issue of back to school costs, which are a serious issue for thousands of families across Ireland at this time.  We have said all along, and we are sticking to this position, that the budget will be on 27 September.  This week we published the summer economic statement, which sets out what the underlying position is with the public finances.  It means we can have a budget package in the autumn of &euro;6.7 billion, &euro;5.7 billion of which will be on the expenditure side, including investment in public services, improvements in public service pay, improvements in social welfare and so on.  Another &euro;1 billion will be on the tax side.  We have also given a commitment that, in parallel with that, we will have a separate package of one-off measures that will be focused on the cost-of-living crisis that many families are facing.  Not everyone is facing it but some families are and we acknowledge that.  They need help.  That is why, even outside of the normal budgetary cycle, we have made so many different interventions across this year, including a reduction in VAT on gas and electricity and a reduction in the excise duty on petrol and diesel.  Both of those measures continue.  The bullet payments on the fuel allowance, the reductions in public transport fares and reductions in the costs of medicines for families are just a few examples of what we have done outside the normal budgetary cycle.<\/p>  <p>  We acknowledge that at this time of year there are extra pressures on families arising from the costs that need to be paid in July and August in the context of going back to school.  That is why we have made this further very targeted intervention.  These are time-sensitive costs.  Waiting until the end of September in respect of these costs is not something we can stand over.  That is why we have made an intervention that represents a significant investment, &euro;67 million in total, by increasing the rate of the back to school clothing and footwear allowance to &euro;260 for younger children and &euro;385 for older children.  That will benefit more than 260,000 children across over 150,000 families.  In the budget, we also made a change to the eligibility criteria by matching the income test for single parents with that that applies to couples.  That was an important change that expanded the availability of the allowance for single parents, who have to carry a lot of costs that they cannot share with a partner.  We think that was the right move.  In addition, we are waiving school transport scheme charges for the coming school year, which will save up to &euro;500 for individual families.  That will be particularly welcomed by families in rural Ireland, many of whom rely on the school transport scheme and who otherwise would be facing long journeys and commutes.  We all know what the cost of fuel is like at this point in time.<\/p>  <p>  Significantly, we are expanding the free school meals programme to all DEIS schools.  In the most recent budget, we added about 300 extra DEIS schools to the programme and we are now extending the free meals programme to DEIS schools across the system, and the hot meals programme to DEIS primary schools.  That means an extra 60,000 children will receive a hot meal in school.  That is a very important intervention.  We all know the value of ensuring children are properly fed so they can avail fully of the potential the education system affords them.  This is an important intervention by the Government.  Does it go as far as some people would like?  Of course it does not.  Will it offset all the costs?  We never claimed it would.  However, it will be of assistance to many thousands of families.  These are targeted measures with regard to the back to school allowance and the extension of hot meals to children attending DEIS schools.  They are very targeted measures which people will benefit from.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070600020#S00500","speaker":"1459"},{"type":"speech","time":1657105320,"counter":80,"content":"<p>The Government took its time listening to what is just plain common sense by making a move on these matters now in July and putting money in families' pockets when they need it and when it will count.<\/p> <p>I ask the Minister to take the next step.  He is surely not saying to families who have &euro;621 a week that they are home and hosed, and that it is plain sailing for them.  We describe these families as middle-income families.  It is not; it is a very modest income.  As the Minister knows, these families cannot qualify for many of the State supports that others on lower incomes can qualify for.  Is the Minister saying to these families that they are on their own?  He cannot do that.  I appreciate the need for targeted measures.  The Minister has borrowed from our proposals and I want him to complete the journey.  We proposed a targeted approach.  We are with him on that.  He has to address the fact that he has left substantial numbers of families and children struggling.  I want him to extend this scheme to capture those 500,000 children, who need this.

The Deputy is now advocating for the very families she believes should be paying 50% income tax rates.  These are families earning &euro;700 or &euro;800 per week.  In the last budget, the Government gave an individual earning &euro;700 a week an extra &euro;400 and an extra &euro;800 to a couple.

We saw a credit union survey this morning showing the cost per child being between &euro;1,100 and &euro;1,500.  I spoke with a mother this morning who is budgeting for the school term ahead.  She tells me that the cost of sending her two children to school this September has risen by &euro;1,500 compared with this time last year.  This is an enormous increase for any family.  Amid rising costs of food, fuel, transport, childcare and housing, this price increase will have serious implications and ramifications for her household budget and the budgets of many households across the country.  The credit unions told us that about one third of families go into debt to pay the cost of being back to school.  The mother I spoke with joked that between the cost of returning to school and other rising costs, her credit union's loans department will be on speed dial for the rest of this year.<\/p>  <p>  There were welcome concessions from the Government on back-to-school costs last night but they are simply not enough.  There was no radical move to introduce the free school books scheme that my colleague, Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, proposed.  It would cost &euro;40 million but would make a significant difference to many families.  There was no move to increase eligibility for the back-to-school allowance, which could be done with the stroke of a pen and would make a real difference.  There was no move for real reform of the outdated school transport system either.  We need a bigger vision with more substantive change.  We have called for a real cost-of-living budget, not one which will introduce mere piecemeal reform.  We welcome the date being brought forward, but as my colleague, Deputy Nash, said, it is really a token exercise, because it has only been brought forward by two weeks.  We have called for more targeted measures to be introduced now to ensure that families and households have excellent supports as they go through that critical time when children go back to school.  Instead, we see suggestions that the Government will introduce vote-winning tax cuts at the expense of real cost-of-living measures to support hard-pressed families and households.<\/p>  <p>  Will the Minister avoid skirting round the edges and make real, substantive changes in the budget, based on a practical way of improving conditions for many families and households?  We know the cost-of-living crisis is not an abstract concept.

This Government has expanded the DEIS programme by the single largest amount ever, to include more than 300 schools.  It is the right thing to do.  Deputies have all issued press releases with the details of what schools in their constituencies were given DEIS band 1 and band 2 status in recent months, because they know the value of it and the benefits afforded to schools by being given DEIS status.  They are given DEIS status because it is warranted.  They accommodate children from communities which, in many instances, are disadvantaged, suffer from social deprivation and need extra help.  This Government expanded the number of pupils in our school system who will get a free hot meal every day by 60,000.  It is an important intervention that represents real change and makes a real difference to the lives of children and parents.  We make the case that that is a radical intervention by the Government.<\/p>  <p>  Similarly, school transport is provided for free to those who qualify.  All ticket holders availing of the school transport scheme will not face any charge for the 2022-23 school year.  In rural Ireland in particular, in the absence of a school transport scheme, parents could face a long commute when fuel costs are high to get their children to and from school.  This measure will make a real difference for many families, providing up to &euro;500.  It can be spread between two payments, in July and November, but many parents try to pay it in July to get it done.  They will not have to do so now.<\/p>  <p>  We are changing the back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance.  We acknowledge that it will not go far enough for many, but it is a genuine effort by the Government to help and to make a difference.  It comes on the back of all the other initiatives that we have taken since the last budget to address the cost-of-living crisis, which is not a crisis for everyone, but for many.  We have been advised time and again that when we make interventions, they should be targeted at those who need it the most.  I do not think anyone can argue that those who qualify for the back-to-school allowance are not those who need it the most.  We are giving them extra help.

As the Deputy is aware, we have made changes to the eligibility criteria for that additional needs payment.  People who are working full time can now qualify.

The Department has received a clear signal from the Government that these cases are to be looked at sympathetically, recognising the fact that people are facing extra costs at this time.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy also raised the issue of the industrial relations dispute.

Possibly, the worst of them all is the really catastrophic failure of the Government to deal with the housing crisis that is gripping this country.  It is a housing \"disaster\", as Fr. Peter McVerry rightly put it.  That failure means that we now have more than 10,300 families, including more than 3,000 children, who are homeless.  There are 120,000 families and households waiting on various housing lists.  We also have the vast majority of young and middle-aged working people who simply cannot afford the housing costs they face.<\/p>  <p>  Today we have had further evidence, in a report produced by the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, that this housing crisis is inflicting incredible hardship on people now, being unable to pay the rents being charged and being unable to purchase homes.  Moreover, the ESRI is now warning that the current generation of young workers and middle-aged workers are going to be put in a far worse position when they reach pension age than the generations before them.  Even though the Government says it is in favour of home ownership, such are the house prices now that huge numbers of people will never ever be able to own their own home.  The Government's own housing needs assessment for my area suggests that of the new households to be formed from now on, nobody in my area will be able to afford the house prices.  Nobody.  This means people will be prey to and trapped in a rental market when they become pensioners.  When their income drops, they will be prey to the insecure possibility, even as pensioners, that they could be evicted.<\/p>  <p>  This all comes on top of another ESRI report from just one month ago that stated the number of households in need of support from the Government to provide them with accommodation has increased massively, while the actual level of support has dropped.  Whereas 47% of people used to get social housing eligibility or support, this has dropped to 33%, which is a massive stealth cut in housing support made available by the Government.  Since last December the Government has sat on a report about raising the income threshold and has refused, despite promises, to give us the outcome of that report.  What is the Government going to do in response to the ESRI reports?  The ESRI is a Government-funded body.  Will the Government listen to it?

As a Government, we do fund the ESRI, which does outstanding work.  It is important that we have bodies such as the ESRI providing an independent analysis of what the Government is doing about the challenges we face as a country, and we take the output from the ESRI very seriously.  The report's key conclusion is that interventions, including increased supply, increased direct provision of social housing, and measures that develop alternative non-market rental cohorts, such as cost rental, will be critical to lowering housing costs for future cohorts.  I make the case that we as a Government are pursuing aggressively all of those avenues through the Housing For All plan.  We are the Government that is prioritising home ownership.  We are introducing new affordable housing initiatives.  We will have the launch of the new shared equity first home scheme imminently by the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien.  This will provide an opportunity for a lot of people to bridge the gap between what they can currently afford to borrow under market prudential rules and the amount they must pay for a home at this time.  It seems to be only the Deputies on this side of the House who see this as an issue and want to help individuals and couples in that situation.  In addition, the Land Development Agency, LDA, through its Project Tosaigh is identifying opportunities for development of social housing, cost rental housing, and affordable housing.  They are moving on site across the country across a range of different schemes.<\/p>  <p>  We also recognise the importance of the fresh start principle, that there are many people who have gone through a divorce or legal separation or who have perhaps lost their home because of bankruptcy or an insolvency procedure.  The Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, has adopted this principle so that all of the affordable housing initiatives the Government is rolling out, and the local authority loan scheme that has been approved, are to be made available to people who need that second chance to purchase a home as well.<\/p>  <p>  We are in the middle of the largest public housing programme in the history of the State.  This is what the Government is doing.  We have committed &euro;4 billion of capital every single year for the next number of years to make sure that we increase the supply of all types of homes, but especially public housing and social housing, whether it is delivered by local authorities or by approved housing bodies.  For the first time ever, cost rental housing is now coming on stream in Ireland.  For the first time ever, affordable housing is now directly enshrined in stand-alone legislation, which only the Government parties in this House supported.  We want to get away from the short-term rental supports.  I agree with the Deputy on that point.  When I look at what we are paying in housing assistance payments, HAP, which is a &euro;585 million in the budget this year, with the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, costing &euro;133 million and rent supplement costing &euro;80 million, the best way to get away from that is to build homes for our people and that is what this Government is focused on doing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070600022#U00600","speaker":"1459"},{"type":"speech","time":1657106520,"counter":102,"content":"<p>Why has the Government not announced the details of the review on the income eligibility thresholds for social housing and social housing support, despite a promise that this would be done before the summer recess?

The LDA has been in existence for four years with not one single social or affordable house delivered.  I repeat, it is not one single house from the LDA.

Last year, 3,038 households renting were served a notice to quit, mainly because the landlord was selling.  This is the highest number of tenant evictions to take place in a single year since the foundation of the State.  The number of families facing eviction has continued unabated into this year.<\/p>  <p>  Renters are living in fear and insecurity.  They are terrified of losing their home and facing the impossible task of finding somewhere else to rent.  A quarter of all children are growing up in an insecure private rental sector.  That is 281,000 children.  For a child, stability and security are fundamental to enable them to develop and grow.  <\/p>  <p>  I have two examples of families who came to my constituency office last week.  There was a young couple with one young child who got the go-ahead to self-accommodate.  The woman was on the phone ringing the hotels around Dublin city.  Councillor Pat Dunne was on the phone to the family support unit.  She eventually got a room that was available and the family support officer agreed.  However, the hotel priced the room at &euro;460 a night, without even breakfast.  The officer refused to pay that amount of money and said it was above the amount they could afford.<\/p>  <p>  Another woman with two teenagers will be homeless this week.  Councillor Pat Dunne contacted the family support unit, which replied that the person had notified the unit last month.  They were eligible for homeless HAP and the family support unit continued to say that she stated the need for two bedrooms.  It advised that in emergency accommodation only one bedroom would be provided, if even one was available on the day, as its service was currently at capacity.  There was no availability in the hubs.  It had three other families on top of these cases, who were resorting to sofa surfing and outstaying their welcome.  Families are splitting up children among friends or family.  The numbers presenting are greater than the numbers leaving the system at the moment.  <\/p>  <p>  Given the prices and unavailability in hotels, bed and breakfasts and hubs, my fear is we will have families back sleeping in cars or going to Garda stations.  We advise people who come into us before they actually leave to overhold if they have nowhere to go, and that is stressful in itself for families.  On the radio, one man said he was advised to go to a Garda station. <\/p>  <p>  The housing crisis is scarring a generation of children.  Hundreds of thousands of children are growing up in this country not knowing what is like to live in a stable, secure and safe home.  In May of last year, official figures showed 928 families and their 2,148 children were homeless.  In March of this year, that number rose to 2,811 children, which is a 37% increase in homeless children.<\/p>  <p>  It beyond time for a real housing emergency response from the Government.  One major response is the reinstatement of the eviction ban for two years and, at a minimum, to introduce a rent freeze.

She highlighted a number of individual cases that underline a real crisis for those individuals and families.  If she wants to provide the details of those individual cases to the Minister, Deputy Darragh O&rsquo;Brien, I have no doubt that he will follow up.  While the emergency accommodation system is undoubtedly under strain, emergency accommodation will be found for people who really need it.<\/p>  <p>  The real answer for us as a country is to build more public housing.  That is what we are back to doing now at scale as a country.  There will be about 9,000 direct build social houses this year by our councils and approved housing bodies.  That is what will help to provide permanent homes for people who are currently on the housing list and in some cases, unfortunately, are in emergency accommodation because they are effectively homeless.  It is an absolute priority for the Government to address that issue.  The availability of hotel accommodation at this time, as we all know, is under strain due to various reasons, including the fact that we have accommodated a very large number of refugees who have come to our country fleeing war, which is the right thing to do, and we have obligations to them as well.  However, it has placed the system under pressure.  There can be no question about that.  We are working very closely with a whole range of service providers in this sector.  We are providing much funding to different service providers to ensure that people who are in real need are afforded accommodation into the future.  <\/p>  <p>  The key thing is to make progress on the supply of new homes across all of the different types, because that is ultimately the best way to relieve some pressure in the system.  If we are building more homes and we have a flow of people going from one type of tenure to another, for example, if people on the list are receiving a council home, which are being built now at record numbers, that frees up capacity within the current emergency accommodation system for people who currently do not have accommodation.  <\/p>  <p>  We fully understand the scale of this challenge, which for so many people &ndash; the more than 10,000 in emergency accommodation - has reached a real crisis point.  It is our priority to address that by increasing supply and providing the support from the Exchequer to all of the service providers, local authorities, approved housing bodies and the LDA to provide more cost rental, affordable purchase and social homes.  We are making progress on that front.

It may be the cost of going to work that has gone wrong or it may come down to the availability of workers, but we have a situation that I have never seen before.  Excellent places that provide an excellent service are now, instead of being open seven days and seven nights, open for three nights or four nights, because they cannot get staff for the other nights.  I respectfully ask the Minister and the Government what, if anything, can be done to try to rectify this and put it right.  It is a shame to think of businesses that can provide a good service not being able to do so because of a lack of workers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070600026#Y00500","speaker":"1487"},{"type":"speech","time":1657108920,"counter":180,"content":"<p>I assure the Deputy that this is an issue all over the country, and not just in the Kingdom of Kerry.

Deputies will be aware that the prior approval of the Oireachtas is required under Article 29.4.7&deg; of the Constitution if Ireland wishes to take part in an EU measure whose legal base falls under Part 3, Title 5 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, TFEU.  The proposed measure before the House today has its legal base under Title 5 and, therefore, it requires such approval.  The proposal is for an EU directive on minimum common standards in member states to protect individuals and bodies, particularly journalists and human rights defenders, against the type of manifestly unfounded or abusive court proceedings commonly known as strategic lawsuits against public participation, SLAPP.<\/p><p>The proposal, which was first presented by the European Commission on 27 April 2022, forms part of a number of initiatives by the European Commission to reinforce the application of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and to strengthen protection for democracy and the rule of law at EU level.  It responds to increasing concerns expressed by the Council of Europe, the European Parliament, the European Commission and NGOs across Europe concerned with press freedom and the protection of human rights about the rising threats to democracy and human rights, particularly in physical and legal threats to media freedom and the safety of journalists.  A particular concern has been the SLAPP actions.  The proposal defines &quot;SLAPP&quot; as manifestly unfounded or abusive court proceedings brought against those engaging in public participation on matters of public interest in order to deter them from such participation.  The objective is less to reach a determination of the main proceedings than to threaten, exhaust and silence the defendant by using procedural strategies such as artificially inflating legal costs, maximising delays, threatening the defendant with exorbitant penalties, making unfounded accusations or issuing multiple proceedings in different jurisdictions.<\/p><p>The proposal explains that the characteristic purpose of SLAPP proceedings is not to seek access to justice, but rather to close down the freedom of expression and the information that is essential in a democracy.  SLAPP actions are therefore seen as not only a threat to the defendant but also an abuse of court time and resources and a potential threat to democracy, fundamental rights and the public interest.  Obviously, the proposed directive will have to strike a careful balance between the right to freedom of expression and information in the public interest and the rights of access to justice and to an effective remedy.  It is important to underline that, under the proposal, whether a particular set of proceedings amounts to SLAPP would remain a decision for the national court.  The purpose of the proposed directive is rather to ensure that every member state provides a minimum common toolbox of procedural safeguards to their judges and tribunals in order to protect defendants across the EU against such actions and to prevent these abusive actions from developing and proliferating.<\/p><p>I will outline the main minimum procedural safeguards that are proposed.  First is the provision for SLAPP defendants to seek early dismissal of proceedings as manifestly unfounded.  In that application the burden of proof falls on the SLAPP plaintiff to show that the action is not manifestly unfounded.  If the defendant seeks early dismissal, the main proceedings must be stayed until a final decision is made on the early dismissal application, which must be treated as an accelerated procedure.<\/p><p>Second is the provision for an SLAPP defendant to seek a court order that the SLAPP plaintiff provides advance security for the defendant's costs, for example, that the plaintiff lodges money in the court if the court considers that appropriate due to elements indicating abusive proceedings.<\/p><p>Third is the provision that the court may accept third party intervention in the SLAPP proceedings by specialised NGOs on behalf of the defendants.  The role of the NGO may be either to provide support to the defendant or to provide relevant information to the court.<\/p><p>Fourth, if the court or tribunal concludes that the proceedings are abusive, it must have power to impose effective, proportionate and dissuasive penalties on the SLAPP plaintiff and to order that the plaintiff bear the full costs of the proceedings.  These should include the full costs of legal representation incurred by the SLAPP defendant unless such costs are excessive.<\/p> <p>Any SLAPP defendant who has suffered harm as a result of the proceedings must be able to claim and obtain full compensation for that harm.<\/p> <p> It is proposed that the courts and tribunals in any member state would also have the power to refuse to recognise or enforce the judgment of a non-EU state, if it arises in proceedings which, under the law of the member state, would have been considered a SLAPP.  Member states are also required to ensure that if an abusive action is brought in a non-EU country against a defendant domiciled in a member state, that defendant may seek compensation in his or her member state of domicile for damages and costs incurred in the third-country proceedings, irrespective of the SLAPP plaintiff's country of domicile.<\/p> <p> Many of these procedural safeguards are already, to a greater or lesser extent, available in our own legal system.  It is important to note that the proposed directive is limited to matters of a civil or commercial nature.  It does not cover any criminal proceedings.  In addition, the proposed directive to apply the proceedings in accordance with the treaty legal base must have cross-border implications.  Under the proposal, these are taken to exist where either or both of the parties are not domiciled in the same member state as the court seized of the proceedings; the act of public participation against which the court proceedings have been taken is relevant to more than one member state; or the plaintiff or connected entities have initiated concurrent or previous proceedings against the same or associated defendants in another member state.<\/p> <p> It is useful to mention how some of the key terms are defined in the proposed directive.  \"Public participation\" is defined as any statement or activity expressed or carried out in the exercise of the right to freedom of expression or information on a matter of public interest, along with preparatory supporting or assisting activities.  A \"matter of public interest\" is defined as any matter which affects the public to such an extent that it may legitimately take an interest in it in areas such as public health, safety, the environment, climate, or the enjoyment of fundamental rights; activities of a person or entity in the public eye or of public interest; allegations of corruption, fraud or criminality; activities aiming to fight disinformation; and matters under public consideration or review by a legislative, executive or judicial body, or any other public official proceedings.  \"Manifestly unfounded\" proceedings are not defined by the proposal.  The Commission considers this a term recognised in member states' legal systems and can be interpreted and applied by national judges at their discretion.  \"Abusive proceedings\" in this context are defined as proceedings that are fully or partially unfounded and have as their purpose to prevent, restrict or penalise public participation.  According to the proposal, such proceedings typically involve litigation tactics used in bad faith, such as delaying proceedings, causing disproportionate costs to the defendant in the proceedings, or forum shopping, which are often combined with threats, intimidation or harassment.<\/p> <p> I should of course mention that in Ireland the issue of SLAPPs has already been considered in the report of the review of the Defamation Act 2009, which the Government approved for publication on 1 March 2022.  The report noted that while the term SLAPPs is not explicitly used in submissions to the public consultation on reform of the Defamation Act 2009, a number of submissions from journalists, representative bodies and the print and broadcast media raised fears and concerns that echo those typical of SLAPP cases.  The key recommendations of the defamation report include a recommendation to introduce a new anti-SLAPP mechanism to allow a person to apply to the court for summary dismissal of the proceedings that he or she believes are a SLAPP.  The Minister for Justice has indicated she is preparing and amending the defamation Bill to give effect to the recommendations of the report.  Deputies will recall the defamation report was discussed in the House on 11 May and this recommendation was widely supported.  However, the proposal in the directive applies both more widely and more narrowly in referring only to proceedings that have cross-border implications.<\/p> <p> This is clearly an important proposal.  Subject to the approval of both Houses, it appears desirable for Ireland to opt into the proposal at this stage, before its adoption, in order to ensure we can participate fully in the council's deliberations and the final text of the directive takes full account of our legal systems.  We therefore recommend the motion to the House and ask Deputies to support it. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070600028#FF00200","speaker":"1493","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657110420,"counter":205,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

While the Commission, in its explanatory memorandum to the proposal to the directive, focuses on journalists and human rights defenders, in this State today the central problem is in fact large developers instigating very expensive strategic litigations against public participation against groups with very limited resources to try to, in essence, destroy the good work such groups are trying to do in the courts.  I will evidence some of that.  While we support the motion, I urge the Minister of State to take back to his colleagues the need for domestic legislation to deal with domestic strategic litigation because that is where the problem is.  I am sure I will not be the only Deputy who will raise that.<\/p>  <p>  I will give a couple of examples by way of cases that have already been widely reported in the media.  It is important to put them on the D&aacute;il record.  In Dublin city centre, a large apartment development, Ivy Exchange, was built during the Celtic tiger with very significant fire safety and structural defects.  The apartment owners' management company is trying to avail of the only redress it currently has, which is taking the developer, Cosgrave's, through the courts to remediate the building that would cost the homeowners tens of thousands of euro otherwise.  Cosgrave's has initiated a strategic litigation-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070600029#GG00200","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speech","time":1657110420,"counter":206,"content":"<p>I ask the Deputy not to use names.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070600029#GG00300","speaker":"1562"},{"type":"speech","time":1657110420,"counter":207,"content":"<p>I will make no apology for this.  It is in the public domain, it has been reported in the newspapers and it is a matter before the courts.  These are precisely the kind of cases - I will not name any individuals - where company names have been reported in the public domain.  I want to repeat them in the Chamber.  I will not go beyond anything that is in the public domain, if that is okay.<\/p><p>Cosgrave's has initiated a strategic litigation against the owners' management company, OMC.  It is trying to bankrupt that OMC and deny it the very legitimate right to pursue the developer it believes is responsible for the defects in the courts.  In February this year, the <i>Irish Independent <\/i>reported on how a developer was threatening a Tidy Towns group with legal action.  Ardstone Homes was reported as the litigant against Ballyboden Tidy Towns group.  In May this year, <i>The Irish Times<\/i>also reported proceedings taken by the Marlet Property Group against residents in Killiney, County Dublin, again, to deny them access to the courts.  A very reputable legal practice, FP Logue solicitors, which many Members will know, is being subject to legal proceedings by Marlet and threats of legal proceedings by Ardstone among others.  I thank the Acting Chairman for his latitude.  The reason it is important to name these cases in the House is these are examples of the strategic litigation against public participation that is happening right now in our State.  As far as I understand it, there is nothing in the EU directive that will prevent such strategic litigations continuing into the future.<\/p><p>There is also a broader issue here.  Under the Aarhus Convention, people have a right to access information, especially about the environment and public health, as well as a right to access to the courts.  We are currently having a debate in the Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage and the Attorney General is looking at the matter of planning reform.  The issue of judicial reviews of planning decisions is back in the newspapers.  The important thing about judicial reviews is the issue is not whether one supports the grounds upon which somebody takes a judicial review.  It is whether people have a right to access justice under the terms of the Aarhus Convention.<\/p> <p>It is absolutely the case that judicial reviews take far too long.  If we had a dedicated planning and environment court that was adequately staffed with professionals at the back end, we could dispense with them much more quickly.  Government is actively considering a set of proposals that were contained in the general scheme of a heads of Bill last year to greatly restrict the grounds upon which citizens or groups, including environmental NGOs, would be able to seek access to justice.  It would make no sense, in my view, to sign up to an EU directive that is meant to have a set of common standards to prevent strategic litigation against public participation at the same time as the Government is trying to reduce the grounds upon which people access public participation through the planning process or the courts.  That is not an argument against reforming the system.  It takes far too long both for public and private developments.  The best way to reform the system is not to make it more expensive for people to seek access to justice or to narrow the grounds for taking such cases, but rather to reform the planning and courts system to do it more expediently.<\/p> <p> There is also another problem, which was seen most recently in the Kilkenny case involving Glanbia.  It is not a planning application that I know anything about.  I am not going to comment on the application or consider the merits of it on one side or another.  One of the statutory consultees to that planning process, An Taisce, which is a body that is named in legislation as a statutory consultee, was subject to the most appalling public bullying by Government Ministers, Government Deputies and, indeed, some opposition Deputies.  I am not saying that what An Taisce was doing is right or wrong.  However, under our law, it has a right as a statutory consultee to engage in the planning process and the arising judicial proceedings after that.  It seems to me that on the one hand, Government is telling us that it would like to protect citizens and organisations from strategic litigation, yet the very same Government is quite happy to apply very public and inappropriate pressure on statutory consultees, such as An Taisce, that are simply doing their job.  It is absolutely the case that the legal appeals that An Taisce took delayed the process enormously.  There is an easier way to deal with that, using the mechanisms I outlined earlier.  I know that the Government supports those mechanisms, but it has yet to enact a dedicated planning and environmental court and tighter statutory timelines on decisions by An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  In fact, in this issue in general very recently, the director for implementation, governance and semester in the Directorate-General for the Environment of the European Commission had some very critical things to say about the Government's poor record in ensuring that citizens and environmental organisations have adequate access to information and justice in our planning process.  In some public commentary, Mr. Aurel Ciobanu-Dordea pointed out that in fact this jurisdiction \"continues to be the most expensive member state in which to make an environmental claim before the courts\".  He went on to say that this \"has left many environmental litigants unable to predict with any certainty the costs exposure\" involved.  The reason that I am raising the point is that if we are going to ensure that people, citizens, journalists, human rights defenders, residents' organisations, Tidy Towns groups or environmental NGOs, have full access to public participation in our planning system and in other issues of public interest, then we have to do it across the board.  We cannot just support a sensible, albeit very modest, proposal from the European Commission for transboundary minimum standards against strategic litigation against public participation.  We must enshrine it in domestic law and in the reforms to our planning system, and ensure that politicians of all parties on both sides of this House, even when they disagree, respect the right of citizens, organisations and statutory consultees to engage in the planning process.<\/p> <p> I know this is not the Minister of State's primary area of responsibility.  I suspect that other Members may share the following request.  I ask that the Minister of State brings these wider concerns directly related to the subject under discussion to the line Minister and for her to correspond with the spokespeople from the various parties on whether or not she has any plans to deal with these wider issues.  It would make no sense to sign up to an EU directive and for Government to say that it is not going to enact comparable domestic legislation to deal with strategic litigation against public participation in this jurisdiction.  I urge the Government to do so.  If it does that, it will certainly have the active support of our party, subject to the detail of any legislative proposals brought forward.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070600029#GG00400","speaker":"1468","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657111020,"counter":209,"content":"<p>I have five minutes to speak.  It took me longer than five minutes to read the directive.  It is a point that I make almost every day now as we go through directives that are important for the lives of people, when we only have a few minutes to participate in the debate.  The matter at hand is an important issue because it concerns the functioning of our democracy.  I suggest that if we asked people in the street what a strategic lawsuit against public participation, SLAPP, was, the vast majority would have no idea.  Certainly, if we used the acronym SLAPP, they would have less of an idea what we are talking about.  In fact, it is a hard thing to define.  At its core, it is a notion that a powerful individual, company or entity seeks to silence its weaker critics by launching litigation that has no merit, but whose purpose is to cow, bully, intimidate and silence.<\/p><p>Obviously, there are a number of issues that arise.  One is the problem that it cannot be determined that a lawsuit has no merit until the case is actually heard in some preliminary form.  Obviously, powerful interests are entitled to use the courts, as is every other citizen, company and entity.  We need to find solutions for that.  My first question is whether this is the solution, or whether should we be dealing with it in our own domestic law.  It is quite clear that we should be dealing with it in our own domestic law.  I would go into it in more detail if I had more time, but bluntly, the actual <i>vires<\/i>of the Commission in advocating for this particular directive is on thin enough ground.  It has multinational requirements because it is anchored in Article 81 of the Treaty of the Functioning of the EU, TFEU.  For that article to apply, there must be a cross-border dimension.  Article 81(1) states: &quot;The Union shall develop judicial cooperation in civil matters having cross-border implications, based on the principle of mutual recognition of judgments and of decisions in extrajudicial cases.&quot;  In particular, Article 81(2)<i>(f)<\/i>of the treaty states that the European Parliament and the Council may adopt measures aimed at ensuring &quot;the elimination of obstacles to the proper functioning of civil proceedings, if necessary by promoting the compatibility of the rules on civil procedure applicable in the Member States&quot;.  If I had more time, I would go into the detail of why I think the underpinning of the directive is thin enough legal grounds.  However, it is part of a package of measures that I strongly support from the Commissioner for Justice, Mr. Didier Reynders.  He is working on a package of measures aimed at tackling abusive litigation.  I am afraid that too often, we see abusive litigation and the intimidation of people who voice their opinions on a range of matters.  I must say that it has also been used by politicians to silence journalists by taking pre-emptive legal action.  That was mentioned by the Minister of State in his contribution in relation to the report of the review of the Defamation Act 2009.  Although the report does not use the term SLAPP directly, a number of submissions were made by journalist representative bodies from the print and broadcast media raising concerns that echoed those raised in relation to the intimidation of voices of criticism.<\/p><p>In essence, I strongly believe in and have no difficulty in supporting this directive, limited and all as it is.  However, we really need to enact domestic legislation on the matter.  That is my main message to the Minister of State today.  Formulating co-operation and joined-up thinking on issues like this at an EU level is important, but if we look at the different legal structures of the member states, they are very different.  Some have non-existent protection and others provide for vague enough protection.  We must deal with the matter fundamentally in our own domestic legislation first.  Let us prove best practice so that we can ensure access to the law, which is the right of every citizen and entity under our Constitution and is a welcome and good thing, is not used as a form of abuse to silence or intimidate voices of criticism.<\/p> <p>Those with deep pockets can go to the courts, access expensive lawyers and they can prevail, despite the merits of their arguments, over weaker citizens or groups of citizens in our State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070600030#HH00200","speaker":"1620","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657111620,"counter":211,"content":"<p>The purpose of this directive would be to provide protection to individuals and organisations, particularly journalists, whistleblowers, watchdogs and human rights activists, against so-called SLAPP lawsuits.  SLAPPs can be described quite simply as privatised censorship.  The vast majority of SLAPPs are pursued by wealthy and powerful litigants with the sole purpose to intimidate and silence their critics.  They are an abuse of the legal system, an insult to the concept of free speech and freedom of expression and a danger to our democracy.  They lack legal merit and once they are presented in court, the vast majority are dismissed.  That is not the issue at hand because the damage inflicted by SLAPPs happens a long time before they ever reach the courts.  These lawsuits are characterised by lengthy and expensive litigation, crafted solely to drain an individual&rsquo;s finances, isolate and intimidate them and ultimately silence them.  It does that, I have seen it happen and I endorse the points that have been made on developers.  I could not believe it the first time I heard of that being used.<\/p><p>I mentioned individuals because in recent years the majority of these lawsuits were directed at individual journalists or activists rather than the organisations they worked for.  This is a tactic to isolate them from the automatic legal and financial support they would otherwise be entitled to and to expose them personally to the costs of the cases.  The cost of a single court case would bankrupt many small media outlets or human rights organisations and even the larger organisations can only withstand so many.  That is before you start talking about the impact it would have on an individual.  The financial and legal vulnerabilities of the media sector are well-known and they are exploited in order to suppress stories.<\/p><p>According to research conducted by the Foreign Policy Centre, 73% of investigative journalists in Europe received legal communications as a result of information they had published.  Most of these, 71%, had come from corporations or other business entities.  We know the courts are favoured by wealthy people and we have seen them used for that purpose in this jurisdiction as well.  The defences proposed by the European Commission were dubbed Daphne&rsquo;s law after the Maltese anti-corruption journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia, who was assassinated by a car bomb on 16 October 2017.  At the time of her death she was facing more than 40 lawsuits.  In advance of her brutal murder she talked about the impact the cases had on her and how they scared other people off from doing what she was doing.  This is not just an issue abroad; these lawsuits are incredibly common in Ireland and are especially damaging to journalists and to human rights groups and activists.  We are seeing community-based individuals who have a legitimate reason to be concerned, including in the sector of development.  Not all developments are good ones and there are developments that must be opposed.  Shutting that opposition down does not improve the built environment or our environment.  It is obvious that this is happening.<\/p><p>I was contacted this week by a woman who is facing a SLAPP as a result of her human rights activism in Ireland.  Before this case was taken against her she did not know what a SLAPP was.  She had never spoken to a solicitor in her life outside of getting a mortgage and then suddenly she was sitting in front of a solicitor who was telling her she might need to sell her house in order to afford the case being taken against her by a powerful public person in this State.  She said:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThe whole process is deeply shaming, terrifying and very, very isolating&hellip;the aim is to exhaust you emotionally and it is powerfully effective.  I've already had to get two loans from the credit union just to be told I'll be brought to the high court. <\/blockquote>  <p>That is happening now to an individual in this country.<\/p><p>This directive would provide for common procedural safeguards in EU member states to protect against these lawsuits.  The safeguards would include the early dismissal of proceedings, which the Minister of State has already gone into in his opening comments.  This is welcome but, as has been said, it only applies to cases that have a cross-border element.  We need to replicate these measures in domestic legislation and we need to do so urgently to protect people in this State from legal harassment by powerful individuals and corporations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070600031#JJ00200","speaker":"1489"},{"type":"speech","time":1657111620,"counter":212,"content":"<p>The Watson Killiney Residents Association in my area had a SLAPP taken against it because it sought a judicial review against a decision by An Bord Plean&aacute;la to grant permission for a strategic housing development by Atlas GP Ltd., a developer owned by Pat Crean of Marlet Property Group.  This information is in the public domain and has been widely reported.  That case has been taken against eight members of the residents association in a precise attempt to intimidate them against their legal right to take a judicial review against a strategic housing development on the grounds that it breached a county development plan, did not have a proper environmental impact assessment, EIA, and screening and so on.  These eight individuals include a woman who is 92 years of age and they had agreed to an initial development of 108 apartments.  However, they took umbrage when a strategic housing development then jacked that up to 255 apartments, which is a legitimate concern.<\/p>  <p>  That is what these SLAPPs are about.  They are widespread across the world and we see them in Ireland where big corporations and wealthy individuals use the money and resources they have at their disposal to try to intimidate communities, environmentalists, human rights activists and journalists from asking questions or challenging their interests.  They have to be stopped so we support this directive but, as has been said, it only concerns cross-border issues so it does not help the residents in that situation or in some of the other examples that Deputy &Oacute; Broin gave earlier.

The aim of the SLAPP is not to win the case but to use the procedure to intimidate, tire out and consume the financial and psychological resources of those who have spoken out.  They aim to achieve a chilling effect and silence those who would speak out similarly.<\/p>  <p>  The number of SLAPPs across Europe is increasing year on year and it is relatively well-known how they are being used to target newspapers and journalists.  I would like to highlight how they are being used to target activists, people who regularly are without great resources, if any, at their disposal, for whom a legal threat can be a scary experience.  In this country for example, a SLAPP has been used by a conservative anti-abortion campaigner against a person who campaigns for safe zones outside hospitals where abortions are carried out.  Activists within one of the most vulnerable and marginalised communities in our society, our transgender community, have been in touch with my office to register with me the sharp increase in the number of SLAPPs being used against activists in their community who make legitimate comment on issues of pressing concern to that community.<\/p>  <p>  As we are debating a justice issue, I want to take a brief moment to raise a serious matter which highlights the need for sentencing guidelines for certain sensitive cases.

I will make some specific points and, in doing so, I will underline the importance of the proposal and our opting in to it at this stage.  The Government has decided that, subject to the approval of the D&aacute;il and Seanad, Ireland should opt in to the proposal at this stage to ensure we can participate in the discussions on the proposals and that the final text of the directive is shaped to accommodate our common law system as much as possible.  There is also a strong reputational aspect to be considered for opting in to this proposal at this stage.<\/p>  <p>  The proposal forms a significant element of the European Commission's European democracy action plan.  It also complements other Commission initiatives, for example, the strategy on strengthening the application of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and the rule of law reports.  Democracy, the rule of law and fundamental rights are the foundations upon which the European Union is based.  A cornerstone of a healthy and thriving democracy is a guarantee that people can participate actively in public debate without undue interference.  For meaningful participation, people must have access to reliable information and be able to form their own judgment on the basis of that information.  It is therefore vital to protect journalists and others engaged in public participation on matters of public interest from manifestly unfounded or abusive court proceedings.  It is desirable to demonstrate our support for these important principles by opting in to the proposal at the earliest possible stage.<\/p>  <p>  The proposed directive refers in particular to the right to participate in democratic life contained in Article 10 of the Treaty on European Union, the right to freedom of information and expression contained in Article 11 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, the corresponding right to freedom of expression under Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights, the right to respect for private and family life under Article 7 and to protection of personal data under Article 8 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights and the right to an effective remedy and a fair trial under article 47 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.<\/p>  <p>  Respect for fundamental rights, including the right of access to justice, will be at the heart of the debate on the proposed directive and its interpretation by the European Court of Justice and national courts.  The purpose of the proposal is to protect against unfounded or abusive court proceedings.  It is not to prevent or impede access to justice or to prevent a person from protecting his or her good name or reputation, rights protected by our Constitution.  The proposal therefore includes procedural safeguards, for example, a case can only be dismissed in full or part at an early stage if the judge considers it is manifestly unfounded; any decision in relation to an early dismissal must be subject to appeal; where a defendant applies for the early dismissal of a case, the main proceedings are stayed until such time as the final decision is made on the application to have the case dismissed; and if an early dismissal application is not granted, the plaintiff can continue with his or her action.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, the safeguards put forward by the proposed directive seek to address specific identified features of SLAPP suits taken by certain parties against journalists and human rights defenders.  These include the deliberate issue of proceedings known to be without merit and maximising of delays and ancillary court applications in order to impose highly exaggerated legal costs; ongoing stress and time burdens; the issue of multiple or duplicate proceedings in a single jurisdiction; the issue of proceedings in multiple jurisdictions, often ones to which the parties and the dispute have no real connection; the waste of court time and resources and drag on court systems due to artificially delayed and duplicate proceedings which have no legal merit; often a significant imbalance of power and financial resources, which pressurises the target of the SLAPP action to withdraw from public participation on the issue in dispute, even where the action appears unfounded; and the subsequent weakening of investigative journalism and defence of human rights, together with public participation more widely.  The proposed directive is therefore an important response.  There is merit in Ireland opting in at this juncture in order to ensure we can participate in shaping it.<\/p>  <p>  In reply to remarks by Deputy &Oacute; Broin, the European Commission has noted publicly that Ireland is among the first four EU members to commit themselves to introducing anti-SLAPP legislation domestically, as the Government has now done in relation to the reform of defamation laws.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Howlin is correct in noting that the directive refers to matters with a cross-border dimension and, for reasons of its legal competence, the Commissioner who is responsible for the directive has publicly acknowledged this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070600032#KK00600","speaker":"1493"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1657112220,"counter":222,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Planning and Development (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2022: Second Stage","time":1657112220,"counter":223,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070600032#KK00800"},{"type":"speech","time":1657112220,"counter":224,"content":"<p>I move: \"That the Bill be now read a Second Time.\"<\/p>  <p>  I am grateful for the opportunity to introduce this Bill and thank Members for facilitating the passage of this important substitute consent legislation through the Houses in advance of the summer recess.  The purpose of the Bill is to amend the Planning and Development Act 2000, as relating to substitute consent procedures.  Substitute consent is a process that concerns applications seeking to regularise existing developments requiring retrospective environmental impact assessment or appropriate assessment in exceptional circumstances.  This Bill seeks to streamline the process and provide for a single-stage application process and it achieves this by the deletion of the initial leave to appeal stage. <\/p>  <p> The amendments in the Bill follow prior amendments introduced by sections 6, 7 and 8 of the Planning and Development, and Residential Tenancies, Act 2020, enacted on 19 December 2020.  That legislation was introduced as an initial interim response to the Supreme Court judgment issued on 1 July 2020 in the Ballysax-McQuaid cases, three joined appeal cases relating to two quarries.  <\/p> <p>The 2020 Act's amendments ensured that the findings of the judgment were addressed and that the issue of the exceptional circumstances in each substitute consent application case would be considered not only at the initial leave to apply stage, but also at the substantive application stage, where full public participation is involved.  In deciding on exceptional circumstances, the board must consider a number of prescribed matters including whether regularisation of the development concerned would circumvent the environmental impact assessment, EIA, or habitats directives and whether the applicant could reasonably have been of the belief that the development was not unauthorised.<\/p> <p> I should have said at the start that the Chairman of the Oireachtas joint committee, Deputy Matthews, has been in contact with my office.  To let both Members who are present, Deputies &Oacute; Broin and Cian O'Callaghan, know, there will a briefing at official level arranged for Monday, in advance of Committee Stage.  The Deputies will be contacted with regard to the specific time.  <\/p> <p> The 2020 Act's amendments effectively rendered redundant the initial leave to apply stage, which did not involve public participation.  In the present Bill's proposed deletion of the redundant leave to apply stage, it has ensured that the 2000 Act retains all of the established the criteria that the board, as the competent authority, is required to consider when determining whether exceptional circumstances exist in substitute consent applications on a case-by-case basis.  <\/p> <p> Related amendments are proposed to section 34(12) of the 2000 Act to clarify provisions for planning authorities and the board to screen applications for retention permission for EIA and appropriate assessment, AA, and to refuse to consider applications for retention of unauthorised developments where either EIA or AA are screened in, in which case the applicant can only consider the substitute consent process.<\/p> <p> Amendments are also proposed to extend section 37L of the Planning and Development Act, which currently allows simultaneous applications for any future development to An Bord Plean&aacute;la and applications for substitute consent for certain quarries only.  The proposed amendment to section 37L will allow for simultaneous applications to be made in respect of all types of developments.  This amendment is to encourage the regularisation and remediation of unauthorised developments, as well as allowing an integrated assessment by the board of such related proposals, which will also be of benefit to the understanding of the public.  <\/p> <p> Some concerns were expressed in the Seanad with regard to the extension of such applications for future-facing development beyond certain quarries.  I am keen for these concerns to be addressed in this House as they were in the Seanad.  At the outset, it is important to note that it is a material consideration of An Bord Plean&aacute;la in considering whether exceptional circumstances exist in a substitute consent proposal, without which the substitute consent application must be refused, whether the applicant had or could reasonably have had a belief that the development was not unauthorised.  There is also the additional material consideration of whether the applicant has complied with previous planning permissions granted or has previously carried out unauthorised development.  In other words, the risk of exceptional circumstances not being deemed to exist and an existing development therefore being refused substitute consent is apparent if applicants cannot adequately demonstrate their bona fides that they could reasonably have had a belief that their development was not unauthorised.<\/p> <p> Any perceived benefits to section 37L future-facing applications in being able to apply directly to the board rather than having to separately apply to the relevant planning authority first will be significantly outweighed by the inherent vulnerabilities and significant potential financial exposure if the related substitute consent application is refused.  In such cases, the relevant planning authority will be statutorily obliged to initiate enforcement proceedings against the unauthorised development seeking remediation of the site.  Furthermore, the future-facing planning application on the same site or an adjoining site may also be refused as a result of, for example, it relying on any element of the refused substitute consent proposal.  In other words, the legislative provision to allow parallel substitute consent and planning applications is not in any way developer-friendly in focus or scope in light of the significant constraints and vulnerabilities for any developer attaching to progressing a substitute consent proposal.  I also note the benefits to the public of allowing a parallel holistic assessment of two related proposals on the same site or adjoining sites to take place at the same time.  <\/p> <p> The amendments proposed by Government by way of this Bill are intended to act in exceptional circumstances to bring developments that have been determined to be operating outside of environmental planning law back into the planning framework irrespective of the commercial value of the site.  In the very rare cases where substitute consent is being sought, this is done after a bona fide mistake has been realised by a developer.  However, it should be noted that, if the substitute consent application is refused, the future development proposal must also be refused.<\/p> <p> I also wish to inform the House of my intention to introduce Government amendments as the Bill makes its way through the legislative process on Committee Stage.  These amendments relate not only to planning legislation, but to other legislation that is within the remit of my Department.  It may be of note that four of the six proposed groups of Committee Stage amendments were previously flagged during the Second Stage debate on this Bill in the Seanad.  These comprise amendments to the ministerial directions provision contained within section 31 and related sections of the Planning and Development Act,  amendments relating to flexibility in planning provisions and judicial review provisions in the Planning and Development Act and amendments to the provisions of the Valuation Act 2001.  I will now outline the intended purpose of each of the six groups of amendments I propose to move on Committee Stage, which also include amendments to include provisions on short-term letting in the Planning and Development Act and to make technical amendments to the Maritime Area Planning Act 2021.  As I said earlier on, at the request of the Oireachtas joint committee and its Chairman, Deputy Matthews, my officials will brief Deputies in detail on these matters in advance of Committee Stage on Monday.<\/p> <p> With regard to short-term lettings, it is further proposed to table amendments on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il with the aim of strengthening the pre-existing regulatory controls in this area.  The detailed operational arrangements and other related ancillary provisions in respect of the certification requirement will be provided for in supplementary regulations which it is intended to make by the end of July, contingent on the enactment of this Bill.  These amendments are being proposed in the context of the ongoing accommodation shortage in the private rental sector, particularly in the areas of highest housing demand, specifically the rent pressure zones, with associated knock-on implications for rental prices in these areas.  These pressures have been further exacerbated by the recent arrival into the State of large numbers of people fleeing Ukraine who are in need of medium to long-term accommodation, which is likely to continue into the future.<\/p> <p> On ministerial directions, I propose to table technical amendments consequent on the establishment of the Office of the Planning Regulator in 2019 and on foot of advice received from the Attorney General.  These amendments will ensure that the legislative procedures of section 31 of the Planning and Development Act, including, but not limited to, sections 31AM and 31AN, which relate to development plans and variations, and sections 31AO and 31AP, which relate to local area plans and the relationship between them, are improved.  This will be achieved by providing greater clarity in the consistency of procedures and of language to address matters such as correct cross-referencing and notifications for both the draft direction stage and the final direction stage.  Amendments are proposed to provide for a timeframe for the office to recommend that a Minister issue a direction.  Amendments are also proposed to introduce a new section to set out the process for the Minister to issue a final direction.  The intent of these amendments is to clarify this process at final direction stage and to set out a timeline allowing for the inclusion of strategic environmental assessment and appropriate assessment, where appropriate.  A further amendment has been provided to set out the procedure involved if the Minister does not agree with the recommendations of the office.  This is currently set out at draft direction stage and we therefore believe it is appropriate for this process to be reflected at proposed final direction stage.<\/p> <p> The purpose of amendments on flexibility in planning applications is to address a High Court decision from last summer relating to the concept of a design envelope approach in planning applications.  Prior to this judgment, while not specifically provided for in legislation, the design envelope approach had been an accepted feature of the Irish planning system and had been successfully applied up to this time.  The approach proposed in the legislative amendments involves a pre-application process in which prospective applicants who wish to avail of flexibility in their application request a meeting with the planning authority or An Bord Plean&aacute;la in respect of a development of a strategic nature in advance of submitting the planning application.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070600032#KK00900","speaker":"1561","continuing":true}]
