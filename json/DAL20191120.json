Under current law, hate crimes are prosecuted under general criminal law rather than through a specific hate crime offence.  Where a perpetrator is found guilty of a crime such as, for example, assault or criminal damage, a sentencing judge may consider a hate motive to be an aggravating factor that would increase the sentence.<\/p>  <p>  I acknowledge the work of my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, who is present, in this area.  In order to ensure that any new legislation in this field is as robust and effective as possible, the Minister of State and I, along with our Department, are finalising research on the effectiveness of legislative approaches in other jurisdictions to tackling hate crime.  This research will allow us to learn from experience elsewhere and identify the approach that will work best in Ireland.  When the work concludes in the coming weeks, I plan to incorporate the learning from the research and bring forward proposals for new hate crime legislation in the new year.  These proposals will be published for discussion and an opportunity will be given to experts, communities and the public to share their views. <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the Minister of State and I, through our Department, have been running a public consultation since October on the separate but related issue of incitement to hatred.

We need to remind all people, particularly those in the political domain, that it is a criminal offence to publish written material that is threatening, abusive or insulting and is intended or likely to stir up hatred against groups because of their race, colour, religion or national origin.  That should be brought to the attention of certain figures in the Minister's party, given their recent utterances.<\/p>  <p>  I refer to the legislation which provides for hate crime to be taken account of as an aggravating factor.  It is important to point out that there have been many promises to review hate crime legislation or put new legislation on to the Statute Book.  As far back as 2000, the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, former Deputy John O'Donoghue, stated his Department was reviewing the effectiveness of laws on incitement to hatred.  A review was carried out by the University of Limerick in 2008.  In reply to a parliamentary question tabled in 2016, the former Minister for Justice and Equality, Frances Fitzgerald, stated there would be a review of the 1989 Act.  It is important that we take that into account and get an answer from the Minister on when this legislation will be brought forward.   A public consultation has recently been announced.

My Department is leading several cross-Government initiatives to tackle racism.  As the House will be aware, the migrant integration strategy published in 2017 sets out the Government's commitment to the promotion of migrant integration and provides a framework for a wide range of actions to support migrants to participate fully in Irish life.

In 2018-19, 103,000 such offences were recorded in England and Wales, while in 2012-13, the number was only 42,000.  There is a reason that these offences are increasing.  It is partly due to populism and partly due to social media.  Some of it is also due to intolerance.  Obviously, there has been greater immigration into countries in recent years.  This appears to have been used inexplicably as justification for it as well so we need to challenge these utterances and to be very severe about it.

This committee will have a mandate to examine what needs to be done by public sector bodies as well as the wider community to challenge racism and racist commentary head on in this country.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has also taken a number of important steps recently that are consistent with the migrant integration strategy.  A diversity and integrity strategy has been adopted, including a working definition of hate crime, to assist An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in delivering a victim-centred service and ensure that it responds consistently and in a robust manner to reports of hate crime.

I assure the Deputy that my Department is closely examining its recommendations with a view to bringing forward amending legislation.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to understand the context of the report.  The Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017 has been widely recognised as landmark legislation dealing with consent and exploitation in sexual activity.  For the first time, it set out in statute what consent actually means, namely, a free and voluntary agreement between people to engage in sexual activity.  The 2017 Act also set out a non-exhaustive list of circumstances where consent is impossible, such as when a person is asleep or unconscious; if a person is being held captive; if a person cannot communicate his or her agreement due to physical inability or disability; if a person is mistaken or misled about who the other person is, or what the activity is; or, for example, if a person is so drunk or intoxicated that he or she is not in a position to consider the activity and make up his or her own mind.  In order for a jury to find a person guilty of rape, three things are necessary: sexual intercourse must have taken place; the person must not have consented; and the accused person must either have known that person did not consent or must have been reckless as to whether he or she consented.<\/p>  <p>  During the Oireachtas debate on the Bill, the issue of whether a person&rsquo;s belief in consent must be reasonably held was discussed in some detail.

At present, the proper test should be that somebody looking at what happened objectively would think it is reasonable or unreasonable for the person to have believed consent was forthcoming.  It is unfair for persons to be able to defend themselves in our legal system on the basis of saying, \"Well, I honestly thought that she was consenting\", even though anyone objectively looking at it would regard that as a grossly unreasonable basis of assessment.

International protection is a complex legal process driven by both national and international law, which works to protect the rights of those genuinely seeking protection by ensuring that all applications are examined in a consistently rigorous and fair manner.  My Department has introduced a number of measures aimed at reducing the time taken to determine applications.  The International Protection Act 2015 introduced the single procedure process for the determination of protection applications.  Under that process, all elements of a person's protection claim, including refugee status, subsidiary protection status and permission to remain are considered together rather than sequentially.<\/p>  <p>  An applicant who applies for international protection today can expect to receive a first instance recommendation or decision within approximately 15 months, provided no complications arise.  Prioritised cases, which include especially vulnerable groups of applicants such as unaccompanied minors, are being processed in just under nine months.  My Department is working hard to achieve a target of nine months in the vast majority of cases.  An additional &euro;1 million has been provided in budget 2020 for immigration service delivery, which includes provision for additional staffing to fast-track applications.  This will further reduce the time needed for considering applications for international protection as well as pressures on the accommodation systems.<\/p>  <p>  As of 31 October 2019, the mean length of stay in international protection accommodation services, IPAS, was 21 months, down from 38 months in 2015.  That is a reduction of 17 months over four years.  Where an applicant has been in a centre for many years, there is generally a complex set of reasons.  These can include difficulties and delays in the applicant producing the required documentation and in verifying that documentation.  In addition, such cases generally involve the applicant having received a negative decision or series of negative decisions on their application and then exercising their right to appeal, often through the courts, which can take time.<\/p>  <p>  The figures on those in centres over three years also includes a substantial group of people who have received permission to remain.  While we wish that those granted permission to remain will move on from centres in order that new applicants can access service provision, approximately 847 people with refugee status continue to live in the centres.  A total of 532 of those people have been residing in the centres for three years or more.  This represents 30.69% of the total number of applicants who have been IPAS residents for three years or more, which is 1,743.  While people are under no obligation to accept accommodation in the IPAS, the Deputy will be aware of the current difficulties faced by people trying to source and secure accommodation.  My Department is assisting those with status to access mainstream housing with the support of organisations such as Depaul Ireland, the Jesuit Refugee Service and the Peter McVerry Trust.  So far this year, 675 people have been assisted in transitioning from IPAS to permanent homes in the community.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000006#D00800","speaker":"1277"},{"type":"speech","time":1574247600,"counter":55,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his reply.

The public are getting that impression because proposals for direct provision centres are being blocked simply because of local opposition.  The message going out is that the country is unable to sustain the numbers involved and that if people put up local objections, they will be able to stop centres being built.  We know that is not the case.  The numbers applying for international protection and subsidiary protection in this country are relatively small by European standards.  Some 3,600 applied last year, and up to 4,000 will likely apply this year, for reasons that have been explained.  Part of the problem is that there is huge uncertainty about where people will stay.  I welcome the Government's recent announcement that it will try to use State accommodation to house these people, for which we have been calling for many months and years.  State accommodation can be used.  Alternatively, we may have to build State accommodation for this purpose, as it is a long-term issue.

It has not changed.<\/p>  <p>  I would further note, however, that the power to establish the criteria for CCTV schemes is now a matter for the Policing Authority by order made with the approval of Government.  The statutory framework does not place an obligation on local authorities to take part in community CCTV.  However, if a local authority decides it is not prepared to act as data controller for community CCTV, this prevents the community scheme from operating in its functional area.  In effect, the current legislative structure is an enabling one that empowers local communities and local authorities to establish a system to which garda&iacute; have appropriate access, provided they meet the statutory requirements.<\/p>  <p>  I am not sure if Deputy Byrne is proposing that we disregard the statutory requirements, which include the fact the local authority is prepared to assume responsibility as data controller.

He has funded only a fraction of what the Government committed to do, which is wrong.<\/p> <p>People need a helping hand.  We must consider whether placing the burden on local authorities, which are not charged with fighting crime, and community groups that are struggling to do lots of other things represents the best value for money.  Let us be honest: some community groups are better placed than others to apply for grants such as this.  That is a fact.  Fair play to them, and I admire them, but there are other areas which could benefit from this scheme.  All we ask is that the Minister, who effectively administers the scheme in terms of providing 60% of the funding for it, make it as easy as possible for towns and villages to get involved.  We ask him to assume his responsibility and not simply pass the buck to local authorities and accuse me of trying to break the law in some way, which is the most ridiculous answer a Minister has ever given to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000007#E01000","speaker":"1225","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1574248800,"counter":68,"content":"<p>By way of explanation to Deputy Thomas Byrne, who has difficulty listening, if he is aware of any groups that wish to avail of the scheme, first, further details are available to download from my Department's website; second, support and guidance is available to help interested groups through a dedicated email address in my Department; and third, if he would like to bring any specific issue to my attention-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000008#F00200","speaker":"1233"},{"type":"speech","time":1574248800,"counter":69,"content":"<p>I will.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000008#F00300","speaker":"1225"},{"type":"speech","time":1574248800,"counter":70,"content":"<p>-----my door is always open, as he should know.

Yes, it is very limited in that it is only available when the case has proceeded to prosecution, but I think something like 80 or 90 cases are prosecuted every year.

That modernisation includes the introduction of a new family court Bill and the development of a dedicated family court system.

For example, work is at an advanced stage on the general scheme of the proposed family court Bill to enable the creation of a new dedicated family court within the existing court structures.  Central to the proposed legislation is the idea that family courts will have new procedures aimed at less adversarial resolution of disputes and will have appropriate facilities and case management arrangements.

The decisions of the court stay with people until the end of their lives, especially when children are involved.  It is imperative to have a system in place that ensures that there is respect for and recognition of the fact that these are extremely stressful and traumatic experiences for people who are before the courts.  I welcome that the Minister says that a family court Bill will be produced.  We need to look on a more basic level at the services available to people who are before the courts.  It is completely inappropriate that people who are involved in stressful litigation in the courts have to talk to their lawyers in a corridor because they do not have appropriate consultation rooms.

This reflects the thinking underlying the committee's recommendations.  The report also references the need for improved court structures and facilities.  In this regard the Government is already committed to building a new family law centre and children's court complex in Dublin 7.  The Government's infrastructure and capital investment plan provides for the development of these at the Hammond Lane site in a central Dublin location.  Deputy O'Callaghan will be aware that under the provisions of the Courts Service Act 1998, management of the courts, including the provision of accommodation, is a matter for the Courts Service.

We need Government commitment to develop this site so that we can have full, proper family law courts there.  We need to look at judges.  We need greater training for judges who are dealing with family law cases.  More importantly, we need more judges to deal with these issues.  Most of these cases are before the District Court and Circuit Court.  When one sees citizens in Phoenix House, one can see that the facilities there at present are completely unacceptable.  We need to modernise our family law courts.  As we mentioned in our report, ultimately, a court-imposed solution on a family is no substitute for an agreed, mediated settlement between the family.

Article 15(2) of the EU recast reception conditions directive allows member states to decide the conditions for granting access to the labour market for applicants for international protection, in accordance with national law.  The European Communities (Reception Conditions) Regulations 2018, which were signed into effect on 30 June 2018, include access to the labour market for qualified international protection applicants.  The regulations provide access to both employment and self-employment in all sectors and categories of employment with the exception of the Civil Service and public service, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Defence Forces.  There are no restrictions on the type of work or the level of income possible.  Under the regulations, international protection applicants will have access to the labour market nine months from the date on which their protection application was lodged, if they have not yet received a first instance recommendation from the International Protection Office and if they have co-operated with the process.  Applicants must have made reasonable efforts to establish their identity and, on commencement of employment, they must register with the Revenue Commissioners and be tax compliant.  Providing access to the labour market where a person is waiting more than nine months without a first instance recommendation is in full compliance with the provisions of the directive.  It recognises that, where a person does not have clarity on his or her status in the State within this period, it is reasonable to allow that person to access the labour market.<\/p>  <p>  The access provided for in Ireland is broad and generous with almost no restrictions.  The system as it prevails is a fair one and allows protection applicants to seek employment after a reasonable period from the time they apply for protection in the State.  A balance must be struck because the intention is not to turn the asylum system into a pathway for economic migration as this would not be fair to those fleeing persecution or to those who migrate to Ireland to work using the appropriate immigration channels.  However, it has always been intended to review the system to determine if it is meeting the needs of applicants for protection and their potential employers.  This is an appropriate time to do so as the system has been in operation for more than a year.  In that  regard, a high level interdepartmental group is reviewing the implementation of the State's obligations under the EU reception conditions directive, including access to work and the direct provision of services offered to applicants while their applications are being made.  I expect to receive a report within days from the interdepartmental group.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to eligibility, as of 31 October 2019, there were 2,429 international protection applicants aged 16 years or over who were waiting nine months or more for a first instance recommendation on their international protection claim.  All may apply for a labour market access permission, subject to meeting the eligibility criteria.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000011#J00700","speaker":"1277"},{"type":"speech","time":1574250600,"counter":123,"content":"<p>This does not make sense.

Despite this, thousands of people who are forced to live in fairly inhumane conditions in direct provision centres, many of them in isolated areas, want to work but cannot do so.  This does not make sense for them or for society.  Why should applicants be forced to wait nine months and why does this apply only in the case of a first application?  It should be remembered that many of the people who get the right to asylum in this country have previously been refused in the first application.  The particular case which led the Supreme Court to strike down the Department's ban on employment for asylum seekers involved a man who had been in direct provision for eight years.  He was a member of what we know to be a persecuted group, the Rohingya, who subsequently got the right to stay but was forced to exist in direct provision for eight years.  Rather than forcing people into the isolation, stigma and hardship of direct provision centres, why does the Department not give them the right to work and make it easy for them to contribute to and benefit society?  I am glad that a review is upcoming.  I hope the Minister of State will take serious steps to address the many obstacles asylum seekers face, including their inability to get driving licences and their isolation from transport services caused by the location of the direct provision centres.

People also complain about the growth in antisocial behaviour on streets and in parks.  The Garda lacks basic resources such as technology, equipment and cars to deal with all of this.  The barbaric attack on Kevin Lunney and the years of unchecked intimidation against his fellow directors is, perhaps, the worst manifestation of this issue.  We discussed that matter on Leaders' Questions previously.  In Lucan, a man was brutally murdered in a housing estate on the night before last.

This is at your own risk.  Don&rsquo;t come if you can&rsquo;t run. <\/blockquote>  <p>This planned raid was similar to events held in Belgium, London and Holland.  We should be thankful that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na intercepted these messages through its monitoring of social media but it necessitated the presence of members of the public order unit and many other garda&iacute; to stop the raid happening.  The fact is that 100 youths actually responded to this call on social media.  What does that reflect?  I am of the view that it reflects a lack of fear of or concern with regard to our authorities and the consequences of such behaviour.<\/p><p>People everywhere tell us that drug transactions are commonplace on the Luas, on other public transport and on the streets.  Those involved seem to have no fear of the consequences.  Individuals are injecting openly on our streets.  Cocaine use is up 30%.

It is the biggest challenge facing workers and families in their daily lives.  I was in Cork yesterday and I was greeted by the results of the Government's disastrous housing policies.  In Fairhill, I met a young woman who is at her wits' end.  She earns too much to be eligible for social housing but she cannot afford a mortgage.  At Blackpool shopping centre, I spoke with one mother whose son faces daily stress because of the amount of rent he is paying.  This young man lives in daily fear of eviction.  I also visited Cork Penny Dinners, an outstanding organisation run by volunteers.  It was once a soup kitchen but it now provides accommodation services.  This charity has stepped up because of the mess Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il have created.<\/p>  <p>  Across the State, people are rightfully angry at the sight of boarded-up council houses.  They are frustrated with each news report about rents reaching new record highs.  They are baffled by the complete lack of delivery in respect of affordable housing.  They are also angry at reports such as the one we heard earlier regarding the huge impact of homelessness on the physical and psychological health of children and babies.  People are sick of this housing crisis and yet it seems to still just go on and on.<\/p>  <p>  There is a site in my constituency, O'Devaney Gardens, in respect of which the wrong decisions are being made again.  We need homes in O'Devaney Gardens.  We need affordable homes that will take families off housing lists and we need affordable rental homes.  That is not what we are getting.  The plan for the site, as concocted by the parties involved in Dublin Agreement 2019 to 2024, is a dog's dinner.  It is a stark example of everything that is wrong with housing policy in the State and it simply will not deliver in the context of meeting people's needs.  These proposed homes will not be affordable for ordinary workers and families and there are no affordable rental homes.  As it stands, the plan is a bonanza for the developer at the expense of the local community.  Alarmingly, the team of Fianna F&aacute;il, the Green Party, the Social Democrats and the Labour Party knew that their plan was a dog's dinner when they forced it through at Dublin City Council.  We need to call a halt to the type of chance-your-arm politics that led to all of this mess in the first place.  We need a change of direction and a change of plan.  Sinn F&eacute;in has proposed the right scheme for the site with 33% social or council housing, 33% cost rental housing and 33% affordable housing for sale.  There is a special meeting of Dublin City Council on Monday night to decide this matter.  I call on Dublin City Council councillors to do the right thing and scrap this dog's dinner of a deal.  I want them to support a new deal.  I put it to the Minister that the Government should support a new scheme for O'Devaney Gardens and commit to resourcing that new plan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000013#L00300","speaker":"1239"},{"type":"speech","time":1574251800,"counter":135,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue.  The Taoiseach was in Cork last Saturday.  There is a new affordable housing investment there of &euro;310 million for a new affordable, shared housing scheme in Cork.  I have no doubt that this is welcome.  Affordable homes will be included in that investment.<\/p>  <p>  The supply of new homes is increasing.  There were 4,920 new homes completed in quarter 2 of 2019.  This is an 11% increase on quarter 2 in 2018.  More than 18,000 new homes were built in 2018, which is a 25% increase on 2017 and the highest number of newly built homes in any year this decade.  Some 42,300 new homes have been built since the launch of Rebuilding Ireland in 2016.  This supply of new homes will continue to increase.  A total of 28,970 planning permissions were granted in quarter 1, which is up 21%.  Total commencement notices as of June 2019 were 24,226, which is an increase of 29% on last year.  The supply of homes is increasing.<\/p>  <p>  The O'Devaney Gardens development involves a &euro;100 million investment.  On Monday 4 November Dublin City Council, by 38 votes to 19 agreed to proceed with a proposal by the city council executive to develop lands in O'Devaney Gardens.  Bartra Capital will now build 768 houses and apartments on the site.  Currently, 50% of the scheme, which is 411 units, has been earmarked for private housing, 30% has been ring-fenced for social housing and the other 20% is set to become affordable housing.  In advance of the vote, councillors representing Fianna F&aacute;il, the Labour Party, the Social Democrats and the Green Party indicated that an agreement had been secured to purchase 30% of the total units available at O'Devaney Gardens from Bartra.  The council, however, voted on 4 November to proceed on the basis of the original plan and the agreement referred to by councillors appears to have no legal standing.  Bartra has simply indicated a willingness to sell private units to the council at prices it will itself determine.  Acquiring homes at the full, open-market price cannot be the basis for affordable, cost rental because the rents that result - which would be required to finance the loans and other costs - would be close to market rents.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000013#L00400","speaker":"1249"},{"type":"speech","time":1574251800,"counter":136,"content":"<p>I might suggest that the Taoiseach go back to Cork, not for the purpose of a photo opportunity with a hard hat on, but to actually talk with the people who have told me, and who I am sure would tell him, of their huge anger and frustration.

As the Minister knows, social farming gives an opportunity to people with disabilities to work alongside farmers on family farms one day per week.  For instance, in County Kerry we have an excellent social farming model.  It is a voluntary project, which makes it sustainable and long-term.  I want to take this opportunity to thank the Minister, Deputy Michael Creed, who has always been positive and workmanlike in ensuring we have received funding from the Department for this worthwhile project.  People such as Eamon Horgan from Kilgarvan, who is a farmer participating in the scheme, have complimented the Minister at every opportunity for being proactive in ensuring we have had the necessary funding.  It works in County Kerry on 19 farms and there are 36 participants.  We need further funding to be made available to ensure we will have the money to employ the facilitators to engage in the project and organise it properly.<\/p>  <p>  People who started in the early stages of the project have been going to the same farms for five years and have built up great relationships.  They have various types of disabilities but they have built up great relationships with the farmers and their families and neighbours and with the communities to which they go.  It is a really worthwhile scheme.  The majority of these people are in receipt of a social welfare payment.  It is good for the participants in that it improves their self-esteem, builds up their confidence and gives them the life experience of working on a farm, which they might not have an opportunity to do where they are from.  To be honest, if we were here for the rest of the day I could not praise the scheme enough.  It breaks up isolation for the farmer.  There is a win-win for everybody in this.  It breaks up a lonely day for the farmers who welcome the young or middle-aged person onto the farms.  They can tell stories about what is going on.  It is good for the young person who is being educated on the ways of farming.<\/p>  <p>  We want to make sure that the project will be given the finance it needs.  The Taoiseach saw it first hand at Project Ireland 2040 in Westport and I know he is aware of the scheme and its benefits.  Something I will look to get from the Government is to see where we want to go with the project.  In Kerry we want to move from having 19 farms involved to 50 farms.  We want to go from having 36 participants to 100 participants.  We have people in the county who will be most welcome and would be grateful to be allowed this opportunity to go onto farms in the community and gain experience on them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000014#M02300","speaker":"1319"},{"type":"speech","time":1574252400,"counter":160,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising the matter.  It is important that by doing so he is increasing awareness of the scheme, which really does benefit the farmer and the participant.  At the Deputy said, it is a win-win for everybody.  Like myself, the Deputy is from a rural background and he is a strong advocate for our farmers and all things rural.  The social farming model is a very important Government initiative that provides a service through communities for people availing of a range of health service supports.  It offers on a voluntary basis participation in a farming environment as a choice to people who avail of a range of therapeutic day support services.  Often these people have physical and intellectual disabilities.  Not only does it assist in the promotion and development of the practice of social farming, it also connects social farmers, organisations and the service providers giving support to the many participants taking part to improve their well-being and grow their confidence.<\/p>  <p>  In October, the Minister, Deputy Creed, announced that his Department will allocate &euro;713,504 under the 2019 rural innovation and development fund.  Participation in social farming has been shown to provide benefits such as improved community connections and relationships, increased self-esteem and capacity, improved health and well-being and the opportunity to learn new skills.  It provides participants with the opportunity to do ordinary things in ordinary places and is wholly in line with shifts in Government policy in health, social care and labour activation towards a social model of disability with person-centred planning and community inclusion.  It is a model that works and the Deputy is absolutely right that we should support it.<\/p>  <p>  The 2020 allocation under the fund has not been announced but the Minister, Deputy Creed, has informed me the scheme will continue to be funded at the same level in 2020.  As the Deputy said, we need to build on it because it is a very good scheme.  I have had the pleasure of meeting the Leitrim providers at Bloom two years in a row as they qualified to get there.

This and future Governments, whoever they may be, should make sure to safeguard this most important scheme.  It has nothing but benefits for everybody and it is very important that every one of us in the Chamber supports it and ensures its budget is rubberstamped and protected for future so there will never be a doubt about it and that it can grow.

It is over two years since a row broke out between Holles Street and St. Vincent's about governance structures and the Minister for Health appointed Mr. Kieran Mulvey to hammer out an agreement between them.  In the meantime, the public was alerted to the fact that a secret deal had been brokered between the two hospitals without any reference whatsoever to the public interest.

The EU Charter of Fundamental Rights states, &quot;Everyone has the right of access to preventive health care and the right to benefit from medical treatment under the conditions established by national laws and practices.&quot;  The UN's International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights states in Article 12: &quot;The States Parties to the present Covenant recognize the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health.&quot;<\/p><p>These treaties, to which Ireland is a signatory, affirm that good health is a prerequisite for public activity and private freedoms.  With the advancement of medical knowledge, the exclusivity of private health systems and a continued exposure to global health issues, it cannot be said today that a citizen's health is beyond the realm of the State.  That is why the Bill will initiate the constitutional amendment process.  It will affirm the right to health as one of modern Ireland's foundational political and social values by enshrining it in our fundamental law, the Constitution.<\/p><p>Without a constitutional foundation, the Government may simply sit on its promises and look only to the short term.  We have seen the results of this approach, such as long hospital wait times, a lack of bed capacity, vacant consultant posts, a creeping rate of legislation and many other issues that have led to unreasonable unmet need.<\/p> <p>Ever since the initial publication of the Sl&aacute;intecare report in 2017, the Department of Health has been committed to achieving a universal single tier health and social care system where everyone has equal access to services based on need and not the ability to pay.  Despite the commendable intentions of the Government, there is no assurance in this regard other than the Government's promise that long-term objectives will be met.<\/p> <p> This Bill would, therefore, crystallise the right to health within the Constitution so as to protect individuals and generate new legislative initiatives.  It has worked in jurisdictions such as India and South Africa, which have used the constitutional right to health to pave the way for health reform and make new laws.  This amendment to our fundamental law will better reflect modern Ireland's primary concerns and the Constitution would hold the State accountable to its democratic mandate to provide equitable and quality health services.<\/p> <p> In addition, the amendment is intended to be fully cognisable by the courts, in the hope that individuals and interest groups can bring unacceptable public health issues to the attention of the courts.  Litigation is circumscribed within reason by the deliberate language of the amendment, which states: \"The State shall endeavour to achieve the progressive realisation of this right [and] the State shall endeavour, within its available resources, to guarantee affordable access\".<\/p> <p> Progressive realisation acknowledges the practical limitations to fulfilling a universal right to health, but it also ensures a process of continual advancement in the creation and implementation of public health measures without retrogression.  Public health protection must be within available resources, a phrase which expects the State to consider health among its top budgetary priorities.  At the moment, for instance, it has been noted that the 2020 budgetary allocations for Sl&aacute;intecare have not met the estimates it is understood are necessary for Sl&aacute;intecare to meet its long-term goals.<\/p> <p> In essence, a constitutional right to health makes certain that initiatives like Sl&aacute;intecare are backed by a constitutional mandate, with no excuse for delay or negligence.  The right to health belongs among our most highly cherished fundamental and personal rights, and I believe the public deserves a chance to affirm the primacy of this right by referendum.  I commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000018#Q01500","speaker":"1275","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1574255400,"counter":271,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Harty.

Every pharmacist in the country has been up in arms since it first came to light last week.  I will cut to the chase.  In recent years, I have interacted with the Minister and his Department in this Chamber and in committee, both privately and publicly.  The Minister, in his interactions with the Irish Pharmacy Union, IPU, gave strong indications that he was willing to engage with the pharmacy sector to make headway in rolling out what is now an underutilised service, getting better value from pharmacists, negotiating a new contract and commencing the reversal of the financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI, in 2020.<\/p>  <p>  I should point out at this stage that, as a pharmacist and owner of a pharmacy, I have an obvious conflict of interest, but I am here representing the pharmacists of the country.  The announcement last week of a further three potential cuts to payments made to pharmacists flies in the face of every discussion the Minister and I have had.  I have always taken the Minister as a man of his word and an honourable person.  I simply cannot believe what happened last week.  What is being proposed will take a minimum of &euro;25,000 from the bottom line of every pharmacy in the country.  That is on foot of cut after cut.  There has not been an increase in fees for more than ten years.  Pharmacists are working night and day trying to keep our businesses viable and this is the straw that will break the camel's back.  As the Minister knows, pharmacists as a group are non-antagonistic and non-confrontational.  They are co-operative and willing, as is their representative organisation, the IPU.  On this occasion, however, things have gone too far.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding the reversal of FEMPI, the Minister has often stated that changed practices are needed.  In the previous three years, pharmacists have taken 12 different actions that have saved the system money.  We have done that without getting one cent extra in payment.  For example, non-oral anticoagulants are provided to hundreds of thousands of patients every week in our pharmacies.  We do all of the associated administration work and when patients come in with unsanctioned prescriptions, we do all of the work and give them their medication.  In many such cases, we do not even get reimbursed for the first month until the patient gets sanctioned.  There would be chaos if we sent those patients back to their consultants and doctors.<\/p>  <p>  Dealing with the high-tech ordering, monitoring and management hub and sanctioning high-tech and critical medication for thousands of patients takes hours of pharmacists' time every week.  All this additional work has been taken on by pharmacists free of charge.  The Department now proposes to cut the high-tech fee for medications such as Entresto, Fampyra and Prolia.  Three months ago, there was a major cut in what is allowed in the area of oral nutritional supplements.  We have been working with patients and their doctors and consultants to let them know what is reimbursable so that patients can go out the door with their vital medication.<\/p>  <p>  This is not the way to commence negotiations on reversing FEMPI or agreeing a new contract for pharmacists.  The Minister addressed the IPU annual conference and gave a firm assurance, which he also gave me at a committee meeting, that he wants to work with pharmacists and wants to roll out a new contract that will bring about a better system and fairer payments.  The Minister cannot allow this proposal to proceed.  I do not want to hear from him that the Department is doing this.  He is the Minister and this is his Government.  We have put our faith in him and I expect him to honour his commitments.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000020#X00300","speaker":"1321"},{"type":"speech","time":1574256000,"counter":283,"content":"<p>I always endeavour to honour my commitments.  I thank Deputy Brassil for raising this important matter.  I genuinely note his keen interest in this area, not just as a pharmacist but as an advocate regarding the role pharmacy has to play from a public health policy point of view in delivering Sl&aacute;intecare.  I have had good and sincere engagements with the Deputy during my time in office and I genuinely acknowledge that and thank him for it.<\/p>  <p>  As the Minister for Health, I value the role pharmacists play in the health service in the delivery of patient care.  Community pharmacy is rightly recognised as the most accessible element of our health service, with an unequalled reach in terms of patient contact and access.  That is why, as Deputy Brassil correctly states, I have given a clear commitment to commencing a thorough review of the pharmacy contract in 2020.  In broad terms, the review will address the role to be played by community pharmacy in the context of Sl&aacute;intecare and in delivering a multidisciplinary model of service delivery for patients, ensuring clarity of roles, avoidance of duplication and achieving optimum value for money.  I recognise already that the IPU has brought forward ideas, proposals and suggestions that it has concerning how pharmacy can do even more in helping to shift services from the acute setting to the community setting, and perhaps ensuring that pharmacists can do more in respect of their scope of practice.<\/p>  <p>  A contractual agreement that is fit for purpose in a health care system that is increasingly seeking to tilt the balance of care towards a strengthened primary care system is now much required.  The vision and approach which underpin Sl&aacute;intecare need to be mapped out for community pharmacy.  A primary care model, integrated with other health policies, will require the expansion of both the scope of practice and the range of public services provided in community pharmacy.  I am thinking specifically of the successful pilot we had for a minor ailments scheme.  That could well be an area of expansion.<\/p>  <p>  In May of this year, as the Deputy rightly reminded me, although I certainly have not forgotten, I addressed the Irish Pharmaceutical Union at the national pharmacy conference in Galway.  In my keynote speech, I made a clear commitment to move beyond the arrangements underpinned by the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest, FEMPI, Acts 2009 to 2015, as I have done for other professions, with a view to optimising the role of pharmacists in the years ahead.  I stand by that commitment, not to move back to pre-FEMPI arrangements but to move on \"to a higher terrain\", as I said at the time.  I am satisfied that we can agree a new contract next year that will do precisely that.  However, in the meantime I am obliged, under law, before the end of this year, to put in place a new framework to maintain a statutory basis for contractor fees as the existing regulations will be revoked from the end of this year, in accordance with the Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017.<\/p> <p>That is not new information.  It is a statement of fact based on an Act that this House passed.<\/p> <p> Prior to the making of the new regulations, I am required to consult the representative body for pharmacy contractors, the IPU.  In that respect this statutory consultation is under way.  My officials wrote to the IPU on 10 October inviting it to attend discussions on the making of the new regulations.  Meetings were subsequently held in my Department at an official level on 24 October and 7 November, following which a detailed and welcome submission was received from the IPU.  That submission is being considered by my Department and I have agreed to a request from the IPU that I would meet it directly in the coming weeks.  I assure Deputy Brassil that no decision has yet been made in this regard.  The Deputy will, I hope, understand and appreciate that while a statutory consultation process is under way I am somewhat limited in terms of what I can say.  However, we have received the detailed submission from the IPU.  It is being given the most serious consideration.  I am conscious of the fact that we will be entering contract negotiations at the start of 2020 and that the sequencing of these issues needs to be considered.<\/p> <p> I expect to see discussions on a new contract begin early in the new year.  I fully believe that community pharmacy contractors have an important contribution to make in realising my future vision - indeed, it is the Deputy's also - for community care which needs to be enabled by a modern fit-for-purpose contractual relationship with the HSE.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000020#X00400","speaker":"1251","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1574256600,"counter":285,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.  I am aware that a statutory framework needs to be put in place.  The Minister should leave it as it stands and commence the negotiations for the new contract and new fees under the existing arrangement, which, I would add, has already taken 33% from payments from pharmacies over the past ten years.  We carried more than our fair share of the burden in the difficult times.  There is also the additional work we have taken on outside of our contract.<\/p>  <p>  I am trying to express to the Minister, in as calm a way as I can, the anger that is out there among pharmacists.  I would not be surprised if they withdrew their co-operation in the high-tech hub, withdrew their co-operation for the National Oversight and Audit Commission and brought about chaos in a system that is already overburdened.  That is coming from a group of people who have never been antagonistic.  They have never been confrontational, they have always been co-operative and willing.<\/p>  <p>  Dentists are moving into 2020 with the same framework.  There will be no change for them.  The Minister is reversing the financial emergency measures in the public interests, FEMPI, for GPs, which we welcome.  They are not being asked to accept further cuts.  As a matter of fact, payments they received previously are beginning to be restored to them.  I ask the Minister not to treat pharmacists differently.  We do not deserve it.  We are honourable and hardworking of people who provide a fantastic service to communities.  The one thing the Minister will not hear about in the context of the health service is the pharmacy system being in chaos.  We do a good job and we do not deserve this.<\/p>  <p>  I will take the Minister at his word to the effect that when he meets the IPU in the negotiations in the coming weeks, the first thing that will happen is that what was put on the table last week will be taken off it.  I also take it that we will sign what we have already and that in 2020 we will renegotiate for a new contract and for the reversal of FEMPI.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000021#Y00200","speaker":"1321"},{"type":"speech","time":1574256600,"counter":286,"content":"<p>I again thank Deputy Brassil for raising this important matter.

Perhaps we are better prepared than other jurisdictions as a result of that constructive engagement and collaboration.<\/p>  <p>  I want pharmacists to do more.  Pharmacists want to do more.  In order for them to do more, I accept that we need to provide more resources to them.  That is why I want to start contract negotiations similar to those that led to a successful agreement with GPs.  Some 95% of GPs voted in favour of the new agreement.<\/p>  <p>  The law of the land revokes the existing regulations at the end of this year.  The law of the land obliges me to put a new framework in place.  The law of the land obligates me to consult representative bodies before doing that.  That consultation is well under way.  Letters have issued and meetings have taken place.  A meeting with me will take place.  A detailed and constructive submission has been received from the IPU and is being actively considered.  We believe that there are efficiencies to be made.  Pharmacists do not disagree with that.

How those two interact is something to which I am giving a great deal of careful consideration.<\/p>  <p>  The document submitted by the IPU is being actively considered at the most senior levels within my Department and by me.  I will meet the IPU and we will decide how best to proceed in due course.

What is at stake is that the polluter pays principle would apply.  One could see in these documents which have been released, uncovered by Mr. Juno McEnroe in the <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>, Ms Lynn Boylan, a former MEP, and indeed Mr. Daniel Murray from <i>The Sunday Business Post<\/i>, that rather than the polluter pays, what we have had in the management of plastics in recent years is that the polluter sets the policy.  Through this cache of over 100 emails, we can see a Department that is operating hand in glove with the industry representative group, Repak.  In the drafting of the plastics directive in the European Union, which was only passed earlier this year and which is critical legislation, and in the debate on my party's Waste Reduction Bill 2017, which has been killed by the Government by its failure to issue a money message, at every stage of the process, the Department was turning to Repak for a steer on what was the best approach to take.  In the European context, that was going right through most aspects of the legislation.  The Government, effectively representing the industry, looked to weaken the provisions of the directive and reduce the category of items that might be included in restrictions to weaken timelines and constantly feed back to industry the latest developments.  Reading the emails, as reported in the <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>, someone asks whether the recipient can telephone in the next half an hour.  Indeed, in the emails published in <i>The Sunday Business Post<\/i>the same system applied in the context of the processing of my party's legislation.  It is not only email correspondence but, according to the articles, meetings were also held on a regular basis.<\/p><p>It is not right that, in the context of this country seeking to go green and wanting to gain public confidence in how public policy is managed, industry interests and the public interest are so entwined.  In this area, the public interest is very real.  This is not a minor or side issue for most people.  I refer to single-use plastics, the problem of plastic waste pollution and the need for us to be stringent, ambitious and bold in terms of telling companies such as Coca-Cola and Britvic that we will run this consumer area not on the basis of their interests but, first and foremost, with environmental and consumer protection interests in mind.<\/p><p>That is why it is a significant and worrying development that the Department appears to be closely dependent on the industry representative group.  I am keen to know what the Minister thinks of what was stated in these emails.  I am keen to know whether he thinks this is acceptable practice.  If he does not, I am keen to know what the Department will do to change its working procedures so that this type of lobbying on behalf of industry groups will not happen in Brussels or here.<\/p><p>This relates to the ongoing debate we have had in this House as to how Opposition legislation is treated.  We never got a satisfactory answer.  My party's legislation was in tune with the European legislation, even the version that was finally passed.  All we heard at the committee was that we could not do it and, effectively, the industry reasons as to why it could not be done.  That is not good enough.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000021#Y00500","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"speech","time":1574257200,"counter":289,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising his concerns about this.  My Department seeks to promote wide stakeholder participation in policy development and is always open to improving those consultations and to suggestions from the Deputy or others.  The Bill to which the Deputy refers was first published in mid-2017, which was before my time in this office.  It provided for prohibiting the sale or free distribution of disposable plastic cups, glasses, plates and other tableware from 1 January 2020, except for items which can be disposed of by composting in an ordinary domestic compost facility, and the mandatory introduction of a deposit and return scheme, DRS, for all beverage containers by 1 July 2019.<\/p>  <p>  I have been informed, as I was not in the Department at the time, that the Department engaged with the Deputy and certain environmental groups shortly after the publication of the Bill.  The Minister at the time supported the intent of the Bill, which aims to reduce the amount of plastic waste in the environment.  However, he referred the Bill for detailed scrutiny to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Communications, Climate Action and the Environment citing concerns about its compatibility with EU legislation and the cost implications for the Exchequer of the introduction of this provision.  The resulting committee report acknowledged the incompatibility of the Bill with EU legislation and outlined potentially significant costs in establishing and operating a deposit and return scheme.  Cost estimates considered in the course of the committee's deliberations identified costs of over &euro;76 million in the first year of establishing the scheme with up to &euro;72 million in costs for the second year.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is not opposed to the possible introduction of a deposit and return scheme in Ireland.  However, given the potential costs involved in its introduction, it believes that a proper study of the costs, impacts and effectiveness is necessary.  The Department is currently undertaking such a review.<\/p>  <p>  It is normal practice to seek the views of affected parties when considering a response to proposals.  I am informed that in consideration of the above proposal the Irish Business and Employers Confederation, IBEC, and Repak were consulted as the need arose.  The Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, was also consulted.  It does not seem unreasonable to consult with Repak, which co-ordinates the delivery of the obligations of industry in this area.  Repak operates under an approval from the Minister to act as a national compliance scheme for packaging.  Producers of packaging have obligations under the EU packaging directive, as transposed in Ireland by the European Communities (Packaging) Regulations 2014.  Repak is a not-for-profit organisation which carries out these regulatory obligations on behalf of its members.  Under the terms of its approval, it is tasked with ensuring that Ireland meets its EU targets under the packaging directive and to report to the Minister annually on progress.  It is also obliged to keep updated on relevant regulatory developments at national level.<\/p>  <p>  I recognise that all stakeholders should have a fair opportunity to participate so all views can be fully taken into account.  In terms of policy development, my Department will evaluate the analysis being undertaken on a deposit return scheme.  Incidentally, the scheme is strongly opposed by Repak, so it has not been a slam dunk for whatever view is coming from industry.  The Department held a major stakeholder forum in September on a new waste strategy embodying the circular economy plan adopted by all member states of the European Union.  All stakeholders were invited to participate.<\/p>  <p>  The approach I have taken since I was appointed to this office is to consult widely.  I consulted widely before the adoption of the climate action plan and I am consulting widely at present before the adoption of a waste and circular economy strategy.  I hold regular meetings.  I have held ten town hall style meetings to ensure I am getting access not just to national interest groups but also to the views of people in the regions.  The approach I seek to take is to receive all views fairly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000022#Z00100","speaker":"1293"},{"type":"speech","time":1574257200,"counter":290,"content":"<p>I understand that a Department, Ministers and politicians must engage with stakeholders and be informed.  However, that is not what we see in the emails released under a freedom of information request.  I can give an example.  There is an email from 8 May 2018 from the Department to Seamus Clancy of Repak.  It states: \"As you know the Minister is before the Oireachtas joint committee today to discuss the draft report on the Waste Reduction Bill\" and then puts a \"quick question\" about Repak.  On the day it was being debated it was to ask if he could ring that day about what the Minister was going to say.  This applied not just to how our Waste Reduction Bill 2017 was handled.  It was the iterative in the circle.  It was informing and being centrally involved, such as asking for a call in the next half hour and, further to a discussion earlier, asking what should be done in the European Council on the plastics directive.<\/p>  <p>  The problem is that the Department was repeating Repak's line that our Bill was in contravention of European policy when, in fact, it was bang in line with European policy presented by the Commission and subsequently in the directive, despite all the efforts of the Government to weaken it.  The Opposition had a correct legislative measure that was perfectly formed to meet what the European Commission was telling governments to do to comply with the new directive.  While the Government was trying to water down the directive in Europe, it was saying here that it could not be done because it would upset industry and would not suit it.  That is what happened and that is why Members on this side of the House are increasingly angered at how a legislative measure that was absolutely appropriate and bang in line with European legislation was turned down for industry interests and not on the basis of a policy approach formed by the Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000022#Z00200","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"speech","time":1574257200,"counter":291,"content":"<p>The point of consultation is to get both sides of the argument and bring them to bear.  It is not to hear only one side of the argument.  There is an obligation on us to make massive changes in the way we manage resources, but we must also take their cost implications into account.  The Deputy was keen to have a deposit and return scheme established, but there was evidence which the Oireachtas committee believed to be a realistic consideration that had to be taken into account with regard to whether one should impose that.  When legislation is introduced by the Government, a regulatory impact assessment is conducted in the normal way.  What tends to happen with Private Members' Bills in my experience is that all of that gets compacted and there may be hurried consultations.  I can understand how the Deputy might construe them as being only hearing one view because there was a need to respond quickly, but it is the Department's policy and my view that everybody's voice must be heard and that we must try to achieve what we must achieve in a way that imposes the least burden and offers the most opportunity for us to succeed in our environmental objectives while also being compatible with other needs of the community.  That is what I seek to do.  If there are flaws in the way this is done, I will certainly seek to correct them.  The approach I have taken in the consultations I have held is to be fair to all concerned.

It is pure coincidence that I happen to be in Chamber at this time.  It is appropriate that the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs is also here to welcome them.<\/p>  <p>  This important issue involves the Bessborough Centre, previously the Bessborough Mother and Baby Home.  That was controversial in itself, but I am not dealing with that aspect today.  The trustees of the Sisters of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary have decided to sell the land.  On that land are vital family services for vulnerable families and children.  What has developed there over recent years is an extraordinarily high quality intervention service funded by Tusla on a current basis.  The family assessment and treatment services include a parent and infant residential unit.  It is an 11-bed facility that provides a continuum of assessment and parenting capacity building, a therapeutic intervention for high risk parent-infant families.<\/p> <p>The parenting capacity provision is very significant, as is the acute residential unit, as has been well recognised.  Post discharge, the Lime Tree project comprises community-based family support service and supervised access service.  That is exclusively commissioned for families involved in the South Lee social work department.  There is a very extensive community cr&egrave;che and preschool with Pobal subvention.  I understand the nuns wish to sell this as a going concern.  This has a capacity of 139 with a staff team of 34, including an administrative manager and childcare manager.<\/p> <p> There is a secondary school for second-chance education provided by the education and training board to some of the mothers who avail of this facility.  Vulnerable adult students are intensively supported to achieve a leaving certificate to enter further education or vocational opportunities.  That school works in harmony with all other Bessborough services, particularly providing parents opportunities to consolidate positive life change whilst using clinical family services.  The centre's ethos of inclusion and unconditional respect engages pupils typically resistant to formal education or statutory involvement.  There are comprehensive employment support services on the Bessborough lands, again facilitating vocational training and experiences for individuals to return to the workplace or seek employment.  That is critical in facilitating the therapeutic and trauma-informed physical environment of the Bessborough centres.  There are tremendous synergies between all these different strands of provision.  On the wider campus, Eist Linn, an inpatient mental health facility operated by the HSE, is also on these lands.  An 11-year lease is left on that facility and &euro;2 million extra capital investment has been added to the premises in recent years.<\/p> <p> In one parliamentary answer, the Minister said she had no role to play in intervening in the sale.  I put it to her straight that the Government should buy it on behalf of the people.  The Minister should work with other Ministers - Health, Education and Skills, and Housing, Planning and Local Government - along with the local city council and combine to buy this entire facility.  A master plan could be developed for its extensive lands, which would add to its existing synergies.  The sod was turned for the event centre in Cork four years ago and nothing has happened.  The developer said he could not complete the project for &euro;10 million or whatever, and I reckon &euro;20 million is now going into it.  Why is it that the most vulnerable and most needy of families and children are always at the bottom of the queue?  There is a real danger that these services will dissipate as a result of this sale.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000022#Z00500","speaker":"1224","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1574257800,"counter":295,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to respond to the issue raised by Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin.  As he outlined, the Bessborough Centre in Cork is a not-for-profit organisation that works with children and families.  The centre is based on a large site that is in excess of 40 acres.  The property is owned by a congregation of nuns who have operated child and family services on the premises for many decades.  The congregation that owns the property is now based in the UK, and I understand that the site was advertised for sale in 2018.  It appears that the Bessborough site has a mix of considerable undeveloped lands and a range of buildings.  A range of services are provided on the Bessborough site, and funding is provided by a number of public bodies, including the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and the Health Service Executive as well as my Department and Tusla.<\/p>  <p>  In 2018, Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, allocated &euro;1.5 million in funding to family and community services provided by the Bessborough Centre.  This was established under the trusteeship of the order of nuns who own the land.  Tusla is also a tenant on the site and has a short-term lease for its fostering office.  The CEO of Tusla visited the site last week.  I am informed that the Health Service Executive also operates services on the campus.<\/p>  <p>  The Bessborough Centre is currently considered a leading national centre for therapeutic assessment and interventions for vulnerable families.  The centre aims to keep families together where it is in the best interests of the child.  My Department provides funding to the Bessborough Centre to run a range of early learning and care and school age childcare programmes for young children.  I recognise the challenges that can be faced by community not-for-profit childcare services.  That is why my Department has developed a strong case management system operated by Pobal, and through which a dedicated team, in partnership with local city and county childcare committees, assists childcare providers facing challenges.<\/p>  <p>  I understand that Cork City Childcare Committee and Pobal are engaging with the service in question on this matter, and they will continue to support the service as and when required.  This is a fluid situation.  There appears to be much uncertainty regarding the future of the site and the services provided there.  It is important that all factors are taken into consideration before any decisions are made.  I know that many people who work for the Bessborough Centre, or who engage with its services, will be anxious to know what the sale of the property means for them.  There are also many others who use HSE or Tusla services on the site who will be concerned.<\/p>  <p>  What is clear is that the property is scheduled to be sold, and that there is a potential risk to services as a result of that sale.  I know that this is the issue that concerns the Deputy most.  Both the CEO of Tusla and I are keen to secure the future of the services that are located on the site.  The owners of the Bessborough property have nominated a representative to engage with Tusla.  An initial meeting took place between all parties on 4 November and further engagements are to take place shortly.  I emphasise that these discussions are in their early stages.<\/p>  <p>  I know that the Deputy will appreciate the sensitivities around engagement on this matter.  We are at one on the need to ensure continuity of these necessary services and I appreciate his support and that of other public representatives in Cork in achieving this.  I will continue to take an active interest in this matter, and will continue to liaise with Tusla.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000023#AA00200","speaker":"1358"},{"type":"speech","time":1574257800,"counter":296,"content":"<p>I accept that the Minister's Department specifically will not have the capital funding required to purchase the 40-acre site.  The State has invested hugely in the area with capital investment over the years and ongoing current funding.  If the land is sold to a private entity, to a developer, these services will break up.  Huge work has gone into building up the family therapeutic service.  In her former role as rapporteur, Dr. Carol Coulter said this is one of the best in the country.  It is nationally recognised and is a national service.<\/p>  <p>  Such facilities do not come easily.  I know that as a former Minister.  This is a wonderful site with tremendous potential.  I understand there was interest in the site by a particular developer who has left the scene due to other issues.  Some of it is zoned amenity and so on.  I ask the Minister to give a commitment to talk to other Ministers and raise this at Cabinet level.  While I am supportive of the event centre, we can find &euro;20 million very quickly for that project, which has taken five or six years to develop.  We can find that no problem because of political imperatives.  It has to be done for politics as the election is coming, the Government promised it, and its attitude is that if it is a case that it cannot deliver it, it had better find another &euro;8 million or &euro;10 million to do so.  Here is an incredible range of services for the most vulnerable in the country, the most vulnerable women, families and children.  A good model has been developed.  There is a mental health inpatient facility for teenagers and children.  Why is it that the State cannot be as proactive as it is in other areas, do the right thing for the future, and develop even greater synergies in future?

We heard only this week that the service is being curtailed for safety reasons, which we acknowledge.  It is being curtailed because of a failure by the Government to address a resourcing issue, as the most valuable resource in the Defence Forces and Air Corps is its personnel.  The fact that the personnel have not been there for a period and are not likely to be there in future concerns me.  In press releases this week, the Department has stated the service has been curtailed by four days each month until February next year, but no guarantee has been offered by the Department, military authorities or the Minister - the Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar - that the crisis in manning levels for the Air Corps is at an end.<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach stated that this position was \"not ideal\", and this is the understatement of the year.  This is a service that provides for those who are critically ill in the main, accident victims or medical emergency cases that may be transferred to a hospital for appropriate care.  It is used daily, such is the success of the service to date.  We should praise the charity that is stepping into the breach to save the blushes of the State.  It is great that the Irish Community Rapid Response organisation has the expertise and facilities to step in and deliver the service or at least cover the service for those days that the Air Corps cannot do it.<\/p>  <p>  It is a sad state of affairs that we have reached a point where the Defence Forces must be backed up by a charity.  This comes after many years of representative organisations for the Defence Forces and Members in this House, including me, continually raising the issue of the failure of the Government to address the retention problem in the Defence Forces and Air Corps in particular.  Specialist personnel are required.  These are not just pilots but also back-up and maintenance crews.  Currently there are only three full crews available for the service despite the fact that there is a need for ten crews.<\/p>  <p>  I hope the Minister of State will be able to reassure me in his comments that come the end of February next year, we will have ten full crews in place.  I do not believe it will happen but it is what we have been told.  The statement indicates that this curtailment will only last for a number of months.<\/p>  <p>  We acknowledge the energy and enthusiasm of the men and women in the Air Corps and their ability thus far, despite reduced numbers, to deliver a service.

I apologise on behalf of the Minister of State with responsibility for defence, who cannot be here today, unfortunately.<\/p>  <p>  As Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh indicated, the EAS based in Custume Barracks in Athlone is an important service provided by the Air Corps.  Notwithstanding the well-documented ongoing human resources challenges in the Air Corps, particularly with the recruitment and retention of pilots, the EAS has been delivered without interruption since 2012, as Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh, in fairness, has acknowledged.  The Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe, has prioritised this service and will continue to do so in future.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State received military advice that the Air Corps will not be in a position to accept EAS taskings from the National Ambulance Service for four days per month for a period of four months from November 2019 to February 2020.  That is regrettable but necessary for safety and governance reasons.  During this time there will be a training surge to produce a new cohort of aircraft commanders for the EAS, and this will ensure the long-term viability of the service provided by the Air Corps.  The safety of serving personnel, HSE staff and patients is the shared number one priority and our whole focus is returning the EAS service to full capacity.<\/p>  <p>  During the 16 days when the Air Corps will not accept taskings, the Irish Coast Guard will provide reserve cover for the National Ambulance Service.  This is in line with the Government's decision in 2015 to establish the emergency aeromedical service.  The Irish Community Rapid Response, ICRR, emergency medical service, which was mentioned by the Deputy, has agreed to provide additional cover using a second helicopter, which will be based at Roscommon University Hospital on the days when the Air Corps will not be in a position to accept taskings for the EAS.  The ICRR will also continue to be available in the south of the country.<\/p>  <p>  The whole focus is on returning the EAS to a full service and full capacity.  A number of measures are being pursued, including the reintroduction of the service commitment scheme for pilots, the recommissioning of former Air Corps pilots and the training of junior pilots during that time.  The emergency aeromedical service provided by the Air Corps has completed more than 2,600 missions since it commenced operations in 2012.  On behalf of the Minister of State and the Government, I pay tribute to the professional and effective service provided by Air Corps personnel, as Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh did as well.  I acknowledge the support of the Irish Coast Guard and the ICRR during this period.  The shared priority is to provide the best available service using all available resources during the four days in each month when the Air Corps will not be available for EAS taskings.  This interruption is regrettable but necessary, as I stated, from a safety and governance perspective.  Everybody accepts it is correct if that is the advice that has been provided.

We had the tragedy of the Irish Coast Guard Rescue 116 which went down off the coast of Mayo.  Accidents can happen but on the night in question, the Air Corps, either because of a lack of personnel or equipment, was not able to provide the required cover.  There are major problems.

Today, the number is 577.  The figures in August, September and October were the worst on record for each of those months.  October, the month just passed, was the second worst month on record.  On 2 October, the highest ever daily figure was recorded for men, women and children waiting on a trolley in an emergency department.  Last year, by the end of October, more than 10,000 elderly men and women over the age of 75 had waited on a trolley for more than a day.  The Government described that as totally unacceptable and said it would not happen again.  This year, the figure is not 10,000 but 13,000, having increased by one third in one year.  The Master of the Rotunda Hospital warned just a few days ago that it is &quot;only a matter of time&quot; before newborn babies are injured or die as a result of overcrowding.  As of the end of October this year, more than 100,000 men, women and children had waited on a trolley.  Nothing like this has ever happened before.<\/p><p>What has been the Government's response this year?  It is a winter plan that includes no extra beds or clinicians and a hiring embargo that the HSE tells us does not really exist.  The Government has arrived at a burning building with a smoke alarm.  What of our healthcare professionals?  Just today, healthcare professionals have told me they are &quot;overwhelmed&quot;, &quot;burned out&quot;, &quot;exhausted&quot; and &quot;under massive pressure all the time&quot;.  Every Deputy in this House who engages with healthcare professionals will have heard the same.  They are under unprecedented, unsustainable and completely unacceptable pressure.  It is unacceptable for them and for patients and their families.<\/p><p>Why is something so bad happening in our society and healthcare system?  There are three big reasons.  First, too many people are having to go to emergency departments.  Second, when they arrive in emergency departments, they do not always get the help and treatment they need.  Third, there are not enough beds.  That is pretty much it.  I will deal with each of those reasons.  Too many people are having to go emergency departments in the first place.  General practitioners could treat many of these people in the community but they do not have the resources to do so.  They do not have the time they need to spend with each patient, nor do they have access to the diagnostics they need for their patients.  They do not have the practice nurses that general practitioners have in other countries where they actively manage the welfare of their patients, keep them healthy and treat them at home, in primary care centres or in GP surgeries.  However, we do not have that and, therefore, people get sicker and end up having to go into our emergency departments.<\/p><p>What happens when people arrive in emergency departments?  Much of the time they arrive into complete chaos in emergency departments being run by skeleton crews who are heroes trying to keep the system going.  The staff who see the patients after 5 o'clock in the evening know they cannot get access to diagnostics.  They do not have a suitable treatment room or assessment room.  They do not even have a triage room or a suitable resuscitation area.  They will do what they can but they will often ask patients to wait on a corridor.  If they admit them, they will ask them to lie on a trolley on a corridor where they may be assessed and treated.  That is the reality people are dealing with today.<\/p><p>Why are there are not enough beds?  First, there are simply too few beds but also the beds we have are not being used properly.  What is going on?  Patients are being discharged but they cannot leave the hospital because they do not have a home care package to allow them to return home.  Interestingly, Deputy Butler and I spoke about this yesterday.  She made the point that in Waterford hospital the number of people waiting on trolleys pretty much matches the number of people who have delayed discharges.  Let us reflect on that.  If there are 25 people on trolleys waiting for beds and 25 people in beds waiting to get out of them, it does not take a genius to work out the solution.  Give patients the home care packages they need, free up the 25 beds and get those who are on trolleys into those beds.<\/p> <p>Other patients are told that they can go home but that they need a scan and if they do go home, it will be two years before they get it.  They are then put in a bed to wait for three days so that they can be put on the hospital's priority list for the scan.  A safe occupancy level is approximately 85% but occupancy levels in Ireland stand at approximately 100%.  All sorts of stuff goes wrong when the hospital is under that much pressure.  If an urgent emergency, such as a big trauma case, arrives, everything else gets knocked out.<\/p> <p> We know why this happening, which means we know how to fix it.  In this motion, Fianna F&aacute;il has put together a very straightforward plan, which would work.  We need to reduce the number of people going into emergency departments by funding GPs to treat people in their communities.  This means more GP out-of-hours services, access to diagnostics and funding for care pathways, particularly for the elderly and those with chronic diseases.  We need to increase emergency department capacity, ensure safe staffing levels, end the hiring embargo, eliminate pay inequality for consultants and provide better access to diagnostics.  We need to free up hospital beds and provide the new beds that are required more quickly.  We also need to fund home care so that we can get people out of hospitals when they are discharged.<\/p> <p> The crisis we are experiencing in emergency departments has never been seen before in Ireland.  It does not exist in any other European country.  If we implement this plan, it will not need to exist here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000025#CC00400","speaker":"1436","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1574259600,"counter":308,"content":"<p>Emergency department and hospital overcrowding has become the norm.  We hear in the news every day of trolley numbers representing the number of sick patients who cannot access a medical bed in a hospital but who may instead have to wait on a trolley, in some cases for days.  They have to stay on a corridor with the lights glaring, without privacy and without bathroom facilities, other than the public bathroom in the emergency department.  They have nowhere to put their personal belongings.<\/p>  <p>  As of October, 13,466 people aged over 75 endured waits of more than 24 hours for a bed.  Never before have so many elderly people waited on trolleys for longer than 24 hours.  The latest figures are devastating.  Last year's figure of approximately 10,000 has skyrocketed by 35% this year.  Many elderly people have told me they are afraid to go to hospital because they fear they will be left on a trolley on a corridor for days, with no privacy as people pass by.  They are afraid they will die alone and would prefer to stay in the comfort of their homes, regardless of how ill they are.<\/p>  <p>  The way forward is to tackle the issue of delayed discharges.  We need timely transfer of care to the home or, with the correct wraparound supports, to a community respite bed or nursing home through the fair deal scheme.  There are 451 patients awaiting approval for that scheme.  There were 680 cases of delayed discharge at the end of October.  In 2014, the former chairman of the emergency department task force warned that delayed discharges were putting lives at risk.  At the time he wrote his analysis, there were 703 delayed discharge patients in the acute hospital system, which he said represented 30 wards at capacity.  Frail elderly patients risk hospital acquired infections, falls, pressure ulcers and medication errors while being nursed in busy acute hospital settings for months on end.<\/p>  <p>  As my colleague, Deputy Donnelly, said, I visited University Hospital Waterford on Monday and was advised that there were 21 delayed discharges currently in the hospital.  On the same day, there were 23 patients on trolleys.  Today, there are 20 patients on trolleys in the hospital and 577 patients on trolleys nationwide.  The point I have been making all year is that if we allow 21 delayed discharges at one end of the system while there are 20 people on trolleys in the emergency department, the problem will never be resolved.  The dramatic increase in lost bed days in our acute hospitals demands a direct intervention from the Minister.<\/p>  <p>  I am calling for a task force on delayed discharges to co-ordinate timely discharge.  We need a centralised, co-ordinated approach to delayed discharges.  Each hospital group should have a task force specifically allocated to identify where issues are occurring and to design a plan to ensure timely access to step-down care for these patients.  We could vastly reduce trolley overcrowding if we got serious about delayed discharges.  I understand that, in some complex cases, this is not always possible but direct intervention is required.  I ask the Minister to give serious consideration to that request.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000026#DD00200","speaker":"1220"},{"type":"speech","time":1574259600,"counter":309,"content":"<p>I do not know the Fianna F&aacute;il Members' arrangements but there are only eight minutes left.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000026#DD00300","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1574259600,"counter":310,"content":"<p>So far this year, more than 100,000 patients have gone without a hospital bed and instead waited on a trolley in an emergency department.  Almost 14,000 people over the age of 75 have endured waits in emergency departments of more than 24 hours.  The plan for winter 2019-20 provides for no additional acute beds or front-line hospital staff.  Emergency medical staffing levels are below international comparators and safe staffing levels.  Hospital bed occupancy is 97% or higher, and is 104% in model 4 hospitals.  Delayed discharges are a significant factor.  In County Wexford, 754 people are on the waiting list for a home care package.  That is more than in all neighbouring counties combined.  Inexplicably, there is nobody on a waiting list in the Carlow-Kilkenny area next door.  I would like an explanation as to how that is possible because it is having a very serious impact on the numbers waiting in hospitals.  The public health system appears to be broken.  These waiting lists are not normal or acceptable.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to mental health, we have had report after report on overcrowding in our mental health services from the Inspector of Mental Health Services.  A couple of weeks ago, a 16 year old spent 40 hours in the emergency department in University Hospital Waterford.  He spent 24 of those hours on a chair with a blanket over his head to hide from the light and noise, which were distressing him.  That is totally unacceptable.  We have also seen reports of what overcrowding has done to the department of psychiatry in Waterford.  People are sleeping on floors and chairs.  This is totally unacceptable.

The Minister maintains that he is investing money in community services but the extra investment in home help hours in six counties in the midlands resulted in only 20 extra home help hours.  We have not been provided with the figures for other areas.  Some 20 extra hours will not make much of a difference.  As I have said before, the Minister needs to follow the money.  Is the extra money resulting in extra home help hours or is it being spent on extra administration costs?<\/p>  <p>  The Minister and the HSE have declared war on a key component of primary care, our pharmacists.  The pharmacists' contract and the withdrawal of funding for phased dispensing are causing enormous difficulties for pharmacists.  The Minister is impairing their ability to play a part in resolving this issue.  The moratorium that is not a moratorium is impacting on replacement appointments for positions right across the service.  If the moratorium that is not a moratorium was not in place, we would have personnel in position to reopen the beds that need to be opened.  <\/p>  <p>  I noted the cases mentioned by Deputies Donnelly and Browne.

<\/blockquote> <\/blockquote>  <\/blockquote>  <p>I welcome the opportunity to address the range of issues raised in the debate.  The pressures facing our health service are a deep concern for all of us.  None of us wants to see patients, especially our older people, and staff enduring overcrowded conditions and none of us is immune to that.  We are working very hard to try to improve the situation but in an honest debate it is important to acknowledge that there is no policy panacea, but rather a variety of reforms and measures are required.  I believe this is why all parties in the Oireachtas agreed on the need for a long-term plan, which is Sl&aacute;intecare.  In that context, I hope we can have an honest and truthful debate this afternoon.  There is no single solution that I am sitting on and refuse to deploy for some unknown reason.  That is just lazy and partisan politics.  I heard Deputy Donnelly outline a Twitter plan yesterday and I heard him outline some of it again this afternoon.  With respect, I have to say it is very familiar.  The Deputy calls for more resources for GPs and the Deputy is aware that we have just negotiated a new GP agreement, of which 95% of GPs voted in favour.  The agreement reverses the FEMPI cuts, most of which were imposed by Deputy Donnelly's party.  The Deputy also calls for bed capacity and he knows that we are delivering more bed capacity.  While Deputy Donnelly was not in Fianna F&aacute;il at the time, any honest look at the graph shows the number of beds his party took out of the health service.  Fianna F&aacute;il is calling for a taskforce on delayed discharges.  I welcome that point but it does exist.  The Minister of State, Deputy Daly set up that cross-divisional oversight group after he published the independent expert review on delayed discharges.  I take the point, however, that Deputy Butler raised.<\/p><p>I shall begin with GP services.  As Members are aware, in May we concluded an agreement on contractual reform and service development with GPs.  This agreement will see an increase in expenditure on GP services of &euro;210 million per annum on a phased basis.  This will help to make general practice sustainable and an attractive option for medical graduates.  Members do not have to take my word for it; 95% of GPs voted in favour of the deal.  The measures included in the agreement are made up of an increase of 40% in the capitation payments to GPs for General Medical Services patients.  In return GPs are committed to co-operating in a series of new measures.  These include e-health developments, medicines reviews, the implementation of community healthcare networks and the management of hospital waiting lists.  Crucially, there will also be an increase of 10% in the rural practice allowance - I know this is an issue of concern to Members - and for the first time ever there is the introduction of a &euro;2 million per annum support for GPs working in areas of urban deprivation.  Improvement in supports for maternity and paternity leave for GPs are also provided for to help attract new and younger GPs to the career.<\/p><p>From January next year we will be doing exactly what the motion calls for, which is the implementation of a chronic disease management programme that will help to move services from the hospitals into general practice and deliver structured care to patients through their local doctors, an approach which has been shown to improve health outcomes and reduce the need for hospital admissions.<\/p><p>The agreement signals the commitment of Government to general practice and the partnership that is required between GPs, patients, the wider health system and the HSE.  The 2019 agreement also includes a commitment to a strategic review of GP services that is intended to examine how best to ensure the provision of GP services in Ireland for the future.  This review on the broader new contract will commence in 2020.<\/p><p>We are also continuing to work on developing our diagnostics services in the community.  This is crucial.  It ensures that people do not have to go to a hospital to get an x-ray or an ultrasound.  The HSE is making progress on a range of options across community healthcare organisations to increase access to radiology services, including publicly provided and outsourced models.  Some 67,000 ultrasound and 79,500 X-rays are planned to be delivered by the end of this year through direct GP access to radiology services.<\/p><p>We all agree that more care needs to be provided in the community and in particular the need to support homecare.  This was clearly recognised by all of us with the increased investment in this area for next year as provided in the budget.  We have not just started next year, however, and have provided additional funding from September this year to improve access to home support and the fair deal scheme.  As a result, we can see the number of delayed transfers of care falling - formerly known as delayed discharges.  The average daily number of delayed discharges in October was 682, which is down from 757 in the previous month.  This is still far too high but it is now beginning to reduce and I expect that to reduce significantly further.<\/p><p>The HSE published its winter plan last Thursday, which is earlier than before, and I secured an additional &euro;26 million of taxpayers' money to support its implementation.  The additional funding is being used for a range of services to help relieve demand for emergency department services and to support discharge and other initiatives to help hospitals deal with the challenges associated with winter.<\/p><p>Specific funding has been allocated to nine winter action teams to support initiatives at local level including additional staff to improve patient experience time, improve senior clinical decision making, reduce length of stay and facilitate weekend discharges; additional aids and appliances to help get elderly people in particular back home; additional home support hours; the implementation of frail intervention therapy teams to help avoid and reduce admissions of patients who are more frail; and additional flu-testing kits to improve patient experience times.<\/p><p>I agree with Deputy Donnelly that we need extra bed capacity.  We have published the capacity review and provided funding for the addition of 2,600 acute beds and 4,500 community beds, in line with the plan.  Progress has been made on increasing capacity.  An additional 267 acute hospital beds were opened under the winter initiative 2017-18.  The provision of an additional 75 acute beds and 75 community beds was a component of the winter plan 2018-19.  The modular facility to expand Clonmel Hospital by 40 beds is nearing completion and will open shortly.  The much talked about 60-bed extension to Limerick hospital, promised for years but not delivered by anybody, is now well under way.  While it will not be open this winter I have viewed it, it is under construction and is under way.  As part of an agreed capacity programme, the number of available inpatient beds is expected to increase to above 11,000 for the first time since 2009.  In 2009, 2010 and 2011 Deputy Donnelly's party reduced the number of hospital beds.  From 2007, under Fianna F&aacute;il, more than 1,500 inpatient beds were lost until Fine Gael began to reverse this trend in government with the Labour Party in 2012.  Since then more than 600 beds have been added and we are continuing to work to reverse the damage done by Fianna F&aacute;il.  The truth is that Fianna F&aacute;il left this country with fewer acute inpatient beds when it left office in 2011 than when it started in 1997.  I have a graph here, published by my Department and available for all to see, called the open beds report August 2019.  I encourage everybody to view this report.  One graph shows a decline during Fianna F&aacute;il's tenure in the Celtic tiger era when it closed beds and built motorways instead of hospitals.  I agree with the Deputy's comments about not properly using beds and I hope in his reply to this debate he will stand up, as have Deputies O' Reilly, Kelly and I, to say that he believes it is inappropriate that private practice is taking place with public hospital beds.  We want to see an end to that, but we have yet to hear Deputy Donnelly's party commit to that.<\/p><p>One issue was raised in Fianna Fail's motion that I specifically want to address on the Rotunda Hospital.  I am fully aware of the concerns that have been raised in relation to the hospital by the Master of the hospital, Professor Fergal Malone.  I have met with Professor Malone and other representatives from the Rotunda as well as the HSE to discuss potential interim works at the hospital.<\/p> <p>It is important to recognise that we want to relocate this hospital to the Connolly Hospital campus and funding for this relocation project is in place in our capital plan.  This is a longer-term plan and we need to look at current infrastructural difficulties.  There has been engagement with the HSE to try to agree a proposal with the Rotunda and I look forward to meeting the Rotunda and the HSE to see how we can proceed.<\/p> <p> I am happy the motion gives me an opportunity to talk about workforce planning.  I want to make it clear there is no national recruitment embargo in the HSE.  If there was it would be the only organisation in the world that could see 2,630 more staff working this year than last year despite an embargo.  Fianna F&aacute;il would know all about embargoes because it cut the number of health service staff.  There are more doctors, nurses and therapists in the health service this year than last year.  However, what we do have to do is what every public service has to do.  Managers can only recruit funded posts.  I am sure there are school principals who would love to hire more teachers.  I am sure there are lots of people in the public service who want to do so but it has to be done in line with the budget.  That is a fair and equitable way to do it.<\/p> <p> There has been a constant increase in the number of staff in the HSE.  There has been an increase of more than 250 doctors since the beginning of this year.  The number of whole-time equivalent nurses and midwives has increased by almost 800 since September 2018.  The recent nursing agreement, despite Deputy Donnelly telling the health committee he believed our nurses are well paid, includes additional measures to help with the recruitment and retention of nurses and puts more money back in their pockets.  With regard to consultants, I am pleased that engagement has started with their representative bodies.  With this engagement and with taxpayers' money must come reform.  We cannot have a situation where patients are waiting in an overcrowded emergency department and just because they cannot afford private health insurance they cannot access our hospital beds while a patient in a private bed is upstairs in our public bed with a private health insurance company making money.  That is not on.  That is not equitable.  I heard Sinn F&eacute;in talk at the weekend about an Irish NHS and I am up for that.  That is what Sl&aacute;intecare is all about.  However, I am not sure Sinn F&eacute;in is up for it if it refuses to rule out private practice in our public hospital beds.  I ask Sinn F&eacute;in to tell us its position.  If, God forbid, it ends up with the health Ministry will it take on the vested interests and say no more private practice in public hospitals?  Will it deliver on the Sl&aacute;intecare commitments?  I will and I will work with any party in the House that wants to do it.<\/p> <p> The emergency department task force meeting this afternoon and obviously I cannot be there because I am here in the House accounting and talking about these important issues.  I look forward to it monitoring the work of the winter plan.  I welcome the debate.  I want to work collaboratively to find solutions but be wary of anyone who stands up in the House and says there are three simple things we could do to fix it.  If there were three simple things we could do to fix it we would have done it.  It is a complex issue that requires massive reform and the delivery of Sl&aacute;intecare.  In the interim, it requires investment that we are putting in place this winter to try to alleviate some of the pressures.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000027#EE00300","speaker":"1251","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1574260800,"counter":317,"content":"<p>I could play the game as to which one of Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael is worse all day and it is great craic but it does not really resolve anything, let us be fair.<\/p>  <p>  The issue of overcrowding has been a constant for well over a decade now.  It did not start eight years ago and people are well aware of this.  Only last January, we in Sinn F&eacute;in passed a Private Members' motion on this exact issue, including pretty much all of the same solutions.  However, as has been the case with this D&aacute;il, votes do not matter and the expressed will of this house is ignored.<\/p>  <p>  The scandal of patients waiting on trolleys was officially declared an emergency by the former Minister for Health, Mary Harney, in the Fianna F&aacute;il Government of the day in 2006 when the trolley count reached 469.

Indeed, it has happened and it has continued to happen because the policies of Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael are virtually indistinguishable.

In 2012 the number was 66,308, in 2013 it was 67,863, in 2014 it was 77,091 and in 2015 it was 92,998.  Is anyone noticing a pattern?  We know that this year the number is already more than 100,000.  In 2016 to 2019, inclusive, Fianna F&aacute;il has been in a confidence and supply arrangement with the Fine Gael Government and has agreed and facilitated the Fine Gael budgets which have had a catastrophic impact on our health service.  Their cause for celebration in those budgets has been the hiving off of public money for the private health sector through the NTPF.  Only two organisations welcome this measure each year.  They are Fianna F&aacute;il and the Private Hospitals Association.  Make of that what you will.<\/p>  <p>  The Irish Association for Emergency Medicine has calculated that there could be between 300 and 350 excess patient deaths each year due to the trolley crisis and emergency unit overcrowding.  We only saw in the past number of weeks the harrowing story of Evelyn Crowley dying on a trolley in Cork University Hospital.  In Limerick hospital, which staff describe as an ecosystem of chaos, a 70 year old woman spent 105 hours on a hospital trolley.  How has this came about?  It is because of a lack of hospital beds throughout the State and a staffing crisis.  The cause of the staffing crisis in the health service has it roots in the recruitment moratorium in the health service brought in by the Fianna F&aacute;il Government in 2007, two years before it was introduced in any other Department.  Deputies can talk to staff working in the health service or to me and I will tell them about it as I represented health service staff at the time.  I can tell them that the moratorium was introduced in 2007 by Fianna F&aacute;il and we have not recovered from it.  This staffing crisis has been escalated by the recruitment freeze implemented by Fine Gael.  Be it a freeze, a pause or a moratorium, whatever the Minister wants to call it if he is not hiring it is effectively a recruitment embargo.<\/p>  <p>  Pay inequality for new entrant consultants and the failure to unwind FEMPI fully for consultants has crippled the public health system and has caused staff losses, demoralised current staff and has left the health service with around 500 consultant vacancies in various specialties, many in emergency medicine.<\/p>  <p>  We have a lack of beds.  Hundreds that closed during the austerity years have not been reopened and cannot be reopened because of a lack of staff.  I keep saying this and as long as there is an overcrowding and trolley crisis I will continue to say it.  To tackle the trolley crisis we have to address the issues causing it and focus on addressing them through increasing recruitment and retention, reopening closed beds, delivering more step-down facilities, increasing home help hours and having proper investment in primary and community care, including diagnostics.<\/p>  <p>  Fianna F&aacute;il facilitates the Government and the Minister for Health holds his office because Fianna F&aacute;il abstained in a motion of no confidence.  Fianna F&aacute;il has the power to change things at any stage and push through progressive policies at budget time and other times but it does not.  It can line up to pile in on the Fine Gael Government but it knows its part in this crisis and must acknowledge it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000028#FF00200","speaker":"1302"},{"type":"speech","time":1574260800,"counter":318,"content":"<p>As we debate another Private Members' motion on waiting lists, it is important to remember that regardless of the waiting figures associated with each motion I for one cannot say that I, in my more than 22 years as a D&aacute;il Deputy, have ever seen a Government sufficiently shocked and shamed into action.  It has never happened.  Put simply, if the severity of the October overcrowding figures were accepted by Government and Fianna F&aacute;il, the outcome of this evening's motion would be change.  But Fianna F&aacute;il is only here for the shock and not for the action, as the record demonstrates.<\/p>  <p>  We must remember what remains constant in our debates on hospital overcrowding.  That constant is the lived experience of those who linger on trolleys or hospital chairs.  As of this morning, I am told there are ten people on trolleys without a bed at Cavan General Hospital in my constituency.  The relatives and friends of those patients will no doubt be worried and distressed that their loved one may be experiencing more pain and discomfort than is necessary.  The fact there are only ten makes not a whit of difference to each of those families and those ten people.  For them, it is exactly the same distress and suffering as if it were 100 and we had ten times the number of people in that experience.<\/p>  <p>  I also want to point out the distress that this causes front-line staff in our hospitals.  Many staff put in long hours and go above and beyond to try and attend to all patients presenting.  I can imagine how disheartening it must be, leaving the hospital after a traumatic and hectic day, only to see those very same patients placed overnight in corridors.  Nurses have said this to me.<\/p> <p>Their work and dedication deserve better.  They have the right to be able to leave work having cared for patients to the best of their abilities and knowing that those same patients and others who will present will be afforded hospital beds long before they return to work on the following morning.  All too sadly, however, that is not the case.<\/p> <p> I note the tendency of the Fianna F&aacute;il spokesperson on health to refer to 2011 as if all was grand up to then and everything started to go bad after that year's general election.  The reality is that the NTPF was used extensively in the years 2009 to 2011, inclusive, before being suspended.  We have seen the NTPF put to use more recently to reduce waiting lists for surgeries and other inpatient procedures.  I hope that Fianna F&aacute;il is not advocating a return to such temporary measures.  What we need immediately is for action on the complete implementation of the Sl&aacute;intecare report.  If that were implemented, we would not have to rely on short-term, knee-jerk reactions.  Many patients, such as those on the ever-increasing cataract treatment waiting list, have benefitted from the NTPF.  I wish them well, but they should not have had to wait, then board buses to travel north, if that was their mode of transport, to receive what was their due in this State as of right.<\/p> <p> I wish to refer to those shocking October overcrowding figures.  Members of the public who sometimes struggle to understand the current political arrangements in the House often ask how large a scandal would it take for Fianna F&aacute;il to withdraw from its support arrangement with Fine Gael.  It will be obvious after tonight that, among the many other scandals of how our citizens are being treated, including in our health services, having more than 100,000 patients without hospital beds so far this year is not shocking or outrageous enough for Fianna F&aacute;il to put an end to this sell-out arrangement and pull the plug, which is what should happen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000028#FF00300","speaker":"1269","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1574261400,"counter":320,"content":"<p>I thank Fianna F&aacute;il for moving this motion, although I will be forgiven for feeling like this is Groundhog Day all over again.  We go around and around debating this.  Unfortunately, I do not believe that we, as a collective political institution, are taking one another seriously enough.  There is a lot of politics, but I am not sure that there are many solutions.<\/p>  <p>  Talking about the situation with trolleys and emergency theatres is like talking about the weather now.  It is that neutralised and socialised, which is awful.  The county I come from has the worst issues proportionately with admissions to hospitals.  We have Limerick on one side and south Tipperary on the other.  Although they get beaten the odd time, those two hospitals usually have the most number of people trying to get into them.  For us in Tipperary, it really is like talking about the weather.  This is not an issue of staff or management, whom I support in both locations.  They dread going into their respective hospitals.  Imagine being a public representative whose constituents dread going into their local hospital.  That is what my fellow Tipperary Deputies and I live with every day.<\/p>  <p>  Just like others, a number of members of my family were on trolleys in University Hospital Limerick, UHL, in recent weeks.  The circumstances people are being left in are disgraceful.  The discourse that emanates from that goes against all of the good work being done in health, for example, cancer strategies, maternity strategies and other public health strategies.  We must fix this.  Surely it cannot be beyond the capacity of the body politic to do so.  I say with great sincerity that the Minister is going to wish that the election was this month.  Unfortunately for the general public, if we have a flu epidemic, or even if we do not, it will be hell.  It is already hell where I live, so it will be an even worse form of hell.  The situation is that bad.  I do not say this with any political glee.<\/p>  <p>  We know about the more than 100,000 people on trolleys this year and the record levels of overcrowding.  What gets to me is the volume of elderly people who are being left on trolleys.  I am not unique - other mid-west representatives are present.  The amount of times one must fight to have elderly people, who are obviously more vulnerable than others, prioritised is ridiculous.  Since starting in politics, the proportion of my time spent fighting for patients to get access to hospital services has multiplied on a scale that I cannot even estimate.  I did it today.  I have been fighting for people all this week, all last week, all last month, every week and every day.  That is not the role of a Deputy, but because of how the system is failing, we are left in a scenario where probably all Deputies must try to intercept and fight those parts of the system that are falling down.<\/p>  <p>  I will tell the Minister a story - I have the lady's permission; her name is Deborah - as an illustration of how bad things are.  Deborah needed an operation on her gall bladder, which is not the most significant of operations but is quite painful.  She was admitted to UHL.  The people there first believed that they could take her as an outpatient, but she was then brought in.  The consultant switched views on this after a number of weeks and realised that the operation could not be done in UHL and she would have to be transferred to St. Vincent's.  St. Vincent's could not take her, though.  I had to intercept the issue, call St. Vincent's and ask why the consultant was not doing more procedures.  Obviously, he has private and public practices.  He is going under the tunnel on a Tuesday to work Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, and on Monday and Tuesday he is working in the public practice.  More than anyone, I am with the Minister as regards private practice in public hospitals.<\/p>  <p>  I, a politician, had to fight to get Deborah transferred to St. Vincent's.  Just before she actually got there, she got a letter from its outpatient department telling her the date for an outpatient appointment for a bloody operation that she did not even have arranged yet.  I had to tell the CEO's office in St. Vincent's that this was happening.  The hospital had given an outpatient appointment to a lady who was in UHL awaiting transfer to St. Vincent's for an operation that the latter could not provide because she had not even been transferred yet and the consultant could not take her.  After the appointment at St. Vincent's was cancelled a number of times, she eventually had the procedure.  This came 11 weeks after being admitted to UHL to have her gall bladder removed.  For 77 days at a conservative figure of &euro;1,300 per day, that is more than &euro;100,000, not counting additional costs like medicine.  By the way, she was given the wrong medicine twice.  Spending &euro;100,000 to have a lady's gall bladder removed is the situation that this country is in.  It is crazy.  Is it any wonder that we talk about the amount of money we are investing in healthcare when it costs &euro;100,000 for a lady to get her gall bladder removed?<\/p> <p>I have asked the director general of the HSE, Mr. Paul Reid, to look into this matter, which is a scandal.<\/p> <p> What the Minister said about the embargo is rubbish.  There are many examples of recruitment not happening.  I know of a person who was offered a role but who is now emigrating because the appointment has not been made.<\/p> <p> I will not talk about the HSE's winter plan because it is effectively a case of putting a finger in a dyke.  The overcrowding situation is so bad in some hospitals that one clinical lead told me in recent weeks that it will lead to a catastrophic event, if not multiple such events, in the coming winter period.  This very experienced person is effectively saying, and it is not said lightly, that people will die unnecessarily.  The Minister has challenged everybody here to provide solutions.  I wrote to Mr. Reid about the issues at UHL and requested answers regarding how it is proposed to deal with the situation there in both the short term and the medium term.  I was not happy with the response.  I have undertaken a comparative analysis of UHL versus Beaumont Hospital, which are two similarly sized hospitals with similar catchment areas.  It is bad enough that UHL is &euro;40 million in deficit in its current funding but when it comes to nurse numbers, there are 1,016 in that hospital compared with 1,294 in Beaumont.  That is a substantial difference, especially when one considers that Beaumont does not treat as many patients.  I can share all these data with the Minister.<\/p> <p> We must deal with the issue of consultants, as the Minister is well aware, and that requires tackling the embargo.  Bed provision is another issue.  The Minister visited Our Lady's hospital in Cashel three years ago but the unit there is still lying idle.  That represents an absolute waste of resources.  There are issues with model 4 hospitals and problems with care pathways.  Nenagh and Ennis hospitals, both in the mid-west, should be used more.  Their minor injuries units, for example, could be utilised to widen the pathways.  There are issues to deal with in regard to intermediate vehicles and making sure patients are transferred more quickly.  Another issue is that I do not know why we are not giving the flu vaccine to more people for free.  There would be a saving for taxpayers in doing so because fewer people would end up in the acute system.  The Minister is well aware of the issues concerning home care packages.<\/p> <p> Solutions are being put forward.  I urge the Minister, as we move into late November, to examine the four or five really bad hospital situations and work with the director general of the HSE to put in place plans that are specific to those hospitals and which give far more detail than is in the winter plan.  Otherwise, what I described at the beginning of my contribution will, unfortunately, come to pass.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000029#GG00200","speaker":"1349","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1574262000,"counter":322,"content":"<p>The Sinn F&eacute;in Deputies have four minutes remaining in their slot and Deputy Martin Kenny has indicated.

The problem of hospital overcrowding stretches to every part of the country.  Most people's experience of it is that it is a direct result of under-staffing in hospitals.  That is the nub of the issue.  I was contacted this week by a nurse who is employed in a hospital through an agency.  She applied for the same job directly with the hospital, was approved and a contract was drawn up.  However, because the job was advertised last July and more than three months have since passed, she must seek to have her application reapproved.  The people responsible for the procurement of staff told her she needed to seek someone out to get her own appointment approved.  When I spoke to the people concerned, who are based in Manorhamilton, they told me that there are hundreds of health service staff around the country in the same position.  There is no additional cost in securing this appointment.  In fact, it is costing more to employ staff such as this nurse through agencies.<\/p>  <p>  The argument is often made that the health service is in a mess because it costs so much.  The reality is that it is in a mess because people are not doing their job.  The Minister is the person at the very top and it is his job is to make sure other people do their job.  That is not happening, however, as the experience of many people shows.  If we are to get a grip on this situation, we need the Minister and the senior people in the Department to have the backbone to stand up and ensure that others do their job.  I have raised concerns on numerous occasions, during Topical Issue debates and other discussions in the House, with both the Minister and the Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne, that people in senior management in the HSE are swinging the lead.  Unless something is done about this, we are all wasting our time.  People are being left on long waiting lists and in queues in hospitals and, in some cases, they are ending up in the graveyard.  The state of the mental health service, in particular, is a cause for serious concern.  We must take control of the situation.  I challenge the Minister and the Government to tackle the situation finally, four years into its current term of office and following its previous term in government.  Failure to do so will be a huge indictment of the Minister and his legacy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000030#HH00300","speaker":"1345"},{"type":"speech","time":1574262000,"counter":324,"content":"<p>The Minister focused on two themes.  First was the argument that Fianna F&aacute;il did it first and, second, there is the notion that no policy change will alter the situation facing people who are waiting on outpatient lists or on trolleys in hospitals.  The first thesis is accurate.  Fianna F&aacute;il did indeed do it first, but that does not reduce the responsibility of the Minister or of this and the previous Fine Gael Government for the current state of the health service.  There has been almost a doubling of the numbers of patients on trolleys over the eight years of Fine Gael rule.  It is true that we are still struggling with the legacy of the horrific cuts in the 1980s, when 3,000 beds were lost.  Despite there being some subsequent movement towards recovery and improvement, that deficit was never dealt with properly.  The onset of the economic crisis saw the introduction of a massive programme of austerity by Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party, which was continued by Fine Gael when it entered office.<\/p>  <p>  A 2014 study conducted by Trinity College showed that &euro;2.7 billion was taken out of the health service between 2009 and 2014, resulting in 12,000 fewer staff, 21,000 fewer inpatient appointments, 30,000 fewer day cases and almost 1,000 fewer beds.  We have had decades of under-resourcing, which is the responsibility primarily of Fianna F&aacute;il and secondarily of Fine Gael, compounded by austerity since the crash.  Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael have continued to pursue the same policies.  The consequences of those austerity policies are seen in the huge waiting lists and the patients on trolleys but also in the entrenchment of the two-tier nature of the health service, which is at the root of many of its problems.  Public hospitals were forced into financial dependence on income from private patients who were allowed to jump the queue ahead of poorer and sicker public patients.  Even when the latter finally access treatment, the care they receive is generally inferior.<\/p>  <p>  The second theme the Minister set out is the idea that there is no single policy change that can turn things around.  It is part of the propaganda and argumentation of successive Governments and Ministers to suggest there is nothing that can be done about the health sector.  No matter who goes in and what they do, it will always be in crisis.  No matter how much money is spent, it will remain a funding black hole.  In fact, there is a simple policy change that would transform the situation, which is to adopt a policy of building a properly-funded national health service.  That service would have one tier rather than two, would not require people to pay out of pocket for medical expenses or private medical insurance and would ensure that everybody has equality of access to the health services they need.  That is the policy change we require and it would transform people's lives.  Unfortunately, Government policy points in the opposite direction.<\/p>  <p>  I will focus on a discrete area of the health service, the ambulance service, to illustrate the point I am making.  I got an answer from the HSE last week to a question regarding its expenditure on private ambulance services in the first eight months of 2019.  I was informed that &euro;7 million was spent filling the gap in hospital transfers, which involves the use of taxis.<\/p><p><i>4 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p>  <p>It is there.  It is relatively small in the grand scheme of the health service but it is a clear example of an underfunded ambulance service, made up for by paying for private operators to step in.  That happens at the same time as the disgraceful union busting treatment of the ambulance workers, personally directed by the Minister for Health against those who want to be members of the National Ambulance Service Representative Association, NASRA, and who are told after seven days of strike action they cannot join NASRA and the HSE will not deal with NASRA.  Every time they protest outside the D&aacute;il, we raise it in here and we get the same answer from the Minister every time, which is basically saying the Government thinks there are enough unions currently organising for ambulance workers and paramedics and therefore they should not be entitled to have a union of their choice.  It is utterly scandalous but it is replicated in the treatment of workers across the health service.<\/p> <p> That is one area but I mention the creeping privatisation, although the word \"creeping\" might understate it at this stage.  The expansive but not openly declared privatisation of our health service takes place throughout the service.  It takes place in the National Treatment Purchase Fund, the payment of agency nurses as opposed to employing people directly to work as part of the health service, private consultants using public hospitals, and people being able to jump queues and so on.  It is everywhere.  The alternative is to invest in a national health service.  That would make a huge difference in people's lives and health outcomes and in equality in our society.  Health inequality is huge in Ireland and statistics continually come out about that.<\/p> <p> It would also make a difference to people's pockets.  I got an answer from the Minister this week about the amount an average household spends on private healthcare and private health insurance each year.  The Minister confirmed the average household spends &euro;960 per year on medical expenses, covering things like GP, dentist and hospital visits etc.  The household budget survey gives a combined figure for medical and dental insurance in the same period of more than &euro;1,200 annually.  As we do not have a national health service, households in this State are already spending over &euro;2,000 on average to try to access the healthcare they need.<\/p> <p> The consequences for this underfunding are very clear.  They are spelled out by Phil N&iacute; Sheaghdha and the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, in the various press releases put out about the coming winter crisis.  The HSE predicts nearly 4% more patients will attend emergency departments, but that will be with 400 fewer staff nurses and midwives in the coming crisis if the recruitment pause is not ended and if there is no proper staffing of our health service.  The most extreme consequence of this underfunding is the estimated 300 to 350 people who will die as a consequence of overcrowding and of being stuck on trolleys etc. between now and next year.  It is horrific, and that goes on top of the experience of sitting on a trolley, the experience of a family member being on a trolley, and the experience of one in ten of the population sitting on outpatient lists, unable to access the healthcare they need.  We need a national health service.  A national health service is a part of a green new deal for Ireland.  Employing the proper number of staff to resource our health services properly means creating thousands more jobs, and those are low carbon jobs.  They are low carbon, high quality and high value jobs for our society.<\/p> <p> It also means taking on the power of the pharmaceutical companies.  We regularly deal with scandals here with people seeking to access necessary pharmaceuticals and medicines, often for their children, and being unable to do so because of the ransom these pharmaceutical companies are attempting to extract from people.  It points to the need for public ownership of the pharmaceutical companies, and in the meantime there is a need for a programme of generic production through publicly owned pharmaceutical companies to ensure life-saving drugs can be accessible to all.  It means taking private hospitals and healthcare companies out of the hands of profiteers, and in that way building a national health service that is equitably accessible to all who live here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000030#HH00400","speaker":"1433","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1574262600,"counter":326,"content":"<p>I am sharing time with Deputy Broughan.  The Minister is probably tired of hearing this discussion in the D&aacute;il.  It gets a bit depressing having to come in here and say it all the time but it deserves to be said.  Everybody has their local hospital and every hospital is in the same level of crisis.  It comes down to a lack of management.  It has started from the wrong place.  I agree with a lot of what Deputy Paul Murphy has said.  We are always starting in the wrong place, and as long as we do that, we will always be in this situation.  If Fianna F&aacute;il jumps over into power, it will have the same problem, it will say the exact same things the Minister is saying now, the Minister will be on the Opposition benches saying the exact same things Fianna F&aacute;il is saying, and it will be the same crap.<\/p>  <p>  The reality is this started with Mac the Knife back in the late 1980s and that process was continued by Fianna F&aacute;il.  The Minister has continued it on hell for leather.  When will they learn it is not working and it can never work?  The reality is we cannot keep cutting and expect it to work.  The reality is we cannot keep focusing on budgets and expect to get more for it because it will not happen and it cannot happen.  The reality is we have to bite the bullet and decide to provide more money for the health services so the service can deal with the problems it has.  We have an ageing population, we have an increasing demographic that needs the treatment and we need the proper home care services so people can get services at home.  That will help our hospitals and that has to be done.  Unfortunately, this Government is not doing it, Fianna F&aacute;il will not do it and no Government in this State will do it if it only concentrates on funding and budgets as a way of doing it because that will not make any difference.<\/p>  <p>  The way the Government is focusing on the problem has led to 49 people waiting on trolleys in Letterkenny University Hospital this morning.  That is up four from yesterday when it was 45.  It remains the second most overcrowded hospital in Ireland for the third consecutive day.  For the month of October, the INMO confirmed a total of 693 people were either on trolleys or waiting on wards in the hospital over the four-week period, making it one of the most overcrowded hospitals in the country, and this could be repeated across the board.  At Letterkenny University Hospital, there were 19,108 people awaiting inpatient or outpatient treatment at the end of June.  That is up 1,906 from June 2018, an increase of 11%.  In Letterkenny University Hospital, over 2,000 more people are awaiting an outpatient appointment.  A total of 1,783 women are waiting for a gynaecologist appointment at Letterkenny University Hospital.  That waiting list has been growing for the past five years.  The recruitment embargo has prevented management at Letterkenny University Hospital from recruiting the nurses, doctors and support staff required to reopen the hospital short stay ward fully.  Those are the facts of the matter and that can be repeated across the board.  In Letterkenny University Hospital we also have an ambulance service that is run for a big county but where most of the ambulances are sitting at the hospital waiting to discharge patients into it.  That is fucking ridiculous.  This has gone on and on and we are here all the time talking about it.  It should not continue but the Minister is not dealing with the problem properly because the problem is a funding issue and that is where the solution will be.  If the Minister is constantly talking about doing more for less, he will do less for less.  That is the reality of the situation and that is all that will happen.<\/p>  <p>  I personally have a problem with the &euro;1.5 billion we give in VHI tax breaks.  Why do we not put that into the health services?  That would raise &euro;1.5 billion straight away.  Instead of giving people tax breaks for having private health insurance, and I pay for other people to have private health insurance, we should put that money into the health services and make sure they are responsible towards our people.  Then we might see some difference.  However, it will go the way the Minister is going, we will go into an election with the Minister in crisis mode, Fianna F&aacute;il will say it is terrible, it will go into government, it will do the same and Fine Gael will say it is terrible.

They have reduced the number of badly needed acute hospital beds and, disgracefully, the number of HSE staff under the three austerity Governments since 2007.  We on the Committee on Budgetary Oversight have year after year examined the budgets and, inspired by people such as Fr. Se&aacute;n Healy and others who have appeared before the committee to give us evidence and ideas, have found that health budgets are consistently too small.  That is the bottom line.  Budget 2020, which was announced a few weeks ago, outlined Estimates for the health Vote, Vote 38, of &euro;18.3 billion for 2020, &euro;18.4 billion for 2021 and &euro;18.5 billion for 2022.  Where did the Department of Finance get those suspiciously similar figures?  What about the delivery of Sl&aacute;intecare or of additional services?  Everyone in the House and all our constituents know that these Estimates are significantly too low to address the crucial needs outlined in the motion.

All the new expenditure, such as the &euro;25 million for the NTPF he mentioned, the &euro;10 million for palliative care and so on, are simply too low, or at least too low together, and they leave out crucial sectors of the health service.  Most members of the Committee on Budgetary Oversight have consistently sought realistic, sustainable budgets for a well-functioning health service in order that we will not keep reverting to crisis after crisis.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, and Deputy Michael McGrath of Fianna F&aacute;il have together agreed four budgets over the past four years which have simply failed to deliver that, which is why it is ironic to hear the health spokesperson of Fianna F&aacute;il so upset by the matter.<\/p><p>At 8 a.m. today, 360 people were on trolleys around the country, with 174 people waiting on wards, which included ten people on trolleys at Beaumont Hospital.  There were 30 people on trolleys at the Mater Hospital, eight at Crumlin hospital, 23 at Tallaght Hospital, 25 at Cork University Hospital, 23 at Mercy University Hospital, 27 at University Hospital Galway, 25 at University Hospital Waterford, 30 at University Hospital Limerick and so on.  One of the most despicable aspects of the statistics is that it was reported in October that 107 children had been forced to wait on trolleys for beds to become available.  Professor Malone, the master of the Rotunda Hospital, whom others reference, has told us graphically that overcrowding contributed to one premature baby dying and two others being infected with meningitis because of beds being so close together and that approximately 4,500 premature babies are born each year.  He seeks an additional &euro;50 million for the neonatal intensive care unit.<\/p><p>Ms Eilish O&rsquo;Regan, the distinguished correspondent of the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>, reported yesterday that waiting list surgery will have to be scaled back in December and January to free up hospital beds for patients on trollies in overflowing accident and emergency departments.  Service plan targets set by the Minister to reduce waiting lists to below 500,000 and surgery waiting lists to below 60,000 will reportedly be abandoned.  Will the Minister confirm this?  Like other Deputies, I have contacted Mr. Paul Reid, the CEO of the HSE, and the Minister since the spring about reports on health service constituents who briefed me on the 2019 embargo on staff appointments.  The Minister has denied that the embargo is happening, as have the Taoiseach and Mr. Reid, but I have learned of appointments made last April for which the new workers, whether front-line or support staff, will be taking up their jobs in January 2020.  That is clearly based on financial and administrative grounds.  The embargo did happen.  It was disgraceful and it should not happen again because there should be a realistic budget for 2020.<\/p><p>In general terms, the motion lays out the horrendous aspects of the health system.  We must support urgent action on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000032#KK00100","speaker":"1361"},{"type":"speech","time":1574263200,"counter":328,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Michael Healy-Rae.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000032#KK00200","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1574263200,"counter":329,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Donnelly and his colleagues in Fianna F&aacute;il for bringing forward this important motion-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000032#KK00300","speaker":"1319"},{"type":"speech","time":1574263200,"counter":330,"content":"<p>My apologies.

First, we need to better utilise our injury units, which can provide for quick diagnosis and discharge back into the community and ensure that people do not have long stays for tests that can be provided there.  Currently, people go directly to accident and emergency departments rather than to injury units and an effort needs to be made to encourage people within the catchment area of injury units to go there in preference.  If they do present at an injury unit, they should be considered as having been admitted to an accident and emergency department and get credit for when they go there.  To send a clear message on the matter, I ask the Minister to make one change, namely, to reduce the charges for people presenting at an injury unit.  One pays the same charge for presenting at an injury unit as at an accident and emergency department.  There is no incentive there.  If the policy is to encourage people to go to injury units, which it should be, we should not charge them the same fees as for going to an accident and emergency department.  There are state-of-the-art equipment, diagnostics and even staff on call in many of the injury units, yet the doors are locked at 8 p.m.  Surely it would make far sense if the GP out-of-hours service based beside such facilities operated out of them and had access to the diagnostic facilities.<\/p>  <p>  Second, we need to utilise vacant nursing home beds available throughout the country to assist with the discharge of patients from hospital.<\/p>  <p>  Third, we have to lift the embargo on critical appointments.  I flagged in the Chamber last week the issue of vacant posts for public health nurses in Ballinsaloe and it is welcome that we have made progress and two of the posts will be filled.  Nevertheless, two community nursing posts that could assist in the discharge of patients from Portiuncula hospital remain vacant, and it makes more sense to make that investment now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000032#KK00700","speaker":"1234"},{"type":"speech","time":1574263200,"counter":334,"content":"<p>I compliment the people working in accident and emergency departments at University Hospital Kerry in Tralee, Cork University Hospital and the hospital in Limerick.  These people are at the coalface, working very hard, but they are not happy with the management of the HSE, the Minister or his Department because of what they see as failings in the system.  I was grateful to the Minister in the past when I brought the management of what we will call the private hospital in Tralee to meet him to discuss very important issues such as how we in Kerry could use a model that is second to none in Ireland, given that a public hospital and a private hospital are located within 1 km of each other.  The two hospitals could work far better together to achieve a reduction in waiting times.  Solutions at the time were given to the Minister and his officials.  The HSE, both in Kerry and Cork, knows how we could better utilise the services of the two hospitals but I am still looking for that to happen.  Both are excellent hospitals in their own right, but by putting them working together, we could help dramatically to reduce the waiting times.  It is inhuman to think of a person, whether old, young or middle-aged, going to an accident and emergency department and wondering whether he or she will be there for one, two or three days.  It is outrageous.  It should not happen at any hospital in the country that an old person would sit on a trolley and wait for hours or days.  I ask the Minister, once and for all, please to try to sort it out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000032#KK00800","speaker":"1319"},{"type":"speech","time":1574263200,"counter":335,"content":"<p>Like the previous speaker, I compliment Fianna F&aacute;il on tabling the motion.

I raised this matter with the Taoiseach recently on Leaders' Questions and was shocked to hear him respond as if this situation was normal or acceptable.  It is not normal or acceptable.  In fact, it is the result of a deliberate policy pursued by successive Governments.  It goes back quite some time, to the Hanly and Fitzgerald reports.  Those reports were not accepted at the time.  The policies underpinning those reports and their recommendations had been implemented on an ongoing basis by successive Governments.  They took every opportunity to implement the recommendations, including during recessions.  The saying is that one should never waste a good recession.<\/p>  <p>  These policies were sold on the basis that big is best, centralisation is good and centres of excellence were needed.  Big is not always best.  Centralisation is not always good.  All of our hospitals should be centres of excellence, and they can be if they are supported, funded and resourced properly.  We need specialist hospitals to provide specialist services, but general medical services, such as general surgery, paediatrics, maternity care and accident and emergency departments can and should be provided locally to a standard of excellence.  This is being done despite significant pressures on staff who work above and beyond the call of duty on an ongoing basis.<\/p> <p>We can see the results of the policies pursued by this and previous Governments in our health service.  There is absolute chaos, with severe overcrowding in hospitals and some 100,000 patients already obliged to wait on trolleys this year.  At UHL, as many as 70 patients are often on trolleys, while nearly 50 patients are in a similar situation in South Tipperary General Hospital.  That is the situation as it stands, and those are two of the worst hospitals in the country for overcrowding.  However, every hospital is suffering as a result of that problem.<\/p> <p> The overcrowding in our hospitals is inhumane.  We have to remember that patients on trolleys are human beings and are entitled to service and respect.  They are not getting that from the health service today.  We know from professionals who have brought this matter to public attention, that this year and every year some 300 elderly patients will die in our hospitals unnecessarily, because of overcrowding, time spent on trolleys and the general chaos in the system.  This situation has arisen due to the policies of successive Governments.  My area includes Limerick and the mid-west, as well as what was formerly the South Eastern Health Board area and is now the South\/South West hospital group area and these policies started to be implemented there way back in 1988.  That was when the Government of the day closed 50 beds in St. Vincent's Day Hospital in Tipperary town.  Taking those 50 beds out of the system immediately put great pressure on the other hospitals.  That policy was continued when Our Lady's Hospital in Cashel was closed and another 30 beds were lost.  That is a total of 80 beds having been taken out of the system in the south Tipperary already.<\/p> <p> Turning to the mid-west, on the basis that big is best, that centralisation was needed and that an excellent service could not be provided in our local hospitals, which we can now see was incorrect, the Government of the day closed Nenagh Hospital, Ennis Hospital and St. John's Hospital in Limerick.  We know and see the result of those closures daily in UHL.  To give a concrete example, in South Tipperary General Hospital in 2011, when Fine Gael came to power first, some 700 patients were on trolleys.  Some 6,000 patients on are now on trolleys in that hospital.  It is a similar story in every other hospital.<\/p> <p> South Tipperary General Hospital operates on the basis of 120% occupancy, while the medical department there operates on the basis of 150% occupancy.  The generally accepted safe level of occupancy is 85% to 90% at most, so there is great pressure.  We have to come to terms with the policies that various and successive Governments have been pursuing for years.  We also have to face up to the fact that these policies were wrong, should not have been implemented and should now be reversed.  The accident and emergency departments at Ennis and Nenagh should be reopened, because there is no doubt that the situation at UHL has been gravely exacerbated by the closure of those departments.  Thankfully, we are eventually going to get our 40-bed unit in South Tipperary General Hospital.  We hope that will be before the end of January 2020.  Overall, however, we lost 80 beds in the area and we need at least another 40 or 50 in a new block.<\/p> <p> The Minister was in Tipperary two or three years ago and he visited Our Lady's Hospital in Cashel, which is a state-of-the-art facility.  Some &euro;14 million was spent on upgrading that hospital, but there is not a single bed in it because it has been vacant for the past ten years.  It is definitely time for that hospital to be opened because it can and should be able to provide step-down facilities.  The expenditure on the hospital was intended to provide district hospital beds, palliative care beds and step-down facilities, but it has been vacant and left in pristine condition for the past decade.  The hospital should be opened immediately.<\/p> <p> As other speakers indicated, the moratorium - and that is what it is - on recruitment of staff must be lifted.  General nurses tell us that 400 staff are needed in their area, while psychiatric nurses estimate that there are approximately 500 unfilled posts.  The moratorium on home help hours must also be lifted.  The recent increase in the funding for home help hours, well and good as it is, will cater for less than 50% of the existing backlog.  Another area in need of urgent attention is GP services and availability.  I also want to state that I support the comments of Deputy Paul Murphy and I would also like to see a proper national health service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000033#LL03700","speaker":"1348","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1574264400,"counter":374,"content":"<p>We move next to Deputy Aylward, who is sharing time with Deputies Niall Collins, Dooley, Murphy O'Mahony and Lawless.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000034#MM00200","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1574264400,"counter":375,"content":"<p>We have two minutes each.

Fine Gael has broken the wrong kind of historic records in respect of the numbers of people on trolleys annually.  Some 28 people are languishing on trolleys in my local hospital, St. Luke's, in Kilkenny, and another 20 are on trolleys in University Hospital Waterford.<\/p>  <p>  In the south east, we are still fighting for equality of cardiac care.  It is the only region without 24-7 cardiac facilities and people are fearful that recent overspending in other areas of the health service could keep us waiting even longer for those essential lifesaving services.  The situation in our hospitals is scandalous and unfair on our hardworking staff, as well as our sick and vulnerable citizens.  There is a major problem with GP retention in rural Ireland and the Government must focus on this issue and incentivise GPs to avail of contracts in rural practices.  It must also be ensured that these practices are adequately equipped, resourced and staffed.<\/p>  <p>  If we can treat more people in GP surgeries, we will then have fewer people being admitted to accident and emergency departments.  The Government must also address the many issues relating to delayed discharges.  This is a major problem in Kilkenny and home care packages are needed to facilitate care and healing in the comfort of people's own homes.  Too many beds are being taken up by people who have been officially discharged by hospitals but who cannot go home as they have no home care packages in place or are awaiting approval of their applications.<\/p>  <p> The Minister owes it to the hardworking staff in our hospitals, who have held the health system together in recent years, to ensure that he does not continue to preside over such chaos.  I ask him to take the seriousness of this situation on board, given that we are not even near the end of the winter yet.  We have another month to go during which there may be sickness, such as that caused by flu epidemics.

We now need action.  People in Limerick and the mid-west region are aghast and afraid to go to that department.  It saddens me to have people describe that department as a cattle mart and the last place in the world to which they want to go.  People should have confidence in that accident and emergency department.  I know the Minister is due to visit shortly and he really needs to focus, through his office and Department, in addressing that issue.<\/p>  <p>  On primary care, the Minister has concluded a deal with the GPs and that deal has been accepted.

Having been offered a position in Galway, she has been told she cannot take it up because the funding has been held back.  To give another example, a constituent of mine who applied for home help hours for her parents, both of whom have a critical need for the service, was told by the local public health nurse that there is an embargo in place.  Her parents cannot avail of the service as a result.  I also received an email from a nurse who took a career break to go to Australia and has since returned.  She has not been allowed a pathway back into her job because of the embargo.  The Minister contends that there is no embargo but it is in place. <\/p> <p> If we could unwind financial emergency measures in the public interest as they apply to pharmacists and get rid of the pay inequality that applies to some doctors, particularly consultants, it would go a long way towards attracting and retaining staff in front-line health services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000034#MM00400","speaker":"1221","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1574265000,"counter":378,"content":"<p>Like other Deputies who represent the mid-west, I draw the Minister's attention to the crisis at University Hospital Limerick.  From an accident and emergency perspective, it is wholly unacceptable.  I do not want to fan the flames or personalise this matter.  The whole political process and a whole-of-Government approach are needed here.  I will cite a couple of cases that I have found striking.  One relates to a woman who spent five days on a trolley in the past week.  That case has been well versed in the local media and I am sure the Minister has heard about it.  In another case, only last month, a farmer in his 70s who collapsed on his farm was rushed to the accident and emergency department in Limerick where he spent two days on a trolley in his dirty farm clothes.  He was squashed beside a patient with ulcerated legs.  If that does not flag a serious crisis in terms of cross-contamination, what does?  A fantastic new facility accident and emergency facility has been built at the hospital but there are enough beds in the hospital or in the catchment area to get patients through the system.  That is a serious issue.<\/p><p>On waiting lists, I understand the reason for the focus on accident and emergency departments because that is the front line.  I will give the Minister three examples of constituents who are on waiting lists.  A 70 year old woman, who is incontinent, has been waiting for three years to get an appointment.  To date, I have been able to get an appointment date for her.  There was much talk last week about the respect and dignity that was not afforded to a prisoner who had to slop out.  What kind of respect or dignity has been shown to a woman who has been waiting for three years to have an issue with incontinence addressed?  Can the Minister imagine what that does to that woman?  It beggars belief.  In another case, a 55 year old woman with an arthritic condition has been waiting three years for an appointment.  Even using the parliamentary questions process, I have been unable to get a date for her.  Another woman of 65 years of age has been waiting for a year to see a consultant about a hip complaint.  She was told via  a parliamentary question that I tabled that she would wait for at least four years.  Somebody in the health service wrote to her informing her she would get an appointment within four years, after which she will have to go back on the list to have surgery done.  I could go on but I am giving the Minister a flavour of the issue.<\/p><p>The Minister is also an elected politician who meets people every day.

Never before have so many people been waiting on trolleys.  Never before have so many old people been left waiting on trolleys for more than 24 hours.  This is only the start of the winter.  We have not had a flu epidemic or major crisis, yet there is an overcrowding crisis.

Enda has been and gone but the waiting lists are still here and are, in fact, worse than ever.<\/p><p>Naas General Hospital in my constituency serves a large hinterland of County Kildare and west County Wicklow.  In September, the number of people on trolleys at the hospital fluctuated between 25 and 32, making it the most overcrowded hospital in the eastern region, including the Dublin hospitals, on a number of days in the past two months.  We are disappointed that a regional hospital is more overcrowded than hospitals in the capital city.<\/p><p>I have raised previously with the Minister the issue of a new endoscopy unit in Naas hospital.

Many promises and commitments have been made and there has been talk of a funding announcement.  Every year, it is <i>d&eacute;j&agrave; vu<\/i>when we hear yet another announcement and commitment.

One has been in the pipeline for some time but it has not yet arrived.  I ask the Minister to put that on his radar and take action on it.<\/p><p>The Lakeview psychiatric unit at Naas hospital also needs significant attention.  A project has been in the pipeline for some considerable time but it has not come through.  People cannot wait any longer.

It must be acknowledged that attendances at our emergency departments are growing year on year.  As the health service capacity review indicates, Ireland has among the highest acute bed occupancy rates in the developed world.  It must also be acknowledged that there has been an increase in delayed transfer of care and that there are challenges in ensuring timely discharge of patients who no longer need acute care.  Given the challenges, my Department is engaging extensively with the HSE this year to identify mitigating actions to bring down trolley numbers and waiting times in the emergency departments.  The &euro;26 million in additional winter funding secured by the Minister for 2019 will help to relieve demand for emergency department services, support more timely discharge of patients and deliver other initiatives to help hospitals deal with the challenges associated with winter.  This will be achieved through the provision of additional transitional care beds, increased funding for the fair deal scheme and provision of additional home care packages.<\/p>  <p>  The nine winter action teams have been in operation since the beginning of October 2019 and are responsible for the co-ordination of a range of integrated hospital and community actions on a daily basis.  Each winter action team reports weekly to the winter oversight group, with enhanced reporting by sites in particular difficulty or at times of exceptional pressure.  The winter oversight group is chaired by the chief operations officer of the HSE and its membership consists of senior HSE staff across the relevant divisions.<\/p>  <p>  Improving timely access for patients is at the heart of Sl&aacute;intecare.  Building upon the progress made in recent years in this area, the Sl&aacute;intecare Action Plan 2019, published by the Department of Health, includes a specific work stream on access and waiting lists.  In addition, many of the other service reforms and enhancements included in the action plan will support timely access to care for patients in the coming years.  Progress has already been made in implementing the Sl&aacute;intecare action plan's access actions this year.<\/p>  <p>  We all acknowledge that the challenges we face are significant.  Of that, there is little doubt.  However, it is my firm belief that all of us want to find the right patient-centred, evidence-based, results-focused and sustainable solutions to the challenges facing our health services.  Investment alone will not deliver the health service we aspire to, and nor will reform or productivity improvements on their own.  All three efforts, including additional capacity, must be delivered in tandem if we are to achieve the vision set out in the Sl&aacute;intecare report of a universal single tier health and social care system where everyone has equal access to services based on need and not ability to pay.<\/p>  <p>  I repeat the point that the most effective way of achieving the Sl&aacute;intecare vision which has the support of all parties is by backing the Government's continued implementation of the Sl&aacute;intecare plan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000035#NN00500","speaker":"1261"},{"type":"speech","time":1574265000,"counter":382,"content":"<p>Deputy O'Rourke is sharing time with Deputies Breathnach, Rabbitte, &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v and Donnelly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000035#NN00600","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1574265600,"counter":383,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Donnelly for bringing forward this relevant and important motion.  I will focus on the delayed discharges and the impact they are having on families and the patients.  I can offer some statistics for the Minister as he leaves the Chamber.  From January 2019 to date, Naas General Hospital has lost 5,883 bed days due to delayed discharges.  This figure is one of the highest for a hospital outside Dublin.  Another statistic relates to people over 75 years of age.  In October, there were 69 people over 75 years of age on trolleys in the emergency department for more than 24 hours.  From January to date, the total was 851 people over 75 years old on hospital trolleys in the emergency department for 24 hours or more.  That is just a flavour of the reality on the ground.  We are all trying to work together but the Government must bring forward solutions to improve these statistics for the most vulnerable.<\/p>  <p>  The main reasons for delayed discharges are the lack of access to appropriate step-down care, such as the home care that we have discussed with the Minister of State, Deputy Daly, on a number of occasions, and the lack of housing adaptation grants, particularly for local authority houses.  For example, &euro;450,000 was allocated to Kildare County Council to provide housing adaptation grants for its housing stock.  That is not nearly enough and discharges are being delayed as a result.  People cannot go home because they need adaptations carried out in their houses.  With regard to home care, people are assessed in the hospital but what they require cannot be delivered because the funding is not available.  That is causing them to stay in hospital, thus leading to bed blocking and so forth in the hospital.<\/p>  <p>  These are two fundamental areas that require attention and delivery.  People want to be at home in their houses because that is where they are happiest and can live independently.  That frees up the health system for the treatment of other patients.  The home care team in community healthcare organisation, CHO, 7 has told me that it cannot approve home care packages due to the lack of funding.  That is leading to bed blocking and has the knock-on effect of patients being unable to access hospitals, including the National Rehabilitation Hospital in D&uacute;n Laoghaire, due to delayed discharges.  The solution is clear.  We must put further resources into the home care area, in which the Minister of State is involved, and housing adaptation grants.  That combination will facilitate discharges and help people to live independently at home.  Along with the housing issue, this is the single biggest crisis that all Deputies deal with in their constituencies each week.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000036#OO00100","speaker":"1324"},{"type":"speech","time":1574265600,"counter":384,"content":"<p>Christmas may be coming and the geese may be getting fat, but so are the numbers relating to delayed discharges, the trolley crisis and the bed crisis in our hospitals.  Like Deputy O'Rourke, I wish to focus on the home care supports that would go some way towards alleviating the growing problems with delayed discharges.  Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Louth has 14,941 lost bed days, the second highest number in the country outside of Dublin.  These lost bed days mean that there were people who were eligible to be discharged from hospital but they did not have access to appropriate step-down facilities.  The almost 15,000 bed days lost to delays are outrageous.  The simple fact is that there was nowhere else for those people to go.  A total of 296 people over the age of 75 years spent more than 24 hours on trolleys or chairs in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital since the beginning of this year.<\/p>  <p>  Overcrowding, cramped wards and the trolley crisis will continue unless urgent funding is provided for step-down facilities, home care packages and creating a speedier fair deal process.  I am dealing with a number of cases where a person is in a hospital and the family is awaiting finalisation of the fair deal.  They can be waiting up to 12 weeks for the process to be completed.  Surely the person could be given a cheaper facility in a nursing home in the meantime while the decision is made on the fair deal.<\/p>  <p>  The issuing of crisis medical cards is taking seven to eight weeks.

At present, we are waiting for Saolta University Health Care Group to release the funding for 24 consultant positions to ensure that those consultants can properly engage in the function of running the hospital.  It is very hard for hospitals to function and to expect the staff who are there to operate with 24 fewer consultants.  Twenty of the positions are permanent and four are temporary.  The embargo is affecting the position of dietician in the endocrinology department.  Not having a dietician in that department has mammoth ramifications for all patients.  This year there have only been ten surgeries.  With bariatric surgery the band that is required can only be put in place with the assistance of a dietician.  The dietician was awarded the contract last February, but because of the embargo she has not been given the opportunity to take up her position.  The same has happened with a number of physiotherapy positions.<\/p>  <p>  To refer to the public health nurse position for Ballinasloe and Portumna, it took a number of weeks to resolve that.  The nurses were expected to work with one third of the staff.  It was resolved last week when we got two public health nurses, but we are still awaiting the approval of two community nurses.

The large number of speakers on this side of the House demonstrates the scale of the crisis.  As my colleague, Deputy Rabbitte, said, University Hospital Galway is a disaster.  The latest dream is that we are going to get a brand new hospital.  I would love to have a new hospital in Merlin Park, but in the meantime we must solve the problems there now.  We want no reneging on the commitment to Newcastle Road in respect of the emergency department that we have been repeatedly promised since 2011, although it is no further forward since then.<\/p>  <p>  There are many issues we could discuss.  One of the extraordinary ones was the fact that after training nurses in Galway, UHG did not offer them contracts.  They can be taken back on a contract but they are not getting permanent jobs in the hospital.  We are constantly being told that there are not enough nurses to take up the jobs.  That was an extraordinary decision.  When I ask the Minister about the policy on this or something else, I get an answer from the HSE.  It appears that the Minister and the Department do not have any overriding policy.  I always thought that the idea behind a semi-State agency was that it implements Government policy, but time and again this Government tells us that it does not have a policy and that the agency has the policy.  Most of those policies are negative.<\/p>  <p>  One of the problems with getting into hospital is that the hospitals are critically short of beds.  The other problem is that people cannot get into the hospital because people cannot get out of it.  They are waiting for the fair deal.  It is an enormously costly wait because every week costs almost &euro;1,000.  If a person is waiting 12 or 14 weeks between the assessments and the approval being given financially, it is a huge amount of money.  Another problem is the critical shortage of home care.  If people being discharged require a high level of care, it is not possible to facilitate them.<\/p><p><i>5 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p>  <p>We could be here all evening on this but I hope the Minister of State gets the message.

The only opportunity to do that is during the Finance Bill, which is why I have tabled a series of amendments asking that the Government produce reports to get the information we need to examine these issues.  Even with the sources available to me as the finance spokesperson for a small party with limited resources, I find the situation shocking.<\/p>  <p>  When we discussed this yesterday, I noted that most people would be shocked to know that the net worth of Irish households currently stands at &euro;740 billion.  That is the net figure, after liabilities.  If that was shared out equally, everyone would have &euro;150,000 each.  Of course, the truth is the vast majority of people have no savings at all and often owe more than they own.<\/p> <p>That enormous wealth, which has been generated and increased dramatically over the past seven or eight years, is concentrated in the hands of a tiny group of people.  It is not me saying this; the information is from the Central Bank's quarterly statistics, which show that 53% of the &euro;740 billion of wealth I described is concentrated in the hands of 10% of the population.  The top 5%, comprising 85,000 households, have roughly &euro;3.26 million each, on average, which is incredible.  Vast amounts of wealth are concentrated in the hands of an absolutely tiny group of people while the vast majority either owe more than they own or have no savings and struggle just to pay bills relating to childcare, mortgages or rent.  They survive on meagre earnings.<\/p> <p> Other figures that I do not have to hand - I do not believe the Minister of State disputes these because I spoke to him earlier as he has examined them - show the share of national income that goes to profits versus that which goes to wages.  That has dramatically shifted in favour of profits over the past 20 or 30 years, more so in Ireland than in any other country in the western world.  Far from there being a trickle-down of wealth as Ireland records some of the highest levels of economic growth anywhere in the western world, it is gushing upwards into the hands of a tiny group of people.<\/p> <p> By means of these amendments, I am arguing that we need to address this and see it as a problem.  Of course, it is a social problem.  In the early 1970s, people in average jobs, if they had jobs, could hope to be able to afford a mortgage.  Now, well-qualified people with jobs cannot do that.  It is a real and tangible expression of this growing inequality in the distribution of wealth.  People work really hard in jobs and qualify for skilled work but their earnings are not enough to be able to put an affordable roof over their heads.  This arises because much of the real wealth in the economy is invested in property assets and these are rented back to the people who cannot afford them at an extortionate price.  People are sitting on money and it is making more money for them; they are getting richer while, in real terms, ordinary workers are getting poorer.<\/p> <p> It is in this context that we argue that there should be wealth taxes.  This would help redistribute the fruits of large economic growth, and specifically the growth in household wealth, in a fairer way to the benefit of the majority and not just a super-wealthy minority.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000037#PP02800","speaker":"1238","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1574266800,"counter":415,"content":"<p>Ireland already has a variety of taxes on wealth, including capital gains and capital acquisitions taxes that levied on individuals or companies on the disposal of assets, in the case of capital gains tax, or the acquisition of an asset through gift or inheritance, in the case of capital acquisitions tax.  The local property tax introduced in 2013 is based on the market value of residential properties and can also be categorised as a tax on wealth.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to understand where Ireland stands in the context of the distribution of wealth.  Officials examine all items relating to taxation, including wealth taxation, on an ongoing basis.  For example, in 2016 and 2018, Department officials conducted two research projects in conjunction with the ESRI on the distribution of wealth in Ireland and the potential implications of a wealth tax.  The resulting research papers, Scenarios and Distributional Implications of a Household Wealth Tax in Ireland, are available on the ESRI website.  Both presented results on the composition of net wealth - assets less liabilities - across both wealth and income distribution in Ireland.  A number of wealth tax scenarios, including regimes from other jurisdictions and hypothetical scenarios, were applied to the Irish data.  In each case, the associated tax bases and revenue yields, the number of liable households across income distribution and the characteristics of the household affected were outlined.<\/p>  <p>  Looking at the composition of households under the different tax scenarios, the studies found that even with a narrow base and high threshold, some households in low income deciles were affected.  This is because of the imperfect correlation between income and wealth.  Furthermore, if a wealth tax were applied in addition to the related forms of wealth taxation, it could have the disincentive effect of causing large changes in the level and type of assets held by Irish households.  Households could be expected to respond to high effective rates of tax and capital income, for example, by reducing holdings of assets in Ireland or relocating wealth holdings to asset types facing a lower wealth tax charge.  Additionally, the distribution implications of a wealth tax across different types of households should be taken into account.  A larger proportion of a wealth tax burden would fall on older households than the share of net wealth might indicate.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to increases to taxes on high-income earners, in 2020 it is projected that the top 1.5% of taxpayer units - those with annual income in excess of &euro;200,000 - will pay 26.5% of the total income tax and universal social charge, USC.  This is a very large proportion of the total income tax and USC take for such a small cohort of taxpayers.  In comparison, 72% of taxpayers - those with annual income of less than &euro;50,000 - will pay 15% of income tax and USC.  To further demonstrate the high amount of tax being paid by high earners under the current income tax and USC system, figures indicate that in 2020 it is expected that there will be approximately 2.78 million taxpayer units, including married couples under joint assessment, bringing a yield from income tax and USC of just over &euro;24 billion.  There will be 2.3 million taxpayer units with incomes of less than &euro;70,000 per annum and the remaining yield of over &euro;17 billion will be paid by fewer than 440,000 taxpayer units earning over &euro;70,000 per annum.<\/p>  <p>  A broad-based progressive income tax system whereby the majority of income earners make some contribution but according to their means is the fairest and most sustainable income tax system in the long term.  The Department of Finance will continue to monitor and consider any additional information or data that comes to its attention.  It will continue to examine existing and alternative potential taxation sources.  The Minister does not have any plans to introduce tax measures along the lines indicated in the report sought by the Deputy.  As a result, I do not propose to accept the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000038#QQ00200","speaker":"1364"},{"type":"speech","time":1574266800,"counter":416,"content":"<p>The vast majority of the increase in household wealth is in the value of property assets, as the Minister of State has acknowledged.

They could not take housing with them and one cannot carry land and property assets from the country.  It might not be bad if these people moved their money from property because it could lead to the extortionate price of property assets falling.  That would not be bad at all.

Offaly, Aghamore Townland, Co. Longford and Lanesborough Townland, Co. Longford.&rdquo;. <\/blockquote>  <p>I have been at a committee meeting dealing with the same issue and apologise that I inadvertently did not get the opportunity to move amendment No. 12.  That amendment and amendment No. 14 deal with the same issue.  Amendment No. 14 refers to the townlands in which the two peat-fired powered stations in Lanesborough and Shannonbridge are located.  Amendment No. 12 references the 20 sites across the midlands where there are Bord na M&oacute;na workshops, which are directly relevant to the cessation of peat harvesting across the midlands.  I seek a specific tax incentive be put in place in respect of these 20 sites to encourage replacement employment for the significant job losses we are facing in the ESB in 13 months and in Bord na M&oacute;na in the coming weeks.  As many people from the midlands would know, because there is already a stockpile of peat on our bogs, there will not be any peat harvesting next year.  That means all the seasonal jobs in Bord na M&oacute;na are now gone.  On top of that, that is a significant threat to the permanent jobs.  As I said to the Minister, Deputy Bruton, and as I said on Committee Stage to the Minister for Finance, this is effectively the equivalent of Google deciding to pull out of the city of Dublin.  That is the impact and the scale of this decision across the midlands that will impact on people between now and the end of next year.<\/p><p>While the action by Government is welcome and any progress in this area is very welcome, and the appointment, in particular, of Mr. Kieran Mulvey, is a very positive one, the reality is we need to encourage private sector investment in our region.  When I discussed this issue with the Minister on Committee Stage, he said I was defining a tax incentive for all of the midland countries, that it was far too broad and that I needed to have something that is focused and targeted.  That is why I have specifically identified 22 sites across our bogs at the sites of our two peat-fired power stations for this particular incentive.  I cannot be any tighter or more specific than that.<\/p><p>I seek to ensure the provision of an additional incentive for business that would create jobs and decide to invest on those sites in Tipperary, Kildare, Longford, Westmeath, Offaly, Laois and Galway, right across the midland counties.  The difficulty is those sites are competing with Dublin, Galway and the other cities to attract business investment and those cities are far more attractive for investment.  We note the challenges IDA Ireland has in bringing foreign direct investment into our region.  By providing a specific tax incentive very much focused on creating employment in those locations, it would act as an incentive for companies to come and at least look at these sites, which are located in rural communities across the midlands that have been so dependent on peat harvesting and employment in Bord na M&oacute;na and the ESB until now.<\/p><p>I agree we need to leverage EU funding.  The coal regions in transition platform will help to provide us with EU funding, but there is also the opportunity of European Investment Bank funding for our region.  However, to do that we need to engage the private sector and get it involved in our region.  That is not forthcoming.  This is a dispersed and diverse region that has found it very difficult to attract foreign direct investment.  Until now, it has not come by preference or by choice to our region.  I believe there is a responsibility now on Government to look specifically at these sites across the midland counties and acknowledge these are the specific identified sites where more than 2,000 staff were employed and where an additional 2,000 jobs were indirectly dependent on those and to provide an incentive to bring new employment into the region, whether it is in light manufacturing, the energy or horticulture areas or whatever area.  It should bring employment back into those communities that are about to be decimated by the decision of An Bord Plean&aacute;la and the ESB not to submit a new planning application.<\/p><p>I was disappointed that the ESB did not decide to submit a new planning application.  The decision in respect of An Bord Plean&aacute;la is very tight and the ability to appeal that is very limited.  However, the decision by the ESB not to submit a new planning application is potentially the death knell in respect of the development of a biomass sector in this country.  The development of a biomass sector was key to the creation of jobs across the midlands and key to maintaining jobs in Bord na M&oacute;na across this transition over the next decade.  If, in putting a particular tax incentive in place, we can get the ESB, Bord na M&oacute;na or another company to re-examine the development of the biomass sector here, it is warranted and important.  Every 15,000 ha of willow that would be grown across our region would create 470 long-term jobs in the harvesting of that particular crop.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000039#RR00500","speaker":"1234"},{"type":"speech","time":1574267400,"counter":422,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this amendment.

One aspect of that related to the carbon tax revenue.  We sought a direction whereby a portion of that would be directed to those regions most affected by transition as it occurs.  The midlands is one of those greatly affected and hence the reason for &euro;32 million out of the &euro;80 million to be specifically targeted to that region.  I refer to &euro;6 million in a transition fund, &euro;20 million in a retrofit programme for social housing, &euro;6 million towards rehab, and a few more million towards pilot projects for alternative farming to assess the new methods of reducing carbon and so forth.  That would have been sufficient in the event of the commitments made by Government, the ESB and Bord na M&oacute;na a year ago when they said that transition would take place over the next nine to ten years.<\/p> <p>That is not now the case as a result of the decision of the ESB not to appeal An Bord Plean&aacute;la's decision, which went against the grain of the Government's own policy.  As Deputy Naughten said, we have made that point on many occasions, most recently to the ESB itself at the Joint Committee on Climate Action within the past hour.  I would have thought there is ample reason for Government to insist that the ESB seek a judicial review on a point of law to address the failure by An Bord Plean&aacute;la to acknowledge Government policy as laid down in this House and to the European Union.<\/p> <p> This failure to do so means that Shannonbridge and Lanesborough power stations will now close next year, although peat will be burnt at those plants for a further year.  The response of the Government and the ESB, which is not to pursue the Government's policy, will have repercussions.  It will have repercussions for the ESB, which believes it has answered up to its responsibilities by placing another &euro;500 million in the transition fund.  I do not believe that is enough.  It is not appropriate and it does not acknowledge the significance of its decision, especially in light of the commitment it made to Government last year.  There will also be repercussions for the Government, including increased responsibilities, both financial and otherwise.  For example, we expected that &euro;6 million to be increased annually.  We also anticipated the Government of the day insisting that not only increases in carbon tax but existing carbon tax revenue be geared in that direction.  This revenue is currently &euro;400 million, not including this year's increase.  I am not saying that this should have been done in one fell swoop, but it should have been done in conjunction with, and parallel to, the transition we had been anticipating and expecting and that we had been promised.  That promise is no longer to be fulfilled.<\/p> <p> There will also be other repercussions.  The public will have its say and will adjudicate on what those repercussions should be.  I will definitely be at the doors telling people that I was very surprised that those in Government with responsibility for this area did not at least ensure that a new application was made or a judicial review sought.  This application could have been cognisant of the conditions associated with the planning decision.<\/p> <p> It seems the likes of An Taisce are given a lot of weight.  An Taisce does good, reputable and commendable work as an advisory body, but it is not a democratically elected body.  It does not have representatives in this House representing the public.  We fulfil that role.  We are here to ensure that the offices of the State adhere to the democratic process, which includes following Government policy as laid out by this House and in legislation.  The Government failed to ensure that was the case.  That is very regrettable and very unfortunate.<\/p> <p> While I acknowledge and commend the thrust of this amendment, as I have said, I do not think it appropriate or fair that one is accepted and another not.  That being the case, I am not in a position to support it.  I am conscious of what the Minister said previously and I await his response to this matter, having not been present for his reply the previous day.<\/p> <p> I take the opportunity to further enlighten the representatives of Government here today.  There are increased responsibilities on them as a repercussion of the decision of the ESB, which means we are now playing a different ball game.  The &euro;6 million, increasing annually, available to the midlands or Offaly is no longer sufficient.  This decision will have a knock-on impact on Bord na M&oacute;na and the revenue resource for Offaly County Council.  In the same period in which we expected it to receive &euro;60 million, it will lose &euro;40 million in lost rates revenue.  That is a swing of &euro;100 million in the space of a few weeks.  Our county can hardly afford a swing of &euro;1 million, let alone &euro;100 million.  Deputy Naughten is right in saying that the decimation now taking place in our region is equivalent to the Dublin region losing a company like Google.<\/p> <p> Back in the 1930s and 1940s, Government charged Bord na M&oacute;na with a remit.  It was to create jobs in a desolate region.  It did that.  It reached its peak of 8,000 jobs in the 1980s.  The Minister cannot be at the wheel and allow the region to become desolate again while we sit on our hands.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000039#RR00800","speaker":"1217","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1574268000,"counter":426,"content":"<p>I support the sentiment of Deputy Naughten's amendment.  There is a lot of focus on, and discussion of, the traumatic effects of the closures in the midlands and what is likely to happen to those communities.  We have a living example in Tipperary.  The facility in Littleton was closed with the loss of 120 jobs, including seasonal jobs, and an associated loss of work for contractors, local suppliers and those who assisted and supported that industry.  The Littleton plant was part of the fabric of the local community.  In fact, the community was built around it.  When Littleton first came into operation in the 1950s, schools and shops were built.  The local community built houses around the facility.  It mushroomed and became an industry that sustained a local community for a lifetime.  People reared and educated their families and the local economy thrived.  I shudder to think about what will happen in the midlands because we have seen an example in what has already taken place in Littleton.  It has had a devastating impact on the local economy.  People feel forlorn and desolate.  There is no future and there are no alternative jobs.<\/p>  <p>  It is disappointing to see Bord na M&oacute;na making these decisions without any forward planning.  There is no semblance of a plan in place to replace the jobs lost or to assist the local communities.  I agree that we should have a targeted programme and dedicated plan.  That will obviously involve some form of tax incentive to encourage people who are prepared to invest or who have innovative ideas to establish in the area to give work and opportunities to local people.<\/p>  <p>  The plant in Littleton and the examples to which Deputies Naughten and Cowen referred cover vast areas.  They have huge workshops and all of the services that industry requires, including electricity, water, sewage and sanitation.  Everything is of a very high standard and quality.  These centres will be left and forgotten unless there is some kind of dedicated plan and co-ordinated approach.  That will require additional incentives to attract people out of the cities down to local areas such as Littleton.  I appeal to the Minister.  A lot of money is available as a result of the carbon tax.  Some of these funds should be diverted to support and assist industry in getting up and running in these areas.  I ask that Littleton be one of the areas considered and that it be covered by the Bord na M&oacute;na transition fund.<\/p>  <p>  The harsh reality has set in for us.  The jobs are gone and the factories are closed.  We have 10,000 acres of bogland stretching from Littleton up to the Laois border.  What is to be done with it?  There are obviously opportunities there.  Bord na M&oacute;na has no plan to utilise that bog or to create opportunities and new alternative jobs.  We need an approach from Government.  Bord na M&oacute;na needs to be told that it has a responsibility and an obligation to these areas and to the families who relied on it for sustenance down through the years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000040#SS00200","speaker":"1240"},{"type":"speech","time":1574268600,"counter":427,"content":"<p>I thank Deputies for their contributions.  I acknowledge that in much of the engagement leading up to the budget, Deputy Cowen had raised this issue consistently on behalf of his constituents and that, on Committee Stage, Deputy Denis Naughten also raised it on many occasions.  I have also heard Deputy Lowry's remarks about his constituents who have been affected.<\/p>  <p>  I had a very small taste of the issues the Deputy's refer to when I visited Lanesboro last week upon the announcement of the change in the licence.  I met many of the people who had been working with Bord na M&oacute;na and the ESB and who have been significantly affected by this decision.  Many of them explained that their grandparents had worked for ESB or Bord na M&oacute;na and that they themselves had been anticipating jobs and careers that stretched well into the future.  In fairness, while there was a sense that their jobs were changing and that they would come to an end at some point in the future, they were not expecting and they were not prepared for it happening on the basis of the current timeline.  This underscored for me a point I made previously to the effect that when we talk about the different effects a change in our economy will bring, we tend to think about it in terms of a change in income for people, for example, as a result of increases in the price of fuel or changes in the price of carbon.  Although a change in a person's income is significant, it is far more fundamental when a citizen loses a job or believes that a job he or she was going to have into the future will no longer be available.<\/p>  <p>  Each of the Deputies expressed their concerns on this issue.  While I do not represent those constituencies, I am aware of the real anxiety, especially as we approach Christmas, regarding to what will happen.  I appreciate that the key issue is not just about the loss of the jobs, it is also the indirect effects of this in the local community, the other employment that was dependent on these jobs, and the effect it will have on the rates base of Offaly County Council and other county councils in the areas mentioned.  In the context of what we are going to do, it is my very strong view that the need for a transition - be it the so-called just transition or the simple need and imperative to come up with new work and new jobs for people who will be affected - will claim one third of the revenue raised by the change in carbon pricing.  I will play a role in ensuring that the communities mentioned this evening are at the forefront of the planning in this regard.  This is why we have looked to put in place a just transition structure within the communities referred to by the Deputies.  Mr. Kieran Mulvey will lead this on behalf of the Government.  I have had extensive, personal experience of Mr. Mulvey in the work he does, and he is especially strong in working with local communities to address these kinds of issues.  I have a lot of faith in his ability to do this.<\/p>  <p>  There are two main reasons I am not accepting this amendment and for asking the Deputy to consider withdrawing it.  From an EU regional aid guideline perspective, we are not able to provide geographically targeted tax incentives.  If we were to do this, and if we were to go down the route with a move such as proposed in the amendment, there is no doubt that Deputies Lowry, Kenny and others who may have communities affected by the changes, would want their communities' and their towns' names in the tax code.  Legally we cannot do that.  Even if we could do it, I hope the Deputies will appreciate that if we begin to single out specific communities or towns we would run the risk of the likelihood of every Deputy wanting the same.  I have no doubt that in the ensuing debate on the issue in the D&aacute;il and in the relevant Oireachtas committees, our ability to respond back to the changing jobs - as referred to here - will be the key way in which the Government is evaluated in the context of how we use the money that will be raised by means of the change in carbon pricing.  I am very committed to playing my part in ensuring that we work hard to find sustainable employment for those who have been affected by the changes relating to Bord na M&oacute;na and in the ESB.  I know why these semi-State bodies were first set up in these parts of the country in which they are located.  I know the needs that exist.  Through the change we make in carbon pricing and by means of other policies at the disposal of the Government, we will play our part in trying to come up with a different future for those citizens who have been affected by this licence change.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000041#TT00100","speaker":"1292"},{"type":"speech","time":1574268600,"counter":428,"content":"<p>I want to make two points.  I am not looking for whole swathes of the State to be designated.  We are talking about 22 specific sites in the area stretching from Tipperary in the south up to Westmeath, over to Kildare and back to east Galway.  The Minister made the point that EU regional aid guidelines would not enable the Government to do that but he will be aware that this area is now accepted by the European Union as being unique.  It is part of the EU designated coal region in transition.  As a result, there is an opportunity to look at unique and targeted supports for these communities.  I do not believe we can have it any tighter than 22 specific sites across the State.  This is the equivalent of Google leaving Dublin.<\/p>  <p>  We need to put some type of incentive in place for private sector investment.  Yes, we will have some public sector investment, but it is important to encourage private sector investment also.  In that context, if we had a designation in place I believe the ESB may consider submitting a new planning application.  I believe the ESB should have submitted a new planning application for 100% domestically-sourced biomass facilities in Lanesboro and in Shannonbridge.  That the ESB has not done this will create, I believe, a very dangerous precedent in the development of a biomass sector, which is fundamentally important to us in reaching our climate change targets and providing sustainable, long-term and green employment across the midlands.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000041#TT00200","speaker":"1234"},{"type":"speech","time":1574268600,"counter":429,"content":"<p>I acknowledge the Minister's response.

I acknowledge, insofar as I can, having negotiated and discussed this at length with the Minister prior to the budget, as he alluded to, that the funding in the carbon tax revenue package was provided on the understanding that transition would take place in the region over the next eight or nine years.

This is with regard to access to important information.  This is public money that is every bit as real as money that is announced in every budget to great fanfare, much public attention and scrutinised heavily with regard to the amount spent directly on health or education and allocated to various Departments.  Depending on how it is calculated, and there is an interesting debate on what is in the base and not the base, the budget scrutiny committee estimates there is approximately &euro;15 billion worth of tax expenditure every year and most of this rolls over from year to year.  This is a lot of money.  I emphasise that the Minister has had meaningful engagement with me on this matter.  I also acknowledge that in the area of film relief he has genuinely listened and that he has also made some positive moves on IREFs and so on in the budget.  However, as I have said to him many times, there is a whole lot more that needs to be looked at.  Frankly, I still believe this is a massive scandal.  To emphasise the point, in 2012, at the bottom of the crash, &euro;74 billion of pre-tax profits were recorded.  The figure for 2017 was &euro;159 billion, which means profits have doubled more or less.  The problem is that even the very modest 12.5% corporate tax rate is not paid on these enormous profits, which have doubled.  When all of the loopholes in the interesting table that people cannot read are applied, the taxable income, as opposed to the pre-tax profit, drops from &euro;159 billion to &euro;79 billion.  We have &euro;80 billion worth of loopholes, expenditures and reliefs that write down the taxable profit so that the effective rate of pre-tax profits is not 12.5% but 5%.  If the Minister imposed a minimum effective rate on pre-tax profits, he would generate approximately &euro;9 billion extra in revenue a year and these companies would still be very profitable.<\/p>  <p>  There are lot of areas to look at but the one I really want to stress this year in the short time I have is intra-group transactions.  I had to really look closely at the table to see this one.  Intra-group transactions are mostly transactions between subsidiaries of the same company lending each other money.  One company sets up a lot of subsidiaries and lends itself money and charges itself interest.<\/p><p><i>6 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p>  <p>The interest it has to pay back to itself is tax deductible, thereby writing down its profits and allowing it to pay less tax.  We discovered this with, for example, Larry Goodman's companies in Luxembourg and so on, but they are all at it.<\/p> <p> It is amazing that the figure on this fascinating list for tax forgone due to intra-group transactions, which amounted to &euro;9 billion in 2016, saw a massive jump from the previous year.  I do not have the exact figure, but it was approximately &euro;2 billion or &euro;3 billion then.  Guess what it was in 2017.  It was &euro;16 billion.  It went from &euro;9 billion to &euro;16 billion between 2016 to 2017.  God knows what it will be in 2018 and 2019.  This is the major mechanism through which some of the most profitable companies owned by some of the richest people avoid paying their proper share of tax.  They are lending themselves money and charging themselves interest, paying which reduces their profits.<\/p> <p> An interesting provision is that of losses forward whereby the banks that brought this country to its knees can use previous losses to write down their tax liabilities, meaning that Bank of Ireland, AIB and so on pay virtually no tax on the enormous profits they are now generating.  Another interesting provision is the category called \"Certain company reconstructions and amalgamations\".  It was in place last year but I am not sure as to whether it was in place the year before.  This tax expenditure increased from &euro;189 million in 2016 to &euro;425 million in 2017.  This is tax avoidance on a massive scale and is robbing the taxpayer of significant amounts of money that could go into health, education, public transport or a just transition in terms of climate change.  One could go through the list of possibilities.<\/p> <p> I appeal to the Minister.  A report on this is important.  The Committee on Budgetary Oversight has started some of that work, but the next issue we need to examine closely is intra-group transactions.  That the figure mushroomed from &euro;9 billion to &euro;16 billion in one year shows that it has become the major loophole through which many of these companies are writing down their tax liabilities.  We need to examine what is going on, who is benefitting from the loophole and how to shut it down.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000042#UU01300","speaker":"1238","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1574269800,"counter":446,"content":"<p>I have proposed a minimum effective corporation tax rate many times.  The recent publication by the OECD that recommended a minimum effective tax rate in parallel to the BEPS process is a warning note to the Government to the effect that this particular regime will not last forever.  Assuming that Ireland will continue to be an attractive destination in the EU post Brexit, the Minister will have a problem on his hands.  If we have significant transfers of financial companies from the City of London to Ireland, I assume that they will be accompanied by significant transfers of intellectual property rights, which were the basis of Deputy Boyd Barrett's contribution.  Those rights are moving from certain jurisdictions to Ireland, but not just because of taxes.  We are probably a more attractive destination for a variety of reasons, including our location and the fact that there are many people in Ireland or who are prepared to come to work in Ireland who have the skills that the companies require.  However, it is foolish in the extreme to allow very profitable companies to pay reduced rates of taxation.  A minimum rate could be identified.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister spoke about the consequences for the midlands of the recent decisions on decarbonisation and proposed an oversight and commentary role for the Committee on Budgetary Oversight.  One way of addressing the issue would be to make more detailed information available on the figures behind the figures.  The Department should be able to provide that fairly easily.  Perhaps it could be provided via the work of the officials who are working with the committee.  We could then have a discussion and see whether there is a pathway through this.<\/p>  <p>  Via President Macron and others in Europe, we are still facing the likelihood of digital taxation.  It is not a perfect mechanism of tax, but many countries will be frustrated with the approaches taken by a number of states, including Ireland, where their nationals are buying significant amounts of services or products that are effectively taxed at close to zero, leaving no flow of money to national exchequers.  That is profoundly unfair and the Minister would be well advised to reconsider it.  If the Committee on Budgetary Oversight were to be an acceptable mechanism to him, that work could be done through it.<\/p>  <p>  I doubt that there are many in this country who want to sell Ireland as an international tax haven.  We want to sell Ireland as a location for international investment and employment.  I imagine that there is mostly agreement on that in the House.  Given the country's focus on education, we are well placed to take advantage of that, but we must be prepared to address the tax issue.  When I was in government, we went into the BEPS process in great detail.  The latest iteration of that is the OECD's proposal to move towards a minimum effective tax rate.  The alternative is a digital tax.  Maybe the Minister has undertaken studies on the likely impact of digital taxes.  I have asked him detailed finance questions on the increasing amounts that have been claimed back by countries like Italy.  Having introduced their own taxation measures, they are claiming back payments that Ireland will consequently find are due to them.  All of this could be the subject of detailed reports.  Since I regularly get answers on this matter from the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners, the data are available even if they are not complete.<\/p>  <p>  We have discussed how the Minister is locked into the problem of the banks' enormous losses forward, the basis for which I am unaware.  Is there a country that allows this kind of continuous losses forward over a very long period?  We are in year 11 since the bank crash.  Those losses started to be built up from 2007.  We are talking about 12 year old losses and banks that in some cases have profits in the realm of &euro;500 million to more than &euro;1 billion.  It is silly that they can continue doing this.  The most valuable aspect of the banks is possibly these losses forward.  We are in a situation where there are all sorts of demand on the Exchequer, ordinary workers have not got any tax relief even though incomes for many will rise by 3% per year and people in receipt of social welfare have got no increases.  It seems profoundly unjust in terms of the principle of taxation that very profitable organisations should continue to get major tax breaks while ordinary workers, people on social welfare and pensioners get little or nothing out of the budget.<\/p> <p>In the case of this amendment, if the Minister is prepared to put forward a format for reporting and discussion which meets his requirements, that would be a positive development.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000043#VV00200","speaker":"1253","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1574270400,"counter":448,"content":"<p>I do not support the amendment.

Many people, including the types of workers referred to by Deputy Mattie McGrath, who are in good jobs in high-tech businesses, pay a lot of tax and sometimes feel aggrieved that they can hardly afford their rent or mortgage.  They perceive themselves as being in the squeezed middle while large corporations pay very little tax.  Moreover, it seems that the larger the company, the lower the rate of tax it pays.  That has an impact on our hospitals, schools, roads and, indeed, on every part of our society.  It means that more and more ordinary working people, who go out and do their best every day, are finding they cannot afford to live, get a mortgage and provide for their families.<\/p><p>We see the evidence of this clearly in the north west.  <i>The Sunday Business Post<\/i>magazine last Sunday included a list of how much Enterprise Ireland has spent in every county.  Nearly two thirds of the moneys were accounted for by Dublin and the counties in the Dublin circle, namely, Kildare, Wicklow, Louth and Meath.  County Leitrim, on the other hand, received only some &euro;350,000, and Sligo less than &euro;700,000.  I am not saying that this is the fault of the Government.  The problem is that there are not enough businesses investing in those areas, and that is because the emphasis is not being placed on ensuring that the places which have the most potential are given the most help.  All the money is flowing into the region where there is the most pressure, the highest rents and where people cannot afford to live.  I am all too aware of this as the parent of college-going children.  County Leitrim has the highest number of graduates per head of population but there are no jobs for graduates in my area.  That is a scandal in a context where we have a 12.5% tax rate for corporations.  Those companies absolutely should be paying that rate in full.  There is an additional problem in that we currently have no ability to direct where that work should be going and where people should be getting a chance.  I want to see my children do better than I have done, as do most people.  However, people living in Leitrim, Sligo and Donegal see them doing better somewhere else, not at home.  That is something the Government must address.<\/p><p>If we are going to make the changes that are needed, the emphasis on what the Government invests in must change.  There used to be a saying in rural Ireland about rubbing more butter on the fat sow's back, which is applicable to the current situation.  Everything is happening in the greater Dublin region and the pressure there is huge.  Rents are through the roof for people looking for a home and students seeking accommodation.  Meanwhile, the west and other areas are continually left behind, the most recent evidence for which was <i>The Sunday Business Post<\/i>report to which I referred.  These issues have an impact on people throughout the country.  If this Government is about fair play, then it must ensure that corporations play fair.  The types of breaks they currently receive should not be given.  Deputy Burton referred to the banks, which are a typical example.  Banks in this country that are owned or partly owned by the State are getting away with paying no tax and making billions in profits.  By contrast, if a rural publican is a month late submitting his VAT return, Revenue will come down on him like a tonne of bricks.<\/p><p>I am not here to beat up on the Government.  We all have a responsibility to address these issues, and Government has a particular responsibility to deliver for everyone.  The problem we see - it is an acute problem for people in the north west, in particular - is that too many people feel they are not getting fair play, and there is anger and resentment because of that.  This how the politics of fear evolves.  People feel the Government has let them down and not delivered for them.  Its promises are no longer believed, as we have seen in respect of the national broadband programme.  The Minister has a huge job of work to do to change that.  Problems we are seeing, such as those concerning direction provision facilities, are all part of this same problem that so many people in rural areas feel neglected and left behind and that Government is not in tune with their lives.  If the Minister and his colleagues do not change that, there will be fertile ground for the far right to move in and instil a politics of fear.  As we go into the next decade, we should be seeking to move past the politics of fear and towards a politics of hope and reform.  The reform we need is to invest in the regions where there is most potential and where we can deliver for more people.  That is the future we can have but it requires the Government to stand up and not just talk about taking action but actually deliver it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000044#WW00300","speaker":"1345"},{"type":"speech","time":1574270400,"counter":450,"content":"<p>There is real value in having certainty around our corporation tax offering.  As such, we must be careful in making changes that could undermine that offering and, as a consequence, our ability to continue to attract foreign direct investment.

It is important to open with some of the facts on this area that touch on some of the points Deputies Martin Kenny and Boyd Barrett made in their contributions.  If one looks at the most recent information available, namely the estimates the Revenue Commissioners produced for 2017, it indicates that for those companies that pay corporation tax, the effective corporate tax rate they paid was 10.2%, an increase on the 10% figure in 2016.  For the top ten companies the rate was 12.7% and for the top 100 companies it was 12.3%.  The gap between the effective tax rate and the nominal tax rate is very small.  In the debate that is under way on what level of taxation is paid by the largest companies, it is important to note the gap between the rate they are meant to pay and the effective tax rate they pay is minimal.  That is a key point of difference with many other countries and jurisdictions we compete with that would have a nominal tax rate that would be far higher than Ireland's but then because of the very many deductions they would make available, they have an effective tax rate that is some way below that.  That is not the case in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Boyd Barrett made the point about the surge in profitability that has happened for large global companies.  Consequent to that, there has been a huge increase in the amount of corporate tax profit that has been paid here in Ireland.  The Deputy may be interested in the technical paper we published last week on the Department of Finance's website that looked to correlate the amount of corporate tax being paid with the share performance of very big corporate players.  It found a real correlation between how much additional tax is being paid in Ireland and the business performance of many of the huge companies the Deputy has referred to.<\/p>  <p>  On the different points made by Deputy Burton, the establishment of a principle of minimum global effective taxation would provide particular challenges for Ireland because if that principle was established the figure would at one point be below the 12.5% in Ireland but my expectation is that at another point in the future the figure would then move above that, which would have consequences for our ability to retain our tax rate as it is.  That principle could yet emerge from the OECD.  As Deputy Burton knows, within the OECD we do not have a veto.  It is not like, for example, the European Union.  It is an organisation that works on the basis of influence and negotiation.  I am alive to what the consequences of a minimum effective tax rate being established through the OECD for the world would be for Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  On the debate on digital taxation, the view I took 18 months ago is that if the European Union or individual countries went down the route of a digital services taxation outside of agreement with other global trading blocs, that would result in the risk of reaction from other countries that have been affected.  I have been proven right in that assessment and that is what is now happening.  For example, America is saying that if American companies are treated in a different way in other jurisdictions, America will respond to that.  That has happened in the negotiations that have ensued between France and America, for example.  I argued in front of the Committee on Budgetary Oversight that I did not believe it would be in our interest for Ireland to face such a scenario too.  I was correct in my concern on what could happen if we went down the unilateral route in digital taxation.  That is not a path Ireland should go down.  Deputy Mattie McGrath supports the approach we are taking.  Deputy Michael McGrath touched on the fact there has already been a big increase in corporate taxation receipts.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Boyd Barrett touched on the issue of intra-group transfers and how they are facilitated.  In this Finance Bill, there are significant changes happening in transfer pricing that will have an effect on that issue.  We are making those changes, mainly because we are part of the OECD approach on that work and also because we need to play our part in ensuring companies are paying a fair and effective tax rate and that there are no mismatches in transfer pricing rules that might allow the movement of revenue and profitability between different parts of companies in a way that is not sustainable.  I emphasise that significant changes are happening in transfer pricing rules that are partly driven by the kind of issues the Deputy has raised.<\/p>  <p>  I listened to what Deputy Martin Kenny said too.  I make the point to him that for many different parts of our economy, the majority of jobs being created are outside of Dublin city.  The main reason I supported the decision on the national broadband plan was to respond to the diagnosis the Deputy offered.  I salute the approach the Deputy has taken to argue for a different political approach to the fears his constituents have.  It is that kind of approach I want to play my part in.  I also want to respond to the fears the Deputy has articulated.  I strongly believe the approach we are taking with the roll-out of the national broadband plan will make a difference to the employment concerns in the many communities across the towns and villages of our country that the Deputy raised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000045#XX00200","speaker":"1292"},{"type":"speech","time":1574271000,"counter":453,"content":"<p>That exhausts the seven-minute slots.

It is around the area of whether the effective rate of corporation tax in this country is as the Minister stated or whether it is not that the debate centres.  I dispute it because the Minister is referring to taxable income after all the reliefs, exemptions and deductions in the list I referred to have been applied.  To me, the essence of the problem is the total declared profits, which have mushroomed, are not what are taxed.  About half of that is taxed.  How &euro;159 billion in profits suddenly turns into &euro;79 billion in profits - with &euro;80 billion in the difference - and how the 12.5% tax rate is only applied to that second lower figure is the problem.  At the centre of that, as the Minister rightly says, are intra-group transactions.  As I tried to stress, intra-group transactions and transfer pricing involve subsidiaries of the same company moving money around in order to avoid paying tax.  That is wrong and we have to address it.  I accept the Minister is looking at it and I accept there are some measures here, as part of the OECD process, that are moving to address some of these problems but we are not going anywhere near far enough.  Equally, it is shameful the banks are not paying tax because of losses forward.  I did not mention the research and development tax credit.  Again, it is mostly going to this same group of companies when it could be better directed, in my opinion, into public universities for research and development that would benefit the domestic economy.  We disagree but I have put the point and hopefully it has some impact on Government thinking.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000045#XX00400","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1574271600,"counter":455,"content":"<p>One area of taxation of the types of sectors about which we are talking is a financial transactions tax, which would have a massive impact on poorer countries around the world.  One of the side effects, perhaps unsought, of the type of tax regime Ireland and Luxembourg have developed is that poorer countries are relieved of their tax earning capacity in respect of raw materials.  The Minister will know this because a number of years ago, he arranged to meet representatives of Oxfam, for which I was grateful.  I acknowledge he has provided for changes to transfer pricing in the legislation.  It is not yet clear how they will play out but I acknowledge that he aims to make the system fairer.<\/p>  <p>  On transfer pricing, there has to be some way, in a globalised, financialised world, of ensuring that people who earn a great deal of money will pay tax.  Otherwise, people who have no money, who are at the bottom of the heap, will have no income, which means their basics in life will be unavailable and unaffordable to them.  That is why the OECD-type approach is the best one, accompanied by good governance and high-quality taxation systems.  The Minister is working on the Augustinian principle of, \"O Lord, make me tax effective, but not yet.\"  We will end up paying, as we already do, large amounts to countries such as Italy, which has located various types of digital taxation in the country.  That means it can take into account, for instance, activities and taxes that companies have paid, such as on labour.  Ultimately, such countries can come back and seek what we could call a refund from us, which they increasingly do.<\/p>  <p>  It is a mug's game to stick our head in the sand and deny what I have outlined.

The issue, as has been pointed out by Deputy Boyd Barrett, is that the Minister suggested that companies pay practically the same rate they are charged, but the truth is that is the rate after they have taken into account all the other breaks, which needs to be examined.  I refer in particular to the research and design break.  It is scandalous that large corporations get away with it time and again.  They move large portions of their profit, which should be taxable, into a research and design account and the money sits there to be spent on measures the corporations should be taking in any event.

Indicating we will change that in the future is the very kind of unpredictability in our tax code that will affect jobs and investment in our country.  Every time I make such a point, I am charged by some with creating a sense of fear and undue panic.

That is a mistake, however, because we could get more by getting ahead of the curve than by being the laggards.  I do not believe the idea that if we introduce a minimum effective tax rate to apply to companies that make the scale of profits that such companies make in Ireland, which will ensure they do not benefit as much from the clear loopholes they exploit and that we will get a bit more as a minimum - a minimum of billions of euro - they will all run out of the country.  There is nowhere left for them to run, particularly in the English-speaking world within the EU, which is where they want to be, even more so after Brexit.<\/p>  <p>  The minimum effective rate would still be well below what the rest of Europe pays because, as the Minister rightly said, the nominal rates in Europe are considerably higher and probably average at more than 20%.

Its focus is to consider the issue of carbon tax on agricultural diesel.  Carbon tax is about bringing about change, not about bringing in more income to the Exchequer.  The idea and pitch behind carbon tax is to drive change.  The objective is that people will get out of the car and use public transport because it is more carbon efficient and they will pay less in fuel taxes.<\/p> <p>The agricultural community does not have that choice because we do not yet have electric tractors and it will probably be a while before we have them in this country.  As they do not have a choice, they should not be liable for the tax.<\/p> <p> When we discussed this earlier, the Minister made the point that there is a double income tax relief for farmers.  The difficulty is that a farmer has to be generating an income to avail of the income tax relief.  As the Minister knows, very few beef farmers will pay tax this year because of the devastating year they have had.  Only a handful of beef processors in the country will have a tax liability.  Having a taxable income is the only way farmers can avail of relief for carbon tax paid on agricultural fuel.  We need to consider another mechanism to ensure that people who do not have a choice, that is, farmers, have mechanisms whereby they can avoid paying the carbon tax on agricultural vehicles.<\/p> <p> This leads us to a broader issue in terms of carbon taxes.  The carbon tax structure in this country disproportionately impacts on people in rural Ireland.  A typical commuting family in rural Ireland will pay an extra &euro;6 per week in carbon tax, yet the equivalent family in Dublin will pay about 30 cent a week in additional carbon tax.  The sum of &euro;6 per week is a significant amount of money for a family, but alternative transport is not available to them.  They have to absorb this as an additional cost.  However, families in Dublin have alternatives, particularly the bus service, which is subsidised by the State, but 30 cent a week will not motivate any family to leave the car keys at home and get onto a bus.  This tax disproportionately hits those who cannot avoid paying carbon tax.<\/p> <p> Amendment No. 23 has been ruled out of order.  It proposed that we try to restructure the motor tax system to drive the type of change that is needed, based on the fuel efficiency of a vehicle.  A diesel car travelling through Dublin city is far less efficient than the same car travelling from rural Ireland to a job in Lucan or Leixlip.  If the taxation system was restructured to take account of that, it would encourage people to leave their cars at home in Dublin without disproportionately penalising those living in rural Ireland who do not have a choice.  We will not have the opportunity to discuss that amendment.<\/p> <p> I want to flag this issue relating to agricultural fuel.  The amendment would ensure that many farmers who do not have a taxable income would be able to avail of the relief.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000046#YY00600","speaker":"1234","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1574272200,"counter":462,"content":"<p>I support the amendment.

They are the very farmers who will be impacted the most by the carbon tax that has been spoken about and a carbon tax in general.<\/p>  <p>  It is an issue that goes beyond farming.  It will affect families living in rural areas or regional towns who do not have buses or other transport options in place.  They are being pressed the hardest.  The symbolism of accepting the amendment would show that the Government accepts that the agricultural sector, in particular, needs some understanding from the Government that farms are not profitable and farmers do not have alternative options.

The main agricultural exposure to carbon taxes comes from fuel imports, primarily through the use of marked gas oil, MGO, or, as we know it, green diesel.  It is subject to the lower excise rate of 10.2 cent per litre.  The increase in carbon tax will increase this to 11.8 cent per litre.  The increase to MGO will apply from 1 May 2020.  The excise rate on MGO compares very favourably with the excise rate applied to auto diesel, which is 49.5 cent per litre.  There is a difference in price of almost 40 cent per litre between road diesel and MGO.  When the carbon tax was introduced in 2012, provision for a double income tax relief for farmers to compensate for this increase was introduced.  This relief continues to apply.  In light of the very limited exposure of the agricultural sector to carbon tax increases and the availability of other income tax reliefs for farmers that are directly related to increases in the carbon tax rate, I do not see the benefit in conducting a report on the impact of a carbon tax on the agricultural sector.<\/p>  <p>  I live in the countryside, down a country lane.

What we really need to do, however, is recognise that while there has been great investment, and reference was made to corporation tax and investment in large corporations and foreign direct investment, there has not been as much emphasis on growing our domestic economy and developing the entrepreneurs and enterprises needed in rural areas, small towns and villages.  That is a big job of work and it will require a new emphasis in politics over the next decade.<\/p>  <p>  We are not in different places in the context of our views on this subject.  We should be coming at it with a unified approach to developing solutions that will serve everyone.  To do that, we have to recognise that there are major deficits.

It is not necessary when opposing an unjust, regressive and counterproductive tax to suggest that climate change is not a serious and urgent problem.<\/p><p><i>7 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p>  <p>It is an urgent problem.  It is an emergency.  We have a short timeframe to address that emergency before we do irreversible damage to climate, to biodiversity and to the conditions which sustain human existence on this planet.  There is no question but that we need to address it.<\/p> <p> The problem is the carbon tax will not address it.  First, we have a carbon tax and it has done nothing - less than nothing - to reduce CO2 emissions.  CO2 emissions continue to rise.  Ireland is failing spectacularly in meeting its targets, is facing hundreds of millions of euro of fines as a result and is trying to buy its way out of its emission reduction targets through the carbon trading system.  The carbon trading system itself is another example of how trying to put a price on pollution is not the way to address it.  The big idea ten years ago was that with carbon trading one can buy one's way out of the problem.  Of course, that became an area for speculation and for the big polluters to buy the right to pollute more from poorer countries which emitted less.  It is completely counterproductive.<\/p> <p> It is also counterproductive from the point of view of trying to win over the majority of ordinary people to support the fight for radical climate action and I ask the Government to consider this.  If we are to make this change we need to have everybody on board.  They must feel they have a stake in taking radical climate action and that they will not be punished for the crimes of polluting corporations and Government failure to address CO2 emissions.  We know 70% of global emissions come from a few hundred companies.  In fact, governments resist efforts to tax those corporations and use some of the enormous profits they generate from polluting industries, such as the fossil fuel industries, to redirect revenues into making the necessary transition.  Instead of doing that, we punish the people who are not responsible and potentially alienate them from the battle to address the climate emergency.<\/p> <p> This amendment I have put forward particularly asks the Government to look at the issue of fuel poverty.  It is estimated that 400,000 households or 28% of the population in this country are living in fuel poverty.  The majority of those people are living in G-rated homes, in other words, poorly insulated homes, and are already suffering from poor insulation.  They do not want to have to spend large sums heating their homes.  They must do so because their homes are badly insulated.  A very significant portion of them can do nothing about it because they live in private rented accommodation.  They cannot do it.  The landlord has to do it.  Alternatively, they live in public rented accommodation - local authority homes - and they cannot do it.  In fact, I spend quite a lot of my time making representations to the local authority asking on behalf of local authority tenants if it will insulate their homes and the local authority says it has not got the money to do it.  By the way, and here is an interesting twist, in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, in the budget recently passed by the new coalition of Fianna F&aacute;il, the Greens, the Social Democrats, the Labour Party and Independents, they have cut the retrofit budget.  They totally slashed it in their first budget.  What already was a snail's pace of retrofitting of local authority homes will be slashed entirely.  It is shocking.  It is disgraceful that they would do it.  It is unbelievable that the Greens would do it.  It is also shocking that the Government would allow them to do it given that we need to ramp up dramatically the retrofit of homes.<\/p> <p> We need to dramatically ramp up the grants to address the fact that 760,000 of the people in this country - one in six - live in poverty.  How the hell are they supposed to retrofit their homes to insulate them, which would be of benefit to them?  They would not be against the idea.  They would be very much in favour of it because it would reduce their energy bills and would make their homes warmer.  However, they are not being given the resources to do it.  Now we will punish them for that fact with a carbon tax.  We will punish them for that fact by taking public service obligation bus routes out of their areas in many cases with the BusConnects plans, by the reduction in subsidies, for example the public service obligation subsidies, to Dublin Bus from &euro;87 million a decade ago to &euro;50 million, and by us having fewer buses in the Dublin Bus fleet than we had ten years ago.  Already, people who depend on public transport who do not use private cars will now be doubly punished.  They have already got poorer public transport service and now they will be punished again with a carbon tax and possibly with higher fares.  Public transport fares in this country are some of the highest in Europe and they have gone up by 80% in the past ten years.  We continue to allow bus fares to go up when we should be reducing or abolishing fares and increasing the subsidies.  There are many more areas I could go into.<\/p> <p> For rural Ireland, what is necessary is to give a sustainable living and payments to our farmers to enable them to move to forms of agriculture that are sustainable and do not emit so much CO2.  Our rural colleagues are correct to be concerned about these matters because they have to be guaranteed investment and schemes that will make it possible, and not be punished for making a necessary transition.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000048#AAA02800","speaker":"1238","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1574273400,"counter":494,"content":"<p>I support this amendment.<\/p>  <p>  The average family farm in a rural area of 50, 60 or 70 acres is not viable on its own and the farmer must go to work.

My party supports carbon tax changes generally.  In fact, we might have gone a little higher.  The matter I wish to raise, and this appears to be the appropriate time to raise it, relates to how carbon tax is being applied, particularly by utility companies.  My question is whether it is being applied correctly and, if so, how that can be the case.  To give an example, I have some figures from a gas bill from a utility gas provider.  The total gas charge is &euro;75.03.  The standing charge is &euro;14.18.  Carbon tax is &euro;5.17 based on an application figure of 0.00370 kWh.  That brings the total to &euro;94.38.  This customer gets a discount of &euro;3.75 because of a direct debit.  The total is then &euro;90.63.  VAT is applied on the total figure.  We are applying VAT on a tax.  How can that be?  Is this the way it should be applied?  Perhaps it is an error on the part of this utility company but, if not, it is applied across the board by other utility companies.  I probably should have seen it in my utility bills, but I did not.  It was brought to my attention by a constituent.  This matter is becoming more important as the carbon tax increases over time.  It is grossly unacceptable that there should be a tax on a tax.  I will be interested in the Minister's response on this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000050#CCC00100","speaker":"1301"},{"type":"speech","time":1574274000,"counter":497,"content":"<p>I will comment on each of the contributions.  Deputy Boyd Barrett knows that I have great respect for the different points he makes and the views he brings to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann but this will be one of my contributions in which the differences between us are more apparent than what we have in common.  I continue to be reminded of the near uniqueness of the Irish left.  On the one hand, it warns Governments of their over-reliance on corporation tax yet, on the other, it fiercely resists any efforts that are made to widen the tax base to use increased taxes to pay for better public services.  Deputy Boyd Barrett is against the local property tax, water charges, carbon taxation and the different forms of taxes that have either been introduced or that we attempted to introduce in order to try to raise revenue to pay for the public services he wants more of.  When he responds to me he will likely argue that the wealthy should pay more, but he will not give any credence or recognition to the fact that we have such a progressive income tax system that the more income people have, the more taxes they pay.  If he does not make that argument, he will argue that large companies should pay more.  If he makes that point, he should also be cognisant of the fact that large companies in Ireland have paid significantly more in terms of the corporation tax receipts in recent years.<\/p>  <p>  I ask Deputy Boyd Barrett to name any credible expert who is arguing that we can respond to the approaching climate change crisis without changing the price of carbon.  His commitment to tackling climate change is hollow when he does not acknowledge that if we are not willing to change the price of carbon, we are not going to change the incentives around it.  The honesty and commitment the Deputy has in other areas of endeavour are lessened if he is not willing to acknowledge that if we are asking people to use less carbon, there is a case to be made for the price of that carbon going up.  That is the argument here.  If we want less carbon to be used, a case can be made for changing and increasing the price of carbon as the way of doing that and for the additional revenue from the higher price of carbon to be used for reinvestment in our economy.  That is what this Bill seeks to do.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding the arguments made by Deputy Fitzmaurice, I understand the effect of carbon pricing for families that do not have access to the forms of public transport that are available in our large cities.  However, this is an argument about taxation.  Deputy Fitzmaurice is aware of the income reliefs that are already in place for carbon taxation in the agriculture sector.  The double tax relief is available for the agriculture sector to offer mitigation against the effects he mentioned of higher carbon pricing.  There is a wide array of tax reliefs and supports available through the tax code to offer support for the families the Deputy spoke about.  The Deputy might make the point that it does not affect those who are involved in farming who are not getting enough income to be entitled to the relief.  One of the reasons they are not paying tax is that the thresholds on income are set at a particular level.  If one is a farmer or a worker in other parts of our economy, we want to set the threshold at a particular level to ensure that if the person's income does not cross that threshold, he or she will keep that income.  That is in recognition of the fact that up to a certain level of income the person is not earning enough to be paying higher rates of tax.  The reason we have these thresholds in place is to protect low income farmers and workers and to ensure they are only paying tax on higher levels of income.  However, I again emphasise that there is an array of reliefs across the tax code because of the value that is placed on the contribution that farming makes to our economy and society.<\/p>  <p>  What Deputy Brendan Ryan described is correct.  The VAT is levied on the total bill and part of that bill includes the carbon tax.  He is also correct that over time as the bill goes up and if a contributor to the bill is a higher level of carbon pricing, the VAT will be charged on the total amount.  What he read to the House is correct.  I welcome the fact that the Labour Party supports higher levels of carbon pricing.  Its view is that we should have made a larger move in carbon pricing in this budget.  It was arguing for a multiple of the move we made, but it is in recognition of the issues raised by Deputy Fitzmaurice that I believe a larger change in carbon pricing in this budget would not have been appropriate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000050#CCC00200","speaker":"1292"},{"type":"speech","time":1574274000,"counter":498,"content":"<p>I hear the points made by the Minister.  Only for the fact I know a little about this, I would almost believe him.  The Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, indicated that it is &euro;15 per 1,000 litres for the average farmer.  I did not talk about the average farmer.  I spoke about the farmer with the family farm.  I am not worried about the &euro;15.  What worries me is that if the farmer calls in a contractor, there is no rebate or allowance for that under the normal taxation system.  The farmer will hand it on.  I am a contractor.  When I am baling for somebody next year, I will hand it on.  It will be coming in on 1 May and the bales will be made from May onwards.<\/p> <p>It is as simple as that.  It will be handed on.  The Farm Contractors of Ireland have said this.  Some 90% of farmers' work is done by contractors.  I am not talking about paying &euro;15 for someone to fee cattle or spread a bit of fertiliser.  That is not it.  We know there is double taxation and I acknowledge that part but I spoke about the family farm where a  person is getting a contractor in to do the work.  The Minister of State will know this well from his own neck of the woods.  These people drive to work every day, because their farms are not sustainable on their own and therefore they will pay more tax.  Obviously there is no rebate for driving to work.  In addition, the fuel used to heat their houses is also diesel.  These people are getting hit three times.  It is probably increasing the cost of the food they eat too because it is hauled by a lorry, or at least some of it because they may be growing some of their own.  This is the problem I am highlighting.  I am not saying there is not certain alleviation for the double taxation that the Minister spoke of - that is agreed, I never disputed that - what I am highlighting is where it is catching these people on the treble.  The Minister needs to understand that these are people on 60, 70 or 80 acres who may be farming beef for suckler and sheep.  No one here will deny that they are struggling.

Our policy is very detailed.  We have just produced an extensive document on it and our budget submission, which we produce every year, also shows precisely how we will pay for it in a whole range of areas.  I will not deal with them all now, but it includes aviation fuel charges, for example.  That would raise a lot of money from the people who actually make profit from polluting.  That is the difference.  What about the big agrifood barons who are making profit out of one of the big polluting areas, not the small beef farmer who is struggling to survive?  Do not punish him or her, punish the guys who are declaring their profits in Luxembourg and who are making a fortune out of this sector and who then use the money raised to ensure a just transition for the small farmer.<\/p><p>I must question the Government's bona fides<i><\/i>on this.  In the first instance, it is not addressing the main problem, namely, that putting a price on pollution has failed.  We have been doing it for several decades with carbon trading and with carbon taxes and it has not worked.  I defy anyone to show me any evidence that would allow us to meet the targets in the eleven years available to us.  We need much more radical actions.  That means focusing on the main areas.  In the context of energy, the Government should stop issuing fossil fuel licences now.  Do not lock us into liquid natural gas infrastructure that will lock us into fossil fuel use for decades.<\/p><p>Housing is another big sector.  We need to retrofit approximately 120,000 homes a year every year for 20 years, which means the State is going to have to do it.  No one else can afford the cost, it must be done by the State.  Transport must be made cheaper and the subsidies have to increase.  People will not get out of cars unless the Government provides better public transport.  During my time in this House, more than anyone else I have raised the issue of afforestation.  Since the first year I arrived here, I have spoken of the need to increase the pathetic levels of forest cover in this country.  Our targets are pathetic but our delivery is about 50% of those targets.  That has been consistent since I entered the D&aacute;il.  Furthermore, the forestry we do plant is often worse for the environment than no forestry at all.  We need to dramatically change the forestry model, increase the level of planting and invest in renewable energy and in research and development around producing renewable energy sources.  That means funding our universities which we are not doing either.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000051#DDD00200","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1574274600,"counter":501,"content":"<p>I return briefly to the Minister's response to my points.

In order to proceed with an ambitious retrofitting programme for local authority housing stock, we need levels of taxation that can be used to pay for that.  One of the three pillars for how the additional tax revenue for the higher carbon pricing will be used is paying for the retrofitting of homes, and particularly local authority housing, and also to ensure that the relevant grant scheme needed from Sustainable Energy Ireland has additional revenue going into it.<\/p>  <p>  On public transport, the Government recently decided to go ahead with the order for additional train carriages to ensure that the rail network will be able to increase its capacity in the future.  There are longer Luas carriages in place to ensure the additional public transport capacity that is needed is in place as Dublin becomes increasingly busier.  However, I return to the core point which is the fundamental area of difference between myself and Deputy Boyd Barrett.  I acknowledge that increasing carbon pricing does have significant and difficult effects for some of our citizens but that is why we have increased the energy allowance and is also the reason why many on low incomes who are in receipt of social welfare payments will be protected from the effects of this change in carbon pricing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000051#DDD00400","speaker":"1292"},{"type":"speech","time":1574274600,"counter":503,"content":"<p>I do not see how the Minister can say that they will be protected when they clearly are not protected as it stands and I cannot see any measures here to protect the 400,000 households living in fuel poverty.  Many or most of them cannot afford to do the retrofit they would like to do, which would improve their quality of life.  They just cannot afford it and in some cases they would not be allowed to do it by their landlord, private or public.  How can the Minister say it is fair to impose additional costs on people already suffering fuel poverty?  I cannot see how he can possibly justify it.  Nor do I see how the Minister can justify allowing bus and train fares to go up and the subsidies to public transport to go down.  I do not see how he can justify that and say that the Government is serious about climate change.<\/p>  <p>  On gas as a transitional fuel, in the past week the European Investment Bank has made a decision that, as of 2021, it will not lend any more money for fossil fuel projects.  That includes gas.  The gas industry is going ballistic about that because it was looking for special exceptions for gas on the basis that it is a transitional fuel but the European Investment Bank said no to that.  As a result, fossil fuel lending will come to an end as of 2021.  We, on the other hand, have put into the European Union as a priority project of common interest a liquid natural gas infrastructure to import fracked gas from the United States that will lock us into importing one of the most toxic CO2 emitting forms of fossil fuel for decades, long after we are supposed to have reached carbon neutrality and long after the environment needs us to reach carbon neutrality.  The Government needs to take a long hard look at whether its policies are serious in addressing this emergency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000051#DDD00500","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1574274600,"counter":504,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1574275200,"counter":505,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 19:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 100, to delete line 12 and substitute the following:  \t <blockquote> \t&quot;with subsection (4). <\/blockquote>(3A) The purchase of diesel by a haulier will be claimable against income tax payable.&quot;.&quot;.  <\/blockquote>  <p>I will not linger on this as we have covered most of the issues.

The haulage industry is so vital that one of the Fine Gael candidates in Wexford is part of it.  The party must be getting around to understanding how vital it is.  As Deputy Fitzmaurice has said, we have so little rail, canal or other type of transport, the road haulage industry is vital to our survival in terms of both imports and exports.  Very little of our farm produce goes by air and any other goods we export internationally go via a haulier.<\/p>  <p>  I salute the hauliers.  Many of them started very small but now have gone to five or ten trucks and some have dozens or more.  They have gone through hell in the past number of years because of many issues.  The Government has done nothing about insurance and although a diesel rebate scheme was introduced, it is difficult to reclaim any money.  Why will the Government not do anything tangible?  Goodness knows diesel is dear as it is for a car or a van, never mind the big trucks where it might cost &euro;600, &euro;700, &euro;800 or perhaps &euro;1,000 to fill them.  This rebate scheme is not doing what it says on the tin.  The hauliers will have an annual night of lobbying here next week or the week after and they come every year.  We know the issues and the Government must know them as well.  The Ministers of State, Deputies Moran and D'Arcy, should certainly know as they are from rural Ireland, where many of the haulage companies are based.  There are some in Dublin as well.  These companies are struggling.<\/p>  <p>  The Road Safety Authority, RSA, is certainly needed but there are certain roads, including one in Deputy O'Keeffe's native county from Mitchelstown to Mallow, where lorries are being checked regularly by the authority.  There are bushes hanging over roads and road inclines that do some shocking damage to those trucks but the RSA personnel are waiting at the other end to penalise the hauliers.  The hauliers must operate to a very high standard now and it is right that trucks and trailers have tachographs and are tested twice a year.  One journey on a road and the equipment, including suspension and mirrors, can be knocked out of kilter.  It can cost up to &euro;500 for a mirror.  These hauliers need support with tangible measures.  They do not need to be victimised and the RSA must understand that the laden weight on axles and their calibration can easily be shifted or distorted.  I understand a bit of this.  If a lorry comes upon a joint checkpoint with the traffic corps and RSA, the calibration could be out when it is checked.  The trucks might then be brought to a weighing station that could be a large distance away.  The drivers would get penalty points if there are issues.  We should be fair to the people who have their trucks tested.  Motorways are fine, thank God, but we do not have a great road network.  The Acting Chairman will know this is the case in parts of Galway and around the country.  The Irish Road Haulage Association has produced many videos demonstrating how drivers must keep to the middle of the road to avoid overhanging trees or otherwise they break the mirrors.<\/p>  <p>  The rebate scheme introduced two years ago is not easy to navigate.  That is what hauliers have told me.  I am an agricultural contractor, not a road haulier, but I certainly understand the issues and we have no rebate scheme.

That is the problem.  The Minister, Deputy Madigan, will not allow us to cut bushes.  We debated that for two years but we finally passed legislation allowing people to cut bushes under supervision in March and August.  The Minister just drove a coach and four through it.  The Minister of State, Deputy Moran, knows hauliers and can speak to them.  The truck mirrors are being broken.  These people are doing their best but there are onerous restrictions with respect to tachographs, insurance and driver issues.  I salute the drivers but we must consider what they face in Calais.  We are talking about migrants and stowaways and these people are trying to protect their trucks.  These are innocent or unsuspecting drivers and there are all kinds of sophisticated methods to get access into a truck with a sealed container by cutting off the hinges.  As the hauliers must live with this as well, they need some tangible support.<\/p>  <p>  The industry is vital to our economy.  The Minister of State might laugh if he likes about the bushes but this industry provides massive employment and a dedicated service to rural Ireland.  The bulk tankers go in and out boreens to collect milk and that is much more difficult to transport because it moves and sways.  The drivers must be very careful and respectful.  The RSA must be pulled back and the benefit of the doubt given to drivers.  I am sure Deputy O'Keeffe agrees that the road I mentioned is desperate and needs improvement.  When drivers travel that road, the RSA is waiting at the other end.  The trucks might have been perfect before hitting that stretch of road.  There are many other stretches of road like that but I have been lobbied about this by a big haulage company from Cahir.  When the lorries are pulled in, people in white overalls lie under the trucks with equipment to check the calibration.  That is grossly unfair.  These are decent people providing much employment and ensuring that our imports and exports in particular get to ports on time.  They ensure the products get to their destinations on time.  We know many of those products have a limited shelf life.  The hauliers must be supported.<\/p>  <p>  This scheme is too cumbersome.  Why is there a rebate rather than something across the board?  Diesel prices have increased enormously in the past year.  Why not give these people something up-front rather than having them paying now before getting something back a couple of months from now?

I do not believe Deputy McGrath understands the haulage sector at all and he has no knowledge of it.  He admitted he was not a haulier and although I am not one either, I have had significant engagement with the haulage sector.

We discussed these issues on Committee Stage.  These amendments relate to both the diesel rebate scheme and the call for a similar scheme for  agricultural contractors.  Regarding the diesel rebate scheme, I understand the objective of what was provided for in the budget and set out in the Finance Bill was to provide some additional relief to the haulage industry, taking account of the increased burden of the carbon tax.  However, there are concerns within the industry that it will not meet that objective and that it will not provide further relief.  As the Minister will know, the request that was made, which we discussed earlier in the process, was that the threshold be reduced to &euro;1, above which the rebate would kick in and that the rebate would be increased to over 9 cent.  I am interested to know whether the Department has done an assessment of what has been proposed.  Is the Minister satisfied it will provide extra relief?  Those who operate this scheme and who have benefited from it so far have raised serious questions about that.  It is a technical calculation in the way that it depends on the price of fuel and so on.<\/p>  <p>  Amendment No. 21 pertains to the request for a similar rebate scheme for agricultural contractors.  The point that can be made, which we discussed on Committee Stage, is that the most efficient way for many farmers to carry out many of the high-volume usage of marked gas oil tasks is through agricultural contractors who have the best and most efficient machinery.  They are able to make the necessary investment to stay up to date with the most environmentally friendly and the most operationally efficient equipment but there is not a similar rebate scheme for them.  If they have to pay additional carbon tax, then, as night follows day, that will be passed on to the farmer and it will increase the cost of the various services provided by those contractors for the farmers.  That is the concern.  The argument being made is that the same issues and principles apply for those contractors as apply for the haulage industry.  If the Minister is not prepared to move on it in this Finance Bill, it is an issue he should examine and perhaps commit to preparing a paper or report to examine the feasibility of introducing such a scheme for contractors working in this space.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000053#FFF00400","speaker":"1223"},{"type":"speech","time":1574275800,"counter":518,"content":"<p>I would like to lend my voice to that of previous speakers in support of amendments Nos. 19 and 20 on the issues concerning road hauliers.  We must acknowledge they are engaged in a competitive business.  I know that from what happens in my own backyard.  With the co-operatives tendering for routes for lorries to collect milk and the cut in prices, I do not know how some of them keep going.  Deputy Mattie McGrath was right in what he said.  They have extraordinary costs and due to the state of our road infrastructure, hauliers return to their depots day in, day out with broken mirrors and so on.  They cannot claim for those costs and must carry them.<\/p>  <p>  Amendment No. 21 was tabled by my party colleague, Deputy Michael McGrath, and I thank him for that.  Agricultural contractors could be compared to the meat in a sandwich, in that they are not eligible for a carbon tax write-off even though all the work activities are for farmers.  The contractors' association requested that agriculture, farm and forestry contractors who are registered with the Revenue Commissioners and employ a minimum of four full-time machine operators should be allowed a similar annual carbon tax deduction against business profits.  In other words, having regard to the previous amendments, agricultural contractors should be treated the same as ordinary farmers in terms of the use of diesel.  We much remember that with the change in farming methods, increasingly more farmers depend on contractors to do their work.  Farms are becoming bigger and more intensive and the margins are very tight.  The cost of carrying machinery on a farm is astronomical.  Like any business, farmers subcontract.  Some of the major co-operatives at one time owned their milk lorries.  Farmers have contracted their work to agricultural contractors.  Contractors are subject to the provisions of the Road Traffic Acts in the same way as other vehicle users or lorry drivers.  They have to comply with stringent standards for road safety purposes.  More importantly, their staff are well trained in health and safety in the operation of farm activities.  When we hear of farm fatalities, it mostly involves farmers who were doing work in their farmyard which perhaps contractors could have been doing.  We should be encouraging contractors to be more competitive to do this work for farmers, as it is becoming a problem.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of climate change, I  noted the document entitled 'Ag-Climatise' - A Draft National Climate &amp;amp; Air Roadmap for the Agricultural Sector to 2030 and Beyond.  It refers to changing farming practices and what will be required down the road.  It will mean more carbon-neutral management of the land and more control in the spreading of slurry and reseeding.  That will involve massive intensification of work for farmers in reseeding and doing all that work.  They need to get contractors on site but at a reasonable cost.  That is why we are seeking this reduction.   A question was asked about this area in Seanad today.  The Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy will be aware of the low emissions slurry spreading regulations and that 12 months ago, there was a requirement to have new slurry equipment for the correct spreading of slurry.  Contractors had to buy this equipment.  The farmer could buy the equipment and apply for a targeted agricultural modernisation scheme, TAMS, grant and be up and running and have a tank that he used a few days a week in a year, while contractors who follow health and safety regulations and buy the machinery are not given any relief.  I ask that some consideration be given to provide rebates for agricultural contractors.  They are in the middle, as it were, between the lorry driver and the farmer who uses a tractor and they do not seem to be given any consideration.  Whatever about climate change, they do not have alternatives in terms of fuels they can use to reduce their carbon emissions.   <\/p> <p>They will still have to rely on diesel products until new innovations come on stream.  I ask the Minister to reconsider his position on this tax on contractors.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000053#FFF00500","speaker":"1278","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1574276400,"counter":520,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for the points he has made.  Much of this has focused on where we are in respect of the agricultural contractor.

That is why they are not entitled to this particular relief.  I accept the point made by Deputy Mattie McGrath.  As we look at the future position in respect of carbon pricing, which will increase over time, we should assess this issue in the context of next year's budget and the preparatory work for next year's finance Bill.  The reason contractors cannot avail of this particular relief is that their occupation is not included in the definition of \"farming\".<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the point in respect of the rebate scheme, I supplied to the committee a note that explains how the scheme protects those involved in haulage from most of the effects of the change in carbon pricing.  There have been many cases made to broaden or review the relief scheme we have in place.  I do not believe we should do that.  The rebate scheme currently in place is proportionate.  The change in the pricing of carbon is being used as a lever to broaden the rebate scheme beyond its current design.  I do not believe that is appropriate.

That proposal was deemed not to be possible.  <i>De minimis<\/i>relief was outlined, and what the Minister has brought forward in the legislation is a variation of that.

These businesses create employment and it has a knock-on effect for the other establishments.  As Deputy McGrath said, we need a review of this tax.  The Minister has initiated a procedure with the &euro;50,000 cap, but nowadays one must ask how many bets that would take?  It does not do any good for the larger outlets who have shops in our towns and major villages.

The first issue is the impact that the increase in betting duty had on the sector over the year.  It is difficult for us to assess what the effect is of the change in betting duty in isolation, given all the other factors that affect smaller and independent bookmakers currently.  The move to betting via mobile devices and phones has been a big factor in the consolidation that is happening in the betting sector.  It is tough to be able to provide an exact impact on the betting sector of last year's budget move.<\/p><p>I will give two sets of figures for bookmakers and the number of registered premises.  In November 2018, there were 277 bookmakers and 847 registered premises.  In October 2019, there were 280 bookmakers and 863 registered premises.  Those figures do not indicate that there has been significant contraction in the numbers of bookmakers or registered premises.  Within that figure consolidation could have occurred.  Smaller independent bookmakers might have moved into groups of larger owners but, on the face of it, the figures indicate that the numbers of bookmakers and licensed premises are broadly stable, which is different from the expectations that were created when we brought in the duty increase in last year's budget.<\/p><p>Deputy McGrath asked specifically if the relief would need further consent from the European Commission.  This must conform to the Commission regulation on <i>de minimis <\/i>aid.  This is why some time is being made available.

Because the relief is capped at &euro;50,000, it will be of limited value to the more mid-range bookmakers.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister quoted overall numbers as evidence that there has not been a significant number of closures.  It could well be the case that there is a time lag involved.  On the basis of the feedback I have received, many of the smaller bookmakers are hanging on.  They are certainly suffering from behavioural change and the move online.  The fixed costs for the outlets are of a different nature.  Albeit a limited relief, it is important that it is put into effect as quickly as possible.  I understood from reading the tax strategy group papers that the relief as set out, which I believe was a maximum of &euro;66,000, was pretty much approved by the European Commission.

Hopefully, that is not happening.<\/p>  <p>  Mention has been made here about behavioural change, behavioural attitudes and rural Ireland.  We have gone through serious issues with the recent Road Traffic Act whereby we have seen pubs closing down and now there are very few pubs open during the day in many towns and villages.  People have turned towards their local bookmaker's office to sit down and watch the racing or to have a chat with their friends and so on.  I have come across this.

More important, I would rather see people betting in the bookies than going home to the armchair, having a few bottles and betting online.

That is a fair point but I still make the point, and I think it is worth recognition in the debate, that the number of bookmakers is pretty stable versus where we were this time a year ago, as is the number of registered premises.  Perhaps this shows the ability of the sector to respond to a change in tax.<\/p>  <p>  I reiterate what I said a year ago, that a 1% betting duty was too low a level of tax for any sector to pay.  The change that we are making is needed.  All parts of our economy must make a contribution to the public services that are very important to our country and a 1% levy was too low and needed to increase.  I am introducing a very targeted change for independent and, likely, very small bookmakers.  I believe it will have an effect.  I notice some are already complaining that it could allow small bookmakers to become too competitive.

It relates to the extension of VRT relief on certain hybrid vehicles in 2020.  This has been restricted from the level of relief available hitherto.  The Minister is not moving to the full worldwide harmonised light vehicle testing procedure, WLTP, system until 2021, and this is the right decision under the circumstances because it could have had quite a significant effect on the motor industry if the Minister had done so in one fell swoop in 2020.<\/p><p>The central point I made on Committee Stage was that restricting the VRT relief on hybrids will have the effect of making certain hybrid vehicles more expensive relative to diesel vehicles for one year only.  What the Minister could actually see in practice is an increase in the sale of diesel vehicles in 2020 which, I am sure, is not what the Minister has intended.  This would be because of the threshold he has set for vehicles to qualify for the extension of the relief in 2020.  From looking at the data I have been able to see that hybrid vehicles are still far more environmentally friendly than the vast majority of diesel and petrol vehicles.  For many people, hybrid vehicles are a stepping stone to full electric vehicles but I understand that in 2020 the majority of hybrid vehicles will be more expensive because the relief will have been removed from them.  The purpose of the amendments I tabled on Committee Stage and these amendments was to allow at least the vehicles that have been ordered to wash through the system in the early part of the year.

Anybody who had followed the debates that took place, in particular on Committee Stage on the previous Finance Bill, would have been aware this change was coming.  Last year, I indicated I would give very serious consideration to this change.  They were due to expire and we had much debate regarding the changes that were due to take place at that point.  The tax strategy group paper after that debate set out very clearly the environmental rationale as to why a further extension was not merited.  If I were to defer this change to 1 February it would ensure that one third of new cars sold in a particular year were not covered by the change.  In good conscience that could not be a change we make.

It was widely understood that there would be a full step change to WLTP in 2020 that would coincide with the removal of VRT relief on hybrids.  In that context the hybrid vehicles would live or die by virtue of the emissions measures and they would be relatively better than petrol or diesel vehicles.  It was all meant to happen together and being well flagged was in this context, whereas the WLTP has been pushed out for a year, and for one year only we have the partial restriction of this relief.  It could create an anomaly throughout 2020.  We will just have to see how it plays out.  The wider point I make is the work done by the tax strategy group on this issue was helpful and it should update the assessment in 2020 because decisions will have to be made in 2021 to put into effect in full the move to the new emissions system.

The Government has made the decision that food supplements will be subject to VAT at the rate of 13.5%.  My understanding, which is worth putting on the record, is that the key reason for the Government saying that it cannot zero rate food supplements is that, under the transposition of the EU VAT directive, the legislative provision for food and drink that was in place on 1 January 1991 made no provision for food supplement products.  The Government's view is that, therefore, it cannot legally zero rate them now.  There is going to be a court challenge on this issue, and we will see how that plays out in the coming months, but a number of points need to be clarified.  Do we now have a clear definition of what a food supplement is or are we going to have ongoing disputes between operators in the sector and Revenue as to what constitutes food and what constitutes food supplements?  The position of Revenue and the Government is that food supplements are not food.  That is the bottom line.  I do not want a situation where this is a rolling debate, with new products being introduced in the market and the sector saying they are food while Revenue says they are food supplements.  Do we have absolute clarity as to what constitutes a food supplement and what constitutes food?  From now on, they will have a different treatment in law in terms of the application of VAT.<\/p><p>Now that we will hopefully have clarity on the VAT treatment of food supplements, do we have an assurance that no retrospective issues will be raised and that outlets that have been selling food supplements will not be subject to revised assessments by Revenue of their VAT liabilities for previous years on the back of this legislation?  This is an important point and people want that reassurance.<\/p><p>The bottom line is that consumers will be paying more for these products from now on because of this change in the taxation code.  There will be a court challenge and we will see what the outcome of that will be, but I am concerned that this will be a rolling debate, given that new products will constantly be introduced.  I do not see a categoric definition of what a food supplement is.

I understand that food supplements are recognised as food under Irish and EU law.  Specifically, EU Directive 2002\/46\/EC on food supplements was enacted in Ireland under statutory instruments in 2007.  The health food industry is required to adhere to all food regulations to ensure quality and consumer safety.<\/p>  <p>  I understand this is a money-raising measure by the Revenue Commissioners on behalf of the Minister for Finance, but it is short-sighted.  Many people visit health food shops to buy food supplements to supplement their efforts to address well-being issues and improve their health, perhaps after a bout of illness.  For instance, they might take probiotics in the context of having been prescribed antibiotics.  Such a duality is common in a large number of European countries through the prescription of what one might call formal and therapeutic medicines administered by the medical system, including chemists, and the taking of food supplements, which are sold to supplement something that the person feels he or she needs.  Many elderly people use supplements.  Many parents give them to their children whose recovery they are seeking to promote after a bout of illness.  The purpose of these supplements is well-being.<\/p>  <p>  Most of the shops that sell health food supplements are small-scale owner-operated shops.  That may be changing in some of our larger towns and cities, but they remain owner-operated for the most part and make an important contribution to small shopping centres.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister moved the applicable VAT rate from the 23% he proposed last year to 13.5%, but even that is excessive.  The 13.5% rate should be examined anyway.  While in government, we applied the 9% rate to certain areas of activity, such as labour cost activities in hotels and catering.  The Minister should rethink this matter.  At a time when many small shops, be they in cities or towns, are being tightly squeezed, food supplement shops and health food shops are doing fairly well.<\/p>  <p>  We are not talking about items that clearly fall outside what the discussion has been about.  Rather, we are talking about specific supplements that people find to be serious additions to their attempts to achieve well-being and recovery or to help with chronic conditions, for example, arthritis.  The Minister is wrong and his colleague in the Department of Health will not thank him, given that this decision will affect people who are addressing their issues on their own.  Take fish oil as an example.  Many supplements in health food shops contain fish oil, which is a traditional remedy that goes back eons, in various forms and with different levels of omega-3 and so on.  If eaten as part of a fish, fish oil would definitely be considered a food.  If it is extracted from the fish and sold as a health food supplement, why is it suddenly not a food?  The Minister must explain himself.  I am sure that he has taken various remedies that people have recommended, possibly including cod liver oil for a bout of flu.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000057#KKK00200","speaker":"1253"},{"type":"speech","time":1574278200,"counter":546,"content":"<p>To make himself younger looking.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000057#KKK00300","speaker":"1363"},{"type":"speech","time":1574278200,"counter":547,"content":"<p>People remember in their childhood being force-fed various kinds of fish oils and, particularly among people on the west coast, seaweed products-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000057#KKK00400","speaker":"1253"},{"type":"speech","time":1574278200,"counter":548,"content":"<p>Bread and milk were all we had.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000057#KKK00500","speaker":"1363"},{"type":"speech","time":1574278200,"counter":549,"content":"<p>----for coughs and other ailments.

That is the appropriate way to deal with it.  If we were to look to define either a food or a food supplement by way of a legal definition, it would be a catalyst for this issue to continue to cause problems into the future.  We can be certain that shortly after making any such definition in law, something would happen to raise issues or unintended problems.  One of the many things I have learned in the drafting and implementation of law is that there can be a temptation to put too much into primary legislation.  In this instance, it should and will be dealt with by way of the guidance that will issue from Revenue.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Michael McGrath asked whether there would be retrospective application in this matter.  That will not be the case; instead, it will be dealt with on a going forward basis.  I hope to provide further clarity as the provision is dealt with and changed within the legislation.<\/p>  <p>  In response to Deputy Burton's questions, I emphasise that the key issue is the question of what is a food and what is a food supplement.  The EU VAT directive that is relevant to the sector is very clear that a different rate needs to apply to food supplements.  We have consulted the European Commission in the course of the debate we have had since this issue was first raised in the aftermath of last year's Finance Bill and it has affirmed our view that food supplements are not foods and that a different rate of taxation should, therefore, apply to this sector.  That tax rate would have been 23%, but I have sought to get the balance right and reflect the importance of the sector for many citizens by setting it at the lower rate of 13.5%.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000058#LLL00300","speaker":"1292"},{"type":"speech","time":1574278800,"counter":559,"content":"<p>The Minister and his advisers know that a 0% rate is still a rate of tax.

I am interested in hearing the Minister's response to the points we have raised, particularly in respect of those cases where doctors have said certain supplements may be of benefit on an ongoing basis to maintain people's health against certain conditions from which they suffer or are recovering.  To impose this additional cost on the persons concerns does not seem to be a good idea.  Surely we want to encourage people to look after their health and well-being?

I am almost certain that one can get it these days in precisely the types of shop we are discussing.  This is something that for Bob Marley and many others in Jamaica was a food, indeed a very healthy food.  However, one is likely to find it for sale here only as a food supplement which will be treated differently from food for VAT purposes.  The same taxation regime will apply to many other products, such as fish oil which may be described as supplements.  That is a mistake.

It is about the definition of the exemption from stamp duty for a young trained farmer.  It is a historical definition that dates back to a predecessor of mine in Galway East, former Deputy Paul Connaughton Snr., who was involved at the time the installation aid scheme worth &pound;5,000 was brought forward.  Deputy D'Arcy's father, former Deputy Michael D'Arcy, was probably also involved when it was brought forward.  It is now defunct, which is disappointing.  At the time, eligibility for the scheme was confined to someone under the age of 35 years who had a green certificate.  Stamp duty relief and agricultural relief were both defined in the Finance Acts as being confined to a young trained farmer.  As the Minister knows, his predecessor, Deputy Noonan, altered the definition of agricultural relief a number of years ago and it is now confined to a trained farmer, regardless of age.  I am looking for the same definition to be applied to stamp duty relief in order that if a farmer is trained, he or she would be eligible to avail of it.<\/p><p>It would make sense because if one looks at the initiative developed between the Environmental Protection Agency, the Irish Farmers Association and the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment called smart farming, the idea behind it is to get farmers to come up with innovative ways of production to reduce overall emissions.  The smart farming initiative has led to reduced agricultural emissions by 10% on average.  We want to try to encourage farmers to acquire the skills they need to do this.  We also want them to become far more efficient to be able to expand their business and consolidate their operations.  In the part of the country from which I come and represent, on the idea behind consolidation being the disposal of an out farm to buy a home farm, when one is talking about small holdings, there is not an awful lot of which to dispose.  The objective is to try to facilitate the small cohort of farmers over the age of 35 years who are trying to make their operations more efficient.  If they have the required qualification, they should be eligible to avail of stamp duty relief.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000059#MMM00500","speaker":"1234"},{"type":"speech","time":1574279400,"counter":568,"content":"<p>I support the amendment.  The position is that if someone is 36 years of age, for the sake of argument, and has a green certificate, he or she can fill in a single farm payment or basic payment scheme, BPS, form and receive the allowance as a young farmer from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  Perhaps the Minister might look at this issue, but for whatever reason, the Department of Finance applies a limit of 35 years.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine allows an application to be made up to the age of 40 years.  The reality is the generation before them want to try to hold on to land for as long as they can.  Generally, for a farmer aged 40, 38 or 37 years, he or she will be 64, 65 or 66 before they he or she receives the farm.  As pointed out by Deputy Naughten, we are trying to bring in people with particular skill sets, as well as young enthusiastic farmers.  I would still describe a person aged 37, 38 or 39 years as young.  We need to try to have the two definitions run in parallel to each other, if possible.  The same definition of a young farmer should be applied by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Department of Finance.  The farmers concerned have their green certificate and are trained.  After a while it will wither away and all farmers will be trained as young farmers with qualifications move up along the line.  Even in my day we had to undertake 180 hours of training, to be topped up by a further 80 hours.  That training was undertaken by farmers who are now aged 52 or 53 years and even older.  They were kept out of the equation.  It is not as if they will be buying ranches.  As pointed out, they will be buying small amounts of land to try to make their operations more sustainable in rural areas.  That will help to keep a light on and a community going.

To qualify, the farmer receiving the transfer must be less than 35 years of age on the date of execution of the deed of transfer; must have attained a minimum agricultural education from a list set out in legislation; must for a period of five years spend not less than 50% of his or her working life farming the land; must retain the ownership of the land; and must submit a business plan to Teagasc before the execution of the deed transferring the land.  The exemption granted will be withdrawn if the land is disposed of within a five-year period and not replaced within one year of disposal.<\/p>  <p>  The primary policy objectives of the Government in agri-taxation are to support and encourage the increased mobility of farm land to a new generation of farmers with relevant qualifications.  The 35 year old age limit is long established for young trained farmer stamp duty relief and has applied since 1994.  It is the only stamp duty relief in the agriculture sector to which an age limit applies.  The Deputy is seeking the removal of the age limit for the young trained farmer relief in order that it might be available to all farmers who hold a relevant agricultural qualification.  The stamp duty relief for young trained farmers, together with stock relief for young trained farmers and succession under partnership schemes, is granted under the EU's agricultural block exemption regulation.  It allows the granting of certain categories of state aid to the agriculture and forestry sectors and in rural areas without prior notification being given to the Commission.  If the age limit was removed, allowing the relief would no longer be eligible for state aid approval under the scheme.  That is the reason I cannot agree to it.<\/p>  <p> It is also important to note that the young trained farmer stamp duty relief is just one of a series of tax measures, including consanguinity stamp duty relief, designed to encourage the intergenerational transfer of farms.  In 2017, for example, the succession farm partnership scheme was launched, which provides for a &euro;25,000 tax credit over five years to further assist with the transfer of farms within the partnership structure, and promote and support the earlier intergenerational transfer of family farms.  Of course, stamp duty consanguinity relief on non-residential transfers at 1% still applies to those who do not meet the criteria for the stamp duty exemption and transfers of land to young trained farmers, and this will continue to assist in succession in such cases.  Support of the farming sector through taxation measures is a priority of mine.  The agricultural-specific tax measures in place were valued at &euro;188.7 million in 2016, while the sector as a whole benefited from &euro;830 million in respect of a broader range of tax expenditures and just under &euro;1.8 billion in direct expenditures for 2016.  Such reliefs are made available because of the support the farming sector needs and to incentivise young trained farmers to be active in the sector.  They also place the right kind of measure to support farming consolidation and the passage of land through generations of farmers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000059#MMM00700","speaker":"1292","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1574280000,"counter":571,"content":"<p>The Minister is correct that there is a block exemption, but as he will know, it is possible for him to go to the European Commission with a proposal if he so wishes.  It is not, therefore, a viable argument for not removing the age threshold, which has been done in the case of agricultural relief.  The objective, particularly in an era of climate action when the focus is on trying to reduce overall emissions, must be to encourage farmers to train and to deal with the issue of trying to reduce overall carbon emissions.  The definition for the exemption should be altered to remove the age limit, and to ensure that farmers are trained and encouraged to train.  For someone over the age of 35 who does not have the agricultural training, there is no incentive for him or her to get it.  Given the challenges the agricultural sector will have to deal with over the next decade, however, such as issues with agricultural emissions including methane, there is an inbuilt incentive for the sector, the individual farmer and the economy as a whole to have the training and to drive the change on farm.  We have seen evidence of that in the smart farming initiative, where clear measures taken by farmers on suckler, beef and dairy herds, as well as in the sheep sector, have led to an average reduction of 10% in emissions, which is significant.<\/p>  <p>  We should try to encourage farmers to get the training and education.

One would have thought the council had more money given the property tax, but it has less because for every cent it collected in property tax was offset against central government funding.<\/p><p>The Government replaced a progressive tax, which was centrally funded through income-related tax, with a tax on the family home that has nothing to do with a person's income and ability to pay.

This will get worse on the other side of a general election at whatever point some sort of revaluation or reconfiguration of the property tax takes place.  That would be unfair and totally unjustifiable.  <\/p><p>I am sure that in many parts of the country, as in my area, the value of people's houses has absolutely nothing to do with their wealth or income.  It may be that the two correlate and some people have houses that are worth a lot while also earning a lot of money, but there is no automatic or necessary connection between the two.  Many council houses in my area that people bought are now, through no fault of theirs, worth a fortune because no other council houses have been built since.  Any kind of house is now worth a fortune, but that bears no relationship to the income of those in them and their ability to pay.  People living in such houses are often on very low incomes.  The system is not fair and has not done anything to improve funding for local government and the services that flow from it.  <\/p><p>The evidence from some of the council budgets I have mentioned is that the situation is getting worse in terms of local government funding.  That is my case for saying that we need a more progressive form of funding for local government, which is not based on the value of a property over which people have absolutely no control and bears no relation to their ability to pay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000061#OOO00400","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1574280600,"counter":580,"content":"<p>Deputy Boyd Barrett and I have debated this issue on many occasions and he is correct that I have deferred the revaluation date for the local property tax to 1 November 2020.  Significant work needs to be delivered next year.  It can be delivered, but it will require consensus in the House for that to happen.<\/p>  <p>  I differ with the Deputy in that I believe that the local property tax is an important part of how we fund local government now and into the future.  I listened to what Dublin City Council had to say and the charges it made about me.  There is no doubt they will make charges about me in the future regarding the revenue available to it.  A city council of the scale of Dublin City Council should be able to manage its budget in such a way that the kind of charges and mooted increases it argues are needed do not happen.  A governing alliance is in place on the council and I expect it to deliver a budget that meets the needs of Dubliners without the kind of charges it has alleged need to be introduced.  It is possible for Governments to do that and, therefore, it should be possible for the council to do the same.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy might clarify his comments on the relationship between house values and people's incomes.  I sensed he began to do so as his contribution concluded.  I wrote down what he said.  He said that the value of a person's house has nothing to do with his or her wealth.  That is not correct.  It is the case, as he went on to say, that the value of a person's home does not correlate to the income within that home.  The Deputy is fully correct in that.   For the Deputy to say that the value of a person's house has nothing to do with his her wealth is not the case and perhaps he might elaborate on that.<\/p> <p>The value of people's homes is a significant part of their wealth.  I appreciate that the local property tax is a big bill for people to pay and I am aware of the effect it has on people's take home pay and income.  It is because I am sensitive to that fact that I am trying to avoid significant unplanned changes and that is why I believe a valuation date on 1 November is more appropriate.  I believe local property taxes have an important part to play, now and in the future, in ensuring that the needs of local communities can be met.  <\/p> <p> From the different parts of the country in which I have opportunities to work in, I have been able to see how changes have been made in local property taxes.  Decisions have been made to increase the tax and the revenue raised has been used to fund important work undertaken by local authorities.  I have seen that work myself.  I refer to where elected councillors decided they would have a lower rate of increase in the local property tax or increase it.  The revenue generated was then used to fund important work within the communities those councillors represent.  That is the way I believe local government should happen and, over time, I would like to increase the ability for those kinds of decisions to happen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000061#OOO00500","speaker":"1292","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1574281200,"counter":582,"content":"<p>We fundamentally disagree.  I do not think people's family homes can be considered wealth in the same way as people who have two, three or four houses - besides their family home - and rent those out to make money.  For me, those rented houses are wealth-generating assets.  People putting a roof over their head is surely just doing a basic thing needed to exist in society.  I do not see that as wealth, but as something that society should be able to provide for people.  Our society does not provide that, but people do manage to get to the point of at least having a roof over their heads through immense struggle, hardship and hard work.  They are then, however, going to be charged for having that home even when it is not a wealth-producing asset.<\/p>  <p>  In any event, the value of a home is not dictated by the owner.  There is a relationship between the bricks and mortar required to build a house in Roscommon and the similar materials required in Ballybrack, but the value of the resulting houses will be completely different.  That has nothing to do with the intrinsic quality of the buildings, but with the fact that the market, which is completely out of the control of the homeowner, has driven up the price to a certain level in one area compared with another.  Those two properties, however, will be taxed on that differential.  That is fundamentally unjust.  We excluded the family home in our proposed wealth tax, even for the 85,000 richest people in the country who are worth &euro;3.5 million.  We think a wealth tax should be imposed on those people, but we removed the family home from consideration because we think it is different from a wealth-producing asset.  That is a sustainable and reasonable position.  <\/p>  <p>  Turning to local authorities, would the Minister give them the power to tax the profits of property developers and land speculators and allow them to generate extra revenue that way?

I am very sensitive to how people feel about the local property tax, how large a bill comes in each year and the difficulty many people face in paying it.  To have a definition of wealth that excludes that value of a home is extraordinary, however.  It is an asset and if all of that wealth is carried forward, via the exclusion of the homes of millionaires and very wealthy people from tax, I am afraid that proves to me further the uniqueness of the Irish left.

There is a major difference, however, when we then consider people who own second, third, fourth, fifth, tenth or even 100th properties, and which they can rent out to generate revenue.  Those are two very different things, but the Minister does not treat them differently in the property tax.  That is the problem.  To me that is an injustice and that is the reason we will continue to oppose a family home tax.  Perhaps that is a better way to put it and that is the way we termed the tax when we campaigned on this issue.

I genuinely thank the Minister for engaging with me on the issue of the 481 tax relief for the film industry.  I refer to the extent to which it needs, should and is required to contribute to quality employment and training in the film industry and the development of that industry.  I thank the Minister's officials for engaging with us as well.  They have responded to some of the points I made, largely on behalf of those who have worked in the industry for decades.  They believe that investment in creating employment and training in a film industry in this country is a good thing and that we should do more of that.  They do not believe, however, that the current incentive has had the desired effect.  The employment and training provided has not been of sufficient quality, even though that is the intent of the tax relief .<\/p>  <p>  I refer to particular parts of the industry.  As the Minister and his officials know, I have distinguished between the film industry and areas such as the animation sector, where the relief has had a major impact.  In that sector, there are companies of scale, people have secure jobs and income and, as a result, Irish animation is boxing at the very highest level on the international scene.  That area is really going from strength to strength.  That has not, sadly, been the outcome to the same extent in the film industry.  There have been many successful productions, but the provision of quality employment and training has not been the same in that sector.  As a result, there is a quite a debate or controversy, to put it mildly, going on in the industry.  <\/p>  <p>  I will not recapitulate the whole debate.  As I said to the Minister when we met earlier to discuss this issue - I hope it is okay to mention that - the problem is that film production companies which apply for the relief are then subsequently denying that they are the employers.  The way they do that is, for each film production, the Irish production company sets up a special purpose vehicle, SPV, or designated activity company, DAC. <\/p> <p>It is not really a company.  It is merely a financial instrument.  It is an accounting tool for that particular production.  However, when workers attempt to assert their rights as employees, the Irish producer company which applied for the relief which is conditional on the provision of employment and training, says to the employee that it is not his or her employer and that the SPV is his or her employer.  The SPV only exists for the film and then it is gone.  Then the same producer company makes another film, sets up another SPV but it is a different employer, even though it is the same employer.  Then it makes another film, sets up another SPV but it is a different employer, but actually it is the same employer.  This is the problem.<\/p> <p> It means that people who have worked on film after film for the same producer and the same recipient of section 481 relief are not accumulating the rights that they have under law, particularly under the Protection of Employees (Fixed-Term Work) Act 2003 which was precisely designed by the European Union and enshrined in Irish law to ensure that this kind of thing does not happen.  To concretise it, it means that those workers are completely vulnerable.  There is nothing to stop the film producer saying to a worker that he or she has worked for the film producer on three or four films previously and has received awards and credits, as many of these workers have, but the film producer will not take him or her on the next film because the worker asked for the application of the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997, in terms of hours of work, breaks or whatever.  The producer company thinks the worker is asking for too much and is a troublemaker and it will not employ him or her on the next production.<\/p> <p> As we speak, that is what is happening.  On RT&Eacute; News tonight, one will see, if one looks at the entertainment section, reference to the sequel for \"Vikings\" being produced in Ashford, County Wicklow.  I refer to people who worked for that producer company, Metropolitan and World 2000, which produced \"Vikings\" before it, \"Into the Badlands\" before that, \"Penny Dreadful\" - I can go through the list.  If one went to those previous productions, looked at the credits at the end and looked at who were the stage hands, the construction-grade staff, the drivers etc. to see how many of them are on this new one when those credits role, at present the answer is \"very few\".  They have already contacted this film company and said that they worked on its last few productions and they are hoping they will be working on these ones and they are being told that they will not.  Co-incidentally, some of those people or their associates are people who went to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht discussing this issue nearly two years ago where they made allegations about the failure of the producer companies to vindicate the rights of workers and fully apply the law on bogus self-employment, the Protection of Employees (Fixed-Term Work) Act 2003 and other employment requirements.  It is many of those people or people associated with them who now will not be allowed onto that production that is in the news tonight.  That is not acceptable.<\/p> <p> I have had a sympathetic ear from the Minister in this regard and from his officials.  I hope that we will design the public support which we need in this industry in such a way that what I refer to cannot happen and that workers who ask for their legal rights will not be displaced.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000062#PPP01000","speaker":"1238","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1574281800,"counter":592,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Boyd Barrett.

We must examine all the options so we will engage constructively when that report is published early next year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000064#RRR00600","speaker":"1223"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1574282400,"counter":604,"content":"<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1574282400,"counter":605,"content":"<p>Bill, as amended, received for final consideration.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Finance Bill 2019: Order for Fifth Stage","time":1574282400,"counter":606,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000064#RRR00850"},{"type":"speech","time":1574282400,"counter":607,"content":"<p>When is it proposed to take Fifth Stage?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000064#RRR00900","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1574282400,"counter":608,"content":"<p>Now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000064#RRR01000","speaker":"1292"},{"type":"speech","time":1574282400,"counter":609,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000064#RRR01100","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1574282400,"counter":610,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000064#RRR01200","speaker":"1345"},{"type":"vote","time":1574283000,"counter":611,"content":"<p>Question put: \"That Fifth Stage be taken now.\"<\/p><p>The D\u00e1il divided: T\u00e1, 45; N\u00edl, 19; Staon, 19.<\/p><br\/><p>Tellers: T\u00e1, Deputies Se\u00e1n Kyne and Tony McLoughlin; N\u00edl, Deputies Denise Mitchell and Imelda Munster.<\/p><p>Question declared carried.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000065#SSS00200","aye":["1246","1310","1293","1369","1307","1260","1241","1273","1339","1286","1285","1364","1261","1268","1338","1292","1356","1322","1264","1300","1233","1313","1318","1251","1249","1365","1314","1240","1243","1359","1343","1247","1363","1295","1315","1328","1297","1267","1329","1265","1334","1304","1213","1277","1358"],"nay":["1432","1238","1361","1253","1263","1316","1258","1303","1341","1320","1319","1345","1242","1347","1362","1333","1269","1301","1232"],"abs":["1368","1321","1332","1354","1220","1350","1335","1357","1221","1346","1223","1283","1262","1228","1278","1312","1231","1270","1271"]},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Finance Bill 2019: Fifth Stage","time":1574283300,"counter":612,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000066#TTT00100"},{"type":"vote","time":1574283300,"counter":613,"content":"<p>Question put: \"That the Bill do now pass.\"<\/p><p>The D\u00e1il divided: T\u00e1, 45; N\u00edl, 19; Staon, 18.<\/p><br\/><p>Tellers: T\u00e1, Deputies Se\u00e1n Kyne and Tony McLoughlin; N\u00edl, Deputies Denise Mitchell and Thomas P.

As Members will know, mental health continues to be a priority area for the Government.  We recognise that mental health service users are often among the most vulnerable in society and for this reason &euro;39 million has been added to the mental health budget for 2020, increasing the annual allocation to &euro;1.026 billion.  This represents an increase of more than &euro;315 million, or 45%, since 2012.  This funding will help in the continued improvement and development of mental health services.  Funding by itself is not enough, however.  We also need to look at how we deliver services and how we can achieve the most appropriate mix of community, inpatient and specialist mental health services.<\/p><p>This approach informed A Vision For Change in 2006, which set a new direction for the delivery of mental health services.  This policy took an holistic view of mental illness and championed an integrated multidisciplinary approach to address the biological, psychological and social factors contributing to mental health.  It also advocated an increased emphasis on recovery and the destigmatising of mental illness.  Outdated institutions were replaced with modernised centres, some of which are today attached to our acute hospitals to ensure quick and easy access to medical facilities, as required.<\/p><p>Community teams were, and continue to be, enhanced in order to treat patients as close to their home as is practical.  There are now 114 adult mental health teams and 70 child and adolescent teams embedded throughout the nine community health organisations around the country.<\/p><p>The refresh of A Vision for Change will continue this work.  In line with Sl&aacute;intecare, it aims to improve both service user and clinician experience to ensure a better outcome, while ensuring value for money.  The HSE's New Ways of Working that were recently installed across our health services will support the implementation of the Vision for Change refresh in order to deliver our health services as close to people's homes as possible, with the majority of care delivered within the community and not in acute hospitals. <\/p> <p>The refresh of A Vision for Change is expected to be presented to Government for consideration before the end of the year.  Given the significant increases to the mental health budget over recent years, this policy will focus on a reconfiguration of existing services to best suit individual need.  As part of this, all current and future mental health spending will be critically evaluated to ensure cost-efficiency and value for money.  In this regard, the Department and the HSE will continue to work to develop innovative ways of delivering mental health services to ensure as many people as possible are treated in as timely a manner as possible.<\/p> <p> Over recent years, I have prioritised a number of initiatives and have worked with the HSE to introduce new ways of working which will complement the delivery of mental health services, while easing the burden on the service.  Some of these initiatives, which are being driven by the Department of Health, centre on digital technologies.  Telecounselling and telepsychiatry projects will provide remote counselling and psychiatric consultations that will help to improve access to mental health services.  A dedicated mental health signposting telephone number will be launched by the Taoiseach later this month and a crisis text line will be launched early in the new year.  Greater use of the technology available to us will help to deliver services at as early a stage as possible and will help to ensure that mild mental health issues are dealt with before they become more serious.<\/p> <p> We have also enhanced mental health services provided in primary care.  The introduction of 114 assistant psychologists and 20 psychologists in primary care has resulted in an increase of 28% in referrals, which will total approximately 14,000 in 2019.  This, in turn, has helped to reduce the national waiting list for child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, to around 2,000, a decrease of 500, or 20%, since December 2018. <\/p> <p> These initiatives exemplify the serious intent of the Government to progress and improve mental health services.  This intent is further demonstrated by the investment in the 170-bed state-of-the-art complex in Portrane that will replace the Central Mental Hospital in Dundrum.  This will address capacity issues which have emerged in recent years by increasing the number of beds from 103 to 130 beds and will completely modernise the forensic mental health service in Ireland.  In addition, a ten-bedroom forensic child and adolescent mental health unit and a 30-bedroom intensive care rehabilitation unit will be co-located on the site.<\/p> <p> The amendment of the Mental Health Act 2001 remains a priority for the Government.  A major review of the Act is currently under way and work is continuing in earnest.  The recommendations from the expert review group have been taken on board by the Department of Health within this review process and are reflected in the draft heads of Bill prepared by the Department.  Earlier this year, the Department furnished the draft heads to the Mental Health Commission for examination.  It is essential that the commission be given enough time to fully consider the draft and to provide its expert opinion.  The Mental Health Commission expects to complete its review of the draft in early 2020, at which point further work will be required by the Department to consider and revise the heads based on the views of the commission.  When this work is completed, the revised heads will be submitted to Government for approval to finalise the text of the Bill.  It is expected that the final text of the Bill, as approved by Government, will go before the Oireachtas in late 2020.<\/p> <p> The ongoing reform agenda in mental health has led to much-needed change on many fronts, including the continued destigmatising of mental illness, a greater recovery focus and the encouragement of more open discussion.  Delivering modern mental health services requires adequate resourcing but it also requires a new outlook to maximise the impact of existing structures and service provision.  I look forward to the continued reform of our mental health services and welcome contributions from Members to this discussion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000067#UUU00300","speaker":"1261","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1574283900,"counter":618,"content":"<p>Is there a copy of the Minister of State's speech?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000068#VVV00200","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"speech","time":1574283900,"counter":619,"content":"<p>There is.

I welcome the opportunity to again discuss mental health in this Chamber.  It cannot be discussed enough.  I acknowledge there recently have been a number of positive developments in mental health including the new 24-hour mental health helpline, the development of a number of clinical programmes, and the building of the forensic mental health hospital at Portrane.  There are, however, also some serious areas of concern.  I refer, in particular, to the many failures to implement policy within our mental health services.  It is now 2019, some 13 years into A Vision for Change, our ten-year national mental health strategy.  Many of the issues faced by patients and their families are totally unacceptable and unnecessary.  I will highlight some of the issues concerning people.<\/p>  <p>  First, I will raise the issue of our child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS.  This is our acute mental health service for children and adolescents, which addresses the 10% that make up the most acute circumstances that affect our young people's mental health.  These services are seriously understaffed.  Only 57% of the staff number recommended in A Vision for Change are in place.  In two areas, CHO 5 and CHO 7, fewer than 50% of the necessary staff members are in place while only 7.6% of the necessary staff are in place for children with intellectual disabilities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000068#VVV00400","speaker":"1354"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Message from Select Committee","time":1574283900,"counter":621,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000068#VVV00500"},{"type":"speech","time":1574283900,"counter":622,"content":"<p>The Select Committee on Justice and Equality has completed its consideration of the Criminal Records (Exchange of Information) Bill 2019, and has made amendments thereto.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000068#VVV00600","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1574283900,"counter":623,"content":"<p>The D&aacute;il adjourned at at 10.15 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 21 November 2019.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
