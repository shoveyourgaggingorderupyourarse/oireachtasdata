People are also very concerned at the prospect of further increases in the cost of the hospital because, of course, the contractors will be able to recoup future costs where the inflation rate exceeds 4% per annum.  I believe construction inflation is currently running at up to 10.5%.  It is a far cry from the &euro;650 million all-in that the Taoiseach announced, I think, back in 2016.<\/p>  <p>  We learned late last week that the Minister was briefed on 27 August.  In a comprehensive note from his assistant secretary he was told the \"construction budget is trending very significantly over budget.\"  I am told that at a minimum it is to be an additional &euro;191 million and this was not in dispute.  The note also stated that BAM had submitted a further &euro;200 million over the &euro;191 million.  This did not include VAT, sectoral employment orders and so on.  The note concluded that the CEO would advise the Department in the following week.<\/p>  <p>  What did the Minister do when he got that note?  Did he talk to the Secretary General in the Department about this?  Was it raised at the regular management meeting of the Department?  Did he seek further briefings?  Why did he not alert his Government colleague, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe?  We have not had an explanation for this enormous overrun with a significant impact on the capital budget.  Why did the Minister for Health not fully inform the D&aacute;il?  In fact the D&aacute;il was misled essentially with the &euro;983 million figure.  No mention was made of the &euro;191 million or that the costs were trending significantly over budget, of which the Minister would have been apprised in that note in August.<\/p>  <p>  Are we to seriously believe that the Secretaries General at the Departments of Finance and Health had no discussions about this between August and November of last year or that the two Ministers did not?  If that is the case, it raises fundamental issues about the governance, competence and management of the budgetary process.  Was it that this project was too big to fail?  Politically the Government had invested too much and it was too late to stop or to relocate.  There was an extraordinary silence about this over a long period of time.  Does the Taoiseach understand why people find the explanations we have been offered so far incredible?  Does he accept that the overall costs will be higher than the &euro;1.7 billion because of inflation and the obligations the Government has?<\/p><p>Does the Taoiseach accept that the Minister for Health should have alerted the Minister for Finance to this issue as far back as August and that his officials should have alerted the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021200003#A00200","speaker":"1224","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1549980300,"counter":8,"content":"<p>I fully understand and appreciate that taxpayers are very annoyed at the way the cost of this project has escalated.

However, PwC has been appointed by the Government so it is obvious that something is wrong.  We cannot actually say that the taxpayer has not been ripped off.  Memos showing the interaction between the hospital board, the Department and the contractors are beginning to emerge.  At one stage, the contractor was threatening to reconsider its participation in the project, which is extraordinary.  It seems that the Government was paralysed and powerless to do anything.  It is quite extraordinary that the Government and the Minister are of the view that &euro;1.7 billion represents a reasonable cost for the hospital.  Is that still the Government's position?

It is under construction, with the first phase due to open in Blanchardstown next year and the final project due to be completed by 2022 or 2023.  Nobody is disputing the Government's decision, made in December, to proceed with the project.  We were faced with three possibilities, namely, to cancel the project all together and set aside over &euro;250 million invested to date, to retender, which would have delayed matters and probably ended up costing even more, or to proceed.<\/p><p>We decided to proceed and very few people opposite have argued that we made the wrong decision to proceed at that time.

The first is the extraordinary achievement of delivering what we are advised will be the world's most expensive hospital, ever, at an overrun to the taxpayer of &euro;450 million.  This is extraordinary stuff.  Second, it is extraordinary to hear the Taoiseach again try to justify or explain away this fiasco, as if to suggest to the taxpayer that it is not such a big deal after all, that is, &euro;450 million of taxpayers' money in any overspend.  Perhaps, what is most extraordinary in this scenario is to hear the Government's coalition partner, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, extol the extraordinariness of the situation and then resolve to back the Government and its incompetent Minister for Health, Deputy Harris.  This is truly extraordinary stuff.<\/p>  <p>  It is extraordinary that the T&aacute;naiste and other members of Government choose to label efforts to seek accountability as stunts.  It is extraordinary that the Cabinet and Government are so arrogant at this stage that they defy the prerogative and duty of the Opposition to hold them to account because that is a democratic imperative and it is essential.  It is essential because of this hospital overrun but it would be necessary in any event because the Minister for Health's record, frankly, is shambolic.  Whatever the Taoiseach may think, or whatever his friend, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, might suggest we have a crisis in the health service.  It is crystal clear at this juncture that the Minister for Health is incapable of resolving it.  In fact, it has become apparent that he is part of the problem and not part of the solution.<\/p>  <p>  We have the worst waiting lists across Europe.  Last month, more than 10,000 patients were on hospital trolleys.  Last year was the worst year on record in a perpetual trolley crisis that nobody seems to be accountable for.  It is a farce.  We had nurses and midwives on picket lines, which was totally avoidable but for the overbearing arrogance of this Government and the Minister for Health, who would only at the eleventh hour engage respectfully with our nurses and midwives.  Then, we have the small matter of &euro;450 million of taxpayers' money.  Fianna F&aacute;il might be prepared to sit on its hands but we will not.  The anger around all this debacle is very real and it will not go away.  I understand that the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, proposes to make a brief statement following Leaders' Questions, with no facility for questions or answers or even the most basic accountability.  I suggest to the Taoiseach that rather than facilitating this fiasco any further he should do the right thing and relieve the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, of his duties.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021200005#C00200","speaker":"1239"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1549980900,"counter":20,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021200005#C00300","nonspeaker":"Deputies"},{"type":"speech","time":1549980900,"counter":21,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for her question.

It will be a truly national facility - born digital and connected to paediatric units and hospitals all over the country.

I want to ask a question regarding PwC, which has been engaged by the Government to explain this gross miscalculation.  I am curious to understand what procurement procedure was followed to appoint this firm.  One could argue that a conflict of interest exists because PwC received in excess of &euro;30 million over the past nine years in fees from BAM.  We now have a situation where PwC is conducting an analysis and assessment of the reasons we have this gigantic overrun.  BAM will most certainly play a central role in that examination.  Can the Taoiseach explain why the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General was not utilised as the watchdog to carry out this function, particularly in view of the fact that its statutory remit is to improve the use of public moneys and resources and strengthen public accountability?  Is it the case that the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General is not adequately staffed to provide this resource?  Why are we farming out so much of our public service work to a small, select group of accountancy and legal firms.  Is it accurate to contend that the public service no longer has the talent or the expertise to conduct such onerous exercises?<\/p>  <p>  At a time when, generally, many Irish households struggle with everyday costs such as those relating to childcare, mortgages, rent and insurance, there is a strongly held sentiment that public moneys are being squandered due to unnecessary layers of bureaucracy.  Growing numbers of quangos - yes, the quangos are most definitely back - and committees of review are established yet no one is held responsible for costly decisions.  In 2011, Fine Gael and Labour separately promised to abolish or merge many dozens of what they described as wasteful agencies.  Fine Gael listed 145 quangos which would be terminated when it came to power.  While a total of 62 were terminated, as many as 40 new agencies have been created.  Some 14 of those involved mergers of old agencies.  There are now, at enormous cost to the taxpayer, an estimated 257 quangos.  It is ironic that their existence creates further distance between the public and the relevant Minister or Department when policy issues, controversies or the need to apportion blame arise.  The quango culture is alive and thriving at a growing cost to the Irish taxpayer while, at the same time, diminishing even more the responsibility of the Minister or the Department involved.<\/p>  <p>  The cost of the administering the State, together with so much unaccountable allocation of public moneys, is infuriating for a hard-pressed workforce.

He will be aware that the main cost of public administration is salaries and, as we increase pay across the public sector this year and next year, that is likely to increase.  The number of State agencies and bodies, as the Deputy rightly acknowledges, has decreased in recent years but not by as much as perhaps we had intended.<\/p><p>One of the new bodies established was the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board because the view was taken that the necessary skills perhaps did not exist within the relevant agencies to deliver a project of this scale.  As a result, a dedicated body was established by the Government and given statutory powers by the Oireachtas to proceed with the project.  Perhaps, on reflection, that was not the right thing to do.  Perhaps HSE Estates, which has done such a good job on other health projects, might have done as good a job, or better, on this project.  However, we are beyond that point now.<\/p> <p> In terms of the work being undertaken by PwC, the commissioning of this review was done by the HSE, which has a framework for the provision of professional services to assist in the programme for health service improvement.  It provides resourcing and experience to be drawn down from PwC, as required.  Under the terms of this framework, it was agreed that PwC would carry out a review of cost increases relating to the new children's hospital construction project.

It was acknowledged that the role of the Comptroller and Auditor General is to look back on expenditure that has already been incurred.  As Deputies will be aware, this is a controversy about &euro;450 million that the Government has decided will be spent in the years ahead.  The expenditure has not yet been incurred.  So far, between &euro;200 million and &euro;250 million has been spent on the project, and that is on budget and on time.  The controversy relates to spending that has yet to happen.  We believe it is the right decision to go ahead with this project because suspending it or stalling it could mean that we would have no children's hospital for a generation and because retendering would probably cost more.  As already stated, the role of the Comptroller and Auditor General is to look back at expenditure that has been incurred.  This expenditure has not been incurred.  This is not about a waste of taxpayers' money; this is about underestimating the true cost of the project.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021200007#E01500","speaker":"1236","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1549982100,"counter":41,"content":"<p>Jesus.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021200008#F00200","speaker":"1239"},{"type":"speech","time":1549982100,"counter":42,"content":"<p>In response to questions from committee members as to whether he might examine the project at some point, the Comptroller and Auditor General did not rule it out, if, as he stated, it could add something valuable.

Many mergers also took place.  To give one small example, the National Sports Campus Development Authority was merged with the Irish Sports Council.  If Deputy Lowry or any other Deputies have suggestions regarding public bodies that should be abolished or merged, the Government would be interested to hear which ones they have identified and the reasoning behind their choices.  What is undoubted is that lessons have to be learned by the Government.  Further lessons will be learned.  The Cabinet decided at its meeting this morning that among the matters which should be examined is whether we should avoid two-phase tenders in the future.<\/p><p>There are definitely advantages to it but there may be disadvantages as well because one does not know the full cost of a project until the second tender comes in.  We are considering whether we should factor in optimism bias and promoter bias, whereby projects that people want to see delivered tend to give rise to optimism about the real cost.  We also will examine the issue of low-price tenders and whether we should look more at median price because we have a real concern that some companies have been low-balling, coming in with very low tender prices to get the contract and then coming back with claims thereafter.

At a meeting of the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach on 5 February, I asked Deputy Donohoe to provide to the committee a detailed account of the drawings and how advanced they were when the contract was agreed in February 2017.  Every expert I talk to about this issue says the Government's fatal mistake was agreeing a contract on the basis of drawings that were little more than planning design drawings.  Anyone would know that a contract should be concluded on the basis of the most detailed drawings, including equipment and IT.  It is not easy being a Minister, as one is there learning the ropes.  Unfortunately, however, we had a Minister who let go of the key rope.  This ship has sailed around for the last two years adding costs for the Irish taxpayer.<\/p>  <p>  We need to be forensic about the political aspect of this issue.  The Minister for Health knew that his predecessor, the Taoiseach himself, had said the only reason this hospital would not open in 2020 would be if an asteroid were to hit Ireland.  As such, he may have been under a certain amount of pressure to deliver.  All of us here know that Deputies were being met in the coffee dock every day by people lobbying them to put the site in Blanchardstown or at Connolly Hospital instead.  Facing the threat of judicial review, there was pressure to sign this quickly and get the deal done.  As reported that day the Government agreed a contract worth &euro;950 million, admitting at the time that IT and equipment might cost another couple of hundred million euro.  Any quantity surveyor, developer or construction expert of note to whom I have spoken has said that was a fatal mistake.  As a result, the main contractor and every subcontractor had the Government over a barrel for the additional &euro;500 million that ensued.  Can the Taoiseach give me some sense of this, being specific and precise?  I do not want to hear about the number of beds and the benefits, yakety yak.  I want to hear why the Minister made the decision to issue a planning contract on the basis of planning drawings rather than the drawings every expert I have spoken to says are needed to cost a hospital.  Why did that happen? <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021200009#G00600","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"speech","time":1549982700,"counter":51,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

The first was to cancel the project, leave &euro;250 million behind us and start all over again, thus potentially deferring the project for a generation.

One can go ahead and get the enabling works, the clearing works, the demolition and the underground works done and then have the second phase done.  An obvious downside is that while one knows for sure the cost of the first phase, one does not know for sure the cost of the second phase.  Even when one goes for a single-phase contract, and the same experts will tell the Deputy this if he asks them, that does not preclude the fact that the developers can come in with claims after the fact.  We see plenty of examples of contracts which were done differently, as a single tender with a single price amount and at the end of the job, the developer came in with additional claims because X, Y or Z was underestimated.  It is not necessarily the case that had the alternative approach been followed we would not have found these additional costs arising anyway.  They just would not have crystalised yet.

I would appreciate it if the Taoiseach could confirm if that is the case and, if so, what is the cost to the public because in terms of the basic architectural works done in the initial first drawings, when the project cost goes up &euro;500 million one gets another &euro;10 million, &euro;20 million, &euro;30 million or &euro;40 million.  Is that the case?  Has the Taoiseach worked out whether that happened?

There are memorandums from September, October and November and more memorandums from the Government.  We have the Department of Health report on Department of Public Expenditure and Reform communications in October and November 2018, summary of timeline of escalation of costs, and the AECOM cost benchmarking report.

The public tender process in Ireland is governed by Directive 2014\/24\/EU, on public procurement.  Article 72 of that directive makes it clear that a new procurement procedure, that is, a new tendering process, is required if the provisions of a public contract are modified during the term of that contract.  What constitutes modification, including price increases, is set out.  Some modifications are permitted if they are provided for \"in clear, precise and unequivocal review clauses\".  If, however, the modifications relate to \"additional works, services or supplies\" that are \"not included in the initial procurement\", any increase in price must not exceed 50% of the value of the original contract.

Residents are living in fear and there does not appear to be strong Garda visibility.

There is nowhere in the world where a once-off report and the ongoing implementation of that report has delivered sustained regeneration.  What works is a systematic and ongoing process of local engagement, shared planning between State agencies and ongoing planning.<\/p>  <p>  Last month, Deputy Curran asked the Minister for Rural and Community Development, Deputy Ring, why the Government is refusing to adopt an approach of systematically targeting concentrated disadvantage.  There has been a huge drop-off in the kind of co-ordinated approach that existed a decade ago.  The reply that Deputy Curran received was an example of a Government which is mainly focused on the number of projects Ministers can announce, rather than on having a real impact.  The approach is to distribute funding in a much broader way, devolving some to the local authorities but most into the hands of the Minister.  This has led directly to a reduction in the funding being given to the communities most in need.  The joint planning approach of State services in disadvantaged communities has been pushed to the side as well.  The spirit of the revitalising areas by planning, investment and development, RAPID, programme has been well and truly buried.  <\/p>  <p>  I ask the Taoiseach to commission a short report on the impact of moving from a development approach focused on the most disadvantaged communities to one which is far more scattered.  Does the Taoiseach agree that the approach in the north inner city that he was praising should be followed elsewhere?

A five year old child was bitten by a rat recently.  I spoke to Ms Brien this morning and asked her if the protest has had any impact.  The council had promised to address the issue but she told me that nothing has happened and that the rat infestation continues.  I heard a person who had lived in the tenement houses on Henrietta Street on the radio recently, as part of the centenary celebrations.  He was talking about what Dublin was like back then and in terms of the terrible aspects of living in the tenements 100 years ago, the biggest issue was rats.  Today, we still have rat infestations and even when the residents of inner city communities protest at Dublin City Council offices, nothing is done.  They fear that the failure to address the neglect of their areas is linked to an agenda to drive the local community out and to socially cleanse the inner city.  Huge numbers of the Dominick Street and Dorset Street flats are lying empty.  Mr. Brendan Kenny from Dublin City Council said recently that there would be no more public housing in the inner city and that all social housing will be in places like Coolock and Ballymun.  The fear of the inner city communities is that the neglect is deliberate.  They believe their communities are being run down and issues like rat infestation are not being addressed because the agenda is to destroy their communities and to push them out.

It was a really important initiative of the Taoiseach's predecessor, Deputy Enda Kenny.  However, there are some concerns about the initiative.

I ask the Taoiseach to confirm that the additional allocation, which brings funding up from &euro;2 million to &euro;5.5 million, that was announced with some fanfare last October will be spent and that the projects earmarked for 2019 will go ahead as planned.  When will the community hub in Rutland Street school be up and running?  Does the Taoiseach plan to put this initiative on a statutory footing?  We have asked about this previously because it would give great reassurance to the local community.  Are the plans to develop Aldborough House going ahead?

I note the Deputies' comments and will respond to their direct questions.  Deputy Ellis asked about the Magdalen laundry site.  As Deputies will be aware, Dublin City Council voted against the sale of the former convent and laundry on Sean MacDermott Street.  The proposed plans were for the development of a hotel and social housing units for older people on the site.  In that context, it is not entirely correct to say that the council has no plans for social housing in the area.  The council actually did have plans but they were voted down by the city councillors in this particular instance.  Sadly, that is happening more and more all over Dublin.  There were also plans for a suitable memorial to the Magdalen women, which would have brought investment and footfall to the area.  There are, of course, a lot of understandable sensitivities around the site, given its former use but I am hopeful that the land will be developed for the benefit of the area and the residents, while respecting the difficult history of the location.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin raised the issue of local community development and I acknowledge that he has raised this issue on many occasions in the past.  There are lots of ways to deliver local community development.  My constituency has quite a number of pockets of deep disadvantage, as does the Deputy's.  Sometimes community development is done through vehicles like local drugs task forces and the DEIS programme in education, which most people will acknowledge has improved education outcomes for children from disadvantaged backgrounds.  The CL&Aacute;R programme for depopulated rural areas is important, as is the use of local community development committees, LCDCs, as a vehicle for the delivery of local community development.  It is too soon to judge whether the north east inner city model is one that should be followed and replicated in the future.  No one would question the excellent work that has been done by the group in recent years but ultimately any appraisal has to be based on outcomes.  We would have to take one or two similar areas around the country and compare the outcomes there with the outcomes in the north east inner city to assess whether all of the good work and investment has actually led to an improvement in measurable outcomes.  It will take a couple of years before we can know that for sure.  We need to make a distinction between good work and good outcomes because they can be quite different.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of the politicisation of Government grants, I do not accept that criticism.  Any grants that are announced by the Government must be applied for and there is an appraisal and evaluation system in operation.  Often there is a scoring system too and then the Minister announces the successful grantees.  Then a flurry of freedom of information requests are submitted to make sure that there was no political interference in the process and I am assured that it is not the case.  <\/p>  <p>  When I was the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport I was very involved, along with the then Minister of State, Deputy Ring, in changing the sports capital programme so that it was less political and had a proper scoring system.  <\/p><p>Each county got an amount of money relative to the number of people living in that county rather than where the Minister might be from.  Those criteria have been retained for the sports capital grants by subsequent Ministers.  <\/p> <p> I am sorry to hear about the condition of some of the social housing around Dorset Street, as mentioned by Deputy Boyd Barrett.  I know that area well for lots of different reasons.

That being so, will he list the Independent Deputies who have been assisted by his Department's liaison unit in regard to matters dealt with by other Departments?  If not, will he explain why not?<\/p>  <p>  Last Tuesday, the Taoiseach outlined the political staff who report to him.  I understand that in his eagerness to claim to have fewer staff than his predecessor he made an error and that he in particular failed to note the one staff member is a seconded civil servant and, therefore, is in a different position.  The Taoiseach also stated that the Independents in government are serviced by their own political staff and three people in the Department of the Taoiseach who hold the titles, deputy government press secretary for the Independent Alliance, chief strategist for the Independent Alliance and political co-ordinator for the Independent Alliance.  Their role is to co-ordinate the work of one Cabinet Minister and four Ministers of State.  The Independent Alliance currently has no backbenchers and so has no need to co-ordinate with a parliamentary party.  Smaller groups and parties in government also always receive disproportionate support but is this not more than a bit excessive, particularly given that their ministerial staffing is in addition to this staff?  Will the Taoiseach outline the process he went through in determining why this is a proportionate level of support in his Department for the Independent Alliance?  <\/p>  <p>  In regard to the other Independent groupings, the Taoiseach indicated previously in the House that he has a number of channels of communication with, for example, the Rural Independent Group.  My understanding is that Deputy Harty is the point of contact for the Taoiseach and the Government with the Rural Independent Group on specific issues.  Can the Taoiseach confirm this and can he indicate whether there is a specific arrangement with Deputy Lowry in terms of particular issues that occur in his constituency because there is always a tremendous degree of coincidence around issues raised in the House and prepared replies pertaining to initiatives in that Deputy's constituency?

For example, they face discriminatory and costly motor insurance premiums.  In recent times, I have been dealing with cases on behalf of returning emigrants who have been quoted exorbitant car insurance prices.  This is ridiculous.  These obstacles will not encourage people to return to Ireland.  Rather, they will be another reason not to do so.  This matter needs to be urgently rectified if we are to encourage emigrants with much sought after skills to return home.

In terms of the PLU, the make-up of the current D&aacute;il and the new procedures that have come into place as a result of D&aacute;il reform have resulted in Government conducting its business in a very different way.  They have also resulted in an increased workload for Government Departments, particularly with regard to the volume of Private Members' Business.  <\/p>  <p>  The PLU was set up to perform a liaison function to help ensure that Ministers and Departments are properly informed of new responsibilities and procedures in the Thirty-second D&aacute;il.  One of the main functions of the unit is to provide assistance to Ministers and their Departments on Oireachtas matters with particular emphasis on assisting Departments with Private Members' business.  The proportion of Private Members' legislation in the Oireachtas has increased significantly and Departments' engagement on Private Members' legislation has also had to change.  The Government's engagement with this process has also had to change so the unit provides Departments with detailed information on the rules and procedures with regard to Private Members' business.  It also provides real-time information on the progress of Private Members' Bills through the D&aacute;il and Seanad.  <\/p>  <p>  The unit will be working with Departments to ensure the Government plays its part in implementing the memorandum of understanding between Government and D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on Private Members' Bills.  It also raises awareness of D&aacute;il reform and new responsibilities of Departments by holding meetings with the Departments.  It liaises on a regular basis with advisers to ensure they are informed about Oireachtas issues and assists them in engaging with the new process arising from D&aacute;il reform.  In this regard, the unit provides detailed information on upcoming matters in the D&aacute;il and Seanad and highlights any new Oireachtas reform issues.  <\/p>  <p>  The unit was established to perform a liaison function to help ensure that Ministers and Departments are properly informed of the new responsibilities and procedures in the Thirty-second D&aacute;il.  In this regard, the main focus of the unit is to liaise with Departments and advisers on Oireachtas matters, with a particular emphasis on assisting Departments with Private Members' business.  In performing its functions, the unit is happy to engage with any Member of the Oireachtas, where appropriate.  It is not the function of the unit to ensure the support of Deputies in the House.  That is a political function.  The unit is there to provide factual information on D&aacute;il and Seanad issues and D&aacute;il reform.  The unit primarily assists Departments and advisers on Oireachtas matters.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021200020#S00600","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Taoiseach's Meetings and Engagements","time":1549989000,"counter":245,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021200020#S00650"},{"type":"question","time":1549989000,"counter":246,"qnumday":7,"qnumall":"[4209\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021200020#S00700","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he will report on his most recent contacts with the President of the European Council and the President of the European Commission.

All of my counterparts assured me of their full commitment to the withdrawal agreement, including the protocol on Ireland within which is contained the backstop, and their view that it cannot be renegotiated.  Other EU issues also arose in our conversations.  <\/p>  <p>  Most recently, I travelled to Brussels last Wednesday for a series of meetings with European Council President Donald Tusk, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, chief EU negotiator Michel Barnier and his deputy, Sabine Weyand, and the chair of the European Parliament Brexit steering group, Guy Verhofstadt, as well as Commissioner Phil Hogan.  I also spoke by telephone with the President of the European Parliament, Antonio Tajani.  <\/p>  <p>  President Tusk and I discussed the latest political developments in London and noted the approaching deadline for the UK's departure from the EU.  We agreed that the withdrawal agreement is the best deal possible and that it cannot be reopened.  While we hope that the backstop will never be used, it is needed as a legal guarantee to ensure there is no return to a hard border on the island of Ireland, while protecting the integrity of the Single Market and the customs union.  In my meeting with President Juncker, he restated his firm view that the withdrawal agreement, including the backstop, should not be renegotiated.  We agreed that while on the EU side, we will continue to seek agreement on the orderly withdrawal of the UK, given the ongoing uncertainty in London we will also further intensify our preparations for a no-deal scenario.  <\/p>  <p>  President Juncker confirmed that the Commission stands ready to assist Ireland in meeting the specific challenges we face as a result of Brexit, particularly in very vulnerable sectors such as agriculture, agrifood, fisheries and small exporters.  He also confirmed that programmes providing assistance for cross-Border peace and reconciliation will be strengthened, not diminished.  We agreed that Ireland and the Commission will continue to work closely together over the period ahead.  A number of other issues also arose in my meeting with President Juncker, including the free trade agreement between the EU and Japan and the situation in Venezuela.  <\/p>  <p>  Both President Tajani and Guy Verhofstadt, MEP confirmed to me that the European Parliament is committed to protecting peace and stability on the island of Ireland and that it wishes to emphasise and remind people that any withdrawal agreement must be approved by the European Parliament as well as Westminster.  I thanked all my colleagues for their strong commitment and noted that as a small country, this strong solidarity resonates deeply in Ireland and other small countries.  <\/p>  <p>  I engage regularly with Prime Minister May.  Most recently, I met with her over dinner in Dublin last Friday and we briefed each other on our respective engagements in Belfast and Brussels earlier that week.  We discussed developments in Northern Ireland and our shared interest in seeing the devolved institutions restored.  I reiterated our wish to see the withdrawal agreement ratified in order that negotiations on a close, ambitious and comprehensive relationship between the EU and the UK can start immediately.  Other EU and international engagements are envisaged in the period ahead.  I will be happy to inform the House of these in due course.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021200020#S02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1549989000,"counter":263,"content":"<p>We have six speakers and we must give the Taoiseach an opportunity to reply.

She is supposedly going to tell MPs to hold tough.  It is vital that the Taoiseach stands firm in the face of this last-ditch attempt by the British Government to renegotiate the backstop.  It is our only insurance policy to prevent a hard border on this island and it is supported by the majority of citizens, businesses and other key sectors across the entire island.  Any retreat would jeopardise Irish interests, the peace process and the Good Friday Agreement.  With the exception of the unionist parties, there is political consensus North and South on the need to protect the backstop.  The actions of the British Government in seeking to ditch it are not only an act of bad faith but have made the prospect of a no-deal situation much more likely.  In the event a no-deal situation transpires, the Government must immediately begin preparing for a referendum on Irish unity.  A unity referendum is consistent with the Good Friday Agreement and, if passed, would see the entire island retain membership of the European Union.  It is a common sense alternative to a no-deal scenario.

Given we are likely to be the worst hit, can the Taoiseach explain why we are so far behind on this?  The Netherlands, which has just as complex a situation to deal with, has all its staffing in place and all its legislation is not only published but it will be law this month.<\/p>  <p>  In regard to the meetings with President Tusk, it is indeed a red herring that everyone keeps talking about whether Europe will stand by Ireland.  There is no doubt about this: if Ireland refuses to accept what is proposed by the UK, the EU will accept Ireland's refusal.  The far more important issue is whether Ireland will be ready to face any eventuality.  Last December the Taoiseach said that all firms that need to be prepared should be prepared by 29 March.

The Europe that proclaims itself as an upholder of human rights, democracy and so on is standing idly by while 12 people - many elected representatives or former Ministers of Catalonia - are today starting trial and facing up to 25 years in prison because they organised a referendum, which they won, for Catalonian independence.

There is not a hint of a chink that we may blink either in Europe or Dublin with regard to any fundamental change to the withdrawal agreement.

The first is a worrying possibility, given Prime Minister May is saying today in Westminster they should stall for more time and get closer to the edge, when the fear is they could go over the edge, which would be deeply damaging for everyone.  The second, which is a recent development, is that she could cross the House of Commons, take what is in Jeremy Corbyn's letter and agree some sort of arrangement which would provide for the UK to remain within the customs union and the Single Market in some form, even though that would go against her red lines.  The third is a second referendum.<\/p><p>With regard to the second possibility, if Jeremy Corbyn's approach was returned, it might give the DUP something it could swing behind in the sense it would not breach its red line of not infringing the UK single market or ours of infringing the EU Single Market.

This sector encompasses taxis, hackneys and limousine services and the regulatory framework applies to the vehicles, the drivers and the services to the travelling public that they provide.  The overall objective of the legislation and the regulatory framework is to protect the consumer interest and to uphold safety for passengers.  The rules do not limit the number of operators; rather, they concentrate on ensuring standards of safety and service that will benefit the public.<\/p>  <p>  The 2013 legislation and the NTA's subsequent implementation of it was informed by the Taxi Regulation Review Report that was published by the Government in January 2012.  Among its recommendations, the review suggested the introduction of a local area hackney licence so as to address transport deficits that would not otherwise be addressed in certain rural areas.<\/p>  <p>  The NTA made regulations permitting the issue of such licences with effect from December 2013.  The aim was to enable a special part-time hackney service to be provided in rural areas which are likely to be too small to support a full-time taxi or hackney operation and which are also too far away from adjacent centres to be serviced by normal taxis or hackneys from those adjacent centres.<\/p>  <p>  To address transport deficits in certain rural areas, the local area hackney licence continues to be offered by the NTA.  However, take-up has been low.  Despite the fact that the costs of a local area hackney licence are deliberately set low and some of the standards that must be met are lower than for a normal taxi or hackney operation, only a very small number of such licences are in use.  The NTA has looked at this and identified that one of the main deterrents to the take-up seems to be the cost to an operator of the insurance needed to cover carrying passengers for reward compared to the restricted nature of the part-time service that can be provided under the licence.<\/p>  <p>  The NTA is currently undertaking a review of key aspects of taxi, hackney and limousine operations with the intention of developing a five-year strategy for the entire small public service vehicle industry.  The strategy will guide regulatory development for the sector over that timeframe.  With the assistance and input of the advisory committee on small public service vehicles, the review is considering a variety of issues including vehicle licensing, vehicle standards, driver licensing, wheelchair accessible vehicles, fixed-payment offences and technological developments.  As part of its work, the review is looking at the matter of local area hackneys and the scope for improving their effectiveness in addressing rural connectivity gaps.<\/p>  <p>  The NTA plans to conduct a public consultation process in the first half of this year on the proposals emerging from the review process.  This will give the public and public representatives the opportunity to provide their views and to inform the outcome of the work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021200022#U03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"speech","time":1549990200,"counter":315,"content":"<p>As of June 2018, only ten local area hackney licences were issued nationally.

He is absolutely correct that 13 is a very disappointing number.  The uptake is low for two reasons, not just one.  The uptake is very low because of insurance.  As the Deputy knows, insurance is a big problem not just for taxis but for hackneys as well, despite the fact that there are extraordinary reductions and incentives for local area hackneys.  The vehicle licence fee is &euro;50, as opposed to &euro;170 for a new wheelchair-accessible hackney licence for one year; the driver licence fee is &euro;20 for three years, as opposed the cost of a small public service vehicle, SPSV, licence, which is &euro;250 for five years.  Moreover, there is no requirement to pass the general SPSV driver entry tests.  Nevertheless we do not seem to have cracked this problem and it persists.  Other reasons have been given.  A survey was done, as the Deputy will be aware, of those people who might work as hackney taxi drivers.  Respondents stated that the radius in which they had to work was also extremely limited.  In answer to the Deputy's question about the review of local hackneys, it is currently being undertaken as part of the strategic framework for the SPSV industry.

The date in 2019 is not settled but it will be as soon as possible.  I understand the urgency to which the Deputy refers.  He should not ignore the fact that there has been a large attempt to address the issue of rural isolation he mentioned through funding for new Local Link services.  The National Transport Authority, NTA, manages that programme.  Increased funding has been provided, with &euro;14.9 million allocated in 2018 and again in 2019.  In addition, public service obligation, PSO, funding has been provided for Local Link regular services, which amounts to &euro;4.5 million in 2018, bringing the total funding for Local Link services last year to &euro;19.5 million.  Total funding in 2019 will be almost &euro;20 million.  These represent significant increases.  There will be new Local Link services.  This increased funding has enabled the introduction of 66 new consumer services to the Local Link networks, operating five, six or seven days a week.  Key features of these new services include greater integration with existing public transport services and better linkage of services between and within towns and villages.  Two new regularly scheduled Local Link services are to be introduced in Carlow, Kilkenny and Wicklow.

While the Government remains of the view that the best and only way to ensure an orderly withdrawal of the UK from the EU, including avoiding the necessity for green cards, is the ratification of the withdrawal agreement reached between the EU and the UK, the Government recognises that it is prudent to plan for the possibility of a no-deal exit.  <\/p><p>The motor insurance industry is therefore behaving prudently in being prepared for the possibility that green cards will be required, even though this is not a desirable outcome.  In line with the current expected Brexit date of 29 March 2019, the Motor Insurers Bureau of Ireland, MIBI, has indicated that insurers and insurance brokers will begin issuing green cards to policyholders from March if no agreement has been reached between the UK and the EU on Brexit and the process has not been further delayed.  At that point anyone who plans on driving their Irish-registered vehicle in Northern Ireland or Britain should contact their insurer or insurance broker one month in advance of their expected travel date to ensure they receive their green card in sufficient time. <\/p><p>The MIBI has responsibility for the operation of the green card scheme in Ireland but individual insurance companies or brokers will issue them on its behalf.  The insurers and insurance brokers are commercially run organisations and are independent in the actions that they take.  The application processes involved are a matter for each individual company.

This is adversely affecting all bus routes, including express services which cannot avoid the congestion.  On a bad morning, if there is a breakdown or an accident, everything on the M1 just grinds to a halt.  The MetroLink is the best solution to this problem because it will reduce traffic on the roads, while also quickly moving more people to the airport, the Mater Misericordiae University Hospital and Dublin city centre.

Other locations of concern include Swords and O'Connell Street and whether the tunnel configuration would be twin or single bore.  On Ranelagh, the NTA has prepared and presented two proposals: bridge and cutting options, with more design work to be carried out on these options.  The proposed MetroLink station development in the Tara Street area has been identified by TII and the NTA as a key connection area, as it will provide interchange between MetroLink, DART and suburban services.  Various options have been explored by TII and the NTA and the preferred option identified would require the acquisition and demolition of the College Gate Apartments and other buildings in the area.

I acknowledge that it has gone down to 15.1 weeks.  The average waiting time in Cork is 17.9 weeks, with a longest waiting time of 24 weeks.  In Mallow, the average waiting time is 19.2 weeks while in Skibbereen it is 20.2 weeks.  There is a problem, regardless of whether the Minister cares to acknowledge it.<\/p><p>I am surprised that the Minister does not know how many additional staff the RSA has recruited.  It has recruited 52 but the Minister is unable to say how many additional staff that represents <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>people who retired and positions that have not been filled in previous years.  The simple fact is that despite the 52 who were recruited last year the problem with waiting times persists.  The Minister should introduce a mandatory maximum waiting time of the ten weeks the RSA has indicated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021200026#Y01400","speaker":"1250"},{"type":"speech","time":1549992600,"counter":370,"content":"<p>We are not far off it.

The Act provides for the regulation of the small public service vehicle, SPSV, sector, which includes taxis, hackneys and limousine services and is commonly referred to as the taxi industry.  Under the legislation, the regulation of the SPSV business is carried out by the National Transport Authority, NTA.<\/p><p>Ireland's regulatory regime is governed by recent modern legislation, which provides for licensing arrangements and industry standards and applies to vehicles, drivers, operators and the services provided for the travelling public.  The Act requires the licensing of vehicles and drivers involved in providing SPSV services.  However, it places no quantitative restriction on the number of licences that may be issued.  The objectives of the regulatory framework are to protect consumers and help ensure safety.<\/p><p>As Deputies are probably aware, the SPSV regulatory regime makes several requirements in the interests of passengers and the public generally.  Drivers must be Garda vetted and must demonstrate knowledge of industry standards and the areas in which they will work.  Vehicles must meet specific safety standards and appropriate insurance is required.  Services must be operated to an appropriate standard for passengers and fares must be charged within the regulated pricing system. <\/p><p>As I mentioned, the focus of the regulatory regime is to protect the consumer and help ensure personal safety.  These are vital objectives which must continue to be central to how the SPSV industry is operated and regulated.  Within that context, there is a need to evolve and be open to new technologies and innovation.  In that regard, there is now widespread use of technology in the SPSV industry, and such innovations are of benefit to consumers and operators. <\/p><p><i><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">  Additional information not given on the floor of the House<\/font><\/i><\/p><p>Over the past few years, there have been calls to change the regulatory system to allow the operation of certain taxi-type services that are not currently permitted.  As the Deputy mentioned, ride sharing has been suggested as an additional means of providing transport services in rural areas. <\/p><p>The taxi regulation review report published by the Government in January 2012 recommended the introduction of a local area hackney licence to address transport deficits that would not otherwise be addressed in certain rural areas.  Regulations permitting the issue of such licences were introduced with effect from December 2013 to enable a part-time hackney service to be provided in rural areas likely to be too small to support a full-time taxi or hackney operation and too far from adjacent centres to be serviced by taxis or hackneys therefrom.  The RSA continues to offer the local area hackney licence to address transport deficits in certain rural areas.  However, the number of active licences remains very low.  The NTA has advised my Department that the principal deterrent to the take-up of the licences seems to be the high cost of insurance for the carriage of passengers for reward.  A review of the position on local area hackneys is currently being undertaken by the NTA as part of the development of a strategy framework for the SPSV industry.  It is expected that the review will be completed in 2019.<\/p><p>As regards the specific issue of transport connectivity in rural Ireland, the Deputy will be aware that the NTA has responsibility for providing integrated local and rural transport.  This includes responsibility for the rural transport programme which now operates under the Local Link brand.  The number of services has been expanded in recent years and spending on the programme has increased substantially.  In recent months, the NTA has been conducting a pilot scheme to test evening and night-time services as part of the rural transport programme.  The pilot scheme was recently extended and future arrangements will be informed by an evaluation of its experience. <\/p><p>We must remain open to new possibilities.  However, the regulation of any public passenger service should continue to be determined in the context of the important safety and consumer objectives that underpin our existing legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021200027#Z00900","speaker":"1213"},{"type":"speech","time":1549993200,"counter":381,"content":"<p>I am all for proper regulation of the industry.

My question regards a proposal by Mytaxi to bring in a ride-share scheme.  If there is a big queue at a taxi rank late at night and one proposes sharing a taxi with another member of the queue, that is fine.  However, if these taxi app companies set up a ride-share scheme whereby three or four people who had not met would get into a taxi at different locations, problems may arise, particularly late at night.  Passengers would not know with whom they will be sharing the taxi nor how much alcohol their fellow passengers may have taken.  It may lead to fights over the division of fares and so on, with taxi drivers being left to manage such situations.<\/p>  <p>  Does the Minister welcome the proposal being put forward by some sections of the taxi industry?

First, I wish to explain that, as Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, I have responsibility for overall policy and funding in respect of the national roads programme.  However, under the Roads Acts 1993 to 2015, the planning, operation and development of individual road projects is a matter for the relevant road authority - that is, local authorities in whose functional areas road developments are situated - in the context of local and regional roads or Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, in conjunction with the local authorities concerned, regarding national roads.<\/p>  <p>  Consequently, it is an operational matter for a road authority and TII to give an account of how a project is progressing within their functional areas of responsibility.  However, following consultation, I can provide the following information and update to the Deputy on investment in primary routes in County Meath.<\/p>  <p>  The N2 Rath to Kilmoon roundabout scheme is included in Project Ireland 2040.  The scheme is being progressed through pre-appraisal and early planning.  This project, which relates to a section of road approximately 6 km long, will address the existing operational and safety problems on this part of the N2.  The expected benefits of the scheme will be to improve efficiency of traffic using the N2 corridor, improve safety and improve connectivity between Dublin and the north west.<\/p>  <p>  In 2018, TII provided an allocation of &euro;25,000 to Meath County Council to carry out the pre-appraisal plan for Rath to Kilmoon.  A further allocation of &euro;250,000 has been provided by TII in 2019 to allow the scheme to progress through planning and design.  TII has issued approval to Meath County Council to progress the procurement of technical advisers to commence the design of the scheme.  The procurement of technical advisers will take approximately three to four months.<\/p>  <p>  The traffic problems at Curragha are exacerbated by traffic which is trying to avoid the delays at Primatestown and also traffic heading to Tayto Park.  The Ashbourne municipal district engineer has been installing and maintaining signage at the junction as well as hedge cutting.  The transportation section of Meath County Council has also prepared a preliminary design to calm traffic and improve definition at the junction and safety on the approaches, including the R155 as it passes the residential properties and school through the village of Curragha itself.  My Department has made &euro;200,000 available to the council to progress this work in 2019 .<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021200029#BB00600","speaker":"1213"},{"type":"speech","time":1549994400,"counter":416,"content":"<p>The Minister will have an opportunity to come back in.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021200029#BB00700","speaker":"1342"},{"type":"speech","time":1549994400,"counter":417,"content":"<p>I might come back to it in a second.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021200029#BB00800","speaker":"1213"},{"type":"speech","time":1549994400,"counter":418,"content":"<p>What about the Slane bypass?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021200029#BB00900","speaker":"1225"},{"type":"speech","time":1549994400,"counter":419,"content":"<p>I will address the matter of  Slane bypass.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021200029#BB01000","speaker":"1213"},{"type":"speech","time":1549994400,"counter":420,"content":"<p>I will clarify the difficulty I have.

I would like to know specifically, in the context projects such as this which are listed for pre-appraisal under Project Ireland 2040, what that means.  My reading of Project Ireland 2040 is that not all of the projects listed will get approval.  Is that the case?  We are spending money on consultants now and, at some point, a list of about half of them will be picked for construction.  That is what a plain reading of that document suggests.  There are other projects in my constituency that are also on that list, particularly the project at Clonee.<\/p>  <p>  This is a major issue.  The Minister is aware of that because he has met residents of the area, councillors and me in respect of it.  People are at breaking point over the traffic there and it needs much more action.  Farther up the road is the Slane bypass and it is almost exactly seven years to the day since it was refused planning permission and we still are nowhere near another planning application being made.

In March 2012, An Bord Plean&aacute;la refused planning consent citing its concern that, having regard to the importance and sensitivity of the location, a bypass of the type proposed could only be considered where it had been demonstrated that no appropriate alternative was available.  Following additional studies, Meath County Council concluded that traffic management options were not viable alternatives to a bypass and an N2 bypass for Slane village was still required.

Technically, the port forms part of the Fishguard and Rosslare Railways and Harbours Company, which is a 19th century joint-venture company, consisting today of Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann on the Irish side and Stena Line on the Welsh side.<\/p>  <p>  The status of the port, and whether its current status potentially inhibits its development, was considered in a strategic review commissioned by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and carried out by Indecon Economic Consultants.  Its report concluded that the creation of an independent port authority would be extremely difficult, given the port's complex legal structure.  Instead, it was recommended that the port remain in public ownership and that the possibilities for increased private sector involvement be investigated.<\/p>  <p>  In order to assist Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann's overall consideration of how best to move forward, the company then engaged consultants to assess market interest.  The assessment was largely positive in terms of the potential for increased private sector investment in the port.  However, it did identify possible implementation issues due to the complicated legislative basis of the port.<\/p>  <p>  Following that assessment, the Department sought and received detailed advice from the Office of the Attorney General on the matter.  That advice identified a number of legal issues with any such proposal and those issues remain under consideration by the Department.<\/p>  <p>  I am satisfied that Rosslare Europort, as a division of Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, is effectively managing operations at the port and looking at the potential of the port to develop further and take advantage of any new opportunities.

No organisation is exempt from compliance with the regulations governing aviation security.<\/p>  <p>  New provisions are on the way at European level which will introduce additional aspects to the background checks carried out in civil aviation, including the use of security intelligence.  When these new EU measures come into effect, they will become part of the overall suite of security measures now applied at Irish airports, including the recently introduced enhanced screening measures, with the objective of improving security practices and security culture at our airports.<\/p><p> There has been a high level of engagement on the implementation of the new security enhancements introduced by my Department.  While there is always an element of adjustment and inconvenience to individuals, these new measures are in the broader public and national interest.  As threats and risk to civil aviation change over time, so too must the security response.  This requires those people charged with providing security to be flexible and innovative.  I have no intention, nor any desire, to interfere in softening any security measure that brings aviation security to a higher standard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021200030#CC01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1213","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1549995600,"counter":449,"content":"<p>I think the Minister will be revisiting this topic in the future.

This means ensuring steady state levels of investment in our rail infrastructure each year for the foreseeable future and requires a significant and recurring capital investment of around &euro;200 million from the taxpayer every year.  I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the funding I have secured under Project Ireland 2040 means that we are in a position to provide this steady state level of funding.  This is significant and very welcome progress.<\/p><p>In addition to this significant increase in funding to support the infrastructure, we have also been increasing the funding available to support expanded services across the country through the public service obligation, PSO, subsidy.  That subsidy amounts to around &euro;140 million each year and is paid in accordance with the public services contract that Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has entered into with the National Transport Authority, NTA.  We have improved the funding framework which, in turn, has allowed the NTA and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann to deliver an improved passenger experience.  Improvements to date include the introduction of ten minute DART services, peak-time DART services operated by six or eight car train sets only, additional off-peak capacity on the Kildare, Maynooth and Northern line services, increased usage of the Phoenix Park tunnel for Kildare line services, improved journey times on a number of key intercity routes and the roll-out of the city centre re-signalling project, which will improve train movements, thereby providing improved passenger capacity across the network.  These are all immediate measures but there are other medium-term and longer-term measures required and key to these is the provision of additional rail fleet.  DART expansion will transform the rail fleet in the greater Dublin area in the coming years but prior to that, the NTA and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann are exploring ways to secure additional fleet.

If this process proves successful, it could provide a quick win boost to rail capacity on key commuter routes.

She is now in her second year of college and many of the issues at the school are probably as bad as they were when she was a pupil, if not considerably worse.  Just before Christmas I received a letter from transition year students who are taking a particular interest in this issue.  In their letter, they describe how several classrooms do not have any windows and that several windows in the school leak in bad weather, which has damaged student work and ICT equipment.  They say that the roof leaks in wet weather, creating pools of water on the floor which is a health and safety risk.  There are problems with ventilation in parts of the school which limits work in the science lab and home economics kitchens.  Some classes do not have access to emergency exits, which is not in line with safety regulations.  There is not enough space to accommodate 660 people and there is no Wi-Fi in the classrooms, which affects teaching and learning.  This is a school in Dublin in 2019.  It is a DEIS school, which means it is supposed to have extra resources and benefits.<\/p>  <p>  When I raised some of these issues with the Minister for Education and Skills previously, I was utterly shocked to hear that the Department was \"unaware of the scale\" the problems in the school.  Subsequent to that, students posted pictures of vegetation growing inside some of the classrooms online.  Even then, the response of the Minister was that it was not possible to say when the project would proceed to tender, at least until the pre-qualification process has been completed.  The problem with that is that this project was initiated in 2010.  In 2015, after a few years of delay, planning permission was granted.  There were certain delays due to fire safety and ESB issues but these issues were overcome more than two years ago.  The project was expected to go to tender then and it was expected that work would begin shortly thereafter.  A whole year and a half went by and there was no progress.  Now we have a limbo situation.  In September 2018, the ETB was asked what stage the project was at and what was going on.  The school was told that the project was at the pre-qualification stage, for the appointment of contractors.  This had been sent into the Department and had been returned with no explanation.  I want to know who was responsible for that.  We cannot have the two sides saying completely different things but that is what is happening.<\/p>  <p>  In January 2019 there was still no movement.  It appears from the Minister's response to me that the Department is using the pre-qualification process as an excuse not to proceed with the development.  The ETB is saying that the pre-qualification process has been completed and is with the Department but the Minister is saying that it is with the ETB.  They cannot both be right.  The manager of buildings in the ETB communicated with the school principal and said that the ETB had completed the documentation and sent it to the Department for approval to go to tender in December 2016.  The Department sent that documentation back, stating that it was to be \"pre-qualified\".  The ETB wrote back and asked the Department what it wanted but nothing further happened.  This is beginning to make the children's hospital project look well managed.  I just do not get it.  The answer we seem to be getting to all the questions we submit on education is that projects fall down between the council and the Department or the Department and the ETB.  Somebody, somewhere has to do something.  This project is more than nine years old and the planning permission for it will expire in the next year if it does not progress.  New schools are being promised left, right and centre in locations nearby and meanwhile, hundreds of children are in this school in appalling conditions in Dublin, in 2019.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021200032#EE01300","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"speech","time":1549996200,"counter":477,"content":"<p>I am taking this matter on behalf of the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy McHugh, who is in the Seanad at present.

Responsibility for delivering the project has been devolved to the Dublin and D&uacute;n Laoghaire Education and Training Board, DDLETB.  A service level agreement, SLA, is in place between the Department and Dublin and D&uacute;n Laoghaire ETB in respect of this project.  This agreement outlines the roles and responsibilities of each of the parties in the delivery of education projects.  It is a central tenet of devolution that responsibility for the delivery of these projects within certain agreed parameters as laid down in the SLA rests with Dublin and D&uacute;n Laoghaire ETB.  In this respect, Dublin and D&uacute;n Laoghaire ETB has appointed a design team to design the accommodation being provided and to bring the project through the tender and construction phases.<\/p> <p> The detailed design stage for St. Finian's community college project is almost complete.

I am pleased to inform the Deputy that these issues have been worked through and Dublin and D&uacute;n Laoghaire ETB is now proceeding with its prequalification process.  Once this process is complete, the project will move to the next stage.  This involves the preparation and issue of tender documents and the appointment of contractors to complete the project.

I am supposed to accept a response that says not to blame the Department, that it is the fault of the ETB because of the service legal agreement.  If that is true, who will make it pay for the debacle, which is what this is?  If it is the fault of the ETB, someone has to be held to account.  The Minister of State said the detailed design is almost complete.  I am sorry but I cannot celebrate because the design team started in February 2013 and the final design proposal was completed two years later in 2015.  For me to be told in 2019 that it is nearly complete is no solace at all, it is a cause for great concern.<\/p>  <p>  We are told that the prequalification process is at issue but the ETB says it did its bit in that regard in 2016.  Why is this process still outstanding?  Whose fault is it that this is still outstanding?  If it was doing this back in 2016, how can I be assured that it is finally sorted?  The Minister of State might shed some light on the other issues that have arisen because, again, that is a problem as well.  Nine years after this was given the nod, there are other issues coming to the fore.  Based on all of the stages outlined by the Minister of State in terms of tenders, contractors and so on it will be another two years before anything will even start.  That cannot be allowed.  Entire generations will be going through this school.  There are children there now whose parents and grandparents have been through it in almost the same condition.  I cannot accept that without somebody being held accountable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021200033#FF00300","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"speech","time":1549996800,"counter":481,"content":"<p>I will try to answer the Deputy's final question first.  There were design issues which need to be considered.  This requires the design team to review the project to ensure compliance with new regulations, namely the near-zero energy building regulations.<\/p>  <p>  Dublin and D&uacute;n Laoghaire ETB carried out a prequalification process at an earlier stage of the project.  However, for a number of reasons, primarily of a legal nature, it has been decided to proceed with a fresh prequalification process.  When Dublin and D&uacute;n Laoghaire ETB and its design team have completed the tender process, a tender report will be submitted to the Department with a recommendation for the award of the construction contract to the most economically advantageous tender submitted.  The Department will examine the tender report and accompanying recommendation, following which the intention is that a contract will be awarded with a contractor moving onto site shortly thereafter.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister, Deputy McHugh, wants to give assurances that the Department is committed to progressing this project as quickly as possible and to confirm that funding has been set aside to progress the building.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021200033#FF00400","speaker":"1247"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Technological Universities","time":1549996800,"counter":482,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021200033#FF00500"},{"type":"speech","time":1549996800,"counter":483,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor, for coming to the House for this debate.  The Minister of State will appreciate that for the south east not having a university is not an ideal.  The facts speak for themselves.  The south east has higher levels of unemployment and lower levels of educational attainment.  There is no one reason for this but it is argued by academics, stakeholders and policy makers that not having a university has played its part in those figures, which are not good for the region.  We need a university in the south east that puts us on a level playing field with all the other regions.  I am supporter of the technological university of the south east.  It is the best fit for the south east and for businesses, people and students.<\/p>  <p>  In the south east we have an airport with no commercial flights.  We have two institutes of technology but no university.  We are always demanding of the Government that it give us the resources we need as of right.  A university is a perfect example of that.  What we need for the south east is not just the pegging together of Carlow and Waterford institutes of technology.  We have to look at this as the opportunity to build a new world class university of international standing.  This will only happen if resources and capacity are put in place.  We need to increase the footprint of the campuses of Waterford and Carlow.  In my view, the headquarters of the new university needs to be in the economic engine of the south east, its capital, namely Waterford.  I know a change management strategy is being worked on by both institutes but I am concerned that the process for the south east is well behind other consortiums.  Does the Minister of State, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor, share that concern?  How do we transition from where we are now with two institutes of technology to a university of international standing that can be on par with existing universities and can create the level playing field for people and businesses in the south east?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021200033#FF00600","speaker":"1258"}]
