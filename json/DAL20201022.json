Government has supported this commitment with funding in our first budget to make sure this priority is delivered in 2021.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the new statutory parole board will considerably improve the system as it currently operates.  The Parole Act 2019 puts the parole board on an independent statutory footing and sets out clear and transparent criteria for how the board will reach its decisions, which will be independent of the Minister of the day.  This includes what factors will be taken into account in making those decisions, who may make submissions, which includes the victim&rsquo;s right to make a formal submission to the board, as well as a number of other details.<\/p>  <p>  The Act also increases the length of the sentence which must be served by life sentenced prisoners before they are eligible to be considered for parole.<\/p>  <p>  The move from the current model to the model set out in the 2019 Act is complex and a significant amount of planning is required to allow for its establishment.  For example, substantial preparatory work is needed to analyse and document the new legal processes that will give effect to the provisions of the Act.  The Deputy will appreciate this is essential to reduce the risk of successful judicial reviews by those who may be impacted.<\/p>  <p>  There are also a number of practical steps required before it will be possible to commence the Act and establish the parole board.  These include the selection of the board members, the appointment of a chief executive and of staff, and securing an appropriate premises for the new body.  A project board has been established in my Department to drive forward and carry out this important work and ensure that all necessary arrangements are made as soon as possible.<\/p>  <p>  Budget 2021 has provided a significantly increased funding allocation of &euro;1.3 million to allow the project board to take forward its work and move us from planning to the implementation phase of the 2019 Act.  To support this work further, additional staff have been assigned to implement this project on a priority basis, in addition to the seven existing Parole Board staff who will continue to support the existing board.<\/p>  <p>  A critical path for delivery of this significant priority project is currently being developed with a view to ensuring full commencement of the Parole Act, which I believe will be achieved in 2021.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102200003#A00600","speaker":"1502"},{"type":"speech","time":1603353600,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I appreciate that work is being done on this but it is quite ironic that the Minister's answer is almost identical to the answer her predecessor gave more than one year ago on the work that had to be done, that the board had to be set up, that a chief executive had to be put in place, there were technical issues to be dealt with, funding had to be put in place and so on.  At the same time, people who are the victims of very serious crime are fearful that the perpetrators who caused huge damage and destroyed their lives are eligible for parole, in many cases after seven years, and they have big issues and concerns around all of that.  Having passed the Act through the Houses with the issues recognised and with determination to change things, one would have expected it was a priority and the legislation would be put into place much faster.  A sense of urgency around this really needs to be brought to bear.  While the Minister has said 2021, it is another whole year away in the view of those people who are sitting and waiting.  They are very anxious that the perpetrators of serious crime against them could apply for parole under the current system.

The fees charged in respect of applications for a certificate of naturalisation are governed by the provisions of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Regulations 2011.  The fee is charged in two parts.  The current application fee is &euro;175, payable when an application for naturalisation is lodged, in addition to which is a certification fee, payable when a certificate of naturalisation issues.  The standard certification fee is set at &euro;950, while a reduced fee of &euro;200 applies in the case of an application made on behalf of a minor or in certain cases where the application is made by a widow, widower or surviving civil partner of an Irish citizen.  In the case of recognised refugees and stateless persons, there is no certification fee.<\/p>  <p>  There is no provision for the discretionary waiver or reduction of fees or for different fees to be applied.  I am informed that the introduction of the application fee had an immediate positive effect on the quality and completeness of applications, which is ultimately to the benefit of applicants.  All of the fees payable under the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended, are kept under ongoing review by the Department.  There are, however, currently no plans to amend the fees.<\/p>  <p>  The standard fees payable by an applicant are designed to reflect the effort and cost involved in processing applications for a certificate of naturalisation which, given the benefits involved, is quite a detailed process.  The Deputy will be aware that formal citizenship ceremonies were introduced almost ten years ago.  These have been universally well-received by participants as the ceremonies provide a sense of dignity and a celebratory occasion that serves to underscore the importance to both the State and the applicant of the grant of Irish citizenship.  Covid-19 has, unfortunately, prevented the holding of our large-scale citizenship ceremonies, which is impacting the processing of applications.  The Minister, Deputy McEntee, was, therefore, pleased to recently approve a solution to replace the ceremonies with a sworn affidavit on an interim basis.  This will enable approximately 3,000 applicants to be granted citizenship in the very near future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102200004#B00200","speaker":"1618"},{"type":"speech","time":1603354200,"counter":20,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his answer.

Many of these people are married to Irish citizens and have been living here for a long time.  When they seek citizenship, they expect the fee to be reasonable and affordable.

She visited Ballymun and Finglas in my constituency several years ago to talk to us about \"Fagin's law\", her Bill on the recruitment of children to engage in criminal activity.  While she had been inspired by a father inducing a child to steal from a changing room at a local match, the application of the concept in my constituency was important.  We have seen young people being induced into crime.  They are given small incentives first, such as a curry tray or something else from the chipper, then a pair of runners and then a track suit.  These children are being brought into the drugs industry, which is a lucrative one and difficult to compete with as a PAYE worker.  Young people see this disparity and look at the options.  We need, therefore, to make interventions and criminalise adults who induce these children to commit crimes.  I ask the Minister of State to go further.

We must also have the correct interventions in place to support those young children, divert them from criminal activity and ensure they have the supports required.  A number of processes are under way in that regard.  The Greentown report on the influence of criminal networks on children in Ireland was produced by the research evidence into policy, programmes and practice project team in the school of law at UL.  Some &euro;4.2 million has been allocated to this area over three years for investment to support that programme and other pilot projects.  Work is also ongoing on the youth justice strategy, which I expect will be published before Christmas.  That is concerned with extending programmes, such as the Garda youth diversion programme, and bringing in other Departments and services to ensure that young children who are being groomed for a crime are diverted and have the supports they need to take alternative routes for their own protection.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102200005#C01000","speaker":"1618"},{"type":"speech","time":1603354800,"counter":40,"content":"<p>I look forward to working with that review.

The transfer of functions, therefore, has already taken place.  I should clarify, however, that\u00a0issues such as\u00a0access to education, public services and employment\u00a0were not\u00a0the direct\u00a0responsibility of my Department before the transfer of functions and they are not the responsibility of my Department following the transfer of functions.<\/p> <p>Issues relating to access can be taken up with the Department or agency which has responsibility for providing the service.  Of course, a whole-of-government approach is warranted to address the needs of diverse groups and to ensure their equal participation in Irish society.  As the Deputy will also be aware, there is a migrant integration strategy in place.  Responsibility for this has transferred to the new Department and its implementation will continue to be an absolute priority for my colleague, the Minister with responsibility for children, equality, disability, integration and youth, Deputy O'Gorman, in his new remit in that Department.<\/p> <p> Access to these services on the same basis as EEA nationals can be achieved through acquiring Irish citizenship.  A minor or young person who has been in the State for five years and who otherwise satisfies the criteria of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956 can apply for citizenship through the naturalisation process. <\/p> <p> The Government is committed to creating new pathways for long-term undocumented people and their dependants who meet specified criteria to regularise their status within 18 months of the formation of the Government, bearing in mind European Union and common travel area commitments.  This commitment was made in the programme for Government and I intend to follow through on it as Minister.  The Government is acutely aware that a number of Irish people face similar challenges abroad and we all know people who are living in the same circumstances in America or other countries and have not been able to go home to see family or friends.  This is something we are actively trying to progress outside Ireland as well.  I am sympathetic to the circumstances of people who, through no fault of their own, can find themselves in an undocumented position here in Ireland.  I am glad to inform the Deputy that the necessary work on this process, in line with the Government commitment, is under way in my Department.  This will include an assessment of international best practice and previous regularisation schemes, such as the 2018 student scheme and earlier such schemes, will also be considered in any future policy decisions.  I am open to exploring all legal solutions to the issue of children and young people who have grown up here in circumstances where they or their family are undocumented. <\/p> <p> My Department has ongoing engagement on this matter with the Migrant Rights Centre Ireland, MRCI, and other NGOs.  I welcome the publication last week of the Live Here, Work Here, Belong Here survey by the MRCI of over 1,000 people who are undocumented.  What is most striking in the survey is that these people want the same things, including the same access to the same rights, the same ability to educate themselves and their families, to be able to work and to have a sense of security in the country in which many of them have been living for many years.  Through this piece of work, their insights will help provide valuable input into my Department&rsquo;s policy formulation.  I look forward to continued engagement with the MRCI and other organisations over the coming months as my officials and I work to deliver the programme for Government commitment. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102200005#C02000","speaker":"1502","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1603355400,"counter":48,"content":"<p>I want to focus on a particular issue.

Among the changes made was to remove those who offer their services as a prostitute from the existing offences of soliciting.  This allows people working in prostitution to provide information to the Garda on, for example, violence towards them by clients, without risking prosecution for selling sexual services.  The Act also introduced two new offences - paying for sexual activity with a prostitute and paying for sexual activity with a trafficked person - and it increased the existing penalty for brothel keeping.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding a review of the effects of the 2017 legislation, the Act provides for a review three years after its commencement.  In July, I commissioned an independent expert, Ms Maura Butler, to undertake the review.  Deputy Connolly asked for a timeline.  I do not have a timeline, but Ms Butler is working on it and will have it concluded as soon as possible.  The review will examine whether the changes made are, in practice, operating as intended and are offering additional protection to those that are most vulnerable.  It will assess the impact of Part 4 on the safety and well-being of persons engaged in sexual activity for payment and it will consider if further measures are needed to strengthen these protections.  In addition, it will quantify the number of arrests and convictions in respect of offences under Part 4.  The review is well under way and an online public consultation was open up to mid-September, which is very welcome.  I understand that contributions were received from a broad range of organisations with different perspectives. <\/p>  <p>  Regarding the second part of the Deputy&rsquo;s question, I am informed by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that since the commencement of the relevant legislative provisions on 27 March 2017 there have been 60 reported incidents of brothel keeping up to 15 October 2020.  Of the 37 suspects associated with these incidents, 31 were female and six were male.  To date, 20 have been charged or summoned in respect of these offences, 17 of whom are female and three are male.  The work of my Department in this area will continue to be guided by our primary aim of protecting the safety and well-being of the most vulnerable women here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102200008#F00500","speaker":"1502"},{"type":"speech","time":1603356600,"counter":69,"content":"<p>As usual, the questions are not answered.  Like Deputy Connolly, I believe not giving a date for the completion of the review is unsatisfactory.  If the law states that it must be conducted within three years, we should have a date for it.  I was recently involved in a students' union debate in University College Dublin, UCD, which included people who support the opposite position and who pushed for this legislation.  They do not support the Sex Workers Alliance Ireland, which organises to undermine them in many ways and is opposed to this review being completed.  That prompted my question.  Why do we not have a date for the review being completed?  Are there outside pressures on the Minister?  Are groups pushing for the review to not be conducted, which is their wish?<\/p>  <p>  I am also alarmed that 20 people have been charged with brothel keeping.  I tabled a parliamentary question some months ago asking how many purchasers of sex had been charged.  The reply said there were several files with the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, but there were no charges against the purchasers of sex at that time.

Was it two women, five or 20, or, indeed, was it somebody pimping them and in charge of their work?  The Minister will find, by and large, that it is two people working in the same space for their safety.  There are many questions to be asked.  It is important that we get the information on when the review will be complete and when we will have it, and on that cohort of very vulnerable people who are being charged for protecting and keeping themselves safe.

Is there a situation where many of these women are doing so under coercion or pressure and do not necessarily wish to be there?  Of the 60, only 17 have been charged.  The Garda will in every instance try to engage with people, including somebody who is suspected of keeping a brothel, to try to understand their situation and whether this is something they are happy to do or if they have been put under pressure.  At every stage there is an opportunity for the Garda to engage with these women to try to ascertain whether they are there of their own volition.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding those who work together, this question arose when the legislation was being passed.  There are concerns that if one decriminalises brothel keeping, it could create a loophole and, further, allow abuse by criminal gangs and others who wish to profit from prostitution.

As she will be aware, a retired judge, Gerard Haughton, is currently conducting a scoping exercise into the tragic circumstances surrounding Shane's death.  The judge furnished an interim report to my predecessor, Deputy Flanagan, last November and, following consultation between the judge with Shane's family and the Attorney General, the interim report was published on 17 December 2019.  In his interim report, the judge stated that he would not limit Shane's family in their submissions to him or the nature and extent of the documentation that they wished to furnish to him in the scoping exercise.<\/p>  <p>  My Department maintains regular contact with the judge and he has assured us that he will ask for any assistance that is required to complete the final report and we will of course make it available to him.

I assure the Deputy that it is of course open to the judge to make any recommendations that he sees fit in his final report and this includes the establishment of any form of statutory or non-statutory inquiry.  He is not precluded in any way from proposing that.

I remind the Minister - not that she needs reminding but for the record - that Shane O'Farrell was killed on 2 August 2011, so we are coming into the tenth year of the anniversary of his death.  The Minister and the House are aware of the efforts his family have gone through to get an inquiry and to get justice.  There are significant questions regarding what happened with the killer, his criminal record and the fact that he was at large when he probably should have been incarcerated.  There were many prison sentences attached to the list of breaches of legislation, in the North and in the South, of which he was found guilty.  For nine years, Lucia O'Farrell in particular and the rest of her family have been campaigning extremely hard.<\/p>  <p>  On 14 June 2018, this House passed a motion, tabled by a current member of a Government party, Deputy O'Callaghan, to demand an open public inquiry into the events leading up to Shane O'Farrell's death.  On 13 February, 2019 the Seanad did likewise.  The two Houses of the Oireachtas have called for this and we are still waiting.  We cannot keep hiding behind Covid.  A lot of work can be done online and we need to progress these matters.  If the Minister is giving a commitment that something will be produced by the judge by the end of the year, then we should all hold her to that.

The reason we have set out this scoping exercise first is to see whether a public inquiry would bring about those answers for the family.  I understand there have been many motions in the Houses, but until we have the answers to the current scoping exercise it is hard for me to say whether the judge will recommend an inquiry.  As a Minister in this Government, I wish to be clear that we do not object to an inquiry if that is what is recommended in the report, but it is important that we see the report first.  The most important point is that I hope we can get the answers this family want and that they can feel somewhat at peace because this has been a very challenging time, almost ten years as the Deputy pointed out.

It is a matter of public interest and not just personal interest to the family that we have an inquiry to find out exactly what happened because nine years ago it was Shane O'Farrell and it could be anybody else tomorrow.  There is a question regarding how this criminal was dealt with, why he was not incarcerated and what led to the events on that day, which took a young man's life and which took his family's basic existence away.  When we get the answers &ndash; the sooner we get them the better &ndash; they will probably lead to more questions about how the justice system works as opposed to answering those that have already been asked.  That is why it is important for everybody to see how the wheels of justice turn, rather than it just being confined to the O'Farrell family.

I share the concerns of Deputies across the House relating to knife crime.  We are all familiar with the problems that have emerged in neighbouring jurisdictions in this regard and the Government is determined to ensure similar problems do not develop here in Ireland.  Although the problem is not of a similar scale here, any stabbing incident can cause irreparable physical harm and have potentially tragic consequences.  That is why a comprehensive and robust legal framework is in place with respect to knife crime, including heavy penalties for breaches of the laws concerned.<\/p>  <p>  Under the provisions of the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, the maximum penalty for a conviction for possessing a knife in a public place without good reason or lawful authority was increased from one to five years.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also has an extended power of search without warrant for knives and offensive weapons.  I am advised a substantial number of convictions have been secured in the courts over the past number of years for possession of a knife or other similar article.<\/p>  <p>  As one might expect, statistics on seizures of knives by garda&iacute; from 2005 to 2019 indicate this is an issue primarily among younger people, with 44% of seizures relating to individuals from the ages of 12 to 23 and 65% to individuals under the age of 30.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is currently operating a reduction strategy for 2019 to 2021, which is targeted at tackling all types of assaults in public, including use of knives.  This strategy is informed by a pro-arrest, early investigation and proactive high-visibility approach.  It places particular emphasis on prevention, education and awareness.  The strategy promotes early prosecution of offenders where feasible and operationally appropriate.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also addresses knife crime through education and engagement with community initiatives.  At an operational level, garda&iacute; proactively target public disorder and antisocial behaviour, including knife-related crime, through the strategic deployment of Garda resources, and areas identified as public order hotspots by local Garda management are the subject of additional foot and mobile patrols.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102200011#J00500","speaker":"1618"},{"type":"speech","time":1603358400,"counter":107,"content":"<p>Last year, there were more than 140 seizures of knives, shivs and other such weapons in Cork, up from 130 the previous year.

The measures in Part 5 of this Act amend the Mental Health Acts, 2001 to 2018, specifically in respect of the role of independent consultant psychiatrists and the holding of mental health tribunals.  Mental health tribunals comprise a solicitor or barrister, who acts as chairperson, a consultant psychiatrist and a layperson.  Tribunals review the detention of every person involuntarily admitted and detained under the Mental Health Act 2001 within 21 days of admission and thereafter every three or six months.  The tribunal either affirms the order detaining the patient or refuses it, following which the patient is released.<\/p><p>The Mental Health Commission, the independent regulator of mental health services in the State, approached the Department of Health in March of this year to raise its concerns over the need to ensure that these tribunals continue and that each patient's right to a review of his or her case is protected.  In addition, there was a need to protect the health of both patients and healthcare staff and to ensure the potential for Covid-19 contamination was minimised.  Following detailed discussion with the Mental Health Commission and the HSE, the Department, in consultation with the Office of the Attorney General, introduced the measures to ensure that these tribunals could continue.<\/p><p>These measures provide for a cascading approach to the role of independent consultant psychiatrists and mental health tribunals.  This approach means that, where possible, the current system of review is conducted as normal.  In cases where this is not possible due to Covid-19, alternative measures are in place to protect the rights of the patient.  The measures allow a consultant psychiatrist conducting an independent examination of an involuntarily detained patient to do so remotely in scenarios where a personal examination cannot take place.  The measures also provide for mental health tribunals, the bodies which review the detention of every involuntary patient, to consist of the chairperson only if members cannot attend due to the spread of Covid-19.<\/p><p>The Mental Health Commission has been monitoring the implementation of the new measures.  While the current situation is not ideal, it has ensured that the rights of patients are upheld and that every patient has received his or her hearing.  As of this week no one-person tribunals have been required and the full complement of a legal professional, a consultant psychiatrist and a layperson has reviewed all involuntary detentions, either remotely or in person.  This, however, does not lessen the requirement to have these contingency measures in place since they may yet be required to protect the health of both patients and front-line healthcare staff.  Furthermore, other supports have been provided to patients to ensure their voices are heard during this period, including the additional involvement of interpreters and the use of videoconferencing for interactions with legal representatives and independent consultant psychiatrists.<\/p><p>When this legislation was introduced more than six months ago, no one could have predicted the terrible toll Covid-19 would take on our country.  As of last night, Ireland has recorded 53,422 cases and, sadly, 1,868 deaths.  The current epidemiological situation is alarming and this week, the Government has had to make the difficult decision to move the entire country to level 5 restrictions in the interest of public health.  Covid-19 remains a significant and serious threat to the health and welfare of all people.  Outbreaks of Covid-19 continue to occur in the community and in our hospitals, including in approved centres.  The measures temporarily amending the Mental Health Act 2001 must continue beyond 9 November as part of our efforts to protect our most vulnerable and our healthcare workers.  The proposal to extend the measures is supported by both the HSE and the Mental Health Commission.  I ask all Deputies to support the continuation of these measures in a timely manner.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102200012#K00400","speaker":"1614"},{"type":"speech","time":1603359000,"counter":121,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 1:<\/p> <blockquote> \tTo delete the words &lsquo;9th day of June, 2021&rsquo; and to substitute the words &lsquo;9th day of February, 2021&rsquo; therefor. <\/blockquote>  <p>We supported the original sunset clause for Part 5 of the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020.

Our amendment recommends extending the sunset clause to 9 June 2021.  We can come back to the Oireachtas and debate that further.  If it needs to be extended again, so be it.  As parliamentarians, we have to come here to have a proper debate on the reasons for this legislation.  I know that Covid-19 has changed the agenda throughout the country, but we cannot allow legislation to be changed indefinitely.  Another date must be named.  We cannot support the indefinite extension of the legislation.  I hope the Minister of State takes this on board. <\/p><p>I will raise a couple of other points while I have the opportunity.  We are in extremely difficult times and the landscape has changed due to Covid-19.  People have faced increased fear, anxiety and pressure on their mental health.  During the mental health debate last week, I raised the implementation of support bubbles for those in danger of isolation.  Isolation affects people living alone such as older people, single parents and parents of children with disabilities.  I am pleased that the recommendation has been taken on board.  This was a sensible decision.  However, another decision was made that will have a direct impact on people's mental and physical health.  When restrictions were introduced in April, people's mental health was one of the first things to be impacted.  We heard from numerous experts and mental health service providers about how people's well-being was adversely affected.  Gyms were closed, but people were able to exercise outdoors in the fine weather.<\/p> <p>The fine weather is gone and the dark nights are back.  When restrictions were eased, gyms could open so long as they put in place stringent public health measures.  Gym owners have put regimented structures in place not only to make their businesses safe, but to implement contact tracing measures also.  Gym users have been compliant with those measures.  As the Minister of State is aware, physical health and mental health go hand in hand.  I have been contacted by several constituents who are very concerned about their mental health coming into the dark nights.  Routine and exercise are extremely important at the moment.<\/p> <p> Unfortunately, Sinn F&eacute;in has not been included in the discussions and decision-making on the restrictions and has not received any briefings from NPHET or the Chief Medical Officer.  Transparency is very important in the context of people's understanding of the restrictions and compliance with them.  The Government needs to have transparency in order to bring people with it.  People deserve the truth.  I have asked the Minister for Health, Deputy Donnelly, to outline the rationale and evidence for closing gyms based on his discussions with NPHET and the Chief Medical Officer.  I put the same question to the Minister of State.  I know she cannot answer now but I would appreciate a response at a later stage.  What discussions, if any, did the Minister have with mental health experts in respect of the decision to close gyms?  Was consideration given to allowing gyms to open either outdoors or indoors under more restrictive measures?<\/p> <p> As I stated, the Government made a sensible decision regarding the support bubble.  As much as I would like to think did so because I raised the issue directly in the House, it did not make the decision on that basis alone.  Rather, the decision was made because the Government went back, did its research and due diligence and made a sensible decision based on the evidence provided.  All I am asking for on behalf of gym users is that the Minister start the process and use the same due diligence process to examine why gyms have been closed and not permitted to reopen.<\/p> <p> The motion proposes an extension to the sunset clause.  A sunset clause is exactly what it sounds like.  It is time bound and there for a reason.  If it is necessary to extend it again, the House should come back in and debate that.  Unless the motion contains a sunset clause and a date relating to it, Sinn F&eacute;in cannot support it going forward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102200012#K00500","speaker":"1469","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1603359600,"counter":123,"content":"<p>The Health (Preservation and Protection and other Emergency Measures in the Public Interest) Act 2020 is a vital part of the national effort to challenge and overcome coronavirus.  The Labour Party supported the Act originally because it supports the objectives the Act is trying to achieve.  In March, we tabled amendments to ensure that the House would be able to review sunset clauses, as is being done today.  We need another date to be set to ensure that any concerns will be addressed.  In fairness, I think the Minister of State knows that this is necessary and, as far as I understand it, the Government will deal with it.  Although the Labour Party supports extending Part 5 of the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020 until 2021, we would have concerns if it were to be extended without detailed scrutiny.<\/p>  <p>  I refer to an important issue that has not been examined in any great detail.  In normal course, an independent consultant psychiatrist examines a patient in person, interviews the responsible consultant psychiatrist and prepares a report for submission to a mental health tribunal.  Such tribunals normally comprise a chairperson who is a solicitor or barrister, a consultant psychiatrist and a lay person.  These tribunals review admission or renewal orders for involuntary patients and either affirm or refuse the order.  The amendments contained in the Act provide that a consultant psychiatrist conducting an examination of an involuntarily detained patient may do so remotely.  They also provide for mental health tribunals to consist of just the chairperson if other members cannot attend due to the spread of Covid-19.  This causes challenges and worries.  It raises concerns regarding due process with people who are related to affected persons.  These are real and justifiable concerns.<\/p>  <p>  The information note sent by the Department to all Deputies states that no one-person mental health tribunals have been used to date but it does not state whether consultant psychiatrists have been conducting examinations remotely or, if they have been so doing, what impact this may be having on their professional assessments.  I ask the Minister of State to outline whether consultant psychiatrists have been conducting examinations remotely.  I presume background analysis of the impact the amendments are having has been carried out.  We need qualitative analysis on that issue and to find out how the process is being conducted.  It is my view that the Joint Committee on Health may wish to examine in detail the changes to the operation of these tribunals.  It should consider which amendments have been used in practice and, if not of them have been used, whether there is a rationale for renewing them.  We need more detail.<\/p>  <p>  Ultimately, it is necessary for a sunset clause to be put back in.  I understand and presume that the Government will do so.  If it does not, there will be an issue.  More detail on the process and how it is working to date is needed in order to assuage any concerns held by Members, as public representatives, as well as the families on whose loved ones the Act could potentially have an impact.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102200013#L00200","speaker":"1610"},{"type":"speech","time":1603359600,"counter":124,"content":"<p>The Social Democrats supported the Act passed earlier in the year.  In theory, we are happy to do so again, but it is very difficult to come to a definitive position on it given the lack of information.  The proposals in the Act are very wide-ranging and have the potential to cause difficulties.  It would have been helpful for some kind of assessment of the impact of the measures to date to have been carried out in order to ascertain whether there have been any issues raised or difficulties.  It would have been reasonable to carry out some kind of review before coming back to the House seeking a further extension.  I have not heard of any issues arising, but it would have been good to hear from the Mental Health Commission, for example, as to whether that is the case.  To a large extent, the House is being asked to agree to the motion blind, without any information or advice regarding the impact of the Act to date.  That is not a good way of doing business.<\/p>  <p>  As previous speakers noted, when extending a sunset clause, there must have a date for that sunset.  It is very difficult to understand why the Government has not set a new date before the House.  I hope that it will, by the end of today, set a date for when the application of these measures will cease.  That is a proper safeguard which should have been included by now.<\/p>  <p>  All Deputies are very aware of the fact that there has been an explosion in problems associated with mental health.  There were many pressing needs pre-Covid and an under-delivery of services.  Members are aware that in recent years there has been an under-resourcing of mental health services to the point that at the start of the year there were very extensive waiting lists, particularly for young people.  There were significant waiting lists for child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, psychology services and so on, and an under-provision of those services.  In the seven or eight months since then, all the indications are that the demand for services has multiplied.  For that reason, it is important that the view of mental health experts is taken into consideration in any decisions relating to restrictions arising from Covid.  I am not aware whether any of the key decision makers in all of this, and certainly the nine or ten people who were involved in the deliberations last Saturday and came to the conclusion to move to level 5, have any expertise in psychology, behavioural science or anything of that nature.  It is a real gap in the decision-making in the context of the House being asked to extend restrictions and the powers of the State to enforce those restrictions.<\/p> <p>However, very little thought is being given to human nature, human needs and psychology.  That is the other side of this.  It is not always possible to take a law enforcement approach to these issues.  We need to consider what people's needs are.  People need to see that the restrictions, while severe, are reasonable at the same time.  Many questions are being asked about those restrictions.  Earlier in the week we were discussing social contact.  People living alone should have been accommodated from the beginning and allowed some measure of social contact.  It is unreasonable not to allow that.<\/p> <p> Some of the measures introduced need to be explained.  For example, many older people like to go out and play golf.  It is a very healthy activity and is good for physical and mental health.  It is very hard to understand why there is a ban on that now.  We need to give consideration to human nature and human needs and allow for social contact.  That is a real gap in the entire decision-making process. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102200013#L00300","speaker":"1567","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1603360200,"counter":126,"content":"<p>I am opposed to the extension of the sunset clause for this and for the other matter we are debating today.  Fundamentally, the Government is attempting to compensate for its mess-ups, blunders and lack of a clear strategy in dealing with Covid by doubling down on repressive measures.  That relates more to the second element of what we are discussing today, but the two elements are related.<\/p><p>We have always been very consistent in being in favour of people following the public health guidelines.  In fact, we have advocated a zero-Covid approach.  There is strong evidence to suggest, first, that the kinds of repressive powers that are being extended today do not work, do not assist in encouraging people to follow those guidelines and can have a counterproductive effect, and, second, that they pose significant threats to our civil liberties.  It is striking that on this element, there is no sunset at this stage, but on the other element to be discussed later there is a sunset of, I think, June 2021.<\/p><p>People will rightly contrast that with the sunset on the ban on evictions, which will end whenever level 5 ends, presumably in December.  However, these repressive powers being given to the State will continue for another six months.  The plan basically is for these measures to continue over the course of the entire pandemic, whereas the supports to enable people to do what they need to do are wound down as soon as we are out of the very highest level of restrictions.  For me that encapsulates the problem with the Government's approach.  The way to get people to follow the public health restrictions is to support them and have public education campaigns as opposed to repression, but unfortunately the Government is increasingly going down that route.<\/p><p>An iCARE study by Dr. Hannah Durand found that fines and other coercive methods are the least likely method to improve compliance.  Dr. Durand stated:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIf the Government takes a hard-line, paternalistic approach, such measures will make it less likely to encourage people to adhere to the guidelines.  It might cause people to disengage and have the opposite effect.<br \/><br \/>We have concrete data now that threatening people with the likes of arrest is not going to work.  The data is really clear that that is not the way to go. <\/blockquote>  <p>That matches up with a range of other research, with another study finding that a sense of social duty overwhelmingly motivated people to comply with public health measures as opposed to being motivated by self-interest.  Another study argued that repressive policing in the context of Covid-19 actually increases social disorder due to the increased mistrust between the population and the police.  That concern was even echoed by the Garda Commissioner, Drew Harris, who pointed out that the UK has seen no benefit from its repressive regime.<\/p><p>It is vital that there be no carving-out of the essential right to protest.  The Government could end up in court if there was an attempt to use the guidelines to restrict people from protesting or to fine them for protesting.  That possibility is contained in the law.  I make the argument that people have the right to freedom of assembly under the Constitution.  It is extremely concerning that people are rightly able to make essential trips to do their shopping etc., including going beyond 5 km from home, but that, certainly according to the legislation, they do not have the right to do that for protesting.  The law potentially allows the detention of everyone attending a protest at which anyone had Covid or was even suspected of having Covid.  People can be fined up to &euro;2,500 or imprisoned for six months without any right to trial as a result of organising a protest or failing to comply with the direction of a garda.  These are extremely serious powers that are being given to the State.  There is no evidence that they are necessary or that they work.  There is plenty of evidence, as seen in the case of the Debenhams workers, that these can be abused.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102200014#M00200","speaker":"1628"},{"type":"speech","time":1603360200,"counter":127,"content":"<p>I apologise for missing some of the debate.  I was at a meeting of the Business Committee.  I was in favour of a sunset clause and I am glad we had one because it gives us a chance to debate the issue, albeit with severely limited time.  At the Business Committee I objected strenuously to this debate being rushed today.  Since its introduction in March, the Government has known that 9 November is the date.  I am sick and tired of this Government.  There is no pre-legislative scrutiny on most issues, and it is all because of a rush related to a deadline.  There should not be a panic.  We have known since we introduced these extraordinary powers in March that there was a sunset clause.  It must be remembered that the Government did not even want a sunset clause.  We are in a very dangerous place here and I am very concerned about it.  I will be opposing this extension for that reason.<\/p>  <p>  On more than one occasion, Dr. David Nabarro and other representatives of the World Health Organization have said that lockdowns have not worked and that they impact regressively and harshly on poorer people - ordinary citizens.  Some big businesses have mushroomed and expanded here during the lockdown, but the ordinary people are made to suffer.  There is loneliness and a sense of fear and fright.<\/p>  <p>  The changes had not been announced 25 minutes the other day when Deputy Cahill announced on my local radio station that the ten-person limit on attending a funeral had gone to 25 because he phoned the Taoiseach.  I welcome that because it is awful that our churches and places of worship are locked up completely.  Along with North Korea and Saudi Arabia, Ireland is the only place where people cannot attend church services of any denomination.  People have grown tired and I am concerned about the supports for them during this lockdown.<\/p>  <p>  I support the community effort that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has made.  In Tipperary, Sergeant Ray Moloney and Superintendent Denis Whelan and the team there have started today making visits and supporting the community, which is what the community and the Garda need.  No police force in the world can operate effectively without the support of the people.  It needs that badly and it has that support thankfully and is doing great work.  Regarding these powers, the Garda Commissioner - I almost said chief constable because of where he is from - has said that what has happened in England has not been good.  Why are we blindly following with &euro;2,500 fines and six months' imprisonment?  We already know the prisons are full, although some prisoners were released at the outbreak of Covid to make space.<\/p>  <p>  Where are the unalienable rights under the Constitution?  Where is our right to assemble?  These are all in our Constitution, which we are treading over here very dangerously.<\/p>  <p>I am not in favour of extending these measures.  We were told we are all in this together but we find we are not.  Other speakers have raised the moratorium on mortgages.  We let that slip.  The banks waltzed into the Government and came out with only a slap on the wrist.  The moratorium is gone and it will be done on a case-by-case basis.  There have been 300 or 400 evictions.  Businessmen have been brought through the courts throughout lockdown.  We have made a pathway for the banks and the vulture funds to carry out their murky, dirty, filthy business, while they terrorise ordinary citizens, including home owners and business owners.  The houses of many small businesspeople are collateral for their vans or machinery.  Many musicians are in fear of losing their houses because they receive only pressure, arrogance and contempt from the lending institutions, yet we give it only a nod and a wink.  We saw what happened in the Galway races tent years ago, we saw what happened at the Galway golf gate.  I mean no disrespect to the Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  These events only so happened to take place in Galway, but it is just sickening.  We are making way for the vulture funds and the banks.  We see what goes on in the courts and the charade there.  <\/p> <p> People are growing tired of this.  They made a Herculean effort to fight the virus, and we must do that, but not by regressing and using these over-demanding powers.  The Minister for Justice is not present but I want clarity on whether the garda&iacute; will have the power to enter homes.

We are facing into a very difficult period with introduction of level 5 restrictions as of today, and the worsening epidemiological figures cross the country.  In the past week alone, more than 8,000 cases have been confirmed and the national incidence rate sits at 262 per 100,000.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has implemented a suite of measures to address the deteriorating situation, including the introduction of level 5 restrictions nationwide, and the continuation of the measures in this Act and the Health Act 2020.  These measures are aimed at limiting the spread and damage of Covid, and at the Government&rsquo;s key priorities of supporting and maintaining health and social care services, keeping education and childcare services open and protecting the most vulnerable members of our communities.<\/p>  <p>  I thank Deputies Kelly, Shortall and Ward for their constructive contributions.  I apologise to them.  I understood the date was set out in the draft resolution but they do not seem to be aware of that.  I will look into this and update them.  The Government has chosen to align the new date for the sunset clause of 9 June 2021 with its medium-term strategy, Covid Resilience and Recovery 2020-2021: Plan for Living with Covid-19.  This date allows our mental health services to plan appropriately for the medium term.  I confirmed yesterday that the temporary measures may be ended earlier by ministerial order should the public health situation improve to such a point that the measures are no longer needed.  These emergency measures will be subject to ongoing review, and will be repealed if circumstances allow.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Kelly asked about psychiatrists.  Independent consultant psychiatrists have been examining patients remotely.  The Mental Health Commission examines all patient records and all reviews of involuntary detentions.  The commission has monitored the implementation of the new measures.  While the current situation is not ideal, it has ensured that the rights of patients have been upheld and that every patient has received his or her hearing.  The commission has not flagged any issues to the Department.  It is keeping records of all tribunals and all records relating to patients, examinations and detentions.  As of this week, no one-person tribunals have been required, as Deputy Kelly said.  I reiterate that tribunals have been conducted by independent consultant psychiatrists.  I hope that allays fears and that he might support the motion.  <\/p>  <p>  On mental health more widely, the outbreak of Covid-19 has been a source of significant stress, anxiety, worry and fear for many people.  This arises from the disease itself, as well as from impacts such as increased social isolation, disruption to daily life and uncertainty about employment and financial security.  The Government recognises this and has put in place funding for a revised mental health promotion and well-being campaign, funding for online supports and the recently launched national crisis text line, 50808.  These measures complement, rather than replace, face-to-face services.  <\/p>  <p>  The Government has further increased funding to HSE mental health services by an additional &euro;50 million for 2021, bringing the total to &euro;1.076 billion.  This funding will help to implement our new mental health policy, Sharing the Vision, which sets out the roadmap for mental healthcare at all levels over the next ten years.  This week, a leaflet went into all 4,000 secondary schools that signposts supports for that age group from 12 organisations.  The leaflet is also available online for third level students who are not on campus.  We are also examining a new advertising campaign especially for older, more vulnerable people who might not have access to the Internet or a smartphone to hammer home the number they can contact if they want to make a call.  That will be rolled out on local radio stations in particular that have significant listenerships in the morning.  We are also looking at counselling options.  The organisation MyMind has capacity to provide counselling up to December.  It provides counselling in 15 different languages, which is very important.  We are doing a lot to ensure that supports are there.  I hope that Members will be able to support this now that I have given more clarity. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102200015#N00300","speaker":"1614"},{"type":"speech","time":1603360800,"counter":131,"content":"<p>A Leas-Cheann Comhairle-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102200015#N00400","speaker":"1518"},{"type":"speech","time":1603360800,"counter":132,"content":"<p>One moment.

I was at meeting of the Business Committee.<\/p>  <p>  I accept these difficult decisions have to be made and I commend all Deputies on making them.  However, we make them without the necessary information.  We cannot change the information that we have now but we can make sure that we are not in this position again.  <\/p>  <p>  During the lockdown the national self-harm registry stopped collecting and collating data.  Staff started collecting the data again fully at the end of August, having started before that, and is now collecting the information both now and retrospectively.  The registry stopped because its staff were not determined to be essential workers.  I want to ensure that does not happen again.  When we talk about mental health and rolling over emergency legislation, we need to make those decisions with as much information as possible.  Above all, we need information on presentations of self-harm in hospitals.  I do not know whether they were up or down, and I think that no one knows this information.  People in emergency departments know about their own place of work anecdotally but that will vary across the country.  The Central Statistics Office, CSO, collects data on suicides.  Its staff were not classified as essential workers.  More fundamentally, the CSO gives out its first information on suicides in 2020 in the first half of next year. <\/p> <p>I accept that it is difficult to collect this information but we did give extra powers to coroners, or there were at least provisions regarding coroners, in the emergency legislation in March.<\/p> <p> I am urging the Minister of State to make sure that we have as much information as possible on the incidence of suicide and self-harm.  If we do not have that information, how can we, as decision makers, possibly take account of it in our decision-making?  It may be the case that the Department has data which nobody else has.  If it does, I ask the Minister of State to confirm that.  I am not trying to put her in a difficult position and I greatly appreciate her allowing me time to speak.  However, if there is information that is available but not in the public domain, I would like to know about it.  I would like, at least, to know that the data on suicide and self-harm during the last lockdown are being considered as we make these difficult decisions.<\/p> <p> Finally, this provision relates specifically to the Mental Health Commission.  Has any study been carried out in respect of the impact of having sittings of the commission take place remotely on the people who are the subject of those decisions and are being detained involuntarily?  I cannot imagine anything worse than being strapped down and administered medicines against my will but I accept that doctors say it is necessary to protect the individuals who are being administered the medicines and sometimes others around them.  People are not able to challenge such a decision in person.  It is being done remotely and they are being told by the person who is advocating their detention that the commission has agreed that they should be detained.  These patients are not being told by the decision makers, because they are remote from the individual.  The individual is being informed of the outcome by the person who has said to him or her: \"I know you do not want to be detained but I am saying it is for your good.\"  For that person to be going back to the individual and saying the commission agrees with that decision is unfortunate.  We need more information on the impact this is having.  I know the Minister of State does not have that information today and I am not raising the matter by way of criticism of her.  I certainly am not raising it by way of criticism of the staff of the Central Statistics Office or the National Self-Harm Registry Ireland, who were obeying the law.  We need to make sure we learn from what went on before and that we are in a position to make these decisions with much more information, if we have to make them again.

I am here to introduce a resolution to extend the sunset clause in the Health (Preservation and Protection and other Emergency Measures in the Public Interest) Act 2020, which is due to expire on 9 November.  It is fair to say that we are living in truly unprecedented times and I do not believe it is possible to overstate how serious a threat Covid-19 continues to pose to our lives, our health and well-being, our economy and our society.  To date, Ireland has recorded 53,422 cases and, sadly, 1,868 deaths.  I know this House will wish to extend its sympathies to the bereaved families and friends who have lost loved ones to Covid-19 this year.<\/p>  <p>  When the Government brought this legislation before the Oireachtas six months ago, we were really at the start of what has turned out to be a continuously evolving and uncertain journey.  Earlier this year, we managed to flatten the curve and return to a period of relative normality but recent trends and the current disease profile are very concerning.  All indicators of disease incidence and severity have continued to worsen in recent weeks.  In the past week alone, there have been almost 9,000 cases and the national 14-day incidence rate now stands at 291 per 100,000.  We have also seen outbreaks of Covid-19 continue to occur in the community, in hospitals, and, most worryingly, in long-term residential care settings.  In response to the rapidly deteriorating epidemiological situation across the country, the Government had to make some very difficult decisions this week to protect public health by moving the entire county to level 5 for the next six weeks under the plan for living with Covid-19.<\/p>  <p>  These measures are essential at this time if we are to get the reproduction number back to below one and suppress the virus.  As An Taoiseach referred to in his address to the nation on Monday night, our overall objective is to suppress the virus to as low a level as possible, while allowing as much of our society and economy to operate as is possible and safe at any given point in time.  While there has been progress made in terms of the development of possible vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics, it is internationally accepted that Covid-19 will continue to represent a grave public health threat in the medium term.  Unfortunately, this means there is still a need for public health measures of the kind that came into effect overnight and which are facilitated by this legislation.<\/p>  <p>  It is worth highlighting that Ireland is not alone in this crisis.  Indeed, all across Europe and much of the rest of the world, Covid-19 infections are on the rise and, increasingly, countries are having to introduce more restrictive measures in response.  These measures place extraordinary limitations on our lives and livelihoods, limiting who we can meet, how far we can travel and requiring some businesses and services to close their doors.  The Government does not take these decisions lightly and always seeks to balance all considerations, including public health, economic and societal considerations, to ensure measures taken are proportionate to the level of threat.   Regrettably, we need to retain these measures as part of our national response.  They proved essential in allowing us to suppress the virus in the first half of this year and they are essential as we do so again.  Critically, they will support us in protecting our key priorities of maintaining health and social care services, keeping education and childcare services open and, above all, protecting the most vulnerable members of our communities.<\/p> <p> Ensuring a balanced response to Covid-19 is a complex task.  Since the beginning of this crisis, the dilemma facing Government has revolved around how to implement public health measures in response to the pandemic in a way that is fair, reasonable and proportionate.  This is neither easy nor straightforward but I assure the House that we will continue to use these powers in a responsible way.  I also assure the House that work is continuing to further develop and enhance a broader public health response, including public health capacity, our testing strategy - including the potential use of alternative diagnostic approaches - and our testing and contact tracing services.  While these services are understandably under pressure progress has been made in developing capacity in recent months and more sustainable capacity continues to be added to the system, including significant recruitment in recent weeks.<\/p> <p> While testing and contact tracing are by no means a panacea for managing this disease into the future, a robust and timely public health response to cases and clusters will continue to provide an important element of our overall response.  Testing and tracing on its own is not sufficient for managing this disease and we must retain the ability to put in place a range of measures as facilitated by this legislation and targeted at limiting opportunities for virus transmission.<\/p> <p> These laws are necessary for now and the main aim behind them is to protect people and save lives.  In the spirit of proportionality, I recognise that the extension of these extraordinary measures must be temporary and I will repeal them as soon as it is safe to do so.  I assure the House that the measures will be continually reviewed and assessed in light of emerging evidence.<\/p> <p> The measures provided for under the Act are exceptional and the Government is mindful of the concerns regarding their impact on individual rights and freedoms.  As the position is ever evolving and changing, we must use the option to renew them for another period.  I am conscious, as I seek to extend this emergency legislation at a time of great national anxiety, that it is important to reiterate that these measures will be imposed only in exceptional circumstances.  We intend to continue to deal with this public health emergency through the co-operation of our people and collaboration between all our State agencies.  Nonetheless, we must continue to legislate to ensure that we have all the required powers to fight this virus.  Let me reassure the House that the Government is clear that public health measures restricting individual rights must be introduced and retained only in the pursuit of legitimate public health goals, must be the least intrusive to achieve those goals, and must be of limited duration.<\/p> <p> Our priority today must be the protection of both public health and human life, preventing the spread of the virus and working to mitigate its impact on our people.  That is why I seek the extension of the sunset clause contained in the Act.  I propose an extension of seven months up to the 9 June 2021 as this is in line with the timeline of the Government's medium-term strategy Resilience and Recovery 2020-2021: Plan for Living with COVID-19.  I ask Deputies to support the continuation of these measures.<\/p> <p> I also wish to highlight that the Government is seeking to mitigate the impact of restrictions insofar as possible by ensuring that there are sufficient mechanisms in place for businesses and individuals to support them through this pandemic.  We are improving the pandemic unemployment payment and the employment wage subsidy scheme to take account of the new restrictions.  We will prioritise the roll out of new supports in mental health services and adopt the inclusion of support bubbles as part of the own household provisions.  We are also taking action to enhance the effectiveness of public health measures by developing more robust and appropriate enforcement mechanisms.  On Tuesday, the Government agreed to the introduction of a system of tiered penalties and I look forward to introducing the legislation in that regard in the D&aacute;il tomorrow.<\/p> <p> As the published figures showed last night, this virus does not discriminate based on age, gender or geographic location. We must all work together again to help slow its spread.  We can do this by following the level five measures and the ongoing public health advice to all of us, including social distancing and handwashing.<\/p> <p> I want to comment now on the level 5 measures that have been in place since midnight.  We are making a pre-emptive strike against this virus.  The next six weeks represent our opportunity to suppress the virus in order that we can open up for December.  Our priorities of human health and human life, our health services, education, childcare and jobs are all stable.  Fatalities have, however, doubled in the past two weeks on a daily basis and it is projected that they will continue to do so.  Regrettably, new cases are growing exponentially and ahead of even the exponential projections we were given just two weeks ago.<\/p> <p> In one very important way, the level 5 measures are like the measures brought in during the first wave.  The very simple and important message is to stay at home.  It is just like in the first wave.  The message when we needed to flatten the curve was to stay at home and this is the message today also.  If we are to drive the virus back down quickly and effectively, which we must do, then a core message for level 5 is for people to stay at home.  Where this set of measures is different to those we lived through earlier in the year is in the provisions that accompany this.  This time the healthcare services will remain open.  I encourage anybody who has a healthcare appointment to please keep it and to engage with his or her GP, therapist, consultant and other healthcare professionals.  It is crucial that people continue to do this.<\/p> <p> Childcare, primary schools, second level schools and third level colleges remain open.  Manufacturing and construction remain open.  Critically, disability day services remain open.  Sports training for school-age children remains open in its current form, namely, on a non-contact basis and in pods of up to 15.<\/p> <p> I was very keen to see the concept of the support bubble included in these level 5 measures.  This is a new measure that we did not have last time.  It covers single adult households, an adult living alone or sharing custody of children, or in exceptional circumstances such as an adult living with a person who has advanced dementia, for example.  The levels of isolation for those people is not something that should be seen.  Those households can link up with one other household to create an extended household.<\/p> <p> There is an eviction ban in place and there are the additional economic measures to which I referred earlier.  Critically, numerous supports are in place for nursing homes, including: funding; the provision of personal protective equipment; a wide range of expert medical supports, including for geriatrics, infection prevention and control and occupational health.<\/p> <p> The next six weeks will be difficult for everybody, for every person, every family, every community and every business.  These measures and exemptions I have listed will help but, as before, for us to succeed and to flatten the curve now each of us will need to play our part and each of us will need to look out for each other over the coming weeks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102200016#O01000","speaker":"1623","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1603362000,"counter":148,"content":"<p>There are no copies of the Minister's speech.

We all support public health measures and interventions which will allow us to wrestle the virus back under control, which we need to do.  We also need to use the coming weeks, to which I will refer later, to prepare so that we can stay ahead of the virus if and when we manage to bring the numbers down.<\/p> <p> This works both ways, however.  When the Minister looks for support from us, and we give it as we want to support the public health measures, the Government and the Minister for Health must respond appropriately.  The level of co-operation with the Opposition seen during the very early stages of the pandemic does not exist today.  There are not enough briefings.  Even before today's debate, all of the Opposition representatives on the Business Committee had to fight for even the limited time we have been given today to debate this issue.  The Government's original proposal was that both motions, that on mental health and this motion on the Minister's wider powers over all restrictions, would be taken without debate and that there were to be no briefings for the Opposition.  <\/p> <p> I believe some in Government briefed the media about some of those who attended briefings, including my own party leader who left a briefing with the Chief Medical Officer at the same time he did, leading to irresponsible and inaccurate coverage in some newspapers.  <\/p> <p> We are not getting as many briefings as we should and we are not getting information as we should be getting it.  Even yesterday, with regard to the Health (Amendment) Bill 2020, which relates to fines, the Joint Committee on Health was told that the Minister would be available to give us a briefing.  We then got a call to say that he would not be.  I am sure there was a good reason for that and I am not saying that the Minister was responsible.  I am only telling him what was communicated to us.  We were told the Minister for Health would be available.  I then got a call from the clerk of that committee to say that the Minister would now not be available because of a meeting.  We then got a briefing from a number of officials who, by the way, did not answer all of our questions to our satisfaction.  This was not because they did not have the answers but because the answers were not actually in the Bill.  We were being asked to sign a blank cheque, with which we will deal tomorrow when that legislation comes before us.  <\/p> <p> The Minister was given extraordinary powers in good faith by Members of this House.  To push the sunset clause out until 9 June is to push it too far.  That is why we have proposed an amendment under which the horizon date would be 9 February.  It would be appropriate for the Minister to return to the House in February rather than June to extend the emergency powers again, if necessary, and to explain the context in which they are needed.  This has to be part of an overall strategy which people can see and which shows how we are to exit from these types of restrictions and the sort of yo-yo situation about which people talk.  We do not see such a clear plan coming from Government.  In the absence of this plan, we have a Government which seeks these powers for a further six months, up until the middle of June.  That is a step too far for us not because we do not want restrictions or do not believe public health measures should be implemented, but because we believe in scrutiny and accountability.  <\/p> <p> We need notice from the Minister when he publishes statutory instruments.  I find out that statutory instruments have been introduced when they go up on the website.  Most of us here are the health spokespersons for our parties but we are given no heads-up whatsoever.  We get no email from the Department to say that the Minister is going to publish a statutory instrument, which will be available online, and to offer us a briefing or clarification on it.  None of this happens.  I say all of this in good faith.  I want this to change.  The more information we have, the better armed we are to respond to queries from people outside of this Chamber. <\/p> <p> I have already made the point that this must be part of an overall strategy.  This motion again extends the sunset clause, allowing the Minister to bring in further restrictions and statutory instruments and to do many other things as well.  People watching this debate, possibly from home, want a clear strategy and plan from Government.  They do not have the sense that such a plan exists.  <\/p> <p> As part of this, we have to ensure that our defences and capacity in a number of areas are built up.  We are now going into a lockdown of six weeks, or at least four, and possibly more if the numbers do not come down.  This will mean real challenges for working families and businesses.  We all accept that.  Many people are not going to work today because their jobs are temporarily gone.  They are surviving on incomes far lower than they would have if working.  That is a real challenge for them.  We are making a real ask of them as individuals.  While we make this ask of individuals, it is important that the State step up to the plate.  That means using the coming weeks wisely instead of repeating what happened over the summer when we got as close to zero Covid as possible but wasted these months by not putting capacity into our hospitals and our testing and tracing systems.  This is now coming home to roost.  <\/p> <p> We can see what is happening with tracing.  I ask the Minister to tell us clearly how many people have been hired of the 1,200 promised new staff for testing and tracing, because I still have not been given the number.  I have asked.  I have submitted parliamentary questions.  Having that number is important if we are to be assured and reassured that there is capacity in the system.  Testing and tracing has to be front and centre.  While the Minister is looking at imposing restrictions and public health interventions, which are necessary, and everything else this Bill does, other measures need to be put in place to go in tandem with these provisions so that people will know their sacrifices are not in vain.  Ratcheting up capacity in testing and tracing is one such measure.<\/p> <p> We also need to hire as many front-line staff as we can get for our healthcare system.  In the budget, the Minister promised to hire 16,000 new personnel.  We have not been given a breakdown of this number.  In fact, the Joint Committee on Health this week received a one-paragraph response from the HSE which said that a plan would be available in the coming weeks.  We are producing plans to plan again as opposed to having the detail worked out.  We are still none the wiser as to how many additional staff are to be brought in.  As Deputy Kelly has pointed out, we have fewer nurses in the system now than we had before the pandemic began, even with the additional recruitment which has taken place.  We need to see all of that happen.  <\/p> <p> Almost 1,500 people who responded to the Be on Call for Ireland initiative are in a pool, more than 800 of whom are job-ready, but have not yet been given a contract.  That is completely unacceptable.  The Minister needs to get a grip on that and ensure that those people who are available and qualified to work on the front line in our hospitals and in testing and tracing are given the opportunity to do so.<\/p> <p> We also need a joined-up approach.  While the Minister seeks emergency powers in these areas, he needs to co-operate more with his counterpart in the North.  The Chief Medical Officers in the North and South need to be more aligned.  This is an all-island crisis that merits an all-island response.  The memorandum of understanding that was signed is not working, or at least not working to my satisfaction.  More needs to be done.  I would like to hear the Minister tell us what engagement he has had with his colleague in the North.  I would also like to know what more the Government is doing, or intends to do, with regard to an all-island response whether in the area of testing and tracing, the area of ports, airports and transport or the area of sharing data and information, because that must also be at the core of our response.  We also need to see all of the income supports put in place for workers, families and businesses.  <\/p> <p> In concluding my remarks I will again in good faith say to the Minister that Members of this House want to work with Government.  We work with public health officials.  We want to support all of the public health measures that need to be in place to ensure that people are kept safe, but we have to be kept in the loop.  If the Minister is honest with himself, and if the thinks back to when he was an Opposition health spokesperson, the previous Government was in place and the pandemic was at its height in April and May, he will recognise that there was much better cohesion and co-operation and much more respect shown to members of the Opposition than is now being shown.  I appeal to him to sort that problem out so that we are better equipped with information and better able to respond to queries.<\/p> <p> My final point is that we sought a direct line for Oireachtas Members to contact the Department in respect of the most recent restrictions.  There are many exemptions to what is allowed and not allowed but we have no facility to get clarity on issues.  That is absolute madness.<\/p> <p>We are all inundated with calls from constituents, with queries such as what the restrictions mean for gyms and other places of work.  Some businesses are trying to circumvent the rules by selling products just so they can remain open.  Workers are calling us to ask what they should do, and we are left hanging, with absolutely no facility to get responses to questions.  That is not acceptable.  People are being asked to make sacrifices and restrictions are being put in place, but they are simply being guided to a website that gives generalities.  When specific questions are asked, however, we do not get answers because there is no facility to do that, other than parliamentary questions.  If the Minister wants us to flood the system of parliamentary questions, that is fair enough.  <\/p> <p> I do not believe that is that way to do this, so I again appeal to him to set up a system that will allow Oireachtas Members to get information as quickly as possible so we can respond to our constituents and provide clarity.  If something is not allowed, then it is not allowed, but we could then give that information very clearly, as opposed to trying to interpret what is there.  I appeal to the Minister to do all that, to work with the Opposition and to ensure there are more briefings, more information and, dare I say it, more respect shown to Opposition Members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102200017#P00900","speaker":"1615","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1603363200,"counter":158,"content":"<p>Did the Deputy formally move his amendment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102200019#R00200","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1603363200,"counter":159,"content":"<p>I did.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102200019#R00300","speaker":"1615"},{"type":"speech","time":1603363200,"counter":160,"content":"<p>I agree with the comments of the previous speaker.

It would be good, therefore, to have an access point or a telephone line through which we could get clarity.  The Minister must also ensure the regulations are brought in fairly.  I refer to large multiple stores being open and taking food out of the mouths of small shop operators who must close.  That is unacceptable, and I ask that something be done.<\/p>  <p>  This resolution amends the Health Act 1947, and public representatives are now familiar with these regulations, although they change frequently.  They deal with a range of issues.  Government announcements have been purely advisory and have not been made the subject of regulation.  What restrictions have been spelled out in regulations but without powers of enforcement or penalties if they are breached?  What restrictions are classed as penal and may be prosecuted?  <\/p>  <p>  Since the start of the pandemic, and the official responses to it, there has been a gap between public health restrictions and what has been set out in legally-binding regulations.  I will give some examples.  The first lockdown was announced and put in place several days before any regulations were made.  There have never been any regulations relating to social distancing in public.  There was no legislative basis to the green list for travel and the law has never required inbound travellers to isolate or restrict their movements, regardless of their country of origin.  These are all issues and anomalies that people point out.<\/p>  <p>  This situation has placed An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in an invidious, if not impossible, position.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is a law enforcement body, not a public health advisory agency.  It has no business enforcing rules not grounded in law.  When the public complains about breaches of the rules and ask where are the guards and why are the rules not being enforced, the answer is that the rules in question were never put into regulations.  <\/p>  <p>  I will stop, because there is no point in my speaking if the Minister is not going to listen.

It is ridiculous.<\/p>  <p>  As I was saying, the rules in question were never put into regulations, and that was not because the Government does not have the power to do so.  The Oireachtas gave that power to the Government in March.  For some reason, however, that has not been spelled out, the Government has preferred a confusing approach whereby some public health rules have no legal status, while others are put into regulations but made non-penal.  That means there is no power to enforce them or to penalise any contraventions.  In addition, a third category of rules has been made fully penal.  <\/p>  <p>  It is not helpful when some people, here and outside, refer in a blanket way to all the restrictions as prohibitions and bans.  They are not.  Such references reinforce the public perception that rules are being enforced and flouted.  The reality, in law, is that the Government in many cases did not make enforceable rules in the first place.  We cannot go into level 5 with such a mismatch between Government public health pronouncements and Government regulations.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na can only lawfully enforce level 5 restrictions when they are reflected in the law.  Fudges do not work.  <\/p>  <p>  The public may be concerned about the lack of Garda enforcement, but the first step is to use the already available power to make regulations that explicitly prohibit contraventions of public health restrictions.  The second step is to make those restrictions penal and the third step is to bring in prosecutions.  This is not impossible, and has happened in a limited number of District Court cases.  We believe it is necessary to stress that these powers are already available to the Government.  It, however, has chosen, for its own reasons, which the Minister might wish to explain, to not avail of them to any major extent.  This Bill is about conferring an additional power as an alternative to a summons and prosecution in front of the District Court.  In lieu of issuing a summons, a Garda may decide in certain classes of offence to serve a fixed penalty notice.  If the penalty is paid, there is no prosecution.  <\/p>  <p>  It is worth noting that although there is a provision for fines of &euro;2,500, that penalty can only be imposed by a court under the provisions of this Bill, while a fixed charge will be &euro;500, or less.  It must be stressed again that this legislation will kick in only if the Government first makes regulations and then specified in those regulations that some of the provisions are to be penal.  That is more than the Government has been prepared to do to date.  This Bill would also require the Government to undertake a third step by specifying that certain penal regulations were also to be fixed penalty provisions, to which the new Bill would then apply.  The Government must make penal regulations under the law we are renewing now, and that adequately reflect the level of restriction announced by the Minister as public health policy.  In no way, should we continue with the mismatch of communications to the public not grounded in law and we also cannot continue to put An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in an invidious situation where its members do not have the powers to do what the public, in some cases, think they can.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102200019#R00800","speaker":"1610"},{"type":"speech","time":1603363200,"counter":165,"content":"<p>I apologise for my late arrival this morning.  It was due to a pile-up on the motorway.  I am glad I was not involved, but it delayed my journey by some time.<\/p>  <p>  I have  listened carefully to the debate and I appreciate fully the importance of the issues and the need for a sound basis for the decision taken by the Government.  The Minister and I have had past incarnations where we did not always sing from the same hymn sheet.  That said, the situation facing the Government now is much more serious than people generally understand.  The information and advice being made available must be borne in mind in the first instance.  <\/p>  <p>  Incidentally, I listened to reference being made to South Korea in recent days and comparisons being made to the situation here.  South Korea has approximately one quarter of the testing and tracing facilities available here.  That information was presented to the health committee only in recent days.  People in South Korea have a different attitude, however, from what is seen to be the law and its observance.  That comes, of course, from their background.  We preserve our freedom and that is part of our constitutional entitlement.  We are right to do that.  We are now, however, imposing a second lockdown of six weeks, which might be more or less depending on what happens.<\/p> <p>Everyone knows there have been widespread breaches of the rules, regulations and good conduct guidelines that have been set out.  They are only guidelines.  It would not have been necessary to have this particular shutdown were it not for the fact that large numbers of people all over the country have been disregarding the guidelines, rules, regulations and calls by the Minister and NPHET to observe social distancing and curtail social interaction by not visiting among friends and so on.  I cannot for the life of me understand why people are continuously asking if it would be alright if they had a visit from so-and-so.  We all have an overall responsibility and it is necessary to curtail the onward march of the virus in early days and to recognise that a shutdown damages the economy and livelihoods of people all over the country to a huge extent.  Surely it must be possible to instil in the minds of everybody in the country the absolute necessity of observing social distancing and hygiene regulations both in spirit and to the letter.  If we do not do that, we are likely to have a further and more expensive shutdown.<\/p> <p> On the issue of advice, I am not sure that we as Deputies should take it upon ourselves to advise people, other than to advise strict observance of the rules and regulations to curtail the virus in the first instance.  If we move over into the next phase and talk about infringement of our freedoms and democracy and so on, we get into a different situation which is not the subject of the rules and regulations necessary to curtail the virus.  We have heard it said, including in this House, that this situation is not serious at all and if there were no regulations, it would be possible to manage it.  We hear comparisons made with other countries.  Every single other country has had either a subsequent lockdown or failures and breakdowns and they are having them as we speak.  At this particular time, given the onslaught of winter and the degree to which people have failed to observe the spirit and letter of the regulations in the past few weeks, we must recognise the urgency to do everything we can individually and collectively.  We must make our individual contributions to curtailing the virus in every way possible in order to protect the health of our citizens in the first instance and the economy in the second instance.  It is in our own hands and those of the general public.  Every single one of us, whether a public representative or an ordinary member of the public, has an urgent responsibility to further the aims, suggestions and advice of those who have the scientific evidence at their disposal and who have done well so far in predicting the levels of infections long before they arose and long before it became necessary to take emergency measures.<\/p> <p> I would like there to be more focus in this debate on the need to comply with the health regulations as a matter of urgency and, by so doing, to remove the necessity for any further lockdowns.  If everybody throughout the country had observed the regulations as much as possible over the past two months, there would be no need for a lockdown or the extension of the sunset clause because we would have achieved our objectives.<\/p> <p> This issue has been discussed at great length - to exhaustion, in fact - at the Special Committee on Covid-19 Response and the Joint Committee on Health.  Again and again the conflict arises.  It is a simple and legitimate case.  The country has to survive economically or we cannot pay for all the things we want to do.  That is recognised.  However, it is possible to achieve the same results without a lockdown, on a voluntary basis, subject to compliance with social distancing.  It is not true that this has been happening.  It has not.  There have been widespread outbreaks of the virus at various locations throughout the country and they have been traced back to particular situations, such as house parties, celebrations and so on.  There is a short and simple answer to everything.  Is it safe to have these celebrations now?  The answer is to ask whether the person asking the question feels it is safe.  Does he or she feel it is irresponsible to proceed against the advice that is available at the present time, to have gatherings and intermingle, to ignore the regulations and, as a result, make the whole country pay the price again?<\/p> <p> We had our own shutdown in north Kildare in the past.  I do not believe it would have been necessary if all regulations had been complied with, but that is the nature of things.  We have exceptions.  I hope and appeal to us all - myself, my family and everybody else included - to observe the regulations voluntarily and thereby remove the necessity to have any kind of lockdown at all.  I ask the public to co-operate and provide the social distancing required.  They can do that.<\/p> <p> There are a number of shops, boutiques, clothing shops and so on in the towns and villages throughout the country that can and will observe social distancing.  They can ensure people wear masks and that no infections can take place as a result of one or two people entering the premises.  They should be consulted to find out whether they can provide such preventative measures within their premises.  I think they can and that they would be willing to do so.  Like everybody else in the House, I have had numerous requests for this consideration, because these shops have not contributed to this situation and have observed and done everything they should.  They closed down before and there have been no instances in their premises.  In those circumstances, I ask that we look at them again with a view to finding out whether any compensation can be made to their particular circumstances, on the basis of their willingness and agreement to observe the regulations strictly and to the letter. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102200019#R00900","speaker":"1584","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1603363800,"counter":167,"content":"<p>There are two minutes remaining in this slot.

Obviously, the public has a responsibility but the primary responsibility for providing leadership and taking action as promised lies with the Government.  Unfortunately, it has not done so to date.  Others have spoken of the need for consultation and briefings and those are undoubtedly needed.  Up to the end of April, we had weekly and sometimes twice-weekly briefings.  We had none during the summer and since the end of August, we have had three briefings.  That is not adequate.  They are basic briefings about the data.  We have heard nothing about the modelling or the forecasts and there is no consultation whatever.

The approach is all the weaker for that.  If there was cross-party agreement on the approach, which there should be, and an opportunity to input to that, that would send a clear message to the public.  It is regrettable that is not the case.  The basic point about these regulations and also the legislation tomorrow is that it would not be necessary to the same extent if a different approach was taken by Government, if Government was prepared to consult and if it was prepared to put the time into producing clear messages for people, developing the sense of solidarity that we had at the start of the year and encouraging people to work together on the basis of what works in people's own minds, of what seems to be fair and reasonable and how we can all help each other.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102200020#S00900","speaker":"1567","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1603364400,"counter":176,"content":"<p>Debate adjourned.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Message from Select Committee","time":1603364400,"counter":177,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102200021#T00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1603364400,"counter":178,"content":"<p>The Select Committee on Climate Action has completed its consideration of the following Revised Estimate for Public Services for the year ending 31 December 2020: Vote 29 - Communications, Climate Action and Environment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102200021#T00400","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Ceisteanna \u00f3 Cheannair\u00ed - Leaders' Questions","time":1603364400,"counter":179,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102200021#T00450"},{"type":"speech","time":1603364400,"counter":180,"content":"<p>This has been a tough week for the women of Ireland.  Last night, we had a heartwrenching and emotional debate on the Government's proposals to seal the records of survivors of mother and baby homes, women who were vilified, abused and treated as outcasts by this State.  In the same week, issues surrounding CervicalCheck have unfortunately arisen again.  Some 12 months ago, the T&aacute;naiste delivered a formal State apology for the litany of failures in respect of CervicalCheck and he said sorry for the humiliation, disrespect and deceit meted out to the hundreds of women affected by that scandal.  This came in the aftermath of the State joining US laboratories that were at fault in dragging a terminally ill woman through the courts and fighting her tooth and nail every step of the way.  It was accurately described as deathbed litigation.<\/p>  <p>  The T&aacute;naiste promised the women concerned that this would never happen again and that an alternative to the courts would be provided for women to seek justice.  The truth is that this adversarial and aggressive approach has been maintained.  Vicky Phelan has come forward to express her shock and anger that women and their families have been let down by the State yet again this week.  The Minister, Deputy Donnelly, has written to women and their families to say that the tribunal will be established next week.  They got that news at the same time as the public announcement.  It is like the mistakes that were made were brushed under the carpet and forgotten about.  It is as if the voices of the women concerned do not matter.  We heard women say last night that their voices did not matter.  Against their wishes and pleas for a non-adversarial route, the Minister, ignoring those calls, insists that the laboratories must be involved in the proceedings if taken before the tribunal.  This is entirely wrong.  The Government should not be joining these laboratories in fighting these women and their families.  A decent Government would stand up for and protect these women and ensure that it worked with them to get the justice that they deserve.<\/p>  <p>  We need to fix the system and that is the least that we owe these women.  I am a user of the CervicalCheck service and I want it to work.  In order for it to work, there has to be transparency and trust.  The women who are the victims of this scandal have to be listened to, so that all women can know they can have confidence in the service because they are having input into it.  These women have been let down repeatedly and now the Minister for Health intends to proceed on a basis that is not acceptable to those women.  Vicky Phelan said she is pleading with the Minister to redouble efforts to sit down again with the members of the 221+ group to identify an alternative solution for redress, which is what members have asked for and deserve.  Will the T&aacute;naiste accept that there is a failure to live up to the promise that he gave when he was Taoiseach, that women would not be dragged through the courts and an adversarial process?  Will he accept that this has caused significant distress for women and their families, all of which could have been avoided?  Will he intervene ahead of this tribunal being established next week and ensure that the cruel treatment of women is stopped immediately and that the tribunal is constituted in a way that will deliver justice for them?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102200021#T00500","speaker":"1467"},{"type":"speech","time":1603364400,"counter":181,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy O'Reilly for raising this very important issue.  The CervicalCheck tribunal is being established in good faith by Government, honouring a commitment made by Government after the Meenan report of 2018.  It is being established as an alternative to court for those who want it where cases cannot be settled by mediation or negotiation, which is of course the preferred solution and has happened in many cases but is not always possible, especially when there is a dispute about the facts and whether or not there was negligence.  The idea is that the tribunal will be quicker, will have fewer legal costs, can be done in private and can be less adversarial as the tribunal will have access to independent experts.  The Minister, Deputy Donnelly, has met the 221+ group.  I heard him say this morning that he is willing and will be happy to meet again with the 221+ group to hear its members concerns, sit down with them and listen to their ideas and suggestions.  He has made that commitment and that is welcome.  I know he will follow through on that.<\/p>  <p>  On the issue of a system being adversarial or not, it is worth paying attention to the words of Ms Justice Mary Irvine.  She said that adversarial, in this context, describes a process whereby the evidence of each witness may be tested on cross-examination.  It does not necessarily mean that it has to be confrontational.  Unfortunately, in some of these cases, it may not be clear-cut.  The person taking the case may feel that her smear was misread negligently.  However, the scientist who read it or the doctor who signed off on it may feel otherwise.  There is then a dispute about the facts.  The evidence is set out and each side gets to question the evidence.  That is what happens and I have not seen anyone come up with a solution to get around that.  I do not think it would be fair to deny a scientist or doctor the right to be heard and to say that they were not negligent and read the smear correctly.  I have not seen any solution to that conundrum other than to refuse to allow people to make a defence.  I do not see how that would work.<\/p>  <p>  On the issue of the laboratories being involved, following from the recent Carrick case in the High Court, I understand that laboratories can be involved as third parties rather than as defendants.  That follows on from the Morrissey case, which established that the HSE has primary liability and cannot delegate its liability.  It will be possible for the HSE and the State to be the defendant but the laboratories will only be there as a third party.  That may be necessary because third parties have indemnified the State and will have to pick up the tab for any compensation.  If they are totally excluded from saying that there was not negligence, that would create an issue and require the State to sue the laboratories, resulting in a second trial and second court hearing.  I do not think that would be in anyone's interests.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102200021#T00600","speaker":"1474"},{"type":"speech","time":1603364400,"counter":182,"content":"<p>The T&aacute;naiste has just read out a description of the process that has been rejected by the women and their families.

Bear in mind that it is being established as an alternative to court for those who want it.  Nobody has ever suggested, or is suggesting, that somebody would not be able to court if the person felt that it was in the person's best interests.

It has changed a great deal of this and much of the thinking on it.  I raised this yesterday and I respectfully ask the Minister to meet the 221+ group - the Taoiseach has already committed to meeting me - and push back the date until that is done.<\/p>  <p>  On a more positive note, in fairness, the Government has listened on a number of issues in respect of where we are going with Covid-19.  As regards the situation with loneliness and isolation, the creation of bubbles for people who are living alone and for single parents proposed by my colleague, Senator Moynihan, has been adopted by the Government.  It also listened to calls to increase the number of people to be allowed to attend funerals for compassionate reasons, given the number allowed to attend weddings.  I accept this has happened.  I now ask the Government to consider some changes to allow partners and husbands to be present in maternity settings with their wives or partners, under specific circumstances.  I do so for compassionate reasons.  A number of parties have raised this issue in the D&aacute;il previously.<\/p>  <p>  Last Friday, I was on the street in Nenagh and I met a lady whom I will call &Aacute;ine.  She is a friend of mine.  She beckoned me across the street and told me a very difficult story.  She discovered she had lost her baby at the three-month scan in University Hospital Limerick's maternity unit.  It was an awful, very upsetting story.  She and her husband are devastated.  Incidentally, the maternity services do a fantastic job across the country.  They are amazing.  I realise Dr. McKenna has carried out an analysis of guidelines for the Government, but we need to tweak them from a compassionate point of view.  It cannot be the case that people who have enough money and have private consultations can have partners or husbands present at a scan, but those who do not have enough money cannot have them in the public setting.<\/p>  <p>  I ask the Government to look at this again - I am not seeking to have a decision made here - because of &Aacute;ine's story.  She was left crying in the maternity service of the hospital.  She had to go back to a ward in which women were joyous with the children they had just been given.  She was left there on her own.  That is barbaric.  Both &Aacute;ine and I believe that she and her husband will need therapy in this situation.  I know her very well, and I have never seen somebody so devastated.  We stood on the side of the street talking privately for over half an hour.  There has to be some customisation for women to ensure their partners and husbands can attend, in very limited circumstances, for the three-month scan and perhaps at another date.  In particular, they must be brought in immediately when there is bad news.<\/p>  <p>  My last point relates to the situation throughout the country.  I know somebody who happened to walk through the car park of a maternity hospital and was confronted with the sight of many husbands, men and partners sitting in their cars.  We can, and must, do better than that.

The approach shown by the Labour Party is in stark contrast to the behaviour of other Opposition parties when it comes to Covid and when we should all be very much on the same side in doing everything we can to contain the virus, North and South.<\/p>  <p>  On the specific issue raised by the Deputy, I understand that partners and fathers are allowed to attend for the labour in the maternity hospitals, but there are tight restrictions on attending for antenatal appointments and scans.  Mechanisms are being put in place, where possible, to allow the father or the partner to attend remotely.  However, that is not the same as being there in person.  One cannot hold hands over Zoom and one certainly cannot comfort somebody who is getting bad news virtually or remotely.  What concerns the clinical directors and masters is that the more people who come into the hospital, the greater is the risk that coronavirus will be brought into the hospital.  With the virus at such high levels in the community, the risk increases each time a visitor comes into the hospital.  We must be cognisant of that.  The vast majority of pregnant women are very healthy, and even if they contracted coronavirus there will probably be no negative sequelae as a result.  However, some women are not.  Some have complicated pregnancies and have co-morbidities.  If they got coronavirus while pregnant, it could result in bad outcomes for them and their babies.  So far, no pregnant woman in Ireland has died of coronavirus, and we would like to keep it that way.<\/p>  <p>  We must balance the concerns.  However, I have listened to what the Deputy said and I will take it up with the HSE and CMO the next time we talk.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102200022#U00400","speaker":"1474"},{"type":"speech","time":1603365000,"counter":187,"content":"<p>I appreciate that.  The statistics show that no pregnant woman has been infected, which is an amazing statistic.  We want to keep it that way.

I also believe we must examine the protocols in general.  I have an issue with regard to somebody who does not have enough income or who is not going through the private system - some of us have a sufficient income but still go through the public system, as I and my wife did for the delivery of our two children - not having access.  There is a distinction there which is unacceptable.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, Jennifer Purcell from Limerick has publicly spoken about having twins.

However, they will endure this lockdown.  They will do so because it gives them the hope that Christmas can be saved.  This is how it has been sold to them.  If they focus on the fact that Christmas can be celebrated with some semblance of our \"old normal\", they are willing to take the darkness now, so that the lights can shimmer in December.<\/p>  <p>  We have been down this road before.  In March, we aimed to save summer.  In October, we aim to save Christmas.  What will our next aim be?  The question I pose today is whether we are learning from the actions we are taking.  Are we being proactive or reactive?  Are we locking down people and locking up the economy while neglecting to rethink our strategy and vary our approach?<\/p>  <p>  There are two weapons we can use to win this battle of survival, namely, technology and enforcement.  We need a renewed emphasis on the importance of testing and tracing.  We also need the implementation of fast turnaround diagnostic testing in schools and at airports and ports.  We must sanction screening for workplaces to detect asymptomatic cases.  I have been told by those working on the front line that people are hanging up when they are phoned and told they are a close contact of a positive case.  This sounds alarming, but it is factual.  People are revolting in a dangerous way.  We need rapid testing to get people back onside.<\/p>  <p>  All of our strategic decisions around Covid are based on critical care bed capacity and the fear of our hospitals being overwhelmed.  We have to close down our economy because our bed capacity is totally inadequate.  This is due to the abject failure of the HSE over many years to proactively manage our health system.  The country and its people are now paying an enormous price for the years of failure in the administration and political oversight of the health service.  The alarm bells have been deafening for many years.  We now have a healthcare system that cannot handle a winter crisis, never mind a pandemic.  We throw money at the problem, but we do not see results.<\/p>  <p>  Issues such as these must be tackled without delay.  The next six weeks cannot simply be about suppressing a virus that will come out to join us again after the Christmas celebrations.  This lockdown must be a time to tackle the problems that have led us to where we are now.  Everything must be scrutinised, every success recorded, every failure rectified and every alternative analysed.  We must use this time to harness the medical and healthcare industry to investigate and implement additional initiatives to urgently increase high-level bed capacity.<\/p>  <p>  The shock and harsh reality of the closure has again hit our bewildered business community.  This further lockdown will have incredibly negative consequences for business.  To address this the Government has introduced the Covid restrictions support scheme, CRSS.

We are.  Anyone who speaks with absolute certainty about the coronavirus is probably bluffing.  We have learned a lot about this virus, and we have a lot yet to learn about it.  We have learned a lot about how to handle a pandemic, and we have a lot yet to learn about it.  We are always rethinking and varying our strategy as facts change and as new evidence becomes available.<\/p>  <p>  Bed capacity is always a concern.  It is an issue but in many ways the position in this regard has been overstated in recent weeks.  Since the start of the year we have added 800 beds to the hospital system, 400 acute and 400 sub-acute and 30 additional ICU beds, with more to come.  As things stand, there are approximately 300 or so patients in hospital with Covid.  They are occupying that number of hospital beds out of a total of 11,000.  There are approximately 35 patients in ICU with Covid and they are occupying that number of ICU beds out of a total of approximately 280.  It is only when the total number of people in ICU goes over 280 that the ICU system goes from green to amber, let alone red.<\/p>  <p>  A rough measure of overcrowding in hospitals is the number of patients on trolleys.  Today, it is 133 and many of those people are on trolleys because they need to be isolated, not because a bed is not available.  That is down 65% on this time last year and 66% on the previous year.  In fact, the number of patients on trolleys and the level of overcrowding in hospitals is probably at an all-time low.  Indicative of this is the fact that the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, still produces a daily count but no longer produces a monthly count.  That is because these are the months with the lowest numbers on record in terms of overcrowding.  That may not come across sometimes in the debate about this matter.<\/p>  <p>  The CRSS is being run by the Revenue Commissioners and will open to applications this week, if not next week, and will apply any time we are at level 3 or above.  It will kick in retrospectively from the budget date for that reason.  The way it works is that any company whose premises is closed as a result of a Government order can claim a weekly grant based on its previous turnover.

These defects often include, for example, a lack of fire-stopping between apartments, inadequate provision of fire doors and significant levels of water ingress, where water is progressively damaging the structural integrity of the buildings.  This not only places enormous cost of anything from &euro;10,000 to &euro;60,000 on those homeowners, it also causes significant stress.  In cases where groups of apartment owners are unable to provide funding for remediation works quickly enough, they may, for example, lose insurance provision on the properties, as well as other difficulties.<\/p><p>The question one must ask is why this is the case.  The first part of the answer is that it results from very bad building practices by far too many developers and builders during the Celtic tiger years.  However, this is not just a private matter between builders and home purchasers.  Builders were only able to get away with shoddy building practices because the regulatory regime in place at the time was far too weak.  In fact, in the late 1980s and early 1990s when the D&aacute;il debated the legal underpinning of that legislative regime, a small number of Deputies warned that light touch self-regulation would result in homeowners spending large sums of money on defective properties without adequate consumer protection.  Unfortunately, those Deputies were correct.  In December 2017, the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government published a report that I authored, entitled Safe as Houses.  It made a series of recommendations to the Government, including to introduce a latent defects redress scheme to provide non-judicial mechanisms for resolution of these issues and funding for effective householders.  Unfortunately, the previous Government was absolutely deaf to the calls from these families for support.  Time and again, the then Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, and the then Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, repeated the mantra that it was a private matter between purchasers and sellers.<\/p><p>I acknowledge the enormous work of the Construction Defects Alliance, a campaign group set up by the families affected.  I welcome the commitment in the programme for Government to examine this issue based on the recommendations of the Safe as Houses report.  It is a very welcome step that the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, has met the Construction Defects Alliance and is putting in place a working group to see what redress can be put in place for these homeowners.  <\/p><p>That said, I have several concerns.  Like me, the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, has direct experience of meeting families in our constituencies who are affected by this issue.  I do not doubt his sincerity in wishing to resolve the matter.  However, I am concerned that the programme for Government only refers to loans, rather than direct grant support.  I am also concerned that the working group that has been set up will not report until summer next year and that no provision was included in budget 2021 to, at least, kick-start a latent defects redress scheme next year, a measure Sinn F&eacute;in provided for in our alternative budget.<\/p><p>The Bill gives the Minister power by way of regulations to put in place a latent defects redress board and a latent defects redress scheme with adequate funding.  That would provide a one-stop shop for people affected by latent defects to get information and advice.  It would provide for a non-judicial mediation and resolution service to get the defects resolved and for a fund part-funded by industry and part-funded by the Exchequer to cover the cost in circumstances where the developer is no longer trading and is unable to foot the bill for the defects that it caused in the first instance.<\/p> <p>Obviously, I will engage constructively with the Minister's working group, but we now have an opportunity to do right by people who, through no fault of their own, are living in unsafe and defective buildings.  Let us not wait until 2022 to support these families.  Let us put in place a robust defects scheme for all those affected by latent defects early in 2021, get the funding provided, start to provide the remediation and then take it from there.  That is what the Bill tries to do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102200027#Z01200","speaker":"1468","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1603368600,"counter":248,"content":"<p>Is the Bill opposed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102200028#AA00200","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1603368600,"counter":249,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102200028#AA00300","speaker":"1474"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1603368600,"counter":250,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1603368600,"counter":251,"content":"<p>Since this is a Private Members' Bill, Second Stage must, under Standing Orders, be taken in Private Members' time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102200028#AA00500","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1603368600,"counter":252,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be taken in Private Members' time.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102200028#AA00600","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1603368600,"counter":253,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Residential Tenancies (Extension of Eviction Ban) Bill 2020: First Stage","time":1603368600,"counter":254,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102200028#AA00800"},{"type":"speech","time":1603368600,"counter":255,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThat leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to extend the ban on evictions and rent increases and for that purpose to amend the Residential Tenancies Act 2004. <\/blockquote>  <p>At the start of this month as it became clear that we were facing a second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic and a second wave of restrictions, we drafted this Bill to restore the full ban on evictions and rent increases.  Solidarity-People Before Profit submitted it three weeks ago.  I am pleased to finally get a chance to introduce it in the House today.  It is very timely given that the Government has at last accepted the need for action on this.  I believe this Bill, which restores a full ban on evictions and rent increases for six months and which can be extended due the coronavirus or due to the housing crisis, provides a much better way to address the issue than the Government's much watered-down version.<\/p><p>The Government has finally caved in to pressure.  It has agreed to restore an eviction ban, but it is proposing to allow evictions to restart from 13 December, which would mean families across the country could receive an eviction notice with their Christmas cards over the holidays.  It really is Scrooge-like on the part of the Government.  The alternative Solidarity-People Before Profit evictions ban would provide at least six months of protection from eviction for people and would cost the State nothing.  However, the Government seems to be more concerned about protecting the rights of corporate landlords and vulture funds than it is about protecting working-class people from eviction this Christmas.<\/p><p>People have made enormous sacrifices to fight this virus.  Many have lost income or lost jobs.  They should not also lose their homes.  That is why we are introducing this Bill to provide safety and security to those who need it during the emergency.  The Government is effectively saying that it is okay for landlords to evict tenants even when the country is at level 3 or level 4 because the landlord wants a higher sale price for the home by evicting the tenants and then selling it empty.  It highlights the Government's priorities.  At level 4 people cannot call over to family and friends for tea, but the landlord can come to throw them out.  Family gatherings are not allowed but gatherings of bailiffs or hired thugs throwing tenants out is perfectly fine.  Where is the logic in that?<\/p><p>This is not just hypothetical.  We saw the impact of the eviction ban in reducing the numbers of people entering homelessness in recent months.  In August, we saw the brutal eviction of tenants in Phibsborough almost as soon as the previous ban was lifted.  Since the ban has been lifted, I have been contacted by many people in my constituency faced with attempted evictions by landlords.  The Government cannot pretend it is not aware of that.  If it allows evictions again from mid-December, we will have more evictions like that.  That is why we instead propose a complete ban on evictions and rent increases as we had earlier in the year.<\/p><p>I also refer to the need for a ban on rent increases.  Earlier this year, the Government accepted the need for a blanket ban on increases in rent during the crisis.  However, now that we are going back into lockdown, it is refusing to restore that ban.  This is very straightforward.  At the very least there should be a rent freeze during the crisis.  In reality we need to reduce rents to affordable levels.  How on earth can the Government justify allowing landlords to hike up rents during the pandemic?  Even by its own capitalist logic, what choice to tenants have?  Are they to shop around and move into a new place?  The reality is that landlords have tenants over a barrel.  That is why we would restore the complete blanket ban on rent increases.  Instead the Government has established a convoluted process that puts the responsibility on tenants and in reality most do not even know about that.  That is just so the Government can claim to be doing something while backing up the big landlords.  It is simply not good enough and our Bill would put an end to it.<\/p><p>Even before the Covid crisis, we had a housing and homelessness crisis.  For years, we have been calling for a complete ban in evictions.  When we introduced the comprehensive anti-evictions Bill in 2018, we argued that it could have a real impact in reducing homelessness.  We saw earlier this year that that was accurate.  That Bill passed Second Stage and has been blocked by the Government on the spurious grounds of a money message.  Beyond this pandemic, we need such a comprehensive ban.  Even more, we need a complete change of housing policy in the State.  Instead of a government of landlords and developers we need a left government with socialist policies, willing to stand up to corporate power.  We need not just a ban on evictions; we need to cut rents, build public housing, and bring into public ownership the properties run by corporate landlords, vulture funds, REITs, etc.<\/p><p>Right now, the bear minimum we can do is to restore the complete ban on evictions and rent increases during the present crisis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102200028#AA00900","speaker":"1628"},{"type":"speech","time":1603368600,"counter":256,"content":"<p>Is the Bill opposed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102200028#AA01000","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1603368600,"counter":257,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102200028#AA01100","speaker":"1474"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1603368600,"counter":258,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1603368600,"counter":259,"content":"<p>Since this is a Private Members' Bill, Second Stage must, under Standing Orders, be taken in Private Members' time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102200028#AA01300","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1603368600,"counter":260,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be taken in Private Members' time.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102200028#AA01400","speaker":"1628"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1603368600,"counter":261,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Estimates for Public Services 2020: Message from Select Committee","time":1603368600,"counter":262,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102200028#AA01600"},{"type":"speech","time":1603368600,"counter":263,"content":"<p>The Select Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence has completed its consideration of Votes 28, 35 and 36 for the year ending 31 December 2020.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102200028#AA01700","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Health (Preservation and Protection and other Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act) 2020 - Part 3: Motion (Resumed)","time":1603368600,"counter":264,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102200028#AA01800"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1603368600,"counter":265,"content":"<p>The following motion was moved by the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly on 22 October 2020:<\/p><p><\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1603368600,"counter":266,"content":"<p>Debate resumed on amendment No. 1:<\/p><p>- Deputy David Cullinane<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1603368600,"counter":267,"content":"<p>I trust the Minister will come in for the remainder of this debate.  Before the break, I was saying we would be much better off concentrating on building solidarity through clear messaging because the messaging has been very weak so far.  It is really important to bring the public along with any new restrictions to ensure they see that there is a logic to those, that they are reasonable and that there is a basis for introducing them rather than just guesswork.<\/p>  <p>  The main way to build solidarity is by providing political leadership in this and the Government being seen to play its part fully.  Regrettably, that has not been the case in recent times, most notably in respect of all the promises on testing and tracing.  This was the mainstay of the Government plan and at no point has that system was worked properly or to the extent that was required.  What happened last week on tracing is very regrettable.  It is very hard to understand why people in government seem to have been taken by surprise about that.  This was flagged very clearly two weeks ago by Dr. Anne Dee when she talked about the pressures on public health staff who were doing the tracing.  It has been flagged for a long time that public health has been a very neglected area.  Many people did not even know it existed until the pandemic broke out.  That is some time ago now.  We know that the sector has been under-resourced.  It is critical at all times, but especially during a pandemic.<\/p> <p>Then one must ask why staffing levels in public health are so poor.  We have about a third of the number of public health doctors that are required and which other countries of comparable size have.  Why have we not increased the staffing numbers since then?  Why is there no such thing as a public health consultant?  Some of these things were referred to in the budget but the Irish Medical Organisation told the Joint Committee on Health yesterday that no progress has been made on those at all and there has been no engagement.  Is it any surprise that the tracing system runs into difficulties when the service is so under-resourced?  A report published last year showed that we were 700 public health nurses short of the recommended level.  They play such a critical role at community level in public health generally as well as the response to Covid.  Not only have we not made any movement in increasing the numbers by the recommended 700 posts, but there are about 40 fewer public health nurses than there were at the start of the year.  At the start of the year, our under-supply of critical care beds was identified.  Even after the big-spending budget, where there was a complete lack of ambition in increasing the critical care beds to a recommended level, at the end of next year there will still be about 200 critical care beds short of what had been recommended prior to Covid, indeed that which was recommended ten years ago.  Is it any wonder that people get cynical and ask why the Government is not playing its part in those critical areas?  Last March, the Minister was given the power to introduce regulations concerning foreign travel, for example, but the situation has got progressively worse since then, with no effective monitoring.  We started with some level of monitoring but there has been none in the past couple of months.  There are no safeguards at all in travel.  I was interested when I heard the Minister on the radio this morning when he spoke on this and spoke of introducing a system to self-isolate for five days and then introduce a PCR test for people travelling from red list countries.  What has the Minister been doing in recent months?  When are we likely to have any kind of safeguards at airports?  That is why people ask \"Why should I do this if the Government does not play its part?\"  That is the fundamental message from this.  The Government was given an opportunity to play its part across a range of areas but, regrettably, it has been found short in what it has managed to do. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102200028#AA02000","speaker":"1567","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1603369200,"counter":269,"content":"<p>This is a very important debate.  I will address the Deputy's last point first: the Government is playing its part in that it is the duty of the Government to pass adequate funding to develop the health services.  In this huge crisis, we have a budget like never before.  There are significant supports in place.  There are issues with the HSE and how it is operating.  I am very concerned about testing and tracing in my constituency.  Two primary schools have contacted me this week.  One had a positive test from a child over the weekend.  The school was contacted on Monday, they contacted the public health section of the north-east HSE and still had not received a reply by close of business last night.  In a second school, a second child in the same class has tested positive for Covid.  The two children are in different pods within that classroom.  While the class is at home, the teacher is concerned that she may have passed it on to children in another part of school where she also worked.  There is a huge responsibility on the HSE to ensure that primary school principals receive a response to their very serious request when a school has a positive case with a child.  It is not acceptable to me that I should have received two calls from teachers yesterday who at 8 p.m. and 9 p.m. last night, were very distressed and concerned about the children in the school.  That is a test that we are not passing right now in Louth.  The public health section is not doing its work which is entirely unacceptable.<\/p>  <p>  A hotline for school principals has been suggested so that they could contact the public health manager.  The schools have made the contacts but they have not received any response at all.  It was also proposed that there could be an online meeting at which schools could get a direct reply and where public health officials could reassure the teachers so that they could reassure the students and parents.  <\/p>  <p>  The legislation to extend the sunset clause is very important but ultimately the answer to this is literally in our own hands.  It is up to each individual to play their part.  Regardless of any rules which the Government brings in, it is up to people to make up their own minds on them.  It is particularly unfair on the Garda who are doing a fantastic job in very difficult circumstances.  The last thing a garda needs is to go to a house where there is a party and people congregating inside and outside.  That is fine in normal circumstances but not when Covid-19 is rampant.  I support what the garda&iacute; are doing, that they will engage with people first and encourage them to cease the activity, advise them of their error in public order and health, persuade them and last, and finally, use the penalties, which are graduated.  It is important to stress that.  The garda&iacute; are very helpful.  It is a very difficult time for them, too.  It is the exceptional cases where penalties must be imposed.  That is at the heart of the legislation and the intention of the garda&iacute;.<\/p>  <p>  What alternatives can be provided, particularly to young people?  How do they live in our society with Covid-19?  We should look again at the restrictions on people who want to participate in sport on their own.  I have had representations, as I am sure have all Members, from people asking why rugby and GAA can go ahead but golf cannot.  If I go to my golf course already kitted out and do not enter the club house at all, can I go around on my own?  Is that not possible?  Does it make sense, provided no one congregates in the car park afterwards?  That point has been made strongly to me.  If it is possible to play tennis, why not golf?  That is in the context of people acting with diligence.  There is also the closure of gyms, when exercise plays such an important part in the mental health and well-being of tens of thousands of our citizens.  I do not have the detail to hand but I understand that the British Parliament has proposed legislation which allow gyms to operate for people to get their exercise as a solitary, independent activity and improve their mental health and well-being in a way that involves the appropriate and required proper distancing.  It is important that we address that as it would be very helpful.  Part of the issue is that in most cases, it is the very small minority who are perpetuating Covid by not obeying the regulations.  If we can provide alternative sports for people it would be important.  <\/p>  <p> Mol an &oacute;ige, agus tiocfaidh s&iacute;.  We must praise young people and use those who influence them in how they go about things.  <\/p> <p>While young people will not listen to the Minister or me, or even to the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, they will listen to their sports idols, for example, and the people whose music they play - and who they follow and love - sometimes very loudly indeed.  We need to look again at how we get the message across to and interact more with the individuals whom young people admire.  We should seek the help of the very constructive and positive individuals who can engage with young people and whose interventions would be very welcome to them, as opposed to having a them versus us situation.  The most important thing is that we are all in it together and working together to improve the situation.<\/p> <p> Earlier, questions were raised in the House about the situation in nursing homes, with people finding themselves in very serious circumstances and, in some cases, without support.  From what I hear, no nursing support is being provided in some instances.  If there is evidence of a decision by unions and the HSE that militates against the well-being of people who are sick in private nursing homes - I believe there is such evidence - that is entirely unacceptable.  There are documents which show that, in April, an agreement was reached between a group of unions and the HSE that if a nurse is asked to go into a private nursing home, he or she cannot be mandated to do so.  If it is a public nursing home or public hospital, that is fine, but the agreement expressly states that it is optional for a nurse or other medical person to go into a private nursing home and there is a right of refusal in that regard.  I do not know what has happened in the facilities in the counties that were mentioned earlier but I am deeply concerned about it.<\/p> <p> There is clear evidence of what happened in a nursing home in County Louth.  Freedom of information requests have shown, clearly and absolutely, that, first, agency nursing staff did not turn up at the last minute and, second, that a doctor who had patients in that nursing home, while he would issue prescriptions, he had to be contacted and persuaded by medical experts in the local hospital to gown up and go in to see those patients.  These are very serious issues which are fundamental to our ability to look after and care for people, particularly in nursing homes.  There cannot be a division between public and private patients in terms of the professional assistance they are entitled to receive from medical professionals or other qualified persons.  Anything to the contrary is, in my belief, against the oath and the principle of care.  The agreement that was made between the HSE and the unions is unacceptable in that context.  People were challenging as to why HSE staff did not turn up in a particular nursing home.  I do not know happened there, but the fact is that the HSE cannot direct personnel to turn up at private facilities.  It has signed an agreement to that effect and it deeply concerns me.  We must make sure that the most vulnerable in our society are helped and that there is no barrier, including a union agreement or HSE agreement, which prevents that from happening.<\/p> <p> There are other questions that arise out of the freedom of information requests to which I referred.  Deputies from other parties know what I am talking about.  We are in a real crisis here and, in dealing with that crisis, we must have absolute clarity about how we care for people.  There cannot be a barrier or impediment to answering a cry for help from anybody, particularly those who are the weakest and most vulnerable in our society.  At this moment, the most vulnerable, because they are the ones most likely to die from Covid-19, are people aged over 65, the vast majority of whom have passed away in our nursing homes.  We cannot allow the issues I have brought to the Minister's attention to continue.  I will give him the information to which I referred and I ask him to act urgently and immediately to ensure the current situation does not continue.  I welcome the provisions set out in the motion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102200029#BB00200","speaker":"1598","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1603369800,"counter":271,"content":"<p>This motion and the preceding one deal with far-reaching laws that restrict people's liberty and freedoms in many ways.  They would be totally inappropriate in normal times but are being introduced for very good reason because we are not living in normal times.  These are very different times that nobody expected.  Where we have legislation of this nature, it is important that it be reviewed as regularly as possible to ensure we learn from what is happening in communities and from people's lived experiences.  Other Deputies have made the same point.<\/p>  <p>  One of the things that has come clearly into focus in all this is the difficulties that exist within our health service under normal circumstances.  The reality is that we have a health service that is not fit for purpose in a time of crisis.  When Covid-19 infection numbers begin to rise, people live in huge fear that our whole hospital system will be overwhelmed.  That is understandable when one considers the very tight capacity in the service.  In normal circumstances, people who need a hip replacement or cataract removal, for instance, are waiting years to see a consultant.  I spoke to somebody recently whose orthopaedic consultancy referral letter for Sligo University Hospital was met with the response that there is a 40-month waiting list to see the consultant.  That delay is not because of the Covid crisis but is in the normal course of things.  We have a huge crisis in our health service and the pandemic has magnified it and brought it much more into focus and to our attention.  We have a lot of work to do to ensure we build capacity as quickly as possible and learn from the lessons thus far.  To that end, we need to review this legislation much sooner than June next year.  We should be reviewing it at least every three months so that we have a clear sense of where we are going and what we are doing.<\/p>  <p>  Many of the problems in the health system in recent times have been down to issues around the capacity of the service.  It was necessary to act quickly to put in tracking, tracing and testing processes.  Many Deputies have referred to a particular issue in this regard and I ask the Minister to take note of it.  I, too, have been contacted by people who have encountered serious problems in regard to testing and how the system is working.  Earlier this week, I was contacted by a person in south Leitrim who had a test performed at home by ambulance service staff but, ten days later, has still not received the result.  Many others are in the same situation.  I have spoken to a number of people who tested positive for Covid and self-isolated but their family members, living in the same house, had to wait several days for a test and were still awaiting the result four or five days later.  That is happening all over the place and it undermines people's confidence in the system and in the response to the increasing infection rates.<\/p>  <p>  There are also huge problems with the tracing element.  The fact that it all fell down last weekend in terms of the numbers of infections is a reflection of that.  We know there are staff in some sectors of the HSE who have been deployed to tracing work.  The Minister and his colleagues in government should look at whether personnel in other sectors of the public service who, because of Covid, may not be working to the same levels they would be in normal times can be redeployed to ensure there are enough staff for tracing.  The lack of personnel in this area is one of the really serious problems we are facing.<\/p>  <p>  I want to refer to the situation in nursing homes, which has been brought into focus today because of the situation in a facility in County Galway.  Back in April, I conducted a small survey in my own constituency by way of telephone calls to a number of nursing homes to see how they were getting on.  At that time, personal protective equipment, PPE, was one of the main concerns people were raising.  My constituency includes a small part of north Roscommon, which is in community healthcare organisation, CHO, 2, with the remainder of the constituency in CHO 1.  Of the nursing homes I contacted, most in CHO 1 reported a positive experience.  The HSE had contacted them, they were getting PPE supplies and they were, overall, fairly satisfied with the response.  A few had problems, including a couple of nursing homes which had Covid cases, but they were being dealt with adequately.  The nursing homes in CHO 2, which covers the Galway region, were much more problematic, with management reporting that they had not been contacted by the HSE at all, they were very disappointed with the level of support they were being given and they had real and serious issues.  Perhaps that is being reflected now in the case that was reported today.  I hope that is not the case and that the level of support was uniform across the State but it certainly was not my experience.  I spoke to 12 or 14 nursing homes across my constituency in April.  While the majority were satisfied with the response, all had issues around staffing, including where they were going to get staff and having to depend on agency staffing.<\/p>  <p>  There are lessons we need to learn today from what has gone before.  In two or three months, when we are on the other side of Christmas, there will be other lessons to learn.  That is why it is important that this legislation is reviewed regularly in order to ensure we learn those lessons and apply them as we need to.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102200030#CC00200","speaker":"1607"},{"type":"speech","time":1603370400,"counter":272,"content":"<p>The prospect of level 5 restrictions for the next six weeks is a pretty grim one.  The normal social and human interaction that is the lifeblood of people will be curtailed to a very significant extent.  It is, however, necessary for a very simple reason.  For any who doubt that, and there are a few, it is necessary for the very simple reason that we cannot put our doctors and front-line health workers in a position where sick people, with Covid-19 or non-Covid related sicknesses, arrive at hospitals where there is no intensive care bed, staff or healthcare provision to look after them and they have to be turned away.  That prospect is unthinkable.  Whatever one thinks of the handling of the Covid pandemic, we simply cannot put our doctors and healthcare workers or sick people in that position.  For this reason, we have no choice but to impose restrictions to try to drive down the infection rate of the virus.<\/p>  <p>  Having said that, I do not agree with the coercive approach the Government is trying to apply, with fines and powers to act against people who the Government deems to be the problem, in sustaining the public health effort.  When the first lockdown happened there was overwhelming support for it.  There was no need for compulsion.  People did it because they knew it was necessary.  As difficult as it is, economically, psychologically, socially and in every other way, an overwhelming majority of people will endure the hardship.  The subtext or underlying logic of the extension of the coercive measures and fines proposed by the Government was summed up by Deputy O'Dowd when he said the reason we are in this situation was some people's irresponsible behaviour.  That is not the reason we are in this situation now.  I will give examples of the reasons we are in this situation.  The Government is exploiting student nurses because it has not staffed our hospitals properly.  We have critically low levels of ICU provision, some of the worst in the western world.  We will not properly pay the contact tracers we need to chase down the virus, and we have failed to recruit them.  We did not act against the meat processing plants and no fines were issued in that sector.  There is whole range of other failings by the Government and, critically, a failure to support people who are seeing their livelihoods hammered by the pandemic.  We say we should reward and support people, rather than punishing them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102200031#DD00100","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1603370400,"counter":273,"content":"<p>We are debating a proposal to extend the State's emergency powers because of the Covid crisis.  There are powerful arguments against extending these powers.  I will deal with three.  First, there is not adequate discussion and debate on the issue.  We are discussing huge curtailment of people's freedoms, including the right to move freely, the right to meet up and the right to have a livelihood.  This discussion is being compressed into the space of a few hours.  The Irish Council for Civil Liberties has said this makes a mockery of our democracy and it is hard to disagree with that.<\/p>  <p>   Second, when we debated this earlier in the year I gave examples from other countries of how emergency Covid powers were used against the interests of ordinary people.  I warned that this could and would happen here and that has proved to be case.  It was only a couple of weeks after that debate that garda&iacute; from Store Street Garda station used these powers to order the dispersal of an official picket at the Debenhams store on Henry Street.  They followed the pickets to the Luas line to make sure they left town and they even tried to break up a conversation between the shop steward and a journalist.  In other countries provisions have been put in place to ensure the right to protest is defended, even in the context of a Covid emergency.  That has not happened in this State.<\/p>  <p>  Last but not least, this is in part a discussion on the Government's strategy.  People should wear masks, curtail their contact with other people and take all the other necessary measures to push back against the virus.  I fully support all those measures.  Level 5 has been allowed to occur because the Government backed off from tackling powerful business interests.  It did this by refusing to go after the meat plant bosses, bottling on the issue of level 5 two weeks ago and failing to bring in a sick pay scheme for workers in private nursing homes, for example.  In addition, while there have been improvements in testing, tracing remains a problem.  Having failed to convince people with such a strategy, the Government has turned to coercive powers such as fines for not wearing a mask and for travelling further than 5 km and so on.  People need a strategy they can believe in, which does not bow down to vested interests.  They need to be persuaded, as they can be, rather than the Government taking the big stick.  These are all very powerful reasons to vote against this extension.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102200031#DD00200","speaker":"1522"},{"type":"speech","time":1603370400,"counter":274,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly.  I note the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, is also present.<\/p>  <p>  As a Deputy who represents Limerick city, I will speak about the latest lockdown and its impact and make a number of observations which I hope will feed into Government policy.  What exactly is the Government's policy on fighting Covid-19?  Is it a lockdown and release approach, that is, one of containment, as we are currently pursuing, or will we have measures for living with the virus?  The Government has said the policy will be based on waiting until a vaccine arrives.  By definition, this means it will adopt a policy of living with the virus, which is one I would support.<\/p>  <p>  We need to see the exit mechanism for the current lockdown.  What metrics will the Government use?  If we want people to support this current lockdown, the public is entitled to know what these metrics are.  The circumstances of the first lockdown were entirely different.  A major pandemic had broken out in Italy and the attitude of the public at the time was that we had to deal with it head on.<\/p> <p>We were coming into spring at that time.  We are now coming into the depths of winter and we need to look at things differently.  What is the process by which the Minister is going to indicate to the public that we are to exit lockdown?  I understand we have to look at two incubation cycles.  These cycles are two weeks, leading to a total of four weeks.  We must then see whether the R-nought rate is below 1 and whether there has been a reduction in the number of new cases.  NPHET has spoken about a rate of less than 0.5.  What is the Government's position?  The public needs to know.  The position must be realistic.  I welcome that the virus incidence is now broken down by district electoral division and that we can get this information every week.  People need to know what is working.  We all want to fight the virus.  The problem is that many members of the public believe that some of the measures being brought in will not assist in reducing the risk or the spread of the virus.  Measures such as the closure of golf courses and gyms and stopping tennis being played need to be explained.  <\/p> <p> What is the exit strategy?  People need to see a realistic light at the end of the tunnel.  What are the metrics to be considered before it can be indicated to the public that we can exit lockdown?  When we do, are we to go level 3?<\/p> <p> The previous lockdown had an enormous impact on various groups of people in the community, and on the elderly in particular.  I fear that many of them will find it impossible to come through this lockdown.  Support must be put in place.  Lockdown causes isolation and prevents these people from exercising in their normal way or going up the town to meet their neighbours.  These are everyday things we take for granted.  We need to look at that cohort.  We also need to consider mental illness and the impact on students during a period of their lives that should be very exciting.  They are now undertaking distance learning.  The Minister referenced this issue on \"Morning Ireland\".  It is something about which I feel very strongly.  <\/p> <p> I work in metrics.  As an accountant, I want to see discernible results and risk-based analysis.  The World Health Organization has said that, over the next six weeks, we need to straighten our position so that we can come out of lockdown and live with the virus.  We do not know when a vaccine will come so, by definition, we will have to live with the virus.  What measures are to be implemented over the next six weeks apart from the lockdown, which will, it is to be hoped, stop the virus from spreading?  It is a very crude way of doing so, however.  I would prefer a more sophisticated and risk-based way of doing so which would allow us to live with the virus.  <\/p> <p> Businesses are closing.  Many family businesses may never open again.  Businesses that have been set up are struggling.  I speak to those in the business community regularly.  I come from that background myself.  They are realistic.  They realise that the introduction of measures is now required but they want to see the metrics.  As the days and weeks go by, there may be indications that the rate is decreasing.  This should be considered on a county and electoral area basis.  Analysis should be conducted as to whether specific sectors increase risk as some do not.  This should be handled in an evolving manner.  It is to be hoped that in four weeks the R-nought rate will be well below 1 and the rate of new infections will be decreasing, but what are we going to do over the next four weeks to ensure we can come out of lockdown and live with the virus until a vaccine is found, whenever that might be?<\/p> <p> That will require us to know what the capacity in our hospitals is and whether our ICU capacity is sufficient.  We will have to know whether the number of staff in the health sector is sufficient.  We may need to examine our contact tracing arrangements.  The Minister will appreciate that what has happened over the past few days has brought the public's belief in the system into question.  There are fantastic people working in the HSE, both in contact tracing and other areas.  I deal with them on the ground.  They work seven days a week.  For us to get on top of this virus, we must be aggressive and must work collectively at every level, including the levels of Departments and of the public itself.<\/p> <p> The basics still apply.  I agree with Deputy Barry on very little but he referred to the basics such as wearing a mask, staying 2 m apart and protecting the vulnerable, including the elderly.  I am very conscious of the elderly.  I worry that many of them will be very isolated over the next four weeks.  It is very important that additional resources are allocated to ensure that they are all visited, if not by family then by services.  We must also look at the mental health side.  Over the next six weeks, I want to see what we have learnt that we can now implement so that, come the start of December, we will be able to tell the public what level we are moving to as we come out of level 5 and what metrics must be met to go to different levels.  It is important that there be a meeting of minds between Government and NPHET on these issues because everyone should be working in the common interest of the public.<\/p> <p> First and foremost, I am a Deputy for the people of the constituency of Limerick city.  I wanted to contribute to this debate to feed into Government policy.  What metrics will the Minister use to determine when to indicate to the public that we are exiting lockdown?  What is the Government's policy on Covid?  Is it a policy of lockdown and release, which is to say containment, or a policy of living with the virus?  Is it an evolving policy?  What will the Minister look for so that specific areas will not have to go into lockdown?  What metrics such as R-nought rate or number of cases will he look for?  If the number of cases is coming down, the public will need to see that they will ultimately benefit from that decrease.  <\/p> <p> Many people were exceptionally law-abiding and accepted very great restrictions on their daily lives.  These people see us going into level 5 and are saying that they did everything by the book and did nothing wrong while the system was being abused in other areas.  From speaking with the public, I believe they want to fight this virus, but they want a strategy to be put in place over the next four to six weeks that they will understand and can buy into.  They want to see the metrics that must be met to go to different levels.  They want to see that we will be able to live with the virus in our daily lives and will keep the schools open, which is very important, get the colleges back to some level of normality, and allow businesses to reopen.  Many businesses were able to operate under level 3, albeit with great difficulty.  What is the Minister's plan for the next six weeks so that, by the end of that period, we can exit level 5?  What is the strategy for living with, and the fully enhanced risk-based model for fighting, this dreadful virus, which has had an enormous impact on our lives, based on definable metrics and understandable empirical evidence, so that the public will understand?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102200031#DD00300","speaker":"1593","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1603371000,"counter":276,"content":"<p>There are reports today that 26 out of 28 patients at a nursing home in Galway have tested positive for Covid-19.  One of these residents has died, and our hearts and prayers are with that resident's family.  The nursing home said that it received no help from the HSE and that, for the past 72 hours, one nurse and one care assistant attended all those patients.  That is an absolute scandal.<\/p> <p>Regarding the oceans of rhetoric that existed around the issue of Covid-19 for the past seven months, the most important element always should have been the protection of those nursing homes.  Men and women in nursing homes are by far the most vulnerable and the most exposed to this illness.  The majority of deaths from Covid so far have happened in nursing homes.  That is incredible because I asked the Minister a number of times to investigate what happened in the nursing homes after the first wave at the start of the year.  I asked the then Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, to do the same.  Both Ministers refused point blank to do an investigation into the nursing homes.  We heard rhetoric about learning new things, etc., yet we have a situation today where a nursing home in Galway is ravaged by Covid-19.  It is so frustrating to get one's head around the fact that no investigation was held into what happened at the start of the year, and now we are seeing it happen again.<\/p> <p> I refer to the case of Mary Bartley Meehan, in my constituency.  Her husband was in a nursing home.  He had a cancerous tumour on his face.  When Mary visited him, she noticed that his fingernails were too long and that he had scratched the facial tumour to such an extent it had become infested with maggots.  I asked the then Minister, Deputy Simon Harris, and the current Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, to carry out an investigation into that family's situation.  Both Ministers said, \"No\"; the HSE said, \"No\"; HIQA, said \"No\"; and the Department of Health says, \"No\".  <\/p> <p> We had to listen to Deputy Fergus O'Dowd earlier looking to get the Government's defence in early with regard to what has happened in Galway.  He sought to build a paper wall between the State and private nursing homes and to wash the Government's hands with regard to responsibility for nursing homes.  That is incredible.  The Minister and the Government are responsible for what happens in all nursing homes.  All nursing homes should be available to be investigated.  There should be no paper wall stopping that.<\/p> <p> The Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, is in the Chamber.  He might recall that I asked him to look into how we can investigate what happened in Mary Bartley Meehan's case.  I mentioned at the time that the Ombudsman stated that there is great frustration in his office that they do not have the power to investigate what is happening in private nursing homes.  According to the programme for Government, the Government will investigate what is happening in private nursing homes yet we are not near that point.  It is very frustrating to see it happen again.<\/p> <p> The previous speaker, Deputy O'Donnell, asked what Government policy is with regard to living with Covid-19.  Let us be very clear.  There is no Government policy beyond six weeks.  There is no exit plan out of this other than a vaccine.  That is incredible.  I spoke to the HSE earlier and asked if there is a chance to get a vaccine to the population of this country by the end of 2021.  A definitive answer was not given but I could tell by the tone of voice that it is very unlikely that 60% of the population of this State will have a vaccine by the end of 2021.  That means we will be continuing in this situation indefinitely with a Covid yo-yo policy, which is having major detrimental, negative effects on the whole of society.<\/p> <p> Do not get me wrong.  This is a serious illness.  We need to do our best to keep those numbers down and, like all previous speakers, I believe we need to do the simple stuff right but we also need to learn to live with this illness.  There is a cost to Covid but there is a significant and real cost to the restrictions.  It is a cost that the Government cannot quantify because in seven months it has not researched the cost of restrictions with regard to mortality, morbidity, mental health or any of those issues.  We are pushing hundreds of thousands of people into poverty, and that will cause morbidity and mortality in the future.<\/p> <p> The idea of imposing fines on a population that is radically losing their income and being pushed out of work is incredible.  Levying fines on the population is equal to the Government raising a white flag and saying, \"We have lost\".  They lost the support of the population in the first wave.  The energy, commitment and focus of the population was singular in reducing the numbers.  The Government has changed the policy on fines because it knows it has lost the support of a significant section of the population on that issue.  <\/p> <p> The Government is taking draconian measures.  Ireland is an outlier in European terms with regard to the severity of restrictions.  Even in Paris, with its restrictions, people can attend church services, shop and go to restaurants.  Why is Ireland an outlier in respect of restrictions when in reality we are mid-table in the incidence of the illness?  There are two reasons for that.  First, our tracking and tracing system has crashed; it is as simple as that.  We can no longer extinguish the virus where it exists through tracking and tracing.  The second reason is we do not have the ICU capacity of other countries.  A budget totalling &euro;18 billion was announced last week yet the Government hardly moved the dial with regard to the increase in the number of ICU beds.  The front line of the Covid-19 battle rests on the shoulders of the people because the Government has not put in the necessary defences in tracking and tracing.  At the start of this year there were 2,000 tracers in the country; there are only 500 now.  How does it happen that we go backwards in the number of people employed by the State to trace this illness?<\/p> <p> There was a sense of frustration across the country today when the news unfolded that 26 out of 27 residents of a nursing home in Galway had caught Covid-19 and that the nursing home called out for help and received none.  It had two staff members-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102200032#EE00200","speaker":"1504","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1603371600,"counter":278,"content":"<p>That is a flat-out lie.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102200033#FF00200","speaker":"1623"},{"type":"speech","time":1603371600,"counter":279,"content":"<p>This was reported by a very eminent GP in the area today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102200033#FF00300","speaker":"1504"},{"type":"speech","time":1603371600,"counter":280,"content":"<p>That is-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102200033#FF00400","speaker":"1623"},{"type":"speech","time":1603371600,"counter":281,"content":"<p>Minister-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102200033#FF00500","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1603371600,"counter":282,"content":"<p>I will take the advice of the Minister.

I will not be agreeing with this vote this evening, tomorrow or whenever it is.  It means that the Government is now moving from a co-operation phase to a surveillance and oversight phase to enforce Covid-19 compliance.  People are scared.  The elderly people are on their own and are scared alive of the media reports on top of them every minute and hour about the numbers and those who are dying every day.  Does the Minister realise that the number of deaths is down 12% compared to last year?  There is a shift in demographics.<\/p>  <p>  I have full respect for Covid-19 and its dangers but we have certainly gone too far because the Government is not sticking to the basics.  The tracking and tracing has not been done right nor has testing.  The Government is saying that it is doing so many tests per day.  It is using the old system where one pulls up at the roadside and gets tested.  Why does it not do what we did in Bandon last week where people came down from Belfast to bring 30 people to Northern Ireland for operations?  They had their results within an hour of having had their tests done in my own clinic.  The Government system is outdated.  It is wasting time and money.  People are suffering with their mental health and the elderly and ordinary people are suffering.<\/p>  <p>  A woman rang me today to say that her husband went out to work, her child went to secondary school, her other two children are told to stay at home from college and educate themselves at home, and she cannot go outside beyond a 5 km radius.  She said that things are more in than out; more people cannot move.  What is wrong with the country?  Where are we going?  We do not have any common sense and the real reason is that we have not stuck to the basics and tried to keep people on side, to educate them and work with them on these basics.  One has to work with people.  People are frustrated and business people have lost their businesses.  This has gone one step too far.<\/p>  <p>  The Government sat back and is now turning it over to the garda&iacute; to carry out the rules and regulations that are there.  It should stick to the basics and gets its testing done properly.  It is like what Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n has described as a yo-yo system.  People will be tested and will be off sitting at home for the next number of weeks, will be back out again and will be sent home again about a month later.  It is a game and the whole thing is upside down.  People can see through it and are becoming very frustrated.  If we do not toe the line we will be criticised but I will certainly not be toeing this line.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102200034#GG01800","speaker":"1461"},{"type":"speech","time":1603372200,"counter":308,"content":"<p>A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I say first to Deputy O&rsquo;Donnell that I have the height of respect for him.  He was here and he did speak for his 11 minutes but there are many other Deputies who are not turning up.  We cannot possibly follow through like this when one is part of a smaller group.<\/p>  <p>  This is not going to work.  There are too many glitches and bad marks in this.  The testing is a fiasco.  I have emails every other day of people who want a test, cannot get a test and who had a test and are waiting two weeks.  One woman I spoke to waited 41 days for a test.  It is just not working.  The tracing collapsed, as we know, at the weekend.  It was not working in any event.  A hotel owner contacted me where someone had tested positive.  She was told that if she was to act properly she should close.  She could get not get an answer from the HSE and was then told to forget about it as it was only a 48-hour test.  The whole thing is a shambles.<\/p>  <p>  I oppose this renewed legislation as it gives the Minister the power to do literally anything he likes.  It is like signing a blank cheque up to June 2021.  Everyone bought into this initially.  The public, young and old from the cradle to the grave bought into this the first time, but we see the Government misbehaving, however, we see the shambles in the testing, we see the fake numbers and the fake news, we see the Minister and what is after happening in one unfortunate nursing home - I do not want to add any more misery - and we are told that it is costing &euro;12.5 million to keep the nursing homes tested, which we must do.  Why is the Government sticking to the polymerase chain reaction, PCR, test when it has been proven all over the world not be accurate?  Deputy Kelly and many others have brought forward other tests and the results of these can be available within an hour.  Deputy Collins brought people to Belfast for eye treatment last week and brought a doctor down from Belfast to his constituency office and had 20 people tested.  They all had their results within an hour.  What kind of incompetence is within the HSE and in the Minister&rsquo;s Department that they cannot get the testing or tracing right?<\/p>  <p>  People have lost faith and the Government has lost the battle.  We were told that everybody was in this together.  N&iacute; neart go cur le ch&eacute;ile.  The rich are getting richer.  The banks and the vulture funds are still doing what they like.  Evictions and court cases have being ongoing and are terrorising families all through the first time as well as now.  A double act is going on here.  Big companies and conglomerates are getting richer and richer.  The World Health Organization and Dr. David Nabarro, envoy to the United Nations, has stated that lockdowns have not worked and that they are regressive on the poorer and less well-off people and do damage to mental health and so on.  The World Health Organization also said that the 2 m distancing was not necessary but the Government insisted upon it here in Ireland.  This Government wants to persecute and destroy the energy, enthusiasm, the passion, the very vigour and vim of the Irish people.  It will not succeed.  The people here 100 years ago fought for their freedom and they now have to go out to fight a tyranny that this Government wants to introduce.<\/p>  <p>  I want to salute An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in Tipperary, Dublin and all over the country.  It is doing its best.  It does not know what regulations it is operating because these are changing so any times.  If we pass this legislation, which I and my Independent group will vote against, the Government will have the power to bring in whatever instrument it likes.  This would not happen under Hitler.  It is scandalous what is going on.  We are supposed to be a democracy.  Where are the Members in this big place that we are paying &euro;25,000 a day for in order to come in to speak?  Where are they?  Have they gone under a stone?  Are they hiding?  The elected representatives of the people should be representing the people who are terrorised and very cross and angry and getting crosser.  The churches are closed.  Only two other countries in the world, North Korea and Saudi Arabia, have closed their churches for worship.  This is a shocking tyranny and is a terrible treatment of the people.  Come back Se&aacute;n Tracey and Dan Breen and the magnificent men of Tipperary who fired the first shots in the War of Independence.

First, it is clear that level 3 simply did not work.  Even in counties at level 4 - Cavan, Dublin and Donegal - the numbers remained too high.  If we want to reduce the number of cases to a level where our hospitals can cope with Covid and, crucially, non-Covid care, schools can remain open and our care homes can be just that then level 5 is needed.<\/p> <p> A number of my colleagues referred to a nursing home in Galway.  I heard Dr. Martin Daly speak about what happened there.  What was very interesting was that at the end of his interview, Dr. Daly stated that this situation showed the need to move to level 5.  Of course level 5 has to be part of a suite of measures.  This motion has to be part of a suite of measures.  My time is very limited.

Most of us should, as democrats, believe that debate is important.  This needs to be debated.<\/p>  <p>  Giving Deputies 50 seconds each to debate what is the most fundamental set of restrictions to rights in this State in its history is not democracy.  I agree with the points made by Deputy O'Donnell.  I disagree with him to the extent that until the questions he asked are answered &ndash; I do not expect that the Minister will answer them &ndash; we should not roll over further powers.  I agree very much with the points he raised and the questions he posed.<\/p>  <p>  We need to debate this motion.  If we do not debate it in the Chamber, where is it to be debated?  Is it to be debated on social media, where people are attacking each other?  Is it to be debated outside the gates of Leinster House by violent groups attacking each other?  I want to be abundantly clear.  I abhor violence, in particular political violence, because it brings people down a cul-de-sac of destruction.  However, if the Government does not allow us time to debate this motion in the House, it will be debated elsewhere.  I do not condone or sympathise with that point, I am simply making it.<\/p>  <p>  I grew up in a house with elderly parents.  They were of a generation which believed that it was fantastic that we had the right to determine our own affairs and had a D&aacute;il that could determine its affairs.  Today represents for me the most fundamental failing of that State in its history.  The State has a duty to protect the health and lives of its citizens, but it equally has a duty to allow people to go about their lives and develop systems to keep them safe while they do so.<\/p>  <p>  The State has singularly failed to do that, and to take any measures, learn anything from the nursing homes and look at the recommendations of the Covid committee.  Nineteen Deputies from every single group in the House sat and arrived at a consensus document with recommendations, none of which have been debated or implemented.  What is the point in parliamentary democracy?  I know there are groups in this State that seek to undermine democracy and parliamentary debate.  This failure to debate things adequately feeds into their agenda.  I ask the Minister to consider the approach he has taken in this motion and to allow for debate before he rams votes through and gives Ministers another seven months to bring in incredibly restrictive measures that are entirely disproportionate and that absolve the State of its failures rather than provide it with any incentive to do something.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to return to one of Deputy Mattie McGrath's points.  I do not know whether the Minister is aware of one measure in the motion but he must be because he signed it.  Priests will be committing a criminal offence if they open the doors of their churches for mass.  I know that lots of priests do not want to say mass and do not believe it is appropriate.  That is their prerogative.  I am not a mass goer, but I know how important it is in the community I represent for people to go to mass or to a church or mosque.  The Government is denying them that.  Is the Government is going to send garda&iacute; after priests who decide to say mass?  If the Government is thinking of that, I have one word to say, \"Don't\".<\/p>  <p>  My time is up.  I thank the Minister.  I have not had time to look at the substance of any of what is proposed, the failings of our testing and tracing system and the inevitable failing of the PCR testing system.  It may be the best test available, but it is inadequate.

I agree with the sentiment.  As I have said in the Chamber, I do not believe there were sufficient Opposition briefings at the start of the pandemic.  I have been working hard in the background to make that happen.  There have been several briefings in the past number of weeks.  There were Opposition briefings on level 5 and, I believe, level 3.  Various Deputies contact me privately on a regular basis and I do my best to keep them up to date in that way.<\/p>  <p>  There was a briefing with the HSE earlier today, that, as Deputy Cullinane said, unfortunately coincided with this debate which health spokespersons would want to attend.  There were operational issues and even last night the D&aacute;il scheduled was moving around.  There was no intent there.  There was a briefing on tiered penalties.  Deputy Cullinane said I had not been made available.  The Deputy and I spoke afterwards.  I offered to brief the committee, and we offered a briefing from officials before the meeting if the committee so wished.  That is what the health committee decided on.<\/p>  <p>  I hear Deputies loud and clear.  My preference is for as much interaction and briefing as possible.  I do not think there was enough at the start and I am very happy to put my hands up on that.  We have pushed for many more briefings.  We now have standing fortnightly briefings in place.  The CMO's office and HSE are involved.  I am available to Deputies at any time.  There have been briefings with the Taoiseach.  We will endeavour to keep going and I hope Deputies have seen a difference in the past number of weeks.  The change is one I intend to keep. <\/p>  <p>  Deputy Cullinane referenced North-South co-operation.  I want to agree with him but I also want to push back, if I may.  There has been extensive interaction north and south of the Border between the authorities in the Six Counties and those in the Twenty-six Counties.<\/p> <p>There has been extensive interaction between the Northern Ireland minister, Mr. Swann, and me, between the Taoiseach and the Northern Ireland First Minister and deputy First Minister, and between our Chief Medical Officer and the Northern Ireland Chief Medical Officer.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, and I had one of the so-called quads recently with the Northern Ireland First Minister and Deputy First Minister as well as the Secretary of State and the CMO.  There is a good deal of interaction.  There is also interaction at a medical level, for example, between our intensivists north and south of the Border.  There is a good deal of interaction.  I would like to see an all-island approach.  Considerable effort has been made.<\/p> <p> I want to challenge Deputy Cullinane in turn because his party is uniquely positioned to help with this.  While I accept his challenge that we continue to do everything we can, I maintain that Sinn F&eacute;in needs to do everything it can as well given that it is in government in Northern Ireland.  Obviously, it is the largest party in opposition here.  I would like to see Sinn F&eacute;in do everything it can as well.<\/p> <p> Several Members have, quite fairly, asked for a helpline or even an email address that is responsive.  I know one was set up when I was in opposition, although I am unsure whether I ever got a response from that email address.  An email address on its own is not enough.  It needs to be one from which Deputies get an answer.  This came up previously and I have committed to it.  I will get back to Deputies on that.  I fully understand.  Deputies, councillors and Senators are getting questions every day from the people they represent throughout the country.  Every representative wants correctly to be able to get back and give the right information.  Deputy Kelly referenced the same matter.<\/p> <p> Various statements were made indicating it was not fair for big stores to sell food as well as non-essential items.  This happened in the first wave.  I agree, and I want to clarify for the House that it is not so much the stores that are deemed essential but the relevant goods that are deemed essential.  A store cannot sell food in one part of the store and clothes in another part of the store.  An example was given to me last night of a sports outlet that was going to start selling personal protective equipment so that it could also sell its normal sports apparel.  That is not allowed.  Such an outlet would be allowed to sell PPE but not the sports apparel.  I agree with Deputies that this would be completely unfair.<\/p> <p> Deputy Durkan raised the issue of compliance.  Deputy Boyd Barrett and Deputy Barry had a different view on compliance.  We will be discussing at some length the tiered penalty legislation tomorrow.  I fully agree with Deputies, however, that it is relevant to the motion before us because it would essentially allow that legislation to operate.<\/p> <p> I put it to Deputies that in the vast majority of cases what we are doing with tiered penalties is reducing the severity of the existing penalties.  The only penalty available at the moment is a so-called penal provision.  That involves a court case and a penalty of a fine of up to &euro;2,500 and up to six months in prison.  I do not believe that is appropriate in the majority of cases.  What we are seeking to do is replace that with something more appropriate, for example, a &euro;50 on-the-spot fine.  This legislation is not about expanding enforcement but making it more appropriate.  The single tool available now is not appropriate.<\/p> <p> Deputy McNamara made an impassioned contribution on places of worship.  I have considerable sympathy with him in that regard.  As with the rest of level 5, we are following the public health advice on places of worship.  I am happy to go back and challenge NPHET to provide the evidence again because I agree that this is a major imposition.  I assure the Deputy and other colleagues that with regard to penalties, religious services are non-penal in that there is no penalty attached to them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102200035#HH00500","speaker":"1623","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1603373400,"counter":321,"content":"<p>That is not true.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102200036#JJ00200","speaker":"1518"},{"type":"speech","time":1603373400,"counter":322,"content":"<p>It should not be there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102200036#JJ00300","speaker":"1612"},{"type":"speech","time":1603373400,"counter":323,"content":"<p>I signed the regulations last night and I assure Deputies that it is a non-penal provision and it will remain thus.<\/p>  <p>  Golf has been mentioned many times.  Some people have been suggesting that tennis was allowed.  It is not.  Tennis Ireland has withdrawn the comment it made.  Essentially, no sports are getting an exemption.  The exemption is for elite and professional sports, for reasons we all understand.  They are professional or semi-professional and operate in controlled, safe environments.  Some people want golf to be an exemption, while others argue that tennis, athletics, gyms or personal training in gyms and so forth should be exempt.  We cannot be in the business of saying that a wide variety of sports are all banned except this or that one.  That is simply not credible and does not correspond to the public health advice we have.  Most sports could make a reasonable argument - many are doing so - that their sport is different and that while it is okay to ban all other sports, their particular sport is okay because it is safe, unique and different.  I hope Deputies appreciate that we simply cannot go down that route.  If we do, where do we stop?  That is the public health advice we have on sports.  I pushed hard for training for school-age children to be included on a non-contact basis in pods of 15 for mental and physical health reasons and because it lines up with keeping the schools open.  That is the exemption.<\/p>  <p>  There has been much talk about a particular nursing home.  I have considerable detail on the nursing home in question.  Deputies will appreciate that I cannot go into great detail on any specific nursing home because it would not be right or proper.  Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n made a variety of statements that were absolutely and fundamentally untrue and very unfair on the work of the HSE.  He said no supports had been provided.  Let me be clear.  These cases were detected through testing done by the HSE.  Infection prevention control teams were deployed.  Staff have been deployed.  Serial testing is ongoing.  All staff and residents were tested.  There are senior management staff on-site right now as we speak.  Significant financial supports are given to all nursing homes.  Significant amounts of personal protective equipment are being supplied.  The HSE is doing everything it can to protect nursing homes.  The comments made here this morning are factually incorrect.  They spread fear and anxiety in the community, which is wrong.<\/p>  <p>  I have great time for Deputy McGrath personally but I have rarely in my life heard such a shambolic contribution.  He talked about Hitler, fake numbers, fake news and even fake tests.  He said the polymerase chain reaction tests do not work.  I will leave it at that.

I had 15 minutes to speak last night, which is an extraordinarily long time for somebody in a small group, and I did my best to capture the lead-in to this urgent legislation, as it has been described, that left the Government little choice other than to rush it through the D&aacute;il by 30 October.  I said this during the debate last night, and while I do not like repetition, it is important to note that my staff and I have done our best to get my head around this and understand the urgency of this legislation.  I have utterly failed to do that.<\/p><p>I am not given to personalising issues and I do not wish to do so.  I want to stick with the issue.  It is difficult to understand how the Government could be in a situation where they are telling us that this is urgent legislation when the commission was established in February 2015 and there have been seven interim reports.  I went through those reports as best I could last night.  I did not do it perfectly but as well as I could.  My purpose was to show that there were seven interim reports from this commission of inquiry, all seeking extensions of time, which is understandable.  Some of those reports are more extensive than others and all of them were published except interim report No. 6.  I asked the Minister last night to deal with that matter and he did not do so in his closing speech.  Even though his closing speech ran to five pages, he failed to deal with the sixth interim report.  I have to rely on a press release from the former Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Katherine Zappone.  I thank her for all her work.  I was critical, I hope in a constructive fashion, of her role in this but I believe, in retrospect, that she did her best with a system that has clearly closed ranks to protect itself.  I made that point during the debate last night.<\/p><p>I listened clearly to that debate, and all of the language that was used was also used for the duration that the institutions in question were in existence - &quot;This is for your own good, we know best and we know best now&quot;.  I find that utterly nauseating for many reasons, both professional and personal.<\/p><p>We have seven reports, all asking for extensions of time and most of them pointing out different issues.  Time is limited in the overall context of this matter for no good reason and because it is, it is important to repeat the following: one of the reports pointed out that there was no logic to the exclusion of unaccompanied children from the redress scheme.  The report suggested that the exclusion could not be stood over.  That was pointed out to the Government and it failed to take any action.  The exclusion of certain homes was also pointed out and the Government took some limited action on that.  It was pointed out many times that the volume of documentation was extensive.  One can see from the reports that the commission had to use orders for discovery.  The commission sympathised, to a point, with the HSE because it had changed formation often, through its previous guises to the HSE.  In one of the reports, the commission stated that it found it difficult to understand how documents that had arisen in the more recent past were still not available, and so on.<\/p><p>Many Deputies wish to speak today so I will not go on for too long but I will point out the following: as a new Minister, there was a duty for him to be briefed on the background of this matter.  There was a duty on the Department to brief him and explain how it could arise that we need urgent legislation now when seven interim reports have pointed out various matters and put the Government on notice of them.  I have re-read the press release of the then Minister, Katherine Zappone, which stated:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThe Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Dr Katherine Zappone, has today [14 February 2020] confirmed that she has received a Sixth Interim Report from the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes.  Although it is a short report it nonetheless raises complex issues related to the completion of the Commission&rsquo;s programme of work.  Most significantly, because the Commission is required to transfer its records to the Minister and deal with third party legal costs prior to submitting its final report, the Commission has requested an extension of time to enable it to effectively manage these issues. <\/blockquote>  <p>The extension was agreed and the then Minister hoped to make the report public, which did not happen.  That was in February 2020.  The Covid-19 pandemic can be used as an excuse for many things but it cannot explain the failure to publish this sixth interim report.  It seems to me, though perhaps I am wrong, that the sixth interim report raised the very issues that we are now trying to tease out in a rushed manner in a forum that is not effective, leading to many misunderstandings and a complete sense of despair that once again the system is protecting itself and failing to protect those who need it most.  I do not mean protection in a charitable manner but in a manner that empowers by giving maximum information and documentation.  That is the lesson to be learned, if there is one.<\/p><p>I ask the Minister again where the sixth interim report is.  Following that report, what interchange was there between the Government and the independent commission?  We were told many times, and rightly so, that it is an independent commission and we cannot interfere with it.  It seemed last night that there has been an interaction between the Minister or his Department and the commission about records.  At the very least, we should know about that interaction, have copies of it and a copy of the sixth interim report.  Where is it?  Can we please have it?<\/p><p>The commission asked for an extension of time until 30 October in the seventh report.  The Minister said that he cannot give an extension of time because the commission has to request it.  Can he please clarify that for me?  I am not 100% sure about that and I ask him to clarify that.  <\/p><p>Can he also clarify how a commission can be partly dissolved and partly not dissolved?  It will be dissolved on 30 October but not dissolved for the purpose of allowing the commission to interact with the survivors and people who came forward to give evidence before it.  How can the Minister explain that part dissolution and part non-dissolution?  That is difficult to understand.<\/p><p>I have no idea why this legislation was necessary, which is why I am submitting this amendment relating to Tusla.  The legislation has been brought before the D&aacute;il ostensibly to give the database and related records to Tusla.  I will come back to Tusla and its reputation.  I cast no aspersions on the staff of the agency but I have great reservations about the system.  More importantly, those affected by mother and baby homes have serious concerns about Tusla.  The main purpose of the legislation that the Minister has brought before us, prior to his amendment, was to allow for an archive of documents.  Finally, some attempt has been made to bring together documentation from various sources, including the religious orders, local authorities, Departments of Health and Education and Skills, to name but a few.  The Minister brought this draft Bill before us to divide that archive up for no apparent purpose and without clarity for the need to give some documents to Tusla and to keep some to himself.  He has now come forward to say that he will keep a complete record of the documents, in his role as Minister.<\/p><p>I will deal with Tusla.  My opinion of the agency does not matter but the opinions of those from HIQA who did a report on the agency do matter.  Have they been brought to the attention of the Minister in the context of the issues arising from what I would call the Maurice McCabe scandal?  Has the Minister's attention been drawn to the Charleton tribunal and Mr. Justice Charleton's comments on Tusla?  That is not to mention the many other concerns that we all have about the agency.  Has the Minister spoken to survivors about their experiences of Tusla before he gives reports to it?  For what purpose are those reports going to Tusla?<\/p><p>I asked the Minister at a briefing what assessment had been done of Tusla's capability to hold onto an archive of this size and significance.<\/p>  <p>I do not want to misconstrue what he said - he might correct me if I am wrong - but I think he indicated that a regulatory impact assessment, or words to that effect, would be carried out in the future.  He brought legislation before the Houses, in an urgent manner and without proper explanation, to provide that some percentage of the documents would be given to an agency in which the survivors have little confidence without any impact assessment having been carried out of the organisation's capacity to receive that volume of documents.  That is totally unacceptable, so I have tabled the best amendment we could formulate in such a short period.  We were asked to table amendments before the debate on the Bill in the Seanad had been completed.  It was still ongoing at the time of the first deadline we were given for tabling amendments, which was 2 o'clock or so on Friday last.  The Seanad debate was still in progress.  With the Ceann Comhairle's good graces, as I understand it, that time was extended.  We had submitted our amendments because we were complying with the rules, but then we had to reconsider our amendments.<\/p> <p> The Minister stated that the Business Committee had waived pre-legislative scrutiny on his recommendation, which is not, as I understand it, totally accurate.  The Government majority on the committee, not the committee as a whole, agreed with him.  If any item of legislation requires pre-legislative scrutiny and scrutiny by committee, this is the one because we should be arguing about the legacy with which we are trying to deal.  Unfortunately, it is not just a legacy but also ongoing abuse.  There are so many aspects I could mention, some of which I mentioned last night, but I add to that Caranua, which, from day one, was not fit for purpose.<\/p> <p> This issue has been under debate since before the Minister's time, although it was all reported in the newspapers.  We have been here every step of the way, watching everything being dragged out of each Government in the most minimalist way possible, in a way that did not empower but demeaned and reinforced the abuse that had happened.  It is in that context that I tabled the amendment.  It is wrong to give documents to Tusla without any analysis, as it is to propose a different organisation, such as the Adoption Authority of Ireland.  All of that should be teased out at committee level, with proper expert advice on the importance of the archive and the documents that will be put there for the first time, and on the accessibility to that archive.<\/p> <p> The Minister, in his follow-up contribution last night, confused matters even more.  It is deeply troubling.  He has not answered the question as to why there is no sixth interim report nor clarified the nature of the interaction between him and the commission further to the publication of the six report, or of the seventh or any other report, but I will focus on the sixth because that was the one, according to the press release, that raised complex issues.  In his follow-up contribution last night, which runs to more than five pages, the Minister stated: \"Also, the database will be transferred to Tusla so it does not go into the commission's archive once the commission has brought forward its final report.\"  That is difficult for me to understand, even though I have the privilege of having a background that helps me in that regard and I have copies of the documentation; imagine how difficult it is for people who were listening to and watching the debate.  The Minister further stated: \"This Bill allows the database and the related records to be transferred to Tusla and it prevents that information from being effectively destroyed.\"  The use of the word \"destroyed\" was strange.  The Minister went on to explain that the word does not really mean what it says but instead means \"redacted\".  \"Destroyed\", however, is a very powerful word.  Nowhere in the 2004 legislation, the grounding legislation for the commission, nor in the National Archives Act, which was published before that and provides for how archives are stored and protected, is there a reference to documents being destroyed.  One section states that all documents will be handed over to the Minister.  I am not sure, therefore, why the legislation before us is necessary.<\/p> <p> According to the 2004 Act, on the handing over of the report the commission will be dissolved and all documents will be handed over to the Minister.  Did he or the Department consider that?  What was the defect therein that meant the Minister needed to bring legislation before the House to provide that the documents would be given to Tusla rather than to him, whereby he would take a little bit, Tusla would take a little bit and they would look after it all because that is the right thing to do for the survivors and they were again acting for the survivors' own good?  Why did the Minister do that, as opposed to recognising the importance of the archive, which empowers us, the people and those who have been in institutions to look at records for the first time?<\/p> <p> The 30-year rule under the National Archives Act, I understand, was due to be changed to 20 years.  Perhaps the Minister could have outlined for the reasons for that too, or his and the Department's views on the European GDPR regulation.  We have clearly articulated - other speakers have done it better than I - how, under that legislation and directive, a person is allowed access to his or her files.  There cannot be an absolute ban on files and documents if they are of relevance to the person in question.  There has been no attempt to analyse that.<\/p> <p> It is very difficult to work with a Government that perpetuates the system that utterly failed people in institutions.  The Government is perpetuating it by saying that it knows best, that it will hold on to the documentation, that it will tell the survivors what they need to know and no more, and that we should take its word on the matter.  After this legislation is passed, I will revert to the committee and ask it to work out the complexities of the mess we have made, all because each Government - I think there have been three - has failed to consider seven interim reports, and failed to publish the sixth one, or to deal with the questions that would be raised in respect of documents   Those Governments failed to come before us with proper legislation to amend the 2004 Act, if that was necessary, although I cannot see why it would have been.<\/p> <p> To add insult to injury, the Government sought advice from the then Attorney General and reverted to say that the State would have to write to those who had come forward in order to protect their confidentiality, even though the terms of reference clearly allowed and mandated the commission to protect confidentiality in terms of identifying criteria such as their names.  Now, rather than taking that as a presumption, if the time is to be extended, it should be extended to allow the people involved to opt to waive their confidentiality.  It should be done the other way around, which would be in keeping with the terms of reference.  The Government should partly extend the commission's remit on this aspect, which was not necessary in my opinion, although I will go along with it.  It has not even explained how the commission can be partly dissolved.<\/p> <p> I have no confidence in the system or in the Bill before us.  I say that reluctantly and wish I could say something different.  I ask the Minister to accept the amendment and remove the Tusla element.  Down the road, it might be the correct organisation or that might be the Adoption Authority of Ireland.  I do not have a view on that.  I have listened to those affected, and it seems the Government is protecting the system, either unwittingly or in full agreement with it.  The Bill is not about protecting the survivors but rather the system and the documents.  I have used every opportunity to refer to briefing notes from 2012, when the intelligence unit in the Department of Health - I pay tribute to the unit and the Minister might clarify whether it still exists - produced a briefing note on the Bessborough and Tuam mother and baby homes, highlighting its concerns about the practices at both.  No shortage of information has been available.  Notwithstanding that, the information over the past five years in which the commission has existed has had to be dragged out of the various organisations.  In that spirit and because of that background, I will press the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102200038#MM00400","speaker":"1577","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1603375500,"counter":356,"content":"<p>Are these amendments grouped or are we on amendment No. 1 only?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102200040#OO00100","speaker":"1504"},{"type":"speech","time":1603375500,"counter":357,"content":"<p>It was pointed out before the Deputy arrived that quite a number of amendments are grouped.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102200040#OO00200","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1603375500,"counter":358,"content":"<p>There is probably very little I can add that has not already been articulated extremely well by Deputy Connolly, other than to say that people are still stunned as to why the Minister is bringing forward this Bill, especially in view of the fact that the necessary consultation with the residents and survivors of the mother and baby homes has not taken place.  It feels like the Minister is captured by the Department and that he is doing the Department's bidding on this rather than driving it himself.  I do not wish to cast aspersions on the work done by people in Tusla, but if we are to leave any imprint at all on the Bill from the people who have spent time in these institutions, it has to be that we take out that line from the Bill.  One of the main issues raised in representation after representation and email after email has been that these survivors do not want Tusla in the position into which it will be placed by the Bill.  I will therefore make to the Minister the same plea I made last night.  We often come into this Chamber and have these debates after political parties have already embedded themselves into their positions.  I ask the Minister to allow his position to be directed or at least influenced by the articulation of the survivors' experience in our contributions.

Before I do so I wish, with the Ceann Comhairle's latitude, to mention an amendment I submitted and which, due to a mix-up between him and the Bills Office, has not been accepted.  It would have been in order, and this signifies and shows how the Bill has been rushed through.  These processes are there as a way to allow people to have an input into the legislative process.  The processes have been short-circuited.  My amendment was to the Minister's amendment.  There is an additional timeline to allow for such amendments to amendments to be processed.  In the normal course of events, that would have happened.  I say this because the Minister held a briefing with Opposition spokespersons on 9 September to signal that this Bill was coming forward, but at that meeting I do not think he signalled it would come forward two days before the D&aacute;il's rising and the thing itself happening.  Between 9 September and today is six or seven weeks, so this Bill could have come through in time for discussion and debate taking place on it, and that is vitally important.  The process has been hampered by the way in which this has been handled.  That needs to be put on record, and I wish to do so because I believe, probably naively, that the amendment I had tabled would have provided a way out for the Government in this situation.  That amendment is not on the record now anyway so it will not be taken.<\/p><p>As for amendment No. 1 and Tusla and its involvement in the retention of the records in this situation, it is shocking to hear the antipathy of people who have gone through the system for Tusla and its ability to deal with the information.  The fact is that they do not feel they would get a fair hearing from Tusla.  It is a sad reflection on the State that it should continue this hurt that has been done to these people over many years and that this will be continued in how this Bill operates.  They say:<\/p> <blockquote> \tTUSLA operates legally troubling and discriminatory practices, including defining adopted people's birth names as 'third party data' and undertaking 'risk assessments' of all adopted people who request their records.<br \/><br \/>The Bill ignores the views of the Collaborative Forum of Former Residents of Mother and Baby Homes, which was established specifically to advise the Government and repeatedly stated that TUSLA should have no further role in adoption information and tracing. <\/blockquote>  <p>Their organisations have said this should not have happened, yet this Bill comes through and proposes to do just that and the Minister will blindly go ahead and push this through today.  I cannot add to what Deputy Connolly said because she has outlined perfectly the concerns about this, but it is important we put on record our feelings as Members about this as well.

The Minister is ignoring the wishes of the people who have survived these institutions and their families and relatives.  We are dealing with one of the major historical crimes of the 20th century that happened in this country.  The journalist Fintan O'Toole has estimated that if industrial schools are included, one in every 100 people in this country was a victim of systematic mass incarceration, a system which involved forced labour, abduction of children and adults, forced separation of families, disappearances, medical experimentation without consent, abuse and torture.  Yet the Minister is not willing to consider amendments tabled by an Opposition that is no better or worse than he or his Government but has a serious contribution to make to this debate.  This was a systematic reign of terror against women, children and the poor.  The Minister is a Green Party member.  He is supposed to be socially conscious.  This reign of terror was comparable, to my mind, to the terror in the Gulags in Stalin's Soviet Union.  The terror these institutions in Ireland have inflicted on this society over the past 100 years has been keenly felt throughout that time.  The system involved various Departments of State, civil servants, local authorities, members of the Garda, members of the medical profession, and institutions of both the Catholic Church and the Church of Ireland.  Who is the Minister trying to protect?<\/p>  <p>  The manner in which the survivors, adopted children, family members - all those affected by this crime - have been treated constitutes a continuation of cruel and inhumane treatment and a further denial of their basic human rights.  The commission of inquiry rejected all appeals, by both individuals and organisations representing those affected, for them to have access to their personal data.  They should have been able to receive copies of all their deceased relatives' personal data and their transcripts of evidence.  They should have been able to comment on the evidence from the State and others involved in their maltreatment, and it is not acceptable now to compound this human rights denial by locking any archives for 30 years.<\/p> <p>I welcome the Minister's amendment in this grouping to keep a full copy of the archives under his protection, or that of any Minister.  Serious concerns, however, have been expressed by victims, relatives and advocacy groups regarding Tusla in respect of requests for information and personal data and adoption tracing.  It is important now that EU law on GDPR is observed by the Minister.  Our amendments Nos. 14 and 27 also deal with this issue.  Despite the Minister and the Government not accepting amendments, I urge members to support the amendments in favour of the creation of an index to the Minister's archive.  It is important for those people who wish to access information from the archive to know what is in it and where it is located.<\/p> <p> What system are we protecting?  Perhaps the Minister can answer that.  It is not the survivors and their families.  It is important in an historical context that we learn from this experience and about who the perpetrators were, just for our nation but also for nations across the world where there has been the same type of abuse, such as in Australia, and in respect of native Indians and others.  That is important for historical reasons, but also for the survivors dealing with and trying to work through what happened to them and their lives.  I am disgusted to hear that the Minister will not accept any amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102200040#OO01300","speaker":"1569","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1603376100,"counter":370,"content":"<p>All of us in the Opposition, and probably many sitting in government, believe that we should not be here debating this issue at all.  The entire country is stunned at what is going on.  I think that the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, does not believe that this is the correct thing to do, but he is the prisoner of senior civil servants and a system that insists on continuing what it started out doing when the State was founded.  I refer to burying its systemic failures in respect of the citizens of this country, and to women and children in particular, and to burying the systemic failures of all the institutions that were built around a State that wanted to ditch the poor and oppress women to such a degree that we have the legacy mentioned.  I refer to one in 100 people having had some experience of the brutal institutionalisation that took place.<\/p><p>I am interested in the references made to the process by Deputies Connolly and Pringle.  When it was originally agreed that the commission would be established and that it would look into the social and historical legacy of the mother and baby homes, the then Minister, Katherine Zappone, convened a gathering of survivors in a hotel.  There were many of them, and a representative group met, gathering in workshops and think tanks for several days to figure out what was the best way to proceed with the investigation.  A friend of mine was one of those people.  She gave birth in Bessborough in 1981, and she will give testimony that there was widespread, if not unanimous, agreement on several aspects.<\/p><p>One was that they did not want any secrecy.  Most of the people present wanted their names attached to the records.  Another area of agreement was that they did not want any dealings with Tusla, because it was not trusted for all the reasons that have been given.  It has failed, and it has created a system of denial and secrecy regarding this matter for many of the people concerned.  The people at that gathering also agreed that they should be able to access the historical files. That was an interesting process, and it was an inclusive and engaging one.  I am sure the State spent a few bob on it, and it gave great hope to the survivors who gathered at that meeting.  They thought that it was wonderful and that something had changed.<\/p><p>Now, however, we are here today.  How did a process that was marked by inclusivity, openness, discussion and dialogue go from that to this?  This Bill is an utter disgrace, and perpetuates all the crimes of the State against that cohort of people and it is now going to bury the record.  The Minister has told us that he is not really sure what is going to be buried for 30 years.  He knows what most of it is, but he does not know what all of it is.  This is absolutely outrageous.<\/p><p>We have put forward an amendment dealing with the issue of Tusla, but it is slightly different from other amendments on the same topic.  Our amendment states that the records should go to the Adoption Authority of Ireland, and we did that because it would ensure that the records would be available if this Bill is passed tonight.  I have no doubt, however, that by tonight this House will have voted to enact all the aspects of this Bill.  This will be a very dark day in the history of this State.  Who will be voting for this Bill?  All the Deputies from the Green Party, Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and probably those ten Deputies from the gene pool who usually stick with them.<\/p><p>Despite the whip being imposed on them, I appeal to those Deputies to do the right thing for history and for the legacy of this State and to not accept the measures in this Bill.  I ask them to not accept that we can pass a Bill that will bury the records for 30 years and that will allow Tusla to be the only agency with access to these files.  I also urge the Minister to read, if he has not already done so, an article published on <i>thejournal.ie<\/i>today by Dr. Maeve O'Rourke.  It is comprehensive and deals in detail with all the legal issues raised by Deputy Connolly. <\/p><p>I reiterate that I do not believe that the Minister, as an individual, has an issue with anything I have said, but that he is doing the bidding of the Department and the apparatus that surround him.  I hope I am right in saying that.  If I am wrong, he can correct me, and if I am right, he will probably not say anything.  What is happening, however, is absolutely shameful and it is extremely hurtful to thousands of people in this country who are victims of that abuse.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102200041#PP00200","speaker":"1486"},{"type":"speech","time":1603376100,"counter":371,"content":"<p>I again express my sincere horror that the Government and the Minister have set their faces against dealing with this issue in any shape, make or form.  They have tried to convince themselves, because they need to convince themselves, that they are doing something for the good of the survivors.  That would take some convincing, and if they can convince themselves of that, they can convince themselves of anything.  We have all received thousands of impassioned pleas from victims and survivors all over the country, and beyond.  I am sure the Minister has also received such pleas, as well as all the Teachta&iacute; in Fine Gael, Fianna F&aacute;il, the Green Party and the Regional Independent Group, or the vast majority of Deputies, who are backing the Government through thick and thin, no matter what the subject.<\/p>  <p>  It is a sad day in our country.  We have talked about many issues from the past.  We have had the children's referendum, the marriage equality referendum and the referendum on repeal of the eighth amendment.  We are now supposed to be a place of openness, transparency and honesty, and a new Ireland.  It is some new Ireland all right when we look at this Parliament today and see the legislation we are debating.  It is draconian, tyrannical and shocking.  Then we see this legacy issue of horror and hurt and disdainful treatment of our citizens.  We have probably moved on from all that now and we are supposed to be a modern, pluralist country, but this is shocking.  I refer to the outright rejection of all these amendments.  The Government has set its face against accepting them.  Deputy Cairns asked for a comment regarding the amendments, but could not get one.  We are taking the silence of the Minister to indicate that he is not accepting any amendments.  All of this means that we are going to remove these documents and lock them away for 30 years.<\/p>  <p>  We had a great time during the millennium celebrations of 20 years ago when many schools and communities put time capsules into the ground.  We were all delighted and wondered who would dig them up in 100 years and what those people would think of us.  This capsule, however, is being buried somewhere, and it is a murky and dirty one.  It is most definitely not a joyous one and will not be.  History will not be kind to this Government and to the Minister.  I could call it a cabal, but I will not because the Government has a majority, it is elected and it has cobbled together a Government, with the aid of Independents.<\/p>  <p>  I cannot believe what is happening and the people looking in cannot believe it.  All right-thinking people, young and old, from the age of reason, think that what is going on is an abhorrence in this day and age of 2020 in the middle of a pandemic.<\/p> <p>I am in disbelief.  The former Minister, Katherine Zappone, convened a forum for survivors.  I understand a good few of them came to it and she engaged with them in a listening process.  They made it quite clear, as many have to me personally and to other Deputies as well, that they do not want anonymity.  They want their names to be out there.  They want to be recognised as human beings, as people who have suffered and whose lives have almost been destroyed, who have fought back and come back from that and who want to move on with their lives.  They want to have their records.<\/p> <p> The Government claims we are protecting the records but this is emergency legislation, or rushed legislation, which is always bad legislation.  There has been no pre-legislative scrutiny.  This Government has only been in being for a short time but I think it will pass out the 2011-16 Government for lack of scrutiny of legislation and the use of guillotines by another name.  The latest trick in the book is to blame the Business Committee for everything.  The Ceann Comhairle chairs the Business Committee and does a fine job of it.  It happened again today when the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, blamed the Business Committee for the way we are dealing with the Bill.  The fact is that the Government just uses the name of the Business Committee.  We object but are steamrolled because it has a majority.<\/p> <p> This is sad.  Doing this to a cohort of people who have suffered enough for a long time will be a blight on this House.  We are again trying to suppress what went on in our murky past.  All these people want is openness, honesty and transparency and to be allowed to go on with their lives but this legislation will not let them.  The outright refusal of the Government to accept any amendments reminds me of countries in eastern Europe in the past that would set their face against any reform, common decency or dealing with the opposition and trying to embrace it.  We are supposed to be all in this together and I am always saying n&iacute; neart go cur le ch&eacute;ile but in this case the Government knows best and knows everything.  When Deputies become Ministers, they try to break out of the straitjackets they are in but senior civil servants do not allow them to do so.  I do not want to demonise any senior civil servant but it seems the system has to be protected above all else.  The sacred system cannot be questioned or gone against.  They must toe the party line.  This is going to end with the Department in tatters.  It is going to end in more prolonged grief for the survivors - I hate to call them victims but they were in many cases - as well as for their families, children, grandchildren and generations to come.  It is an appalling vista. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102200041#PP00300","speaker":"1612","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1603376700,"counter":373,"content":"<p>I am a little concerned about the response I gave Deputy Cairns earlier when she asked about amendments being accepted.

Since the foundation of this State, successive Governments have maintained a code of silence regarding the abuse of children and other minors in their care and control and for whom they had a duty and responsibility.  This Bill elects to copper-fasten that abusive silence for a period of 30 years, contrary to the principles of basic human rights, particularly in relation to children and other young persons.  The records and deliberations of Tusla leave much to be desired, yet this Bill envisages the transfer of further specified records and databases to that organisation, without according any enhanced or new right to access, thereby forcing impecunious inquiries through courts and judicial reviews on foot of Tusla refusing access.  It is sprawling and lazy legislation, which contains a hidden threat of the explicit amendment of section 43 of the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004.<\/p><p>I advocate, without reservation, that all future judicial inquiries be conducted by a retired judge because a sitting judge is constrained by an inability to make a political statement.  When one particular judge applied to a Department seeking inspector reports for industrial schools, it was found upon further inquiry that the reports had been destroyed, which I venture to suggest was the real reason for that judge's resignation.<\/p><p>This Bill continues the code of silence and the horrid denial of proper access.

As regards the comments the Ceann Comhairle made, it is very clearly the Government that is not listening or hearing.  It would not have to have particularly good hearing to listen to the anger, upset and appeals to change course from survivors.  The approach of the Government has been horrendous and heartless and is unfortunately reimposing an abuse upon people.  I pay tribute to the incredible survivors for the campaigning that has been going on, which has made this a major political issue and put the Government under significant pressure to make the very small amendments it is making.  It is incredibly impressive.  These people were subjected to such abuse by the State and a church which were willing to let them be treated in such a way and be the subject of such abuse because they were women or were from poorer backgrounds.  That church then colluded in a cover-up by the State to prevent its role in that abuse being exposed.  The fact that people are still fighting and speaking out in the way they do is inspiring.<\/p>  <p>  There is something quite Orwellian about a number of aspects of this debate, particularly the double-speak that goes on.  Let us take the term \"mother and baby home\", for example.  A home is meant to be a place of safety and warmth.  What we are talking about here is something very far from a home.  In reality, these homes were much closer to prisons as they were places of extreme abuse in some cases.  Another example is the language used by the Government in the briefing notes and so on, which refers to protecting the records.  The survivors simply do not accept or agree with that.  They are not convinced by that argument because they know this is not about protecting the records.  They are not protesting because the records are being protected.  This is about sealing the records for 30 years and putting them out of the reach of survivors, who showed great bravery in testifying about the abuse they faced.  Many spoke up explicitly asking that their stories be heard, recorded and shared, and now they are being told that they will be swept under the carpet<\/p>  <p>  I support the amendments coming from us and others.  In dealing with the particular issue of Tusla, the basic point was made yesterday and should be made again and again today that Tusla is not an appropriate controller for the records.  There is no reason the Adoption Authority of Ireland, for example, could not be the controller instead.  I am sure the Minister is aware of the issues around legally troubling and discriminatory practices in the access of adopted people to their information.<\/p> <p>The Bill ignores the views of the collaborative forum of former residents of mother and baby homes.  It is a forum that was specifically established to advise the Government and it has repeatedly stated that Tusla should have no further role in adoption information and tracing, yet the Government has doubled down on that approach and has committed to it despite all the uproar.  In the spirit of what the Ceann Comhairle said, I appeal to the Minister to listen, not to us but to the survivors.  They are asking to be heard and for changes to be made.  I appeal to the Minister to listen to them and make the necessary changes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102200042#QQ00700","speaker":"1628","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1603377300,"counter":380,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

That reflects to a large extent the process that has applied to this legislation.  The Bill has been rushed, without the pre-legislative scrutiny that it and the women deserved.  There was no consultation with the survivors, which is a problem, and it reflects the discussion we are having and the problems many of us have with the Bill.<\/p>  <p>  This is an emotive and sensitive issue and it is clear from the discussions today and yesterday in the D&aacute;il, and the debate in the Seanad, that this issue goes deep for Members of both Houses.

Some are quite uneasy about the Bill and what will happen once it is passed, including what impact it will have on survivors and their stories and the fact that they will not be able to access their own information.  In light of how sensitive and personal an issue this is, we need to reflect on what it may mean for individual Members of this House and the Seanad.  There may be people with personal stories that they may not be in a position to discuss or want to discuss.  Recognising that the Minister is not accepting amendments, I ask him to allow a free vote on this issue.

The tone of the debate here, unlike debates on other matters, has been measured from an Opposition point of view, which is the point of view I can speak from.  We are being asked to legislate with one hand tied behind our backs because we feel we are speaking to reason in seeking more time for more deliberation on issues.  One issue that is pertinent to this Bill is information and tracing.  We do not have an information and tracing Bill.  That renders this Bill and its effects useless for the countless people who will want access to information on the contents of the database.  I am not convinced that the Minister's amendments will ameliorate that.  We have been told that there are 60,000 records.  My colleague, Senator Ivana Bacik, said in the Seanad: \"If one is one of the survivors or a family member about whom there is data held, how frustrating it is to know that the data is going to be held by the Minister but sealed for 30 years, and by Tusla for some undefined period yet a survivor or one's family member will have no access to it and no right to see it or even know what it is.\"<\/p>  <p>  This is important and it is not centrally about the testimony given by survivors to a confidential committee but about the 60,000 records which, as the data protection assessment says, relate to a wide array of information, paper, records obtained under discovery and records held by the institutions, State, religious orders and so on.  We are saying that people should have access to a large amount of information where it identifies them or a relative, or where it is their information.  How frustrating it must be and paternalistic of us to continue to hold that and say we will allow people access at some future point but that we do not yet know how we will do that.  There is a philosophical point about how, while nobody is striving with perfection, the Parliament deals with an issue as sensitive as this.  We spoke last night and the Minister heard excellent, balanced testimony from Members about the genuine concern of people to find a way of negotiating this legislation in a way that has an outcome that speaks to the need to create the archive in an appropriate way and also with regard to the seeking of information.  It was not partisan or overly political.<\/p>  <p>  Aside from the flaws in the legislation, what is missing is the information and tracing Bill.  We do not know when we will have that legislation.  It is absolutely germane to this very issue.  That is why we are hamstrung as a legislature.

That is within his power and remit, and it is not an unreasonable request.  The clear message from everybody is that Tusla is not the appropriate organisation.  Whatever people's opinions on it, that is what survivors are saying.  They do not trust the organisation.

I do not see why the commission cannot be asked to delay by three months while the correct legislation is brought forward to deal with sealing the records, Tusla and an appropriate organisation.  It is not a big request.  The commission asked for a number of extensions, so why is it not appropriate for us to ask for one extension so the right thing can be done?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102200043#RR00500","speaker":"1449","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1603377900,"counter":385,"content":"<p>I spoke last night on this issue.  We have had a very reasonable discussion about it.  I am disappointed with the Minister's statement that he will not accept any of the amendments.

I appeal to the Minister to consider in the next few hours what we have been saying.  We must do this right and we must do it for the right reasons.  I accept that he wants to do it right and for the right reasons, but there are flaws.  There are major concerns among the survivors and the people who were involved in these atrocities.  They want to have it right.  They want a little more time for us, as legislators, to ensure that whatever laws we pass are right.  We must do the right thing.<\/p>  <p>  This is not in any way party political, but about doing the right thing.  It is the first time in my five years in the D&aacute;il that I have heard Members from every political party and none, including from Fianna F&aacute;il and others in the Government, expressing their concerns that this might not be the right thing to do right now.  There is an opportunity to extend the deadline so we can have reasoned debate, look at amendments and bring forward the legislation that would be required in an all-party fashion.  Lest anybody give out to us for seeking that, this issue is the one issue on which we must man up as politicians and decide to do this together for the right reasons.  We need a little time.  I urge the Minister to consider extending the time of the commission so we can do that.<\/p>  <p>  I will not repeat the issues I raised last night.

Many of us, with some hesitation, accept the extension of this draconian legislation, but somehow we are told that we cannot find a mechanism to extend the timeframe before we vote on this Bill.  We are told it is simply not possible, yet we could find a way of extending some of the most draconian legislation this House has ever passed.  We had to, but we have to on this legislation as well.<\/p>  <p>  The debate last night was the most sensitive debate in which I have ever been involved.  We are saying to survivors that we should take the risk of going ahead with a flawed process, and that we will put it right with other legislation later.  I believe the Minister intends to do his best, but every survivor of the mother and baby homes has already been let down by the State after suffering the inhumane and cruel treatment in those homes.  They were let down again and again when they tried to reassert their rights and to get information about who they were and where they came from.  I hate to say it, but the truth is, as the Minister and I know, that the same people feel let down in the same way by this legislation.  If we want to support survivors, we have an opportunity to do so today.  The Minister can either accept some amendments or delay the process.  Many good amendments have been tabled by the Opposition, and he need not accept all of them.<\/p>  <p>  The Ceann Comhairle said earlier that the purpose of this debate is to try to persuade and convince and to actively listen and respond.  If that is not the case, what are we doing here?  What is this crazy choreography in which we dance around one another but never find any common ground?  In the previous parliament in which I sat, and I understand it has a different system, all amendments were compromise amendments.  I do not expect that here, but is there a rule that we can never have compromise amendments?  Can we never have any meeting of minds?  What we are involved in now has no purpose from the point of view of improving legislation.  There is democratic accountability and debate, but we are supposed to be debating amendments.  However, there is no point because the Minister has said he will not accept amendments.  As other colleagues said, it is a waste of time from the perspective of improving legislation and trying to respond to the genuine concerns of so many victims.  As I said last night, this is perhaps the most sensitive legislative measure we will deal with in the House.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, the amendments before us relate to Tusla being a repository of the database of this sensitive and personal information.  I have read many emails and spoken to many people.  They are determined that Tusla should not be involved.  It is not about the individuals who work there, but the bureaucratic culture and the culture of always saving the system.<\/p> <p>People just cannot fight any more.  We do not want to see these records sealed.  My final comment to the Minister is only a repetition of what others have said: he should extend the debate or at least, as one of my colleagues said earlier, he should allow a free vote.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102200044#SS00300","speaker":"1605","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1603378500,"counter":388,"content":"<p>I initially put my hand up to speak on this topic out of anger because I spent a large part of this morning going over the amendments and preparing what I was going to say.  Then, 20 minutes into the debate we were told the Minister would not be accepting any amendments.  That is an extraordinary admission to make that resulted from an insightful question from my colleague, Deputy Cairns.<\/p>  <p>  The Ceann Comhairle mentioned that we live in a parliamentary democracy.  I am very new to this Chamber but I believed we were coming in here today to debate, argue, present reasons and to try to convince each other to go in a particular direction, yet that was shut down 20 minutes into the debate.  It gives rise to serious questions about our parliamentary process and in many ways undermines it.  I constantly hear about an angry, shouty left.  I ask the Ceann Comhairle, and anybody who is listening in, whether they can blame us when what we are met with here is obfuscation and people closing their minds to any sort of reason.  The level of structural ignorance is appalling.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill has been designed in a manner that is completely counter to the very concept of parliamentary democracy.  Where did it come from?  Who was calling for it to be brought forward at this particular point?  It cannot be emphasised enough that it was brought through without any pre-legislative scrutiny, apparently at the request of the Minister, who told us that it was approved by the Business Committee.  That is a play on words because it was not approved by the Business Committee, it was approved by the Government majority on the Business Committee.  It was rushed through the Seanad last week and then, within seven days, it came to the D&aacute;il last night, where there was nothing but respectful and engaging communications and everybody across the Chamber, having tabled their amendments, went away convinced that we would fight for them, but that was taken off the table really quickly.<\/p>  <p>  It did not have to be that way.  We will tear strips off each other in this Chamber when it comes to issues concerning taxation and expenditure, rightly so, because that is the very nature of parliamentary democracy.  However, on an issue such as this, one that is so emotive and that has such meaning for people who have already suffered such trauma and hardship by this State, this could have been a matter on which we could have found some form of unification, but that was not permitted.  In whose interest was that done?<\/p>  <p>  I am sorry as I do not wish to personalise this matter, because above all other Ministers, this was a Minister I really had hopes for and was rooting for in terms of the role he has to play and the expectation that he would act in a reforming manner.  When one finds oneself in opposition to survivors of extraordinary State cruelty and incarceration and on the wrong end of human rights lawyers and people who have dedicated their lives to bringing light to the injustices of the State, and in opposition to people who mean no hardship to him, one must ask in whose interest the legislation is being introduced.  What would be so detrimental about admitting that perhaps we are rushing this a little bit too fast and that perhaps we need to take a little bit more time to go through the Bill, scrutinise it and find togetherness.  That is all we are asking for.<\/p>  <p>  Nobody thinks anyone is being malicious in terms of the legislation that has been introduced, but we do think the means by which it is being brought through the D&aacute;il is insulting.  All we are asking for is a little bit of time so we can find common direction.  This issue is too important for oppositional politics.  Even at this late stage, I appeal to the Minister to enable us to find common direction and to demonstrate collective leadership to the people who have been wronged by this State.  That is what we are asking for.  Those who have been wronged are the most important voices that we can listen to, and at the moment they are feeling that they are being re-traumatised through this process.  The absolute antithesis of restorative justice is the re-traumatisation of victims, and that is what we are doing here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102200045#TT00200","speaker":"1560"},{"type":"speech","time":1603378500,"counter":389,"content":"<p>It is rare that I am completely dumbfounded by the Government or the State but I really am dumbfounded.  I am very curious to hear what the Minister has to say for himself in response to the points that have been made and to the request for a free vote, which I echo on behalf of survivors.  I was talking to a survivor last night and she asked why on earth the Government would impose a whip on this issue.  It is perhaps understandable on economic issues or certain political issues in the general sense of the word but why would one want to impose a whip in respect of an issue like this?  The fact that the Government does, makes me think that Deputy Gannon is being too kind, although I understand the motivation for what he says.  I think this stinks, because if it did not stink, why would the Government impose the whip?  Why would it not just say that we could have a free vote on it?  It is a matter of conscience.  The survivors are some of the people most abused by the institutions of church and State in this country.  They are concerned about what the Government is doing and do not want it to do what it is doing, and it is going to impose a whip and ram through a Bill, despite those appeals and protestations.  Why would the Government do that?<\/p>  <p>  Why would the Minister not accept any amendments?  It stinks.  There is more to it than the Minister is saying.  His explanations for his actions do not add up.  I do not understand the claim that seems to have underpinned what the Minister is doing, that somehow he is doing this to protect the records because otherwise they would be destroyed.  What is the basis for the Minister saying that?  I do not see it.  I do not believe it is true, but yet the Minister says it.  Maeve O'Rourke's article sets out clearly why that is not the case, so why does the Minister say it?  This stinks, particularly as the Minister is saying things that nobody believes to be true.  Unless he provides a better explanation than he has given to date, I conclude that it stinks, that the worst possibilities are what is actually underpinning all of this, which is a continuation of the cover-up by the State of its appalling crimes against mothers and children.  The State does not want to tell the truth about the dark crimes, the sins it committed and the manner in which the church and State colluded in the abuse of mothers and children.  It is difficult not to conclude that that is clearly what is going on here.<\/p>  <p>  If the Minister can convince us otherwise, I am listening.  The Ceann Comhairle said we should listen to each other.  I am open to hearing an argument, but I have not heard an argument from the Government to date.  There is much at stake for people here.  There is the identities of the people who have already been traumatised.  It is their history, and their identities.  What right has the State to seal those up, to decide what is done with them, and where they should go rather than the people whose histories and identities they are?  It is absolutely shocking.  In the spirit of what the Ceann Comhairle said about listening, I am hopeful that the Minister is listening to the appeals, questions and concerns and is going to convince us, to use the Ceann Comhairle's terms, that there is a good reason for what the Government is doing and that there is no reason to be suspicious about the imposition of a whip in respect of a matter like this.  I suspect, however, that we are not going to be convinced.  I hope I am wrong, but I suspect I am not.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102200045#TT00300","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1603378500,"counter":390,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Boyd Barrett.

I am also aware that this debate, particularly over the past two weeks, has exacerbated that rawness.  That does not sit easily with me.<\/p>  <p>  I am bringing forward a Bill today whose purpose is to protect a database created by the commission on mother and baby homes.  The commission and I believe this database will be of significant benefit to the many mothers and children who were separated by the process of the mother and baby homes.  We had a lengthy eight-hour debate in the Seanad last week in which Senators raised many of the points we heard last night and other points.  In response to that debate, I am bringing forward two amendments addressing the significant issues raised by Senators from parties represented here and Independent groupings.<\/p>  <p>  In response to what was said in the D&aacute;il, as well as through engagement with Deputies, Senators and academics over the past two weeks, I propose two political processes to address some of the issues set out in the amendments.  I was upfront when I said I could not accept them as amendments but I would seek to resolve issues through initiating a process.  That is a commitment that I will speak to again in the course of the debate today.<\/p>  <p>  I have been criticised for not listening and for what I said about amendments.  I am bringing forward two amendments solely on the basis of what I have heard in the context of this debate.  I am also bringing forward a number of political solutions to other issues in this debate.  I must make the point, however, that this Bill does not seal the archive of the mother and baby homes.  That claim has been repeated countless times in this House.  It is incorrect.  This Bill seeks to protect a database and ensure it is not sealed in that archive.<\/p>  <p>  The law on the archive being sealed comes from the original Commissions of Investigation Act 2004.  When the commission on mother and baby homes was established in 2015 by the Oireachtas, it used the 2004 law as its basis and the consequence of that was the application of the 30-year archive rule.  Accordingly, when the commission on mother and baby homes brings forth its final report and stands dissolved in law, its archive will be transferred to my Department and will be sealed for 30 years under the legislation.<\/p>  <p>  In the House yesterday, I acknowledged the real problems created by that 30-year seal, in particular the real issue as regards access to personal and incredibly pertinent information.  I brought forward this legislation because it will take the database out of the archive and give it to Tusla.  That database is immediately available for use in the future, which will be incredibly beneficial.  That is the sole purpose of what I am trying to achieve with this legislation.<\/p>  <p>  My amendments Nos. 3, 5, 25, 26 and 63 will ensure that a copy of the database of the mother and baby homes and the related records will remain in the archive, as well as being transferred to Tusla.  Under the original Bill, the database and the records supporting it were to be taken out of the archive and transferred to Tusla.  Many Senators, Deputies and others have flagged that as a problem.  They wanted to ensure that an entire copy of the archive was always kept together.  Responding to that, we are bringing forward amendment No. 26 which will ensure the entire archive is kept together.  A copy of the database will be made and left in the archive.  The original of the database will transfer to Tusla and be used.  I have listened carefully to the arguments for this from Deputies and Senators.  I am acting to achieve that particular goal.<\/p>  <p>  Several Deputies have suggested Tusla is not the right repository for the database if it is taken out of the archive.  When the commission on mother and baby homes was established, it copied the records of a wide range of bodies relevant to its investigations.  Tusla at that stage held the records for 15 of the 18 mother and baby homes being investigated.  There were no records for three of them or they could not be found.  Tusla had the original records for 15 of them.  The commission took scanned copies of all of those records.  The originals remain with Tusla.  The commission took records from some other bodies too, such as PACT, the Protestant Adoption Society, and the Regina Coeli Hostel.  These were other bodies that had records relating to certain mother and baby homes and county homes.  The copies of those records were used by the commission to create this database.  It was able to trace the names and dates upon which women entered the various mother and baby homes and use that to link to children exiting those mother and baby homes, primarily through the various adoption processes, some of which we know were extremely questionable.<\/p> <p>For all those records that were copied by the commission to further its investigation over five years, we now have a database linking mothers and their children.  That is an electronic database that exists.<\/p> <p> Under the current Commissions of Investigation Act, when the commission reports, it stands dissolved and its entire work archive is sealed for 30 years.  The commission in the sixth interim report, of which I will speak later, informed the Government about how it recognised the value of the database and it expressed concern that under the legislation, the database would have to go into its archive, becoming inaccessible.  It is the taking of this database out of the archive to ensure it can be used that we are bringing forward with this legislation.<\/p> <p> My Department made the decision that the database would rest with Tusla in the interim.  We believe the database and the supporting records should rest with Tusla primarily because under the current legislation, the Adoption Act 2010, Tusla has the responsibility for tracing in Ireland.  It is an inadequate system and there has been much criticism of Tusla for how it has engaged with survivors seeking information.  I cannot speak to every case but in many cases Tusla was simply unable to give survivors what they needed because the legislation in Ireland is so inadequate.<\/p> <p> Deputy Sherlock spoke earlier about information and tracing legislation and the fact we do not have information and tracing legislation in tandem with this Bill.  I would love to have it but Deputies know how long it took for information and tracing legislation to get to Report Stage in the previous Seanad; the then-Minister, former Deputy Zappone, withdrew the legislation at that point.<\/p> <p> Last week I committed in the Seanad to seeking to bring information and tracing legislation forward next year.  It is important that I am as realistic as possible with timelines as too often expectations are raised and dashed.  A significant amount of work has been done on information and tracing to get us where we got to in the previous Oireachtas and the work has continued in my Department since to bring forward meaningful information and tracing legislation.  I do not need to tell Deputies that the process will be difficult and hard calls will need to be made on the legislation.  The debate here has demonstrated to all of us the absolute importance of giving information to the survivors of these homes.<\/p> <p> I have digressed a little.  We have existing tracing legislation in the country with the Adoption Act 2010 and Tusla has been given the role of tracing adopted children under the Act.  Tusla has very extensive files of mother and baby homes, as I alluded to.  The commission took copies of the files and the originals remain with Tusla.  As it currently stands and without the database, when somebody comes to Tusla to seek tracing services, Tusla must assign a social worker and go through the original files.<\/p> <p> If we give this database and the supporting records to Tusla, it will be able to use that database to assist existing tracing services for anybody seeking information about one of the mother and baby homes from which Tusla holds the original records.  It would be able to use the database to fulfil its existing tracing functions.  Having the database will make the process much easier.  That is the prime reason we believe Tusla is the right place for this; there would be an immediate benefit to Tusla holding this database with respect to its existing tracing services, limited as they are.<\/p> <p> The database comprises records primarily originating in Tusla but there are also records from other institutions and bodies.  Tusla will have a GDPR responsibility over the entire database and all the records, which is important.  All the database and related records for that database which have been transferred to Tusla will be covered by GDPR, which is significant.<\/p> <p> I spoke to the issue of capacity yesterday.  Tusla has approximately 60 staff dedicated solely to tracing.  I have heard what Deputies have said about inadequacy in this work and the individual circumstances where the service has not been right.  As the line Minister with responsibility for Tusla I ask that where Deputies come across individual cases like this, they should bring them to my attention and I will seek to address them.  The Adoption Authority of Ireland, which is a fantastic body, has 29 employees in total.  Tusla has 60 dedicated to tracing and the adoption authority has 29 in total.  Again, we believe Tusla is the best place to achieve value from the database in the interim.<\/p> <p> All that being said, we are speaking about an interim resting place for the database.  In the context of the information and tracing legislation I will bring forward next year, a discussion and decision must come about on what body will in the long term engage and undertake information and tracing in this country.  I hear the very real concerns about Tusla doing this and I do not have the answer on who will undertake information and tracing in the long term but it will be answered in future information and tracing legislation.  For the reasons I have outlined to Deputies, the interim solution is for the database and related records to go to Tusla, which would be able to fulfil its existing statutory functions on tracing with the records originally in its custody and where Tusla has the GDPR responsibility for all the records transferred.  That even applies to the copies of the records that did not originate with Tusla.<\/p> <p> There is also the question of the sixth interim report, which was submitted by the commission to the then-Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, former Deputy Zappone, on 14 February this year.  In the interim report, the commission sought another extension of its work.  As with all requests for extensions of its work done through interim reports, this was brought to the Government.  In the request, significant legal and practical issues were raised relevant to the completion of the commission's programme of work at the time.  It is those issues around the database that this Bill seeks to address.<\/p> <p> Subsequent to the report there was extensive engagement between the commission and the Office of the Attorney General on the matters raised.  The report did not include any findings by the commission on the substantive matters it examined over the previous four and a half years.  I will publish the sixth interim report when I publish the final report of the commission of investigation.  At that stage it will be available for all Deputies to see.<\/p> <p> I have outlined the reasons I cannot accept the amendments from Deputies relating to Tusla or the Adoption Authority of Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102200046#UU00200","speaker":"1477","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1603379700,"counter":395,"content":"<p>I suppose as we know the Minister will not accept any amendments today, I will speak for the record, as it is the only thing we can do.<\/p> <p>Regarding the amendments to which the Minister just referred, I note that there have been many references to Dr. Maeve O'Rourke's article on <i>thejournal.ie<\/i>today.  I would like to put some of it on the record.  Dr. O'Rourke writes that the first amendment is intended &quot;to ensure that the Minister receives a full copy of the commission of investigation's entire archive, including a copy of the part of the archive that is sent to Tusla&quot;.  That amendment is very welcome and I thank the Minister for including it.  Dr. O'Rourke describes the intention of the second amendment as:<\/p><blockquote>\tTo allow the Commission to continue to operate until February 2021 (although it will still deliver its final report by the end of October 2020), so that it can contact all those who gave evidence to the Confidential Committee to ask whether they would like the Commission to redact their personal data from its archive prior to the Commission depositing the archive with the Minister. <\/blockquote> <p>Regarding this latter amendment, Dr. O'Rourke goes on to argue:<\/p><blockquote>\t... the Commission or Government should give those affected by the abuses under investigation a choice as to whether they wish to be identified in their transcript of evidence in the Commission&rsquo;s archive.<br \/><br \/>However, this amendment is not the way to achieve this.<br \/><br \/>The Commission and the Government should be applying the framework of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which gives individuals many rights in respect of their personal data, including the right to be informed, the right of access, the right to rectification, the right to erasure, and the right to object to data processing.<br \/><br \/>It makes no sense to single out one of these rights and to leave out the rest including the immediate right of subject access to personal data held by the Commission. <\/blockquote> <p>People are sick of hearing many of the arguments being made by the Minister and his Department.  Dr. O'Rourke did an amazing job of debunking those arguments.  I would briefly like to go through a few of them.  One argument holds that the legislation needs to pass by 30 October or the database will be destroyed or will somehow disappear.  Nobody knows exactly why the commission feels it will have to destroy the database.  It appears to believe that it cannot deliver personal data to the Minister despite section 43 of the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004 explicitly stating that every commission of investigation has to give every document or piece of evidence gathered or created by it to the relevant Minister on concluding its work.  The general data protection regulation, GDPR, which came into force in 2018, contains no barrier to the transfer of this data to the Minister.  <br\/><br\/>Another argument which we keep hearing holds that this legislation is not about sealing the archives.  The commission was established under the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004, which requires that evidence be private and sealed for 30 years.  The public disquiet is about sealing.  Concerns have been raised on foot of the repeated briefings on the Bill given by the Minister and his Department, as well as statements by the Minister in the Seanad.  The Minister keeps stating that everything he receives from the commission will be sealed in the archives for 30 years.  For this reason, the public is campaigning for the Minister to amend the Bill to make clear that these records will not be sealed.  If the Minister does not intend to seal the archives, why not include this guarantee?  Neither the commission nor the Government is permitted under the GDPR to place a blanket seal over the entire archive in any case.<br\/><br\/>Another argument worth dispelling holds that people gave evidence under assurances that the archive would be sealed.  Nobody has asked for the testimony of vulnerable people to be revealed to the public.  We have asked for individuals to be given access to transcripts of their own evidence and to their personal and family records.  <br\/><br\/>I will address one more argument and then encourage anyone who is listening to read Dr. Maeve O'Rourke's article.  It is claimed that adoption information and tracing will be addressed by much broader legislation which the Minister will bring forward in the near future.  The commission of investigation and the Minister still cannot avoid EU law, which requires them to uphold GDPR rights in relation to the archives they hold.  It is also important to note that the commission of investigation has gathered personal data that goes beyond adoption files.<br\/><br\/>We know that the Minister will not accept any amendments but I find it difficult to believe that he is not finding it hard to push this legislation through, especially when we could simply postpone it, as other Deputies have noted.  Will he at least consider doing that?  The least that survivors deserve is for the Bill to go through proper pre-legislative scrutiny.  We all know the Minister can do that.

The one welcome thing I have heard is that Tusla's role in this is an interim measure.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to address the commission of investigation's sixth interim report.  The Minister has confirmed that it raises significant issues around the disposal of records.  He intends to publish that along with the commission's report after we pass the legislation.  This is in spite of the fact that this legislation is based on the issues raised in the sixth interim report.  The Minister will not say why he will not give it to us.  I do not know if I am making a big deal out of nothing.  There are seven reports, all of which I have read.  The Minister refuses to give us the sixth even though this legislation is based on the issues it raises.  More worryingly, we do not have sight of exchanges with the commission, which was set up to function independently, and with the Attorney General.  We know nothing about these communications.  I am asking the Minister to publish every single piece of documentation which passed between the Department, the Government and the commission since the sixth interim report, however that information is held.  I ask him to give us the sixth interim report before the day is out so that we can inform ourselves on the need for this legislation.  <\/p>  <p>  People have spoken of the Minister's bona fides, which I accept.  In recognition of that bona fides and the trust that Members have in him, I ask the Minister to tell us in plain and simple English why the sixth interim report cannot be published so that we can read it, understand it and see why it is necessary to pass this legislation in this manner.  <\/p>  <p>  Either the Minister is being absolutely disingenuous on the subject of the 30-year rule or his Department is.  He says that this legislation has nothing to do with it, which is correct.  However, it is disingenuous of the Minister to keep repeating it when he knows that the commission was set up on the basis of the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004.  That Act refers to the National Archives Act 1986, which in turn provides for the 30-year rule.  The onus is on the Minister to explain this.  Surely, seven years after the very welcome apology from the then Taoiseach, Enda Kenny, the Minister should tell the House how he is going to get around the 30-year requirement.  <\/p>  <p>  Let me take a step back.  The 2004 Act states in black and white that the commission must hand all of the documents, information and testimony over the Minister.  The Minister tells us that he will be bound by the 30-year rule.  Let us accept that for the sake of argument.  The Minister and his Department then have a duty to tell us how they will change that because of the importance of this archive of information, which has been highlighted in every single report, including the interdepartmental record that led to the commission of investigation as well as the interim reports of the commission itself.  I will return to the importance of the archive in a minute. <\/p>  <p>  After five and a half years and seven interim reports, and in light of the issues raised in the sixth interim report, the Department has a duty to tell the House what legislation is necessary to circumvent the 30-year rule.  If we have learned anything, it is the importance of learning from documentation.  I am looking forward to seeing what the commission of investigation publishes.  Perhaps that is not the right phrase.  I am certainly not comfortable with it.   That will outline the commission's view of the evidence it has heard and the documents it has read. <\/p>  <p>  In addition to the report itself, we need to be able to see the documentation on which the commission bases its view.  If it is not possible for me and other Deputies to read that documentation, it must be possible for researchers and academics to do so.  It has to be accessible to survivors in the future.  We need that.  It is called \"empowerment\".  It would mean giving power back to the people from whom we took it.  Not only did we take their power from them, we blamed them.  We called them all sorts of names.  Now is our chance to do what is right.  The Minister has come to the House with legislation which has now been amended.<\/p> <p>I welcome the amendment tabled by the Minister which will mean that the whole block of information will be kept together under his remit.  However, his original intention was to give some of the information to Tusla.  He has explained today that he did that because he wished to enable Tusla to use the information for tracing and tracking.  If he can get around the 30-year rule for that purpose, then there is an onus on him to explain how he is getting around it and taking some information out of the 30-year rule but not other information.  I do not understand the logic there.  To be clear, if there is no way around the 30-year rule and the Minister is obliged to comply with it, there was a duty on him to come into the House and set out how the legislation can be amended to allow for this.  During a briefing on this issue, I attempted to ask that question, however inarticulately, and the Minister replied that so doing would undermine the whole basis on which the commission functioned.  In other words, he claimed that people went forward to the commission on the basis that anything they stated to it would be sealed for 30 years.  I do not believe that one single person who was in a mother and baby home or came forward on behalf of a family member who was in a mother and baby home went to the commission on the understanding that anything they said would be sealed for 30 years.  I do not think that was the case.  That begs the question as to whom the Minister is protecting - not him personally - when he speaks about having to seal the information except for the segment that has gone to Tusla.  Whom is he protecting in that regard?  Which witness or body is he protecting in insisting that? <\/p> <p> Another aspect of the matter is whether the 30-year rule applies from the establishment of the commission onwards and to the documents used in the commission even though those documents go back 50, 60 or 70 years.  Where does the 30-year rule apply?  The mother and baby home in Galway closed in 1961.  We are way beyond the 30-year rule.  What index has been made of the documents for various years, not to mention the source and contents of the documents?  What index has been made of the documents that are beyond the 30-year rule?  No information whatever has been provided in that regard.<\/p> <p> The Minister referred to Tusla having a capacity of 20.  Tusla does not have enough social workers.  There are children on a waiting list.  Some therapists working for Tusla who have been sidelined to tracing and tracking in the context of Covid.  I feel for the staff in Tusla.  It has an appalling and mixed-up name that, as I have previously stated in the House, really reflects what the State did when it created Tusla under the 2013 Act which came into operation in 2014.  I think the name is based on t&uacute;s l&aacute;.  I do not even know how to pronounce it.  The Irish word \"t&uacute;s\" means beginning and the word \"l&aacute;\" means day.  I presume the name \"Tusla\" refers to the beginning of a new day, but the s&iacute;neadh fada is gone and the meaning is gone.  Maybe that indicates what was done to Tusla when it was set up.  The Minister referred to the 2010 Act putting the obligation on Tusla, but it was not in existence in 2010.  It only came into existence in 2014.<\/p> <p> I do not mean to nitpick.  I am not an expert on any of this.  My strength comes from my personal involvement, the privileged life I have led and the privilege of having a voice.   I would prefer to be having a cup of tea outside rather than having to go through all of this.  It is emotionally and intellectually draining.  Most of all, it is unacceptable.  I stated yesterday and earlier today that the language used is patriarchal.  Those who have been affected are being told that the State is using the information for their own good.  It is taking this chunk of information and giving it to Tusla because so doing will help them to trace their parents or children.  That is the approach that is being taken, rather than having an overall vision and learning.<\/p> <p> I have no words to describe what the State did to mothers and children.  It then heaped abuse on abuse after that.  Now it is coming forward, 21 years after an apology was given, with legislation that is not fit for purpose.  If I am to be honest, I do not think the amendments are great either, but they were tabled to try to amend a bad Bill, and it is a very bad Bill.  I ask the Minister to take it away and then come back to the House and tell us what is the way out of the 30 October deadline when the data will turn into pumpkins, rot, disappear or self-destruct.  The Minister has not addressed any of that.<\/p> <p> He has extended the commission to February in order to allow for the implementation of a solution that was given by the Attorney General, which I do not agree with because people went forward in confidence regarding identifying marks, their names and so on.  That is what is now being presumed.  They are being given the option of stating that they do not wish to be anonymous but, rather, wish to have their names put to it.  It should be the other way around.  If the Minister can extend the life of the commission for that purpose, why can he not extend its life in order to avoid the self-destruct button on 30 October?  Once again, it is as though the sword of Damocles is hanging over Deputies: if this is not done, a terrible thing will happen.  Can the Minister imagine what that sounds like to people who have been through this system?  They are told that if they do not do what the State tells them to do, this is what will happen.  The State is going to give them a little carrot by taking a chunk of the information and giving it to Tusla, the very organisation these people do not trust, and ask it to assist with tracing.<\/p> <p> Many Deputies, including me, begin long contributions by stating that they will be brief.  I am doing my best to be as brief as I can.  If the Minister can take out a chunk of the information and avoid the 30-year rule for it, that raises the question of why he cannot take out more of the information.  If necessary, it can be given to Tusla - I do not wish for that to be done - in trust until we sort out the mess.  Alternatively, another body could take it in trust and avoid the 30-year rule in the manner the Minister has done for the database and collected information.<\/p> <p> I again call for the publication of the sixth interim report and an explanation as to why it alone of the seven reports has not been published.  I ask the Minister to explain why he did not come into the House, after seven interim reports and five and a half years, to tell Deputies that there is a problem, the House needs to pass legislation and the matter needs to be discussed at the joint committee with the benefit of expert advice such that we could all work together.<\/p> <p> It is important to mention Catherine Corliss and other people whom I will not name on the ground in Tuam.  She worked meticulously off her own bat in Tuam from 2011 until 2013.  She got the names of 796 babies and children buried somewhere on the site.  We now know from one of the interim reports that some of those babies, infants and children are buried in what appear to be chambers used for sewage.  She paid &euro;4 for each death certificate and so on.  I wish to mention her name and the background to where we are today.  That is only one segment.  I could go back further, but I will not do so.<\/p> <p> I will quote the words of Terry Prone.  Deputies are asked not to mention names in the House, but this is in context.  She was speaking on behalf of the Sisters of Bon Secours when rumours started about burial chambers in sewage chambers.  She stated on behalf of the Bon Secours sisters to a documentary maker: \"If you come here you&rsquo;ll find no mass grave, no evidence that children were ever so buried and a local police force casting their eyes to heaven and saying, &lsquo;Yeah a few bones were found &ndash; but this was an area where famine victims were buried.  So?&rsquo;.\"  I am not singling out the Bon Secours sisters.  If we have learned anything here, it is that this involved local authorities, District Court judges, solicitors, health boards and the Department of Education.  There was State control and State involvement.  The county council owned the mother and baby home.  I cannot think of a more inappropriate name for the home.  It was owned by the county council and operated by the Bon Secours sisters.<\/p> <p>I will mention one final person, Peter Mulryan, who is a survivor.  I do not think he will mind me mentioning his name because he has gone public many times.  It is a few years since I used these notes.  Mr. Mulryan has been to the High Court on eight separate occasions trying to get access to his records.  That is the background.<br\/><br\/>I will conclude by speaking about the importance of archives.  Dr. Caitr&iacute;ona Crowe, former head of special projects of the National Archives of Ireland, wrote in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>:<\/p><blockquote>\tWhy are archives important?  Because they are evidence of events in the past that give us some certainty about what happened, if used intelligently and carefully.  In the era of &ldquo;fake news&rdquo; and the supremacy of opinion over fact, archives are a bulwark against mischievous or uninformed attempts to rewrite history.  We need to value, cherish and understand them. <\/blockquote> <p>In its report published in 2014, the interdepartmental group, which met before this commission was set up, noted:<\/p><blockquote>\t... the Group&rsquo;s examination of the extensive records which could contribute to greater public understanding of historic practices has necessarily been very modest given the scale of such records.  The Group considers that a very important benefit of such an historical survey would be to provide an inventory and analysis of the archival and other sources, both public and private, of most relevance in researching these issues. <\/blockquote> <p>I could go on, but I will not.  I know no amendments are being accepted.  I find myself in the position of thinking they are not great, mine included, but we are doing our best with very bad legislation.  The Department has been on notice for a long time.  The Government and the two which preceded it knew that there were issues with how we were going deal with a collection of documents for the first time.  It must be borne in mind that in the context of the Magdalen laundries, we had the McAleese report, the commission of investigation and Caranua.  Every report highlighted the dispersal of documents and the difficulty in getting them.  One of the interim reports referred to a congregation of sisters who swore an affidavit in respect of documents, which the commission found incredible - &quot;incredible&quot; is my word.  The commission had difficulty believing an affidavit that the nuns swore and so on.  We have known for a very long time.<br\/><br\/>Regarding the confidential briefing notes that Deputies got when discussing the mother and baby homes in recent years, in 2012 the intelligence unit in the Department of Health highlighted all these issues and the concerns regarding practices that the commission is investigating.  The Minister has come to us with this Bill and has told us and the people listening that they are mixing up different things and that this is not about sealing documents away for 30 years.  That is disingenuous and unacceptable.  For as long as I have a voice, I will continue to say that.<br\/><br\/>For the last time, I appeal to the Minister to lead differently.  We all came in to do things differently and not to repeat Department speak.  I do not blame staff.  I see how hard they work, but it is time to lead and it is our duty to lead.  What is the solution to get the Minister out of this mess?  This legislation is not the solution.  How do we change the deadline that is, according to the Minister, looming over us?  I do not accept that it is.  How does the Minister, as a leader, get around that so that we can have satisfactory legislation?  How can he stand here and tell us that the sixth report will be published after bad legislation is passed?  The Minister should try to listen to us and reflect.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102200048#WW00200","speaker":"1577","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1603381500,"counter":400,"content":"<p>I note with interest the point made by Deputy Connolly about the creation of Tusla.  It is a word that does not trip off the tongue easily.  I do not even know if there is a statutory basis for the name &quot;Tusla&quot;.  I believe it is called the Child and Family Agency.  We would all do ourselves a favour if we continue to refer to it as the Child and Family Agency.  I do not know when the marketing people came in and decided to give it this glossy title.  Perhaps this is something that should be reviewed and revised.  I agree with the Deputy in that respect.<\/p><p>The Minister is again stating unambiguously that the Bill does not seal the mother and baby homes archive for 30 years.  Do I understand that correctly?  The Minister is nodding in the affirmative.  Last night he said: &quot;this Bill does not seal the mother and baby homes archive for 30 years.&quot;  Later in that debate, he also said<\/p> <blockquote> \tThe 2004 Act provides for the publication of the final report of a commission by the prescribed Minister and further provides that the archive of records will remain sealed tor a period of 30 years, after which time its availability for public inspection is governed in accordance with the National Archives Act 1986. <\/blockquote>  <p>While I want to give the Minister the benefit of the doubt, these seem to be contradictory statements.  While I do not mean this in any pejorative way, there may be a bit of wizardry going on with the words.  While, technically speaking, the Bill before us may not seal the database or the records, the Minister has acknowledged that the 2004 Act on which all this hinges provides for the records to remain sealed.  That is the point I cannot reconcile in my mind.  That is the perception I have, and I am quoting the Minister's own words back to him.  We wanted more time to deliberate on this so that we could go through this line by line, dissect the Minister's words and scrutinise the legislation adequately so that we could have a clear conscience collectively that we were passing legislation that would not be detrimental to the women, children, relatives and everybody directly affected by the legislation.<\/p><p>I ask the Minister to clarify for us his intention in respect of this in the simplest language.  Our interpretation is that there is a definitive sealing of the records.  The Minister made the point previously, in response to points I made on the information and tracing Bill.  I acknowledge the Minister's words with regard to there being a process and that he hopes to bring the information and tracing Bill before us next year.  The Minister will forgive me if I am somewhat sceptical about his ability to do that.  I am not referring to his personal ability to do it.  I do not doubt his bona fides in this respect.  However, the information and tracing Bill stopped like a juggernaut and it has not started again, and I do not understand why.  That needs explaining and further interrogation because it is germane to this Bill, not from the privacy or confidentiality aspects but from the point of view of seeking information and devising a process to facilitate people to seek the information they so deserve and that is theirs as of right.<\/p> <p>I ask that the Minister please clarify the seeming contradictions in his Second Stage speech last night on the records' sealing.  He stated: <\/p><blockquote>\tThe 2004 Act provides for the publication of the final report of a commission by the prescribed Minister and further provides that the archive of records will remain sealed tor a period of 30 years, after which time its availability for public inspection is governed in accordance with the National Archives Act 1986. <\/blockquote> ","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102200050#YY00200","speaker":"1514","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1603382100,"counter":402,"content":"<p>The process of this Bill and the Minister's work has not changed at all.  He has come to the Chamber and said clearly that he refuses to listen to the arguments put forward and he will accept no amendments from the Opposition.  That fits perfectly with the process so far, which has refused to listen to the Opposition, to the women and to the people who were born in those homes.<\/p>  <p>  Hundreds of people who spent time in those homes are watching this debate in the D&aacute;il from their sitting rooms.  They will be saying that the Minister's stonewalling of these amendments is perfectly consistent with the Government's entire approach to their lives; there is no difference at all.  It makes this whole process theatre.  People come into the Chamber with nailed down perspectives on votes and amendments without taking into consideration the information behind them.  The Minister is asking us to buy a pig in a poke.  He is asking us to back him, that the Government will introduce further legislation in future, and will release reports in the future and that we should just trust them now.  Why would any of the women or people watching from their sitting rooms trust the Government on this now?  What has the Government given them that they would be able to trust it?  <\/p>  <p>  I will go through some of the amendments I tabled to ask why they were not considered logical amendments.  One discusses relevant persons whose details are held in these records and who should have access to the records.  The idea is to strike a fair and healthy balance regarding all the issues that have been raised, including consent, confidentiality, public interest and rights to one's records.  The specific amendment ensures that relevant persons such as former residents of mother and baby homes will be able to access their own records.  Another amendment provides that \"Nothing in this Act shall be construed as denying a relevant person whose personal information is held by the agency, authority and\/or Minister from accessing such data as is directly relevant to them\".  It almost feels futile to go through the content of these amendments given that the Minister has come in to stonewall this.  It is heartbreaking to see a Green Party Minister do this.  There was at least a varnish of an effort to work constructively with Opposition Members but that varnish has disappeared by now. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102200051#ZZ00200","speaker":"1504"},{"type":"speech","time":1603382100,"counter":403,"content":"<p>I wanted to take the opportunity to contribute again as I am conscious that we probably only have 90 minutes left in the debate so we will not reach most of our amendments.  Not only are we rushing the legislation, we are rushing this crucial part of the debate and will not even have the opportunity to put forward the arguments for why we tabled these amendments.  As the day has progressed, it has become increasingly clear this is a shambles.  I wish to put some of the rationale for some of our amendments on the record.<\/p>  <p>  There is no principled reason the Oireachtas fail to legislate to ensure the Minister responds to personal data access requests once he receives the archive.  Neither the commission or the Minister has explained why, as a matter of principle, individuals effected by torture or other cruel treatment, forced family separation, enforced disappearance, or the fate or whereabouts of a family member who died while detained or abducted remain unknown and medical experimentation should not have full access to their personal data, including the transcript or their own evidence to the commission.  I would like an answer to that, if possible.  <\/p>  <p>  The fact that they did not have any access to the commission's archive for the duration of the investigation is a major breech of their basic rights under the European Convention on Human Rights to be properly involved in any inquiry into the abuse they suffered.  They should have been able to receive a copy of all their or their deceased relatives' personal data and their transcript of evidence and they should have been invited to comment on the evidence being received from the State and non-State institutions responsible for the treatment of mothers and their children.  It is not acceptable to compound that human rights abuse by denying access to personal data in the Minister's possession for the next 30 years.  The only justification which the Minister has offered is that the 2004 Act envisages a commission's archive being sealed for 30 years upon deposit with the Minister.  There is no obligation on the Minister to seal the records under this Act.  In fact, rather than be bound to secrecy, the Oireachtas could legislate to unseal record and evidence gathered by the commission.<\/p>  <p>  We want to reiterate that this legislation needs to be scrapped.  I do not care if I sound like a broken record.  I appeal to the Minister regarding the time.  We are having to explain why we are putting forward amendments while we rush through.  We should at least have the time to debate those properly.  We need to call a halt to this, put the brakes on and give it the proper time that it deserves, and take the opportunity to ensure the records are not sealed or passed over to Tusla.  We need to engage in consultation with the survivors which goes to the heart of the whole matter.  It is extremely frustrating that we are rushed on this.  <\/p>  <p>  We tabled an amendment on indexing.  To engage in debate and consultation on further unsealing of the commission's archive, it is necessary to know what it contains.  The archive deposited with the Minister is likely to include witness testimony, State records, many of which should be in the National Archives, but the originals are not because of the National Archives chronic under-funding, institutional records, financial records, correspondence, and bishops' and diocesan records.  There could, therefore, be hundreds of thousands of items, if not more.  How can the Government justify continued sealing of the archive without explaining what is in it and why exactly it needs to be sealed?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102200051#ZZ00300","speaker":"1449"},{"type":"speech","time":1603382100,"counter":404,"content":"<p>I thank the Cathaoirleach for the opportunity to speak again. although I wonder what is the point.

I am not qualified enough to add anything but I want to echo her call.  Since the Minister will not accept any amendments, maybe he will publish the sixth interim report, as Deputy Connolly called for, and do so before this legislation passes tonight.  Surely he can call his Department and tell his officials to publish it on its website in the next half hour?  Surely it is not that important.

If he is not able to simplify his argument so that we in this House and those outside the House who are impacted by these issues can understand it, then we have a problem.<\/p><p>The Minister's amendment No. 39 sets out a new section 6, subsection (1) of which states:<\/p> <blockquote> \tNotwithstanding the Act of 2004, the Commission shall stand dissolved on 28 February 2021. <\/blockquote>  <p>He has said that the purpose of this provision is to allow the commission to continue to operate so that it can contact all those who gave evidence to the confidential committee to ask whether they would like the commission to redact their personal data from its archive.

The Minister needs to explain what is meant by &quot;destroyed&quot;.  I asked him to do so last night and even gave him options that might be envisaged, including shredding, burning and self-destruction.  We need an answer as to what is meant by the database being &quot;destroyed&quot;.  I am trying to offer the Minister a way out that would give everybody more time to deal with this issue.  He says the issue is not about the sealing of the archive, because that comes under different legislation.  It does not matter which legislation applies.  The sealing of the archive has become the issue of concern for survivors and for the Deputies who oppose his Bill, albeit that it is a result of legislation enacted in 2004.<\/p><p>A possible way out for us all, as I have proposed, is for the Minister to delete section 6(2), as inserted by amendment No. 39, and thereby extend the deadline for the archive to be sealed until 28 February 2021.

If that is the position he feels he has been boxed into, he could at least delete that particular subsection and give us time to react to what is, as Deputy Connolly outlined, a very bad piece of legislation.  The Minister does not fully know what he is going to seal on 30 October.  I know he does not know because he told me so the other day, unless he has been since more fully informed.  He knows most of what will be sealed but not all of it.  Apart from the agony this causes for the survivors and those concerned with them, there is also the question of losing access to very important historical documents relating to certain institutions and to the conduct of the State and its institutions.  The Minister does not know about those documents, which means that nobody knows about them.

The former Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Katherine Zappone, asked on a number of occasions for it to be published and several speakers have already spoken about it.  Why has it not been published?  The Minister spoke about splitting the report and sending some of the data to Tusla for the reasons he stated.  However, the other half of the material will be sealed for 30 years.  Is the issue one of concern about what information is contained in the other part of the material?  As the last speaker said, the Minister does not know what is in it and nor does anybody else, although we can suspect and surmise.  We are all well aware of, and can speak frankly about, the collusion that took place between the State, the church, solicitors and so on.  We have all heard the statements and testimonies of survivors.<\/p>  <p>  Listening to the majority of speakers on this side of the House, it is clear the biggest concern is that we do the right thing.  It has been said over and over again that we are rushing through very bad legislation.  I said last night that a bad law is an unjust law and an unjust law is an injustice to the people to whom we owe it to get their testimonies heard.  I join a previous speaker in calling for the publication of the sixth interim report.  Let us have the evidence.  In any case in any court, under any law and in any country, one is entitled to all the evidence before making a judgment.  It may be unintended but the Minister would be letting down himself if he does not ensure all the evidence is available.  This is not a personal attack on him.  I understand that whips are being cracked and I have appealed to Deputies in other parties to do the right thing.<\/p>  <p>  This is about dealing with historical abuse.  It is about telling the truth so that this type of thing never happens again.  We are 60 or 70 years on from some of these events and we are going back to the same thing again.  It is an Irish way of doing things to believe that if we do not talk about something, it will go away.  If we push it under the carpet and say nothing, it will not be seen.  That has to stop.  My worry is that the report is so damning and puts so many people and organisations on the hook that the Minister is doing what he is doing through fear of letting down a few and, by doing so, he is letting more suffer.  We are well aware that chemical trials were done in these places, which means pharmaceutical companies were involved, with the backing of the State, local authorities and the courts.  I am concerned that the Minister would sooner cover up that and protect those involved and, as a consequence, let the few survivors who are left, and their children who are also suffering, suffer until they die without getting any justice whatsoever.<\/p>  <p>  We all come into this House with strong beliefs, although our beliefs are different.  We have had discussions on this issue on several occasions even during my few years as a Deputy.  It has become even clearer to me over the past two days that people on this side of the House are genuinely concerned about the issue and really want to do the right thing.  We have all made appeals to the Minister and I will do so again.  Will he go back to his own party, Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il, sit down with his colleagues and tell them that there have been a lot of valid points made in this House?  It is not about being nasty and it certainly is not about scoring political points.  The Minister can hear that the tone of my voice is a lot different from what it was yesterday.  I have been in constant contact with survivors, even while sitting in the Chamber, and they are not impressed.  That is being very polite.  They are not impressed with what they are seeing.<\/p> <p>One person texted me a while ago to say their heart is sinking and they are losing faith.  The Minister is where the buck stops this evening.  The Minister is the one who will hold all of these records.  He has the power to make a stand today, to turn around to his own party and the rest of the coalition and say for once in his life he is going to do the right thing, to stand up and show all the cards on the table without caring who has the four aces or the two jokers.  The two jokers are going to be out.  I appeal to the Minister to listen to this side of the House, to listen to the speakers who have appealed to him tonight and not guillotine this debate tonight.  I do not want to be attached to it.  We all make mistakes.  God knows I have made so many I could write two books on them.  I would probably have seven or eight reports.  One puts the hand up when one makes a mistake and, if brave enough, apologises.  It has gone on for too long.  It is now the chance for the State and everybody else who colluded in the abuse of these people over the years to stand up and be counted, put up their hand, say they made a mistake and move on from that.  If we bury this and guillotine it tonight we will be back here again because we will rehash something.  We will need to come back in again.  We might need to go outside the jurisdiction, but these people deserve the honesty and the truth.  They need to know what happened.  As I said during last night's debate, they went into this process, not to tell their stories to be famous, but to tell the story so it would never happen again.<\/p> <p> There has been a little bit of coverage outside the House in the media.  Again, I believe it is shameful because what has happened here is an absolutely massive blimp on Irish history.  It will be remembered by me and others and at least we will be able to pass it on in stories.  If the Minister does not do the right thing tonight he knows what will happen when this information is locked up.  This is a generation that does not have 30 years left in their lives.  Most of these survivors do not have 30 years left to live.  Many of their siblings will not have 30 years left to live.  The Minister has said that while some part of it has to be hidden he does not know what is to be hidden, but I suspect that with this 30-year rule it must be fairly dangerous if the Government does not want it in public.  But they are not telling the Minister.  Does the Minister understand what I say?  Those generations will never see the record and then it disappears.  That is wrong.  I ask the Minister to get off the high horse, shrug down the shoulders and go back in as a team manager to say we are changing tactics here, this is a different game now, to get out there and tell the truth.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102200052#AAA00300","speaker":"1452","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1603383300,"counter":409,"content":"<p>I do not know if the Minister gets the sense from the Chamber today that there is a real sadness here.  As the previous speaker said, there is a sinking feeling because we know the clock is ticking and that nothing is going to change, whatever efforts we make.  There is an inevitability that those women are going to be let down again and that their histories and their information will be put beyond their reach.  It is an incredibly unfortunate, disappointing and shameful thing that will happen today.<\/p>  <p>  I want to have an opportunity to get my amendments on the record even if it will not actually make any difference to the end result.  I find it difficult to understand that if the Minister or I, or anyone in this Chamber, went into any government body that held information on us we could get access to it and yet a seal will be triggered by this Bill, and regardless of what the Minister has said those survivors will not be able to access their information.  I do not understand how the primary legislation around data protection and GDPR does not apply to this database.<\/p>  <p>  Many speakers have referred to Dr. Maeve O'Rourke who has done a huge amount of work in this area.  Dr. O'Rourke has outlined that the commission and the Government should be applying the framework of the EU general data protection regulation, GDPR, which gives individuals many rights on their personal data, including the right to be informed, the right of access, the right of rectification, the right to erasure and the right to object to data processing.  One of the Minister's amendments enables the right of erasure but he ignores all the other rights that come in that package.<\/p>  <p>  Under GDPR legislation neither the commission nor the Government is permitted to place a blanket seal over the entire archive it holds.  Under article 23, restrictions can only be placed on data subject rights, including the fundamental right of access to personal data, to the extent necessary and proportionate in a democratic society to achieve a legitimate aim and only in a way that still respects the essence of the right.  The Government has not explained why it is denying individuals, who were subjected to forced family separation, access to their own transcripts of evidence and personal and family records.  The Minister has not explained why that is a necessary and proportionate measure to safeguard the effective operation of this or any other commission or future co-operation of witnesses.  In fact, I imagine that by telling a person the Government is going to take his or her information, use that information and seal it away, it would discourage the person and prevent him or her from participating in any further commission.<\/p>  <p>  My amendments to the Bill attempt to reassert the primacy of the GDPR legislation.  I have also included the Adoption Authority of Ireland, as have other Members.  The rationale is essentially the same, that we listen to the survivors.  They do not want their data going to Tusla.  The Adoption Authority of Ireland seemed a very practical and good solution and alternative to that.  The authority has the capacity to manage this information.  Again, this is what the survivors want.  They do not want the data going to Tusla.<\/p>  <p>  Some of my amendments also provide for looking forward in time to the Minster laying before the Houses of the Oireachtas a number of reports, one of which is the prospective development of a national archive and the second to support the right to, and strengthen access to, birth and early life information, and to include measures to support access to the information on birth, early life health or family death.  My amendment is time limiting these.  While the Minister asks the women to trust him because he is going to do something on this, we have not seen any timelines.  I am aware that it is difficult to put timelines into something like this but I believe we need to bind them somehow.<\/p>  <p>  These amendments are to ensure we go beyond today's legislation and that consultation with survivors remains paramount.  The one stark thing with this legislation is that there was no consultation with survivors.  I cannot reconcile that.  Restorative justice requires that full consultation is carried out with representative groups so that all opinions, ideas and concerns are addressed.<\/p>  <p>  I hope it does not, but assuming the Bill goes through tonight as the Minister wishes, I ask that the Minister immediately starts talking to survivors and starts working to build their trust again to make sure what they need and what they want to see happen happens very quickly.<\/p>  <p>  I note the Minister did not take the opportunity to answer my question on the free vote.  I would like an answer on that because this goes to the heart of Members.  As my colleague Deputy Gannon said, issues of taxation or policy issues are okay for a whip, but this is not one of those.  Given the sensitive and personal nature of the matter I believe it warrants a free vote.  I ask that the Minister respond to that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102200053#BBB00200","speaker":"1627"},{"type":"speech","time":1603383900,"counter":410,"content":"<p>I appreciate being allowed to speak a second time.  I last spoke before the Minister had replied.  He has shown steadfast unwillingness and belligerence with regard to all of the amendments.  It is sad to see it suggested that an issue that has gone on for so long, nearly three quarters of century in places, should go on for a full century and that access to these survivors' records should be denied to them, their families, their loved ones and campaigners for justice.  I have been in the D&aacute;il for nearly 14 years and have been here for a number of debates on this sad and deplorable issue.  I have seen taoisigh and others brought to tears when apologising.  I was going to refer to crocodile tears, although I do not mean that personally, but tears like these, pious platitudes, nice or humbling words and passionate views and speeches are no good to survivors.  This needs to be dealt with.  We cannot push it any further down the road.<\/p>  <p>  I again thank the people who took the trouble to email, write to or ring me or to call to my office.  Even today, I got a call from a man in Nenagh about what went on in Sean Ross Abbey in Roscrea in my own county.  The people involved there have fought the good fight and have been blocked at every turn.  They have some awful and harrowing stories to tell.  I support them, thank them and give them some solace.  If they are watching from home today, they will see very few in the Chamber and they will see a Minister, who is a member of the Green Party, which tells us that it is modern in its thinking and which is passionate about new climate initiatives on so on, toeing the party line and complying with the party whip for the sake of a State car and getting his legs under the table of Government.  The Minister will deny everything he has claimed to stand for.  I know many who will be galled to vote down this amendment tonight, but who will still do so.  As a previous speaker said, one can understand the whip being used on budgetary or taxation legislation, but there is no place for party whips in such an emotional and charged atmosphere and when dealing with such a sensitive and sad saga in our history. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102200054#CCC00100","speaker":"1612"},{"type":"speech","time":1603383900,"counter":411,"content":"<p>Will the Deputy speak to the amendment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102200054#CCC00200","speaker":"1572"},{"type":"speech","time":1603383900,"counter":412,"content":"<p>I am speaking to the amendment.  I am speaking to the fact that the Minister has rejected each and every amendment.  With the Acting Chairman's permission, I am making the point, which I will not labour, that I am truly saddened to think that a Green Party Minister would act in this way.  I do not see many of his colleagues around him or behind him.  There are not many who have come in to speak in support of him or to provide him with moral support because they know this is wrong no matter what way one looks at it.  The main wrong has been perpetrated again on the survivors and on their families and support groups.  These people met with the former Minister, Katherine Zappone, and told her clearly that they did not want anonymity and that they wanted their names out there.  This is all codswallop.  It is a game of hide-and-go-seek.  It is a case of ducking and dodging.  It is the worst type of politics.  I expected better from Deputy Eamon Ryan, whom I respect, and from the Green Party.  It is very sad to see the price of power.<\/p>  <p>  In the two debates we are having today, including the one this morning about extending ministerial powers, the people have been forgotten.  People are only used as cannon fodder for the ballot box.

I will just speak for a few minutes before the Minister responds.  I thank the Acting Chairman.  I appreciate getting to make a second contribution.  I will refer to something to which many Deputies have referred - the GDPR, with which I have some familiarity.  As citizens of Ireland and of Europe, we enjoy certain rights under GDPR.  Colleagues have referred to these.  We enjoy the right of access to our personal information, the right to rectify any mistakes and the right to erase certain information.  We also enjoy the right to make decisions on the processing of any processing of those data.  The Minister tells us that he is protecting this information in what he is proposing in this legislation.  The law on the sealing of archives comes from the 2004 Act.  This is where the 30-year seal was activated.  Surely, GDPR and the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, in favour of which citizens in this country voted as part of the Lisbon treaty, are the overarching and overriding legislation in this regard.  They have primacy.  We often say these are EU legislation but they are now Irish legislation because we have transposed them.  The difference is that, if necessary, the European Commission can ensure that we enforce that legislation.<\/p><p>Once again, the Minister said that he is protecting this information and that the Bill needs to be passed by 30 October or some information could be destroyed.  It has been made very clear that we do not know precisely what information the Minister is talking about or what might happen to it.  Something bad might happen to some of the information.  Does GDPR not already protect that information?  The provisions of the 2004 Act have been superseded by GDPR.<\/p><p>Many people have referred to Dr. Maeve O'Rourke, whose excellent article I have read.  She has included in this article a link to a piece by Simon McGarr in which he talks about a policy document from the European Data Protection Board in June of this year.  This document sets out the limits of permissible national legislation restricting GDPR rights.  I will quote one or two excerpts from the document. The Minister is probably familiar with it but it is important to quote one or two excerpts because this is an overarching body.  One of the points it makes is that:<\/p> <blockquote> \tAny restriction must respect the essence of the right that is being restricted.  Restrictions which are general, extensive or intrusive to the extent that they void a fundamental right of its basic content cannot be justified.  If the essence of the right is compromised the restriction must be considered unlawful <\/blockquote>  <p>That is surely relevant to what we are talking about.  The second point I will take from the policy document is relevant to the 2004 Act and the possible destruction of information.  It states, &quot;In line with the GDPR and the case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union and of the European Court of Human Rights, it is indeed essential that legislative measures, which seek to restrict the scope of data subject rights, are foreseeable to persons subject to them, including with regard to their duration in time.&quot; <\/p> <p>Any restriction, therefore, that is applied retroactively or not subject to defined conditions does not meet that foreseeable criterion.  In that context, I point out to the Minister that all those people who testified and gave evidence could never have foreseen that this was going to happen.  We must understand that protections already exist.  I am not pretending I fully understand this, although I have listened and tried.  We did not have time for pre-legislative scrutiny or to go through this Bill forensically and because of that - I will only speak for myself - there is a certain amount of shooting in the dark.  Some matters, however, are very clearly explained in the statement from the European Data Protection Board.  It makes it clear that the legislation we must look at in this context is the GDPR and that the 2004 legislation is restricted and superseded by the GDPR.  I would like to hear the comments of the Minister on this issue. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102200054#CCC00500","speaker":"1605","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1603384500,"counter":416,"content":"<p>I am getting texts from survivors expressing their disgust at what they are witnessing being done by the Minister and the Government.  They are saying how pointless this whole exercise seems to be, given the Government's unwillingness to entertain amendments.  Is it not pretty damning that the people who should be at the centre of this process are disgusted at what the Government is doing?  Another person, whom I mentioned earlier, asked why on earth a whip was being imposed.  That is a question the Minister has still not answered, by the way.  Why would it be felt necessary to impose a whip?  Why would the Minister want to impose a whip?  I asked this person if he felt anything else needed to be said, as his point had been made.  He just said I should invite the Minister to do the right thing by resigning to make history in preventing a great wrong being done.  That man, on behalf of the survivors, is asking the Minister to make a statement that he is not willing to stand over this Bill and be part of a Government that would stand over what the survivors and victims do not want to happen.  Is that not pretty damning too?  Those were unsolicited texts from people who contacted me because they cannot believe what is happening.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister has been offered ways out of this situation.  Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith and others have offered him a way out by proposing that he delete the section, which I do not have in front of me, on the imperative for the commission of investigation to report at the end of this month.  If that section were deleted, it would create the space to consider this properly and give people a chance to challenge the sealing of archives.  I do not know why the Minister would not take that section out on foot of the feelings of anger being expressed.<\/p>  <p>  On the specific group of amendments, I heard the Minister's answer regarding Tusla.  I thought about his response and whether it was reasonable.  I hope he will not take up wrong because I and, I am sure, the survivors do not want to cast aspersions on the very many good people working in the Child and Family Agency.  However, the issue here is the nature of State institutions, the imperatives, if one likes, that State institutions have and the pressures on these institutions to act in a particular way.  They are State silos with their own imperatives and it is those imperatives that are not trusted by the survivors.  That is perfectly understandable and it is why the survivors do not see Tusla as the right body.  I will give an example of what I mean by that and how those imperatives can operate.  I just stumbled upon this in a very topical context.  A school principal emailed me with a circular on Covid-19 that was just sent out by the Department of Education and Skills to school principals.  I cannot read out the exact wording here but the circular stated that if a teacher tests positive, the response of the principal should not be to call the HSE but to ring the Department, which will then arrange for a public health call that will then decide on any measures regarding close contacts and the possible exclusion of people.  I ask myself why the Department of Education and Skills is interfering in a public health response in the context of the protection of children from a pandemic.  Why is it doing that?  The Department is doing that because it has its own imperatives and its imperative at the moment is to keep schools open.  If this circular is correct, it would appear that it may be interfering with what should be the proper public health protocols regarding the close contacts of a positive Covid case.  I hope the Minister understands the point I am making.<\/p>  <p>  It is the same, potentially, in the case of a body like Tusla.  We have seen examples and instances of that because Tusla has its own imperatives which may conflict with the best interests of the people we are talking about in this Bill and their needs, wants and right to access information on themselves and their history and identity.  That is why the survivors do not want Tusla to have this role, as I see it.  They do not trust the imperatives of State bodies in particular instances because they may conflict with people's aspirations, needs and desires.  I think they are right.  They have a right to have that concern and to suggest instead a body that is a bit further removed from the imperatives of the State and would not be influenced by political imperatives to cover up certain matters or not to do things that might be damaging in some way to the State.  The survivors are right to be concerned in that regard.  They are right that it would be better to have that information in the hands of a body that is less susceptible to the political imperatives of a State body and its desire to protect itself or the State.<\/p> <p> I find it amazing that the Minister is willing to allow records to be sealed for 30 years when he is not sure what they contain.  He is not quite sure what information could be in there that is relevant to particular individuals, their histories and the actions of the State in the abuse of mothers, children and individuals.  It is astonishing that the Minister would allow that and think it is acceptable when he does not even know what is or is not being sealed.  It is quite shocking that the Minister thinks it is okay for that to happen.<\/p> <p> I was born in a mother and baby home and my adoption was organised through St. Patrick's Guild, which is one of the institutions where there are records.  I am lucky and I did not have a terrible history, but there are bits of my story about which I do not know.  I might be curious to try to fill in those gaps at some point.  It is possible that bits of my story, or important bits of many people's stories, could be sealed and that I and thousands of others would never have access to those bits of our identity and history.  That is far more likely when some of those histories are absolutely terrible.  As I said, I do not want to focus too much on myself because I was lucky.  One of the people texting me at the moment went through not just one of these institutions but all of them and still has not managed to secure the information about their real identity and history.  Perhaps part of that story is embarrassing to certain people.<\/p> <p> I know bits of my own story and bits of others and some of the circumstances surrounding the separation of children from their mothers and some of the characters who were involved at the upper echelons of the State and the church are very embarrassing for them.  Powerful people utilised these institutions to protect themselves from some of their shameful and hypocritical behaviour.  Is that some of the information that will be sealed up?  We might never get to see it but it could impact on the lives and histories of real individuals still existing who have the right to know their story and all the facts surrounding their histories and their lives.  Apparently it is okay to seal that and that the Minister would not even know whether it was sealed or not.  It is unbelievable that the Minister thinks it is okay that this would happen when he has been given an out.  A few suggestions have been made of ways out for the Minister not to do what he is proposing to do.  He should do the right thing by the victims who are out there asking him not to do this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102200055#DDD00200","speaker":"1478","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1603385100,"counter":418,"content":"<p>I will address the issue of GDPR first, which was raised by Deputies Whitmore, Harkin and others.  I have seen the article by Dr. Maeve O'Rourke and other articles have addressed this particular issue as well.  My Department has engaged extensively with the Attorney General's office on this issue and the advice we have received, to which the Department is bound, is that the GDPR right of access to personal data set out in Article 15 of the GDPR is expressly prohibited by section 39 of the Commissions of Investigation Act.  Section 39 of the Act prohibits that in accordance with Article 23 of the GDPR, which allows for exceptions to the GDPR in a range of circumstances including those relating to the administration of justice.  It is on that basis that the Attorney General has advised my Department that the potential solution to the issue of access to information, which a number of Deputies have suggested, is not available.  I understand that that is a contested view.  I think Dr. O'Rourke would contest it, as would others.  I accept that and that is why I said yesterday in the D&aacute;il that I want to address this matter and broaden access.  That will require a change in laws and I do not have the answer in respect of this issue today.  I have agreed with the Attorney General that we will meet and discuss it and his office will take me through the argumentation on that point.  I hope, with its agreement, that the Joint Committee on Children, Disability, Equality and Integration can bring in academics to voice the opposite perspective and see what we can do to agree on this.  Contrary to what Deputy Pringle suggested, neither I nor my Department feel we know it all.  We are looking for solutions but they will not be brought forward in this legislation.<\/p>  <p>  Similarly, the 30-year rule stems from the 2004 Act and its interaction with the National Archives Act 1986.  I accept that by sealing the archive we will create significant issues, to which Deputy Boyd Barrett has referred, where people want to find information about their lives which is limited by the existing law, under which this commission of inquiry was set up.  What I have tried to do is to take one significant part, namely, the database constructed by the commission using records it had copied from other institutions, and take that out so it is immediately available and some of those gaps can be filled in for many people.  I have committed to coming back and looking at the 30-year ceiling and seeing what we can do to address that, particularly for personal information.<\/p>  <p>  In the context of the focus on the archive, it is also important to look at the actual commission report, which we will be receiving from my engagement with the commission on 30 October.  The commission has spend the last five years looking at many of the absolutely shocking issues, such as the vaccine trials and all these individual and collective atrocities that took place across that period.  The commission has spent the last five years investigating those.  It is going to produce a report of 4,000 pages, with sections addressing each of the mother and baby homes and county homes that come within its remit.  It will be making its assessment on the evidence it has scrutinised over five years.  That report, which has been delayed on so many occasions, is going to give us so much of the information, which has been analysed.  The judge who led this commission has a track record of undertaking incisive and sensitive investigations of other issues, including legacy issues of our country's past.  That is why, throughout this process, my aim has been to ensure the commission can report when it has indicated it is ready to do so, on 30 October.  The report will come to my Department and the Government and the Attorney General will have to review it.  After review by the Attorney General it will be published by the State.  I have made my commitment that I will see that done as quickly as possible because I think the survivors want to see that report and the analysis which has been undertaken over the past five years.  That will provide many, though not all, of the answers survivors want.  I have no doubt that the commission will set out recommendations on how the State responds to the things it has discovered and the conclusions it has made.<\/p> <p>I look forward to working on implementing those specific recommendations.<\/p> <p> The issue of a free vote requires a Cabinet decision, as does a decision to release the sixth interim report.  It has not been released up until this point because of advice from the Office of the Attorney General.  I want to come back to a number of points that Deputy Whitmore made and that others touched on, specifically in the context of archives and the amendment she tabled.  Tying into the issue of the 30 year rule and the value of having material available, I absolutely see that.  There is an archive with this commission report and with regard to the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse, which was the subject of retention of records legislation in the last D&aacute;il, which was extremely controversial and never addressed.  There is also an archive for the McAleese report.  All of these issues and the material in them, which speaks to dark periods in our nation's past, are contained there and we have to find some way to address that.  I do not have the solution for Deputies today.  What I have done and will continue to do is commit to seek ways to address that.<\/p> <p> Two weeks ago, I met with Dr. Maeve O'Rourke and Deputy Gannon and we discussed the issue of an archive.  The proposal relating to Sean McDermott Street was interesting.  I need to find out more about it.  I have been sent more details by CoLab subsequent to that meeting.  It referred to various models.  I know there is the model of what was done with the Stasi museum in eastern Europe as a potential model of how one can address a situation relating to a dark part of a country's history, with divisions created in families because of the decisions taken in East Germany and, in our own situation, decisions taken by members of families to direct a mother who is pregnant to go to a mother and baby home.  Those are models that Ireland can learn from.  I am committed to doing whatever I can as Minister to address that.<\/p> <p> In the context of this legislation and the application of the 30 year rule, coming from the 2004 Act, we want to see the mother and baby homes commission of investigation's report delivered to get the information and analysis that has taken five years published as quickly as we can.  We want to protect the database and ensure that it does not become sealed before we address issues about the 30 year rule.  We want to ensure it is available for current tracing purposes that Tusla undertakes now and that it is available for future information and tracing purposes to be provided for in legislation which I have committed to bring to the D&aacute;il in 2021.  I believe this Bill is the way in which we can deliver on those objectives.<\/p> <p> I have learned a lot from this process.  I have learned about the importance of engagement in all these sensitive issues and the importance of better communication by me.  Where I have failed to communicate either in this House or, more importantly, to survivors' groups, I apologise and I will work to do better on that.  I genuinely believe that this legislation delivers on its central purpose of protecting that database and allowing its use to try to bridge those holes in information that exist because of what happened in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102200056#EEE00200","speaker":"1477","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1603385700,"counter":420,"content":"<p>I believe the Minister's intention is as he says.  When he says that he is going to try to resolve this in the way that the survivors want, I believe that he will try.  I believe it will be difficult for survivors to put trust in the Minister as a part of the State and a member of an institution such as this.  What I would prefer to see is for this Bill to be somehow amended to give extra time.  I mentioned before that the Minister's amendments allow for the dissolution of the commission to happen on 28 February.  My understanding is that the sealing of the records will take effect upon dissolution of the commission under the 2004 Act.  I believe that a simple amendment could be made here.  If the Minister wants to give himself a year, he should allow the commission to stay in place and not dissolve it.  It can still report in October.  That will give the Minister the time he needs to put legislation in place and to look into the issue of GDPR.  As the Minister says, it is a contested view.  He can examine it, bring it to the committee and do whatever he needs to do.  He should give himself a year to do it.  That is a really simple amendment that he could make to his own amendment, to extend that period of time.  That will give everyone a bit of space.  The Minister can do his consultation, talk to survivors and get this right.  If we rush this through today, it will not be right for a long time.<\/p>  <p>  I would like to press some amendments.

I am on the point of giving up but then I realise what a privileged role I have.  If I am at the point of giving up, what is it like for someone who has been through the process?  I do not like emotional arguments and I think we have a duty not to be emotional because, while emotion is good, we have a duty to hold the system to account.  That is what democracy and being in Opposition is about.  I have asked the Minister repeatedly about the sixth interim report and he has finally said, on the advice of the Attorney General, that he cannot publish it.  That is mindbogglingly difficult to understand.  Earlier, the Minister told us he would publish it when the report was published.  I do not know what the connection is between the report which the Minister will receive, which will go to Cabinet, then the Attorney General and then be published, and the sixth interim report, which I presume is one of the reasons that we are in a mess, and the Minister will not publish it.  Will the Minister please tell us why it cannot be published?  What has the Attorney General said is so difficult in that report that we cannot be party to it?  Does the Minister realise what he is doing over and over again?  The patriarchal voice is deafening, that they know best, they know most and they will release a little bit.  It is happening again here.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister said that he tried to release one significant part, which he gave to Tusla.  On what basis can he pick out one part and not another?  He said the report has been delayed often but he does not say why it has been delayed.  As somebody who has been critical of the delays, I stood up yesterday and put that in context.  The delays are not caused by the action of the commission.  Please read the reports.  It was initially surprised by the number of people coming forward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102200057#FFF00600","speaker":"1577"}]
