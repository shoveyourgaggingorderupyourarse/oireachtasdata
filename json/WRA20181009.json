Defence Forces pay is continuing to increase in accordance with public sector pay agreements. The focus of these increases is weighted in favour of those on lower pay.<\/p>  <p>  Members of the Permanent Defence Force have received the pay increases due under the Lansdowne Road Agreement.  In addition in 2017, following negotiations with PDFORRA, improved pay scales for general service recruits and privates, who joined the Permanent Defence Force post 1 January 2013, were implemented. <\/p>  <p>  The Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020 provides for increases in pay ranging from 6.2% to 7.4% over the lifetime of the Agreement. The first increase due from 1 January 2018 has been paid to Permanent Defence Force personnel and a second increase is being applied from 1 October 2018.  Further increases in pay are scheduled for 2019 and 2020.<\/p>  <p>  By the end of the current Public Service Pay agreement the pay of all public servants (including members of the Defence Forces), earning under &euro;70,000 per annum, will be restored to pre FEMPI levels. The restoration of the 5% reduction to allowances cut under FEMPI is also scheduled in the agreement.<\/p>  <p>  New entrants to the Defence Forces will also benefit from the measures which were recently announced in relation to amendments to the pay scales for new entrant public servants recruited since January 2011. <\/p>  <p>  The Public Service Pay Commission was established to provide objective advice to Government in relation to Public Service remuneration policy.  In 2017, under my direction, the Department of Defence brought issues of recruitment and retention in the Defence Forces to the attention of the Public Sector Pay Commission (PSPC). As a direct result of that initiative the PSPC is conducting an in-depth evidence based examination of those issues. <\/p>  <p>  The Department of Defence has provided data as requested by the PSPC for consideration. The Commission's work is on-going. The Department of Defence will continue to engage with the Public Service Pay Commission throughout the process. I will give due consideration to the findings and recommendations that arises from the work of the Commission.<\/p>  <p>  The Public Service Agreement 2010-2014 (Croke Park Agreement) for the Defence Sector provided that a review would be undertaken of the current technical grading of appointments and\/or classes of appointments for enlisted personnel, including consideration of whether current requirements merit tech pay, are at the appropriate rate of tech pay (including whether a higher or lower rate of tech pay should be paid) or can be me in a more cost effective manner. A review of technician pay in the Defence Forces is ongoing in my Department and PDFORRA will be consulted on developments. <\/p>  <p>  There are a number of outstanding adjudication findings across the public service, including the Defence Forces, which cannot be implemented at this time having regard to the provisions of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act, 2009-2015. Outstanding adjudications relating to the Defence Forces include, the Army Ranger Wing Allowance, Technical Pay increase for Cooks, Account Holders Allowance and Rations and Accommodation for recruits and apprentices.<\/p>  <p>  The Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020, provides for consideration of a process to address any outstanding adjudications, having due regard to the question of their continued validity and cost implications. Discussions in this regard has commenced with the relevant representative association. <\/p>  <p>  In accordance with the Public Service Stability Agreement, 2013-2016, (the Haddington Road Agreement), all sectors across the public service were required to contribute to additional pay and productivity measures. Other sectors delivered these savings through a variety of approaches including additional working time and reduced rates of overtime payments.<\/p>  <p>  The contribution from the Defence sector included a further reduction of 10% on the rate of certain allowances payable to the Defence Forces. This included a 10% reduction in overseas allowances. There are no plans at this stage to revoke the cost savings measures under this agreement and in this regard an estimated cost of restoration of the allowance is not available.<\/p>  <p>  As I previously outlined, the Public Service Pay Commission is considering recruitment and retention issues in the Defence sector and will report in due course. This will inform future actions relating to recruitment and retention.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018100900069#WRA03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1365"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Defence Forces Representative Organisations","counter":49,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018100900069#WRA03550"},{"type":"question","counter":50,"qnumday":13,"qnumall":"[40810\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018100900069#WRA03600","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"the outstanding decisions of the conciliation and arbitration scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1305","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":51,"content":"<p>The Conciliation and Arbitration scheme for members of the Permanent Defence Force (PDF) provides a formal mechanism for the PDF representative associations, i.e. RACO and PDFORRA, to engage with the Official side.

Ireland attaches great importance to safeguarding the human rights of all prisoners, with due regard for the international standards enshrined in the United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners.<\/p>  <p>  As I have stated in this House previously, I remain very concerned about the deteriorating human rights situation in Bahrain.  Although Bahrain has repeatedly stated its commitment to improving its human rights record and safeguarding human rights as enshrined in the Bahraini Constitution, there are ongoing instances of violations of fundamental freedoms there, including violations of freedom of opinion and expression.  <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy notes, the shrinking of civil and political space is particularly worrying in light of parliamentary elections which will take place in November this year. Good governance and accountability are vital for the realisation of human rights, and Ireland is committed to encouraging full participation in democratic processes. I am aware of reports that many opposition groups have been dissolved and that their members have been barred from running for election. These developments suggest an increasingly restrictive approach, targeting those who express views which oppose or challenge the Government in any way, including through parliamentary election processes.  <\/p>  <p>  Ireland regularly conveys its concerns about human rights to the Bahraini authorities, including through the Bahraini Embassy in London and through Ireland&rsquo;s (non-resident) Ambassador to Bahrain. In February of this year, officials from my Department met with the Ambassador of Bahrain in Dublin, and raised Ireland&rsquo;s concerns about the human rights situation in Bahrain.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland also regularly raises the case of human rights in Bahrain at the Human Rights Council (HRC) in Geneva, in the form of national statements and its support to EU Statements. In Ireland&rsquo;s most recent Item 4 Statement (human rights situations that require the Council&rsquo;s attention) at the HRC session in September 2018, we expressed our concerns about &ldquo;the ongoing restrictions on civil society space and the treatment of human rights defenders in Bahrain&rdquo;. We also called on Bahrain &ldquo;to respect freedom of opinion and expression, and the right to a fair trial.&rdquo; At the previous HRC session in June 2018, Ireland also raised concerns under Item 4, and the EU in its Item 2 Statement (on the reports of the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights) also highlighted the deterioration of the human rights situation, with particular reference to the shrinking of political space in Bahrain. <\/p>  <p>  My Department will continue to monitor the situation in Bahrain, and will continue to call on the Bahraini Government to make good on their stated commitment to make progress in the area of human rights.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018100900070#WRB03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Visa Applications","counter":87,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018100900070#WRB03700"},{"type":"question","counter":88,"qnumday":33,"qnumall":"[40799\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018100900070#WRB03800","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if there is a facility for a Filipino citizen applying for a visa to deal with a named official in his Department here rather than having to liaise with officials from the consulate in Manila; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1302","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":89,"content":"<p>Ireland has no Embassy in the Philippines and no Irish officials working there.

The effects of the conflict on civilians has been exacerbated by drought, leading to severe food insecurity and the threat of famine and, in turn, massive population displacement.<\/p>  <p>  On 12 September last, the President of South Sudan, Salva Kiir, signed a peace agreement with rebel factions, opening the possibility for change.

I want to commend those who voted in the consultative referendum, and acknowledge the political leadership and courage shown by the Macedonian and Greek governments in coming to an agreement on the issue.<\/p>  <p>  It was a peaceful and democratic vote, in which 94% of votes cast were in favour of the Agreement. This represents a positive result, despite the turnout being low at 37%.  A threshold of 50% turnout is required if the outcome of a Macedonian referendum is to be regarded as legally binding.  However, as the referendum was only consultative in nature, failure to reach this threshold does not prevent politicians in Skopje from pressing ahead with the Prespa Agreement.  The Agreement must now be ratified by the parliaments of both countries, beginning with the Macedonian Assembly, if it is to enter into force and if the proposed name change is to become effective. As such, it is now in the hands of parliamentarians in Skopje to decide on a way forward which can command broad support in the wake of this result.

Ireland and our EU partners are looking at how we might actively and constructively engage in the session notwithstanding some serious concerns about the way in which the work of the Group has been conducted to date.  In the first instance, we agree with the view expressed by countries across all regions on the need to revert to the Human Rights Council for a new resolution following the completion of three sessions of the Inter-Governmental Working Group.  Furthermore, the Programme of Work for any future sessions, including possible speakers, should be negotiated in coordination with regional and other groups.  The nomination of the Chairperson and the conduct of proceedings should be in accordance with the principles set out in the Rules of Procedure of the General Assembly, including impartiality and respect for the rights of minorities as well as majorities.  We also think it is essential that the participation of all stakeholders including civil society, trade unions and business should be facilitated.<\/p>  <p>  We have noted with interest the zero draft of a legally binding instrument to regulate, in international human rights law, the activities of transnational corporations and other business enterprises circulated in July by the Ecuadorean Permanent Representative in Geneva.

We would like to see any new initiative build on, rather than duplicate, existing measures such as the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and the ILO Tripartite Declaration of Principles Concerning Multinational Enterprises and Social Policy.  Above all we believe that it should be rooted in the UN Guiding Principles.  In this regard, we are of the view that the appropriate place for the discussion of any new initiatives is the annual UN Forum on Business and Human Rights, which was established in 2011 by the Human Rights Council to serve as a global platform to discuss trends and challenges in the implementation of the Guiding Principles.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018100900071#WRC02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Syrian Conflict","counter":121,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018100900071#WRC02300"},{"type":"question","counter":122,"qnumday":44,"qnumall":"[41150\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018100900071#WRC02400","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if his attention has been drawn to a report on the Syrian conflict (details supplied); his views on the recommendations of the report; if, in view of the report's contents, he will reiterate his concerns about Russian involvement in the conflict with the diplomatic mission here; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1222","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":123,"content":"<p>I am all too aware of the awful human suffering caused by the Syria conflict.  There has clearly been a pattern of deliberate and indiscriminate attacks on civilians and civilian infrastructure by the Syrian regime and its allies, as we saw in Eastern Ghouta earlier this year.  These acts are reprehensible and in direct contravention of international humanitarian law and I have made my views clear in this House and in various international fora.  Atrocities have also been committed by groups such as ISIS in the course of this conflict, and my condemnation of those acts is also on record.<\/p>  <p>  Russia is in no doubt of Ireland&rsquo;s position: our concerns have been raised with the Russian authorities directly on numerous occasions at Ministerial and official level.  Last October, I met with Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Vladimir Titov and reiterated that Ireland condemns in the strongest terms the ongoing attacks on civilians and civilian infrastructure, and the use of chemical weapons.  I also called on Russia to ensure civilians are protected, and to exert its influence on other parties to the conflict to do the same.  I, and my officials, will continue to raise our concerns with the Russian authorities, at every appropriate opportunity.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the recommendations in the report to which the Deputy refers, key themes are accountability and effective multilateral action.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland has consistently called for the referral of the situation in Syria to the International Criminal Court.  We take every appropriate opportunity to speak out against human rights abuses in Syria in UN and other international fora.  At the last meeting of the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva in September 2018, Ireland co-sponsored a resolution on the human rights situation in Syria which condemned the continued and deliberate targeting of civilians and civilian infrastructure, including the use of chemical weapons against civilians, the denial and diversion of humanitarian aid and medical assistance, and the use of starve or surrender tactics that we have repeatedly seen in Syria.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland and the EU also provide political and financial support to a broad range of measures which aim to ensure full legal accountability for all war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in Syria.  For example, we are supportive of the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Syria established by the UN Human Rights Council.  In 2017, Ireland provided &euro;100,000 in financial support to the International, Impartial and Independent Mechanism (IIIM) established by the UN General Assembly.  The IIIM aims to assist in the investigation and prosecution of persons responsible for the most serious crimes under international law committed in Syria.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to our core contributions to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), Ireland has contributed &euro;200,000 specifically to the OPCW-UN Joint Investigative Mission to eliminate chemical weapons in Syria.  In June 2018, Ireland co-sponsored the decision adopted by the State Parties to the Chemical Weapons Convention introducing an attribution mechanism to identify the perpetrators of chemical weapons attacks in Syria and elsewhere.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, Ireland has consistently supported EU sanctions targeting the Assad regime and its supporters, and will continue to do so as long as the situation on the ground justifies these measures.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland and the EU firmly believe that there can be no military solution to the Syria crisis and support the UN-led efforts to bring about a comprehensive, sustainable and inclusive resolution of the crisis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018100900071#WRC02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ministerial Communications","counter":124,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018100900071#WRC02600"},{"type":"question","counter":125,"qnumday":45,"qnumall":"[41524\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018100900071#WRC02700","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if there is a policy regarding ministerial use of private email for Government business in his Department; and if so, if it will be published.","asker":"1349","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":126,"content":"<p>The ICT Unit of the Department provides a secure email service and the Department&rsquo;s ICT Security Policy governs the use of the email system for all staff, contractors, agents and third parties.

I am pleased to report that the recommendations have either been implemented or otherwise addressed.<\/p><p>Since the financial crisis, there has been a significant number of measures taken to address the failures highlighted in the post-crisis analysis.  This includes measures to address the recommendations of the Banking Inquiry.  These have been at an institutional, national, and EU level.  Both the Department of Finance and the Central Bank of Ireland have undergone significant organisational change in terms of structure, culture and resources.<\/p><p>There has also been a large amount of new legislation introduced at a national and EU level to address the weaknesses that came to light during and after the crisis.<\/p><p>The former Central Bank of Ireland and the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority have been re-amalgamated into one body, the Central Bank of Ireland (the Central Bank).  The approach to banking supervision has radically changed to one that is more assertive, risk-based, and challenging, and one which is underpinned by new legislation, predominantly the Central Bank Reform Act 2010 and the Central Bank Supervision and Enforcement Act 2013.<\/p><p>The Department of Finance has implemented the recommendations of the &lsquo;Wright Report&rsquo;; it has restructured its divisions; and it has implemented an open recruitment policy to ensure an optimum skills mix.  The Department&rsquo;s objectives are to ensure a sustainable macroeconomic environment and sound public finances, with a balanced and equitable economy, enabled by a restructured, vibrant, secure, and well-regulated financial sector.<\/p><p>The establishment of the State&rsquo;s Financial Stability Group has facilitated and strengthened communication and coordination between the State institutions i.e. the Central Bank, the Department of Finance and the National Treasury Management Agency.<\/p><p>National regulatory measures have been complemented by EU-wide reforms and new legislation.  In the EU, the Banking Union has been put in place, thus implementing the commitment of the European Council in June 2012 to break the bank\/sovereign link.<\/p><p>The EU Banking Union provides for a single prudential supervisor through the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM), a single rulebook, and a Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM).  This aims to improve coordination and militate against negative spill-over in the future.  The European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) is responsible for the macro-prudential oversight of the EU financial system and the prevention and mitigation of systemic risk.  The ESRB monitors and assesses systemic risks and, where appropriate, issues warnings and recommendations.<\/p><p>There have also been economic and fiscal reforms at an EU level.  The Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) was strengthened following the adoption of the &lsquo;six pack&rsquo; legislative package in 2012.  The reformed SGP is now complemented by a new surveillance mechanism which ensures that macroeconomic imbalances, as well as debt and deficit targets, are monitored.  This mechanism, the Macroeconomic Imbalance Procedure (MIP) should ensure that emerging imbalances, such as housing bubbles, are detected at an earlier stage and acted upon.<\/p><p>I now refer specifically to the recommendations of the Banking Inquiry that are relevant to my Department.  The majority have been implemented or else the recommendations have been otherwise addressed.  Some recommendations refer to ongoing or periodic reviews, and these are continuing.<\/p><p><i>Review of section 33AK of the Central Bank Act 1942:<\/i><\/p><p>- A review of section 33 AK is occurring as part of the forthcoming Central Bank (Amendment) Bill.  The Central Bank is assisting in this review.<\/p><p>- It is important to consider that the ability to disclose to a judge will depend on the legal mandate of the particular inquiry, the nature of the particular documentation under consideration and the EU law provision (where relevant) applicable.  Any proposed amendment to section 33 AK will also require prior consultation with the ECB.<\/p><p><i>The membership of the Board of the Central Bank, appointed by Government, must include sufficient expertise and relevant direct experience in financial stability and prudential regulation:<\/i><\/p><p>- The current members of the Central Bank Commission were all appointed after the financial crisis, and possess the relevant knowledge and experience as is statutorily required.<\/p><p>- Any future members will be appointed from an open competition under the remit of the Public Appointments Service, following the guidelines for appointments to State Boards.<\/p><p><i>Establish a formal process with clear procedures for situations where there are conflicts between the advice provided by the Department of Finance on matters where exceptional risks are involved and the decision proposed by the Minister:<\/i><\/p><p>- While this recommendation is specific to the Department of Finance, the Corporate Governance Standards for the Civil Service, published by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in 2015, requires that all Departments and Offices have in place a published Governance Framework that, inter alia, should &ldquo;set out the formal processes and mechanisms for documenting decisions made within the Department to include Ministerial consideration and filing of same&rdquo;, (p.13).<\/p><p>- In the Department of Finance, all submissions and advice to the Minister are recorded on an E-submissions system.  This allows the Department to fully document its advice on matters where exceptional risks are involved, while respecting the constitutional and existing legislative frameworks, and the ultimate decision proposed by the Minister.<\/p><p><i>The banking division in the Department of Finance should be periodically subjected to a performance review by an independent third party to ensure fiscal, capital market, and banking expertise is adequate to challenge information and assumptions provided to it by the Central Bank of Ireland:<\/i><\/p><p>- The Department, as a whole, is subject to the capability review programme as part of the Civil Service Renewal Plan.  The capability review process assesses relevant Department attributes such as the structural capability of the Department, including its strategic HR, learning and development, and culture and values.  The review is undertaken by a Review Team based in the Reform and Delivery Office of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.<\/p><p>In addition, the Department and the Banking Division are subjected to regular review through:<\/p><p>- Annual Oireachtas oversight and scrutiny of the Department&rsquo;s resources and outputs;<\/p><p>- IMF periodic reviews of the Department&rsquo;s role in financial policy and regulatory matters, such as the IMF Financial Sector Assessment Programme conducted in 2016; and<\/p><p>- Periodic performance reviews of the Department, such as the Wright report.<\/p><p>Specifically, the Department has taken actions to improve the fiscal, capital market and banking expertise in the Department and the Banking Division through:<\/p><p>- Professional Diplomas in Financial Services and Government Economics have been developed by the Department in conjunction with the Institute of Banking and the Institute of Public Administration (IPA) respectively.<\/p><p>- These measures help ensure Departmental staff possess the necessary skills and knowledge to perform their duties effectively.<\/p><p>- Increased recruitment of economists, and financial and capital market experts into the Department to assist in the analysis and challenge of financial and economic data.<\/p><p>- The Shareholding and Financial Advisory Division (SFAD) is comprised of circa 18 civil servants and secondees from the National Treasury Management Agency with extensive private sector expertise and professional qualifications in: capital markets (debt and equity), corporate finance\/investment banking, accounting and auditing, and law.<\/p><p>- The Department has regular interaction with investment bankers, analysts, lawyers, accountants, tax advisers, investment funds, private equity funds, stockbrokers etc. so as to ensure that the Department has access to up to date market information and intelligence across a wide range of subjects.<\/p><p><i>Acceptable bands should be agreed with regard to the proportion of total State taxation revenue accounted for by defined cyclical, transaction-based taxes, including triggers for follow-up action when these limits are breached:<\/i><\/p><p>- The objective of ensuring that cyclical or windfall revenue is not used to fund permanent increases in public expenditure has already been addressed through reforms introduced in the Stability and Growth Pact and the Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance.  In particular, the issue is addressed by the expenditure benchmark, which limits the growth in general government expenditure to the trend growth rate of the economy unless discretionary revenue measures are introduced to fund higher increases.<\/p><p>- Also, in line with Government policy, and subsequent to the SGP reforms mentioned above, the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council was established and given the function of monitoring compliance with the fiscal rules, assessing the official forecasts and whether the fiscal stance is conducive to prudent economic and budgetary management, including by reference to the Stability and Growth Pact.<\/p><p>- The introduction of the Rainy Day Fund will allow for cyclical revenues to be paid into the Fund to ensure such revenues are not used towards current expenditure.<\/p><p><i>Legislation governing the powers of the Minister for Finance relating to directions to the NTMA should be reviewed:<\/i><\/p><p>- The issue of Ministerial directions to the National Treasury Management Agency, as provided for under Section 4 (4) of the NTMA Act 1990 and elsewhere in the NTMA&rsquo;s legislation, was reviewed since the period dealt with by the Inquiry&rsquo;s report.  The preparations of the NTMA (Amendment) Act 2014 involved a thorough review of Ministerial powers including directions to the NTMA.  The issue was also discussed at length as part of the Committee Stage and following reflection the Department, the Minister and the Oireachtas were satisfied that the existing provisions were measured and appropriate.<\/p><p>- It is important to note that the NTMA&rsquo;s treasury functions, such as borrowing on behalf of the State and managing the national debt, are delegated to the Agency by the Minister for Finance under the NTMA Act 1990, as amended, so these remain primarily responsibilities of the Minister for which he\/she is accountable.<\/p><p><i>The operation and effectiveness of NAMA should continue to be reviewed, in particular when medium term property price movements can be taken into account.  When NAMA completes its work, it should be the subject of a further comprehensive and final review:<\/i><\/p><p>- In line with the recommendation, NAMA is kept under review.  The C&amp;amp;AG carries out ongoing and ex-post reports on NAMA&rsquo;s performance.  Both the Department and the C&amp;amp;AG continue to review NAMA during its lifetime and would envisage carrying out such a report once NAMA has completed its work.<\/p><p>- Carrying on from the 2014 Section 227 report, the Department of Finance continues to develop its views regarding NAMA&rsquo;s strategy and continues to monitor NAMA&rsquo;s performance relative to the market and expectations.  One key element of this ongoing analysis is the comparison of NAMA&rsquo;s outturn to changes in the value in asset classes and geographies in which NAMA holds assets.  These ongoing analyses will continue to assist in the Department&rsquo;s evaluation of NAMA&rsquo;s strategy regarding its remaining portfolio, including the future strategic direction around the Dublin Docklands SDZ development and the strategy around the Residential Funding Programme.<\/p><p>- In addition to ongoing work, the Department fully intends to perform a comprehensive review of NAMA once its work is complete.  Section 227 of the NAMA Act requires that, as soon as may be after 31 December 2012, and every 5 years after that while NAMA continues to be in existence, the Minister assess whether NAMA has made progress towards achieving its overall objectives, and decides whether continuation of NAMA is necessary, having regard to the purposes of this Act.  In addition, the Minister may also, at any time, have NAMA report to him or her regarding progress on the achievement of NAMA&rsquo;s purposes.<\/p><p>- Similar to Section 227, Section 226 of the NAMA Act required as soon as may be after 31 December 2012, and every 3 years thereafter while NAMA continues to be in existence, that the C&amp;amp;AG shall assess the extent to which NAMA has made progress toward achieving its overall objectives.<\/p><p>- The next Section 227 Report is due in 2019.  Under Section 227, the Minister also has the power to effect an off-schedule Section 227 report at a time that coincides with the achievement of NAMA&rsquo;s purposes under the Act.

IAASA will now be directly responsible for the inspection of the audits of Public Interest Entities (PIEs), such as credit institutions, insurance companies and entities listed on regulated stock exchanges.  The new measures address this recommendation and also include notable changes to the regulatory regime for auditors, particularly for the audits of PIEs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018100900071#WRC04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Literacy Programmes","counter":139,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018100900071#WRC04100"},{"type":"question","counter":140,"qnumday":50,"qnumall":"[40682\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018100900071#WRC04200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the involvement of his Department in tackling adult literacy; if a financial allocation is provided for same; if so, the way in which it is utilised; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1224","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":141,"content":"<p>My Department has no specific financial allocation provided for tackling adult literacy.<\/p>  <p>  As part of Public Service Reform, our colleagues in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform promoted the use of plain English and provided plain English language training courses in 2016, for staff in other Departments.

This requires taxpayers to submit annual tax returns of their income and gains to Revenue.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the findings in the Annual Report by the Comptroller and Auditor General (C&amp;AG) include references to the taxable income of high wealth individuals (HWIs) and the rate of income tax paid by these taxpayers.  Both taxable income and income tax payable are determined in accordance with tax legislation which include the availability of reliefs and tax credits.  Such credits and reliefs where applicable have, as stated by the C&amp;AG in his report, the effect of reducing the tax liability of an individual for any given year of assessment.  As also stated by the C&amp;AG in his report, while high earners are well placed to utilise the wide variety of credits and reliefs available, they may also be liable to pay additional tax by virtue of their high income in the form of the domicile levy and the high income earners restriction.<\/p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that it has had a particular focus on HWIs over a long period.  HWIs have been managed by dedicated units with its Large Cases Division since it was established in 2003.  Dedicated case managers are responsible for profiling, risk assessment and compliance activities for HWIs within their case base and Revenue&rsquo;s Anti-Avoidance Unit operates within the HWI Units.  Revenue has recently split its Large Cases Division into two divisions, one of which will now focus on HWIs, avoidance and pensions.  This structural realignment is being supported by an expansion in the number of specialist and experienced staff assigned to the oversight of the new Division&rsquo;s case base.<\/p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the structural realignment being advanced by Revenue combined with the mandatory disclosure regime which applies to marketers, promoters and users of &lsquo;disclosable&rsquo; transactions and the use by Revenue of the powers available to tackle tax avoidance and tackle schemes that involve contrived, artificial transactions that are designed purely to produce a tax advantage for the taxpayer will continue to deliver an outcome where HWIs pay the appropriate tax in accordance with the legislation.  I am also assured by Revenue that in line with its comprehensive risk assessment programmes, there is appropriate examination and evaluation of the tax returns submitted by HWIs and where necessary compliance interventions are undertaken to verify the accuracy of the returns.  Where under-declarations of income or gains are identified or where tax avoidance activity is identified, Revenue will be relentless in its action in such cases and take whatever action is necessary to recover all taxes legally due together with associated interest, penalties and surcharges where relevant.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, the High Earners Restriction, which aims to limit the use of certain tax reliefs and exemptions by those on high incomes, is meeting its objective.<\/p>  <p>  As detailed in the recently published Revenue report on the operation of the High Income Earners Restriction, in 2016 some 149 high-income individuals with an adjusted income of &euro;400,000 or more (i.e. where the restriction fully applied) paid an average effective tax rate of 30.1% on the combination of adjusted income and ring-fenced income.  The additional tax collected from these 149 taxpayers was &euro;25.8 million, representing an increase of 175% on the tax that would otherwise have been paid if the restriction had not applied.  An important outcome of the restriction is that 54 individuals with adjusted incomes of &euro;400,000 or more, who would not otherwise have paid tax in 2016, were brought into the tax net for that year.<\/p>  <p>  The 2016 report also shows that 372 high-income individuals with an adjusted income of up to &euro;400,000 (i.e. where the restriction applied on a graduated basis) paid an average effective tax rate of 19.09% on the combination of adjusted income and ring-fenced income.  When the USC is included, the average tax rate is 28.61%.  The additional tax collected from these 451 taxpayers was &euro;12.7 million, representing an increase of 242% on the tax that would otherwise have been paid if the restriction had not applied.  Some 164 individuals with adjusted incomes of up to &euro;400,000, who would not otherwise have paid tax in 2016, were brought into the tax net for that year, as a result of the restriction.<\/p>  <p>  The performance of this measure is noted by the C&amp;AG in the recent report.  The report notes the relatively high effective tax rate on income earned by high wealth individuals (which in 2015 was 39.2% compared with an average tax rate of 16.3% for all taxpayers).<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018100900071#WRC05000","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Data","counter":149,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018100900071#WRC05200"},{"type":"question","counter":150,"qnumday":54,"qnumall":"[40745\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018100900071#WRC05300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the estimated cost of all tax expenditure inclusive of the domicile levy and all other tax reliefs and credits; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":151,"content":"<p>I am advised by Revenue that the available information in respect of the cost of tax expenditures (credits, allowances and reliefs) is published on Revenue&rsquo;s statistics webpage at https:\/\/www.revenue.ie\/en\/corporate\/information-about-revenue\/statistics\/tax-expenditures\/costs-expenditures.aspx.<\/p><p>My Department also publishes its own Report on Tax Expenditures each year, and I expect that the 2018 version will be published with the Budget 2019 documents today at www.gov.ie\/budget.<\/p><p>I am also advised by Revenue that as the domicile levy is an annual charge of &euro;200,000 levied and paid by relevant individuals, it is not a tax expenditure.

This group is an important forum for key stakeholders in the Credit Union Sector and has submitted papers on long-term lending and consultation and engagement to the Central Bank and is currently finalising a paper on Tiered Regulation. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, following consultation with the Credit Union sector, revised regulations for credit unions commenced on 1st March 2018 which make changes to the investment and liquidity requirements and allow for greater diversification of investment income, including provision for up to c. &euro;700 million investment in Tier 3 Approved Housing Bodies via a regulated vehicle.<\/p>  <p>  While there are challenges to returns arising from the low yield environment and low loan to asset ratios, the sector continues to show signs of improvement reflected in growth in new lending, delivering c 35% of all unsecured consumer lending in 2017, a decrease in the level of reported arrears and an increase in reserves.

In addition, Revenue and HM Revenue and Customs in the United Kingdom undertook a joint initiative to find a new fiscal marker (Accutrace S10&trade;) for use in marked fuels, which was introduced in Ireland and the United Kingdom from the beginning of April 2015. Accutrace S10&trade; is a colourless marker whose chemical properties are similar to those of diesel, rendering it resistant to conventional dye-washing laundering methods. All the indications are that the introduction of this new marker, together with the wide range of other measures taken to prevent and combat fraud, has had a major impact on the illicit fuel trade. Revenue has undertaken research to assess the impact of this strategy and published an analysis (available at ) in January 2015 of oil market trends and, on the basis of a comparison of extrapolated pre-2013 trends with actual results for 2103 and 2014, estimated that the strategy pursued may have saved the Exchequer between &euro;150 million and &euro;200 million in 2014. Updated analysis published by Revenue (available at ) in April 2017 showed that the impact of Revenue&rsquo;s initiatives may be contributing to a further uplift in receipts from diesel of up to &euro;35 million per annum (based on 2016 levels of trade).<\/p><p>Revenue is aware of attempts to remove the marker by using a distillation process. This involves heating the marked fuel to extremely high temperatures. This is a highly dangerous procedure, with significant physical health and safety implications for anyone involved. Revenue is arranging formal scientific analysis of fuel samples and equipment taken in the course of a recent operation to determine the nature and impact of any process to remove the fiscal marker.

This regulatory regime is operated by the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment and is enforced by local authorities.  This regime, which imposes higher environmental standards on coal in the State than applies in Northern Ireland, enables local authorities to undertake enforcement action to prevent the sale or distribution of coal that does not meet our standards. <\/p>  <p>  European Union Single Market constraints preclude the use of any cross-border movement controls in the administration of Solid Fuel Carbon Tax.  Therefore, Revenue has no authority to stop vehicles and physically inspect loads of such fuel. Similarly, the transport or possession of solid fuels that originated in Northern Ireland are not, in themselves, Revenue offences and Revenue&rsquo;s officers have no authority to challenge such transportation or possession.  It is important to note that liability to Solid Fuel Carbon Tax does not arise on the physical presence of the goods in the State, but on first supply in the State by the supplier who is obliged to register with Revenue, make a return and pay the tax.  This return must be made one month after the two-month accounting period provided for in law.<\/p>  <p>  I am advised that Revenue is in contact with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment to discuss the effectiveness of the regulatory regime for solid fuel and to explore how to improve matters in light of continuing concerns that fuel sourced from Northern Ireland is getting onto the market here, including the scope for cooperation to ensure improved compliance in the sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018100900072#WRD01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Insurance Costs","counter":171,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018100900072#WRD02000"},{"type":"question","counter":172,"qnumday":61,"qnumall":"[41026\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018100900072#WRD02100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if further and detailed consideration will be given to the ongoing concerns of an association (details supplied) regarding exorbitant insurance costs and the overall level of awards; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1270","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":173,"content":"<p>I note the attached press release of the Alliance for Insurance Reform to which the Deputy refers.  I also welcome the recent statement of the Chief Justice on the Opening of the New Legal Year and his reference to consistency and proper calibration of injury awards which was made in the context of recently published Personal Injuries Commission (PIC) Report.  This Report has made a number of important recommendations which I believe will improve the personal injury resolution framework in Ireland.  This area of work is of particular importance to tackling the broader cost of insurance issue. The implementation of these PIC recommendations &ndash; along with those from the first PIC Report - will I believe  contribute to a better functioning personal injury litigation system, and it is hoped that they will ultimately contribute to making insurance more affordable for the whole of society. <\/p>  <p>  The Alliance for Insurance Reform has played an active role in highlighting the issue of the cost of insurance, particularly for businesses and voluntary organisations.  My colleague Minister D&rsquo;Arcy has formally met with the Alliance on a number of occasions, most recently on September 18th, and issues related to the Alliance&rsquo;s &ldquo;10 asks&rdquo; were discussed in some level of detail.  At this meeting it was pointed out that many of these &ldquo;10 asks&rdquo; were considered by the Cost of Insurance Working Group in the course of producing its two reports, namely the Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance and the Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance.  Indeed, a number of these measures are in the process of being implemented, such as amending section 8 of the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004 and putting in place guidelines for the reporting of suspected personal injury fraud by insurers to the Garda&iacute;. In respect of other issues put forward by the Alliance, such as changing the approach to calculating the Book of Quantum, the recommendations of the PIC that this country follows the example of judicial intervention which has occurred in Northern Ireland and in the UK, namely the introduction of Judicial Guidelines for judges, is an important recognition of the role of the Judiciary in this area.  On the issue of a legislative capping of awards, as Minister D&rsquo;Arcy has clearly indicated previously,  there are constitutional issues which need to be first considered, thus explaining why the Working Group has referred that matter to the Law Reform Commission for examination.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, I think it is important that the focus of the Cost of Insurance Working Group continues to be on implementing the recommendations of its two Reports.  As I have stated previously, I believe that the cumulative effects of the implementation of all the recommendations should include increased stability in the pricing of insurance for consumers and businesses and improved availability of insurance generally.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018100900072#WRD02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Budget 2019","counter":174,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018100900072#WRD02300"},{"type":"question","counter":175,"qnumday":62,"qnumall":"[41181\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018100900072#WRD02400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if consideration will be given to the issues raised in a pre-budget submission by an association (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1270","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":176,"content":"<p>The Deputy will be aware that it is a longstanding practice of the Minister for Finance not to comment, in advance of the Budget, on any tax matters that might be the subject of Budget decisions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018100900072#WRD02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Pension Levy Yield","counter":177,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018100900072#WRD02600"},{"type":"question","counter":178,"qnumday":63,"qnumall":"[41254\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018100900072#WRD02700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the yield from the private pension levy in each of the years in which it was applied; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1255","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":179,"content":"<p>I am informed by Revenue that the yield for all relevant years from the Stamp Duty levy on pension schemes is as set in the following table. <table><tr><th>Year<\/th><th>Yield <br \/><br \/>&euro;m<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>2011<\/td><td>463<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2012<\/td><td>483<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2013<\/td><td>535<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2014<\/td><td>743<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2015<\/td><td>169<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Total<\/td><td>2,393<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>The levy has ceased since 2015.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018100900072#WRD02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ministerial Communications","counter":180,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018100900072#WRD02900"},{"type":"question","counter":181,"qnumday":64,"qnumall":"[41523\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018100900072#WRD03000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if there is a policy regarding ministerial use of private email for Government business in his Department; and if so, if it will be published.","asker":"1349","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":182,"content":"<p>The Department of Finance does not have a specific policy in relation to the use of private email for Government business.  <\/p>  <p>  ICT services to the Department of Finance are provided by the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer (OGCIO) under the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.

My Department, along with SOLAS, the Education and Training Boards (ETBs) and partner agencies, are collaborating on the ongoing development and enhancement of the structures required to progress its implementation. The strategy sets out 12 inter- related elements which aim to promote, develop and encourage literacy and numeracy skills in the adult population. Progress to date includes the development and launch of the national awareness campaign, <i>Take the First Step<\/i>, development of national guidelines for the initial and on-going screening and assessment of participants and the publication of a number of research projects including the examination of integrating literacy and numeracy in FET programmes and an examination of barriers to participation in FET programmes. This year SOLAS has commissioned NALA to progress the evidence base to inform best practice in relation to family learning.  It is envisaged that <i>Family Learning Best Practice Guidelines<\/i>will be available in early 2019.<\/p><p>The SOLAS allocation to Education and Training Boards (ETBs) for 2018 for adult literacy and basic skills provision is over &euro;35m. Funding for further education and training (FET) is allocated to SOLAS, who then allocate to the ETBs through a strategic planning process. There is some discretion for SOLAS and the ETBs in relation to how funding is allocated across all of the FET programmes, including adult literacy. <\/p><p>The ETB Adult Literacy Service provides programmes with accreditation at levels NQF levels  1-4.  Provision for adult literacy is delivered through a number of programmes;<\/p><p>- Adult Literacy groups (small groups)<\/p><p>- Intensive Tuition in Adult Basic Education (ITABE)<\/p><p>- English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL)<\/p><p>- Skills for Work - workplace literacy courses<\/p><p>- Voluntary Literacy provision (one-to-one tuition)<\/p><p>- Family Learning Programmes<\/p><p>- Distance learning service<\/p><p>Details of the allocation of funding across programmes and the numbers of beneficiaries of those programmes is set out in the following table.<\/p><p>The adult literacy programme is informed by a set of operational guidelines that include guidance on initial assessment and engagement and the importance of more intensive provision to support literacy acquisition.  Less intensive provision can be useful in welcoming and engaging new learners back into education but the guidelines recognise that more intensive approaches are required to enable progression.<\/p><p>I also recently launched a new policy framework for employee development, 'Supporting Working Lives and Enterprise Growth in Ireland', which was developed by SOLAS in consultation with key partners.  This new approach will enable targeted support for vulnerable groups in the Irish workforce as it has a particular focus on employees those who have lower skills levels and who need more opportunities to advance in their working lives and careers, to sustain their employment and to avoid displacement or to avail of emerging job opportunities. The policy sets a target of having over 40,000 workers, whose skills level is below Level 5 on the National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ), engaged in state supported skills development by 2021. It should be noted that while the NFQ is not a literacy scale but a qualifications framework, I am committed to addressing literacy issues amongst those whose highest level of qualification is below Level 5, including through achieving certification for their learning. This will supplement the numbers already being supported through our adult literacy programmes. Participation by employees in relevant courses will be provided free of charge. <\/p><p>The substantial investment already being made in adult literacy, supplemented by this new initiative to support those in employment, will also ensure that Ireland is well positioned to achieve the 2030 literacy targets in the in the Agenda for Sustainable Development.<\/p><p>This new initiative is also a significant part of our national efforts to implement the European Commission's Upskilling Pathways Recommendation: New Opportunities for Adults, as almost half of those with less than an upper secondary qualification are in employment. My Department has been working with partners on the implementation of the recommendation &ndash; which aims to help adults with less than upper second level education acquire a minimum level of literacy, numeracy and digital skills. My Department has established a multi&ndash;agency steering group to identify the priority cohorts and appropriate measures to implement the recommendation.  This informed my Department's recent response to a request from the Commission for information regarding arrangements in Ireland on upskilling pathways interventions. The response presented the overall context for Upskilling Pathways in Ireland, including key background information that the Commission would find useful, as well as information on existing and planned provision. The Commission are conducting an audit of interventions across Member States and hope to report back on their findings by the end of the year.<\/p><p><b><i>Adult Literacy Programmes in ETBs<\/i><\/b><table><tr><th>Programme<\/th><th>Funding Allocation for 2018<\/th><th>Projected Beneficiaries\u00a0 2018<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Adult Literacy (incl.

A clear challenge also remains in relation to the share of persons with NFQ Level 3 as the highest level of education attained.<\/p><p>In the National Skills Strategy 2025, targets are set to reduce the percentage of adults scoring at level 1 in the PIAAC survey from a baseline of 17.5% to 12% by 2025, and to increase the percentage of adults scoring at levels 2, 3 and 4 in the PIAAC survey from a baseline of 44% to 50% by 2025.<\/p><p>The delivery and enhancement of adult literacy and numeracy provision is being driven through the implementation of the Further Education and Training (FET) Literacy and Numeracy Strategy which is contained in the FET Strategy 2014-19.  My Department, along with SOLAS, the Education and Training Boards (ETBs) and partner agencies are collaborating on the ongoing development and enhancement of the structures required to progress its implementation. The strategy sets out 12 inter- related elements which aim to promote, develop and encourage literacy and numeracy skills in the adult population. Progress to date includes the development and launch of the national awareness campaign, <i>Take the First Step<\/i>, development of national guidelines for the initial and on-going screening and assessment of participants and the publication of a number of research projects including the examination of integrating literacy and numeracy in FET programmes and an examination of barriers to participation in FET programmes. This year SOLAS has commissioned NALA to progress the evidence base to inform best practice in relation to family learning.  It is envisaged that <i>Family Learning Best Practice Guidelines<\/i>will be available in early 2019.<\/p><p>The SOLAS allocation to Education and Training Boards (ETBs) for 2018 for adult literacy and basic skills provision is over &euro;35m. Funding for further education and training (FET) is allocated to SOLAS, who then allocate to the ETBs through a strategic planning process. There is some discretion for SOLAS and the ETBs in relation to how funding is allocated across all of the FET programmes, including adult literacy. <\/p><p>The ETB Adult Literacy Service provides programmes with accreditation at levels NQF levels  1-4.  Provision for adult literacy is delivered through a number of programmes;<\/p><p>- Adult Literacy groups (small groups)<\/p><p>- Intensive Tuition in Adult Basic Education (ITABE)<\/p><p>- English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL)<\/p><p>- Skills for Work - workplace literacy courses<\/p><p>- Voluntary Literacy provision (one-to-one tuition)<\/p><p>- Family Learning Programmes<\/p><p>- Distance learning service<\/p><p>Details of the allocation of funding across programmes and the numbers of beneficiaries of those programmes is set out in the following table.<\/p><p>The adult literacy programme is informed by a set of operational guidelines that include guidance on initial assessment and engagement and the importance of more intensive provision to support literacy acquisition.  Less intensive provision can be useful in welcoming and engaging new learners back into education but the guidelines recognise that more intensive approaches are required to enable progression.<\/p><p>I also recently launched a new policy framework for employee development, 'Supporting Working Lives and Enterprise Growth in Ireland', which was developed by SOLAS in consultation with key partners.  This new approach will enable targeted support for vulnerable groups in the Irish workforce as it has a particular focus on employees those who have lower skills levels and who need more opportunities to advance in their working lives and careers, to sustain their employment and to avoid displacement or to avail of emerging job opportunities. The policy sets a target of having over 40,000 workers, whose skills level is below Level 5 on the NFQ, engaged in state supported skills development by 2021. It should be noted that while the NFQ is not a literacy scale but a qualifications framework, I am committed to addressing literacy issues amongst those whose highest level of qualification is below Level 5, including through achieving certification for their learning. This will supplement the numbers already being supported through our adult literacy programmes. Participation by employees in relevant courses will be provided free of charge. <\/p><p>The substantial investment already being made in adult literacy, supplemented by this new initiative to support those in employment, will also ensure that Ireland is well positioned to achieve the 2025 literacy targets set out in the National Skills Strategy 2025.<\/p><p>This new initiative is also a significant part of our national efforts to implement the European Commission's Upskilling Pathways Recommendation: New Opportunities for Adults, as almost half of those with less than an upper secondary qualification are in employment. My Department has been working with partners on the implementation of the recommendation &ndash; which aims to help adults with less than upper second level education acquire a minimum level of literacy, numeracy and digital skills. My Department has established a multi&ndash;agency steering group to identify the priority cohorts and appropriate measures to implement the recommendation.  This informed my Department's recent response to a request from the Commission for information regarding arrangements in Ireland on upskilling pathways interventions. The response presented the overall context for Upskilling Pathways in Ireland, including key background information that the Commission would find useful, as well as information on existing and planned provision. The Commission are conducting an audit of interventions across Member States and hope to report back on their findings by the end of the year.<\/p><p><b><i>Adult Literacy Programmes in ETBs<\/i><\/b><table><tr><th>Programme<\/th><th>Funding Allocation for 2018<\/th><th>Projected Beneficiaries\u00a0 2018<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Adult Literacy (incl.

The funding includes: <\/p>  <p>- The National Council for Special Education (NCSE), which is a separate statutory agency, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), is responsible for processing applications from schools for special educational needs      supports.  The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support. NCSE&rsquo;s Support Service has brought under its control the Special Education Support Service (SESS), the National Behaviour Support Service (NBSS) and the Visiting Teacher Service for children who are deaf\/hard of hearing and for children who are blind\/visually impaired (VTSVHI). The Support Service provides advice and support to schools on the education and inclusion of students with special educational needs, providing in-school support for support teachers, continuing professional development for teachers, and support to schools on the management of challenging behavior. It will also enhance the multi-disciplinary capacity of the education system through providing access to expert knowledge in areas such as autism, speech and language therapy and challenging behaviour.  <\/p>  <p>- National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS)   delivers a consultative, tiered service delivery model to schools, in line with international best practice for the effective and efficient delivery of educational psychological services that best meet the needs of all pupils\/students in schools. This service delivery model allows NEPS psychologists to support schools to provide an effective continuum of support to meet the needs of pupils\/students. <\/p>  <p>- Over 13,400 Special Education Teaching posts   under the Special Education Teaching allocation model, introduced in mainstream primary and post primary schools for the 2017\/2018 school year, providing additional teaching support to pupils with special educational needs. The number of students receiving additional special education teaching support in mainstream education increased from 138,493 in 2011 to approximately 166,000 in 2017. <\/p>  <p>- 15,000 Special Needs Assistants (SNAs)   available from September 2018, providing additional adult support staff to schools to cater for the additional care needs of pupils with disabilities in an educational context. An additional 800 SNA posts has been made available for September 2018 with up to a further 140 SNA posts available from September to December 2018. Approximately 36,000 students have access to SNA support in schools in 201718 school year, compared to 22,200 in 2011\/12. <\/p>  <p>- Over 7,900 students in 124 special schools   with  1,490 teachers, increased from 6,848 students with 1,141 teachers in 2011.  <\/p>  <p>- Approximately 1,456 special classes   in place with 155 new Special Classes opened in September 2018 in mainstream primary and post primary schools. This compares to 548 special classes in 2011. <\/p>  <p>- Assistive technology\/specialized equipment.   Under the Assistive Technology scheme, as set out in Circular 0010\/2013, the Department of Education and Skills provides funding to schools towards the cost of computers and specialist equipment, which are required for educational purposes, for use by students with special educational needs. Equipment is provided under this scheme for children with more complex disabilities who, in order to access the school curriculum, require essential specialist equipment which they do not already have, or  which cannot be provided for them through the school&rsquo;s existing provisions.  <\/p>  <p>- Special School transport arrangements  . The purpose of the scheme is, having regard to available resources, to support the transport to and from school of children with special educational needs arising from a diagnosed disability <\/p>  <p>- Enhanced capitation grants for special schools and special classes attached to mainstream primary and post primary schools  , based on disability categories, are paid to special and mainstream schools with special classes to assist them with the extra costs associated with setting up small classes. Class running costs are usually established by dividing the costs overs the number of students and the number of students in a special class is much lower than in a mainstream class. <\/p>  <p>- Modification of school buildings  . <\/p>  <p>- Special Arrangements for State Examinations   facilitates access to the certificate examinations by candidates who would have difficulty in accessing the examination or communicating what they know to an examiner because of a physical, visual, hearing and\/or learning difficulty. 17,661 students benefitted from this scheme in 2017, increased from 14,287 in 2011. <\/p>  <p>- Specialised Training for people with disabilities   is funded by the National Training Fund The target group for STPs comprises unemployed people with disabilities, in receipt of a disability payment or in possession of a letter from their doctor, who are aged over   16, and are deemed by DEASP and ETB&rsquo;s to require the additional supports that STPs provide.<\/p>  <p>- Adult Education   &ndash; once off projects for disability in education.  <\/p>  <p>- The Fund for Students with Disabilities   supports students to participate fully in their academic programmes and aims to ensure that students are not disadvantaged by reason of a disability. Eligible full-time students can receive assistance from PLC level to doctoral level, and the Fund is not means-tested. A claim under the Fund is made on behalf of an eligible student by their college following an assessment of need. The Fund typically provides three types of assistance, including assistive technology equipment and software, personal and academic support, and transport. <\/p>  <p>  The HEA do not collect data on the progression of students with special educational needs to higher education but collect data on entrants with disabilities, and in addition, collate data on the number of students in higher education supported by the Fund for Students with Disabilities. The number of students with a disability entering higher education has doubled from 2011, rising from 2,166 to 4,417 in 2016\/17.<\/p>  <p>  The continued increase in investment by this Government to support students with special educational needs across the education system would indicate that it is having a positive impact on their retention and participation in school and their progression to third level and further education and training.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018100900074#WRF04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Student Grant Scheme Eligibility","counter":311,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018100900074#WRF04700"},{"type":"question","counter":312,"qnumday":108,"qnumall":"[40889\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018100900074#WRF04800","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if his Department has investigated difficulties experienced by mature students in availing of a student grant; his plans to relax the criteria applied to independent students (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1244","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":313,"content":"<p>Very significant numbers of third-level students move out of home to go to college and continue to be supported by their parents while in full-time education.

My Department, along with SOLAS, the Education and Training Boards (ETBs) and partner agencies are collaborating on the ongoing development and enhancement of the structures required to progress its implementation. The strategy sets out 12 inter- related elements which aim to promote, develop and encourage literacy and numeracy skills in the adult population. Progress to date includes the development and launch of the national awareness campaign, <i>&lsquo;Take the First Step&rsquo;<\/i>, development of national guidelines for the initial and on-going screening and assessment of participants and the publication of a number of research projects including the examination of integrating literacy and numeracy in FET programmes and an examination of barriers to participation in FET programmes. This year SOLAS has commissioned NALA to progress the evidence base to inform best practice in relation to family learning.  It is envisaged that <i>Family Learning Best Practice Guidelines<\/i>will be available in early 2019.<\/p><p>The SOLAS allocation to Education and Training Boards (ETBs) for 2018 for adult literacy and basic skills provision is over &euro;35m. Funding for further education and training (FET) is allocated to SOLAS, who then allocate to the ETBs through a strategic planning process. There is some discretion for SOLAS and the ETBs in relation to how funding is allocated across all of the FET programmes, including adult literacy. <\/p><p>The ETB Adult Literacy Service provides programmes with accreditation at levels NQF levels  1-4.  Provision for adult literacy is delivered through a number of programmes;<\/p><p>- Adult Literacy groups (small groups)<\/p><p>- Intensive Tuition in Adult Basic Education (ITABE)- English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL)<\/p><p>- Skills for Work - workplace literacy courses- Voluntary Literacy provision (one-to-one tuition)<\/p><p>- Family Learning Programmes- Distance learning service.<\/p><p>The adult literacy programme is informed by a set of operational guidelines that include guidance on initial assessment and engagement and the importance of more intensive provision to support literacy acquisition.  Less intensive provision can be useful in welcoming and engaging new learners back into education but the guidelines recognise that more intensive approaches are required to enable progression.<\/p><p>I also recently launched a new policy framework for employee development, 'Supporting Working Lives and Enterprise Growth in Ireland', which was developed by SOLAS in consultation with key partners.  This new approach will enable targeted support for vulnerable groups in the Irish workforce as it has a particular focus on employees those who have lower skills levels and who need more opportunities to advance in their working lives and careers, to sustain their employment and to avoid displacement or to avail of emerging job opportunities. The policy sets a target of having over 40,000 workers, whose skills level is below Level 5 on the National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ), engaged in state supported skills development by 2021. It should be noted that while the NFQ is not a literacy scale but a qualifications framework, I am committed to addressing literacy issues amongst those whose highest level of qualification is below Level 5, including through achieving certification for their learning. This will supplement the numbers already being supported through our adult literacy programmes. Participation by employees in relevant courses will be provided free of charge. <\/p><p>In the National Skills Strategy 2025, targets are set to reduce the percentage of adults scoring at or below level 1 in the PIAAC survey from a baseline of 17.5% to 12% by 2025, and to increase the percentage of adults scoring at levels 2, 3 and 4 in the PIAAC survey from a baseline of 44% to 50% by 2025. The substantial investment already being made in adult literacy, supplemented by this new initiative to support those in employment, will also ensure that Ireland is well positioned to achieve these targets.<\/p><p>As regards childhood literacy, the Literacy and Numeracy Strategy, launched in 2011, set out a vision for raising standards in our early years, primary and post-primary school settings. The 2017 Interim Review of the Strategy shows the significant progress which has been made under the Strategy since 2011, notably in promoting a high level of literacy for all.  For example, the National Assessments of English Reading and Maths (NAERM) shows that the percentage of students at second class performing at the highest levels (Level 3 or above) in reading increased from 35% in 2009 to 46% in 2014; and the percentage of students at second class performing at the lowest levels (Level 1 or below) in reading decreased from 35% in 2009 to 22% in 2014.  Substantial progress has also been made at post primary-level with the percentage of 15 year olds performing at the higher levels in reading as measured by the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) increasing from 29% in 2009 to 37% in 2015; and the percentage of 15 year olds performing at the lowest levels (at or below Level 1) decreased from 17% in 2009 to 10% in 2015.The average score achieved by Ireland's fifteen year olds in the PISA literacy assessment was second only to Finland in the European Union.<\/p><p>The Interim Review Report also shows areas for improvement such as a gap in achievement between learners in DEIS schools (in particular DEIS Band 1 schools in primary) and those in other schools which must be addressed.  Publication of the <i>DEIS Plan 2017 <\/i>is a significant step and its implementation will be the vehicle for driving progress in terms of improving educational outcomes including literacy for pupils at greatest risk of not achieving their full potential.  The Literacy and Numeracy review sets out additional actions with new and updated targets to 2020.  Achievement of targets will be measured through the National Assessments of English Reading and Mathematics (NAERM) and Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA).<\/p><p>Measurement on a county by county basis is not available, but the targets set out in the following document show the focus on reducing the gap between achievement in reading in DEIS Band 1 schools and pupils in all primary schools, and between students in DEIS post primary schools and students in all post primary schools.  <\/p><p>Standardised testing is carried out at 2<sup>nd<\/sup>4<sup>th<\/sup>and 6<sup>th<\/sup>classes at primary level and are used to measure the level of child's achievement in English and Irish reading and maths. They compare children's score with other children in the same class or age level.  The purpose of these tests are to gather information on the level of the child&rsquo;s reading and maths to help the teachers plan each child's specific learning, and to inform the parent on how well their child is doing in school.<\/p><p><b>National Assessments of English reading (NAERM) &ndash; DEIS Band 1 Primary Schools<\/b><table><tr><th><b> <\/b><\/th><th><b> <\/b><\/th><th><b>Target for 2020 set in the 2011 Strategy\u00a0 <\/b><\/th><th><b>Current Position (NAERM 2014)<\/b><\/th><th><b>New Target to 2020<\/b><\/th><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td><b>Second class<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"4\">No corresponding target in 2011 <i>Strategy<\/i><\/td><td>18%<\/td><td>25%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>Reading: At or above Level 3 <\/b><\/td><td><b>Sixth class<\/b><\/td><td>21%<\/td><td>27%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td><b>Second class<\/b><\/td><td>44%<\/td><td>40%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>Reading: At or below Level 1<\/b><\/td><td><b>Sixth class<\/b><\/td><td>47%<\/td><td>40%<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p><b>Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) &ndash; DEIS Post-Primary <\/b><table><tr><th><b> <\/b><\/th><th><b> <\/b><\/th><th><b>Target for 2020 set in the 2011 Strategy\u00a0 <\/b><\/th><th><b>Current Position (PISA 2015)<\/b><\/th><th><b>New Target to 2020<\/b><\/th><\/tr><tr><td><b>Reading Literacy: At or above Level 4 <\/b><\/td><td><b>15 year olds<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"3\">No corresponding target in 2011 <i>Strategy<\/i><br \/><br \/> <br \/><br \/><b> <\/b><\/td><td>28% <\/td><td>33% <\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>Reading Literacy:\u00a0 At or above Level 5<\/b><br \/><br \/><b>(highest achievers)<\/b><\/td><td><b>15 year olds<\/b><\/td><td>7%<\/td><td>10%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>Reading Literacy: At or below Level 1<\/b><\/td><td><b>15 year olds<\/b><\/td><td>16%<\/td><td>12%<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018100900077#WRJ01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1351"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Building Projects Status","counter":422,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018100900077#WRJ01300"},{"type":"question","counter":423,"qnumday":150,"qnumall":"[41253\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018100900077#WRJ01400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"his plans for the proposed extension of a school (details supplied); the status of the project; the timeline for completion of the works; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1237","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":424,"content":"<p>The project to which the Deputy refers has been devolved for delivery to the local Education and Training Board (ETB).<\/p><p>Under this arrangement, it will be a matter for the ETB to appoint a Design Team for the design and construction phases of the project.

This is a long-standing principle of our system of justice.

This is because once there has been any significant lapse of time between one employment and another, the original vetting disclosure must be reviewed to take account of any changes in information, such as more recent criminal convictions.  Furthermore, the data protection law requires that any sensitive personal data which employers use in regard to their employees must be current, accurate and up-to-date.  Importantly, the general non-transferability and contemporaneous nature of the current process also helps to protect against the risk of fraud or forgery in the process.<\/p>  <p>  I am pleased to inform the Deputy that at present, 80% of overall vetting applications are being processed by the National Vetting Bureau in five working days.  This efficiency has been achieved by the deployment of the e-Vetting system which facilitates the on-line processing of applications for vetting from registered organisations.  The e-Vetting system is available to all registered organisations and the Garda Authorities are ready to assist those organisations who are not yet using the e-Vetting system to do so.  In circumstances where there is such a sustained reduction in processing times, the issue of vetting &ldquo;transferability&rdquo; is largely obviated.<\/p>  <p>  That said, there are certain limited circumstances where organisations can share a single vetting disclosure where this is agreed to by the vetting applicant.

In addition, my officials delivered a presentation on the pilot scheme at a stakeholder event hosted by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.<\/p>  <p>  During the review, I requested that the emerging labour shortages being experienced in the agri-sector be prioritised.  As a result, a total of 750 employment permits for meat processing operatives have been made available under the pilot scheme.  The pilot scheme is open to all employers working in the sector and workers can be drawn from almost all non-EEA countries.

The Expert Group also concluded that a person&rsquo;s means should remain the main qualifier for a medical card. This position remains unchanged.<\/p>  <p>  Medical card provision is based on financial assessment. In accordance with the provisions of the Health Act 1970 (as amended), eligibility for a medical card is determined by the HSE. The Act obliges the HSE to assess whether a person is unable, without due hardship, to arrange general practitioner services for himself or herself and his or her family, having regard to his or her overall financial position and reasonable expenditure and every application must be assessed on that basis. Under the legislation, having a particular illness, in itself, does not establish eligibility for a medical card and therefore, the medical conditions of applicants for this scheme are not monitored on that basis.

Social and medical issues are considered when determining whether undue hardship exists for an individual accessing general practitioner or other medical services. The HSE affords applicants the opportunity to furnish supporting information documentation to fully take account of all the relevant circumstances that may benefit them in the assessment, including medical evidence of cost and necessary expenses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018100900081#WRN03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services","counter":657,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018100900081#WRN03800"},{"type":"question","counter":658,"qnumday":231,"qnumall":"[40659\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018100900081#WRN03900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reason for the delay of 34 months in County Wexford for an appointment with a child and adolescent primary care psychologist;

The Strategy contains 35 priority and additional actions and its implementation is being led by the National Dementia Office in the HSE. The office has made substantial progress towards developing evidence-based care pathways for people with dementia and progress to date, as well as future plans, is recorded in the mid-term review of the Strategy's implementation, which was published in May this year. The Strategy emphasises the need for a \"whole community response\" to dementia, as the majority of people with dementia live in their own communities and wish to avail of services in their local area.<\/p>  <p>  In 2016 and 2017, the National Dementia Office partnered with the Alzheimer Society of Ireland on a project to map dementia-specific community-based services and supports. The project showed that the average number of community-based services in each Community Health Organisation was 35. Services provided in the community include dementia day care centres, a large proportion of which operate five days a week; dementia-specific homecare delivered by fully trained staff who are familiar with and understand the different symptoms and stages of dementia; dementia-friendly activities such as choirs and art gallery visits; dementia social clubs and Alzheimer Caf&eacute;s; carer support groups; and dementia advisers. These services are provided by voluntary organisations and the HSE and partner organisations. <\/p>  <p>  It is acknowledged that there are gaps in access to services and a large variance in what services are provided across the country. The National Dementia Office has met with senior HSE officials in each Community Healthcare Organisation region to highlight gaps in each area and to develop local action plans to improve service provision.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to these community supports, in 2014 the HSE introduced Dementia-Specific Intensive Homecare Packages (Dementia-IHCPs) to test the feasibility of providing a high level of support to people with dementia with complex needs to facilitate them to remain living at home. These were initially co-funded by the HSE and the Atlantic Philanthropies and now fully funded by the HSE, which has committed to continue to provide approximately 120 packages at any one time. In addition to the IHCPs, people with dementia are also able to avail of standard home care services on the basis of need and within the resources available<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Health secured &euro;6.26 million through the 2016, 2017 and 2018 Dormant Accounts Fund Action Plans for a number of projects to improve care and supports for people with dementia. Projects receiving funding include the delivery of post-diagnostic supports; a dementia diagnostic service for people with intellectual disability; a national network of memory technology resource rooms; the development of a national dementia registry; the national rollout of a dementia training programme for HSE homecare staff; the development of dementia resource centres; funding for a dementia community activation coordinator; and community support projects for people with dementia. <\/p>  <p>  In terms of plans to expand support levels for people with dementia, the level of funding available for the Department of Health in 2019 and the quantum of services to be provided by the HSE will be considered as part of the national Estimates and budgetary process and National Service Planning. <\/p>  <p>  In July and September, I met with the Alzheimer Society of Ireland to discuss dementia priorities. I have also met with Senator Colette Kelleher, a former CEO of the ASI and advocate for people with dementia, to specifically discuss the needs of people with dementia. I remain willing to engage with advocacy groups on dementia issues as we continue to work towards improved care pathways and services for people with dementia, their carers and families. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018100900082#WRO03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1261"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Services for People with Disabilities","counter":713,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018100900082#WRO03900"},{"type":"question","counter":714,"qnumday":249,"qnumall":"[40725\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018100900082#WRO04000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he has met with a group (details supplied) to discuss funding arrangements for a centre in order for it to open on more weeks per year; if the granting of funds has been considered in the context of budget 2019; if the attention of the group has been drawn to other funding avenues; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The approach set out in the Plan included insourcing of surgical procedures in the Children's Hospital Group (CHG), and the broader public hospital sector, as well as outsourcing initiatives, including private providers nationally and abroad. <\/p>  <p>  In 2017, as part of the outsourcing initiative, families were offered the opportunity to have their child's surgery abroad. CHG advise that in total as part of this initiative 28 patients have had their treatment abroad and that arrangements have been agreed with services in the UK to undertake follow up reviews to ensure those children who received outsourced surgery in the UK receive appropriate follow up care as per the agreed protocol. This will include face to face outpatient clinics in Our Lady's Children's Hospital Crumlin, in addition to phone call and Skype follow up, if needed. These reviews are scheduled according to the patient's clinical care plan. <\/p>  <p>  As a result of the additional &euro;9m provided to the HSE in Budget 2018, the CHG advise that the increased investment has started to see the service stabilise and the current capacity expand to meet the demand for timely scoliosis treatment. As a consequence, there has not been the demand to send patients abroad for surgery. <\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding, this year a small number of families were offered the opportunity to have their child's surgery abroad, but did not avail of the offer as they did not want to travel abroad. One child did have surgery abroad in 2018; this was a procedure that was due to have taken place in 2017, but which was deferred until 2018. <\/p>  <p>  The CHG advise that the investment in paediatric orthopaedics this year, which includes scoliosis services, has already improved access for surgery and outpatient review. The impact of investment is now starting to deliver results, with a consistent reduction in waiting times being recorded. By September 2018 there had been a reduction of 26% in the waiting times experienced to access surgery since the start of the year.

Its terms of reference, developed following cross-party engagement, included examination of the tendering, contracting, operation, conflict of interest arrangements, performance information and performance management, accreditation and quality assurance of contracted cytology laboratory services since the inception of the CervicalCheck programme.

While some potential exists to recruit labour from within the domestic and European labour markets, it became apparent in recent times that this would be insufficient to meet the demand and therefore, I and my officials worked with the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Heather Humphreys, and her Department to introduce a pilot quota of employment permits for non-European Economic Area (EEA) nationals for these three sub-sectors.  So far, 750 permits have been allocated to meat processing, and of these, 448 have been issued (as of 05\/10\/18).  Given the level of demand, it is anticipated that the full allocation will be used in the near future.  A remuneration threshold of &euro;22,000 was introduced for these permits, with employers obliged to ensure access to suitable accommodation and training, including language training.<\/p>  <p>  I said at the time of the announcement of these permits that they were just one piece of the jigsaw in addressing labour supply and that the sector must also continue to intensify its efforts to source labour from both the domestic and EU markets.  In this regard, my officials have worked closely with the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection (DEASP) to assist in these efforts.  In May 2018, that Department hosted an information session with representatives from across the agri-food sector, including representatives from the meat processing sector, as well as officials from my Department, the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation (DBEI) and the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC).  This meeting provided information to the sectoral representatives on the range of employment initiatives and supports that DEASP can provide, from &lsquo;Intreo&rsquo; to &lsquo;EURES&rsquo; and more, while officials from DBEI and the WRC explained the employment permits system and obligations and responsibilities of employers.  I understand the DEASP have continued and intensified their engagement with the agri-food sector since then, including the meat processing sector, with a range of different interactions including:<\/p>  <p>  - Meetings with the meat, horticulture, pigs, poultry, forestry and horse racing employers and representative bodies.  <\/p>  <p>  - Job recruitment fairs, events, and course recruitment <\/p>  <p>  - Future and ongoing recruitment campaigns both in Ireland and across Europe (EURES)<\/p>  <p>  A further meeting was held in July with a range of industry bodies and individual employers (including the meat processing sector) to go through these initiatives and others in greater detail.  The DEASP also held a dedicated information meeting with representatives of the meat industry and individual employers.  Finally, I understand that DEASP officials have also had extensive engagement on a one-to-one basis with employers across the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018100900090#WRW01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Literacy Programmes","counter":1088,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018100900090#WRW01200"},{"type":"question","counter":1089,"qnumday":384,"qnumall":"[40674\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018100900090#WRW01300","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the involvement of his Department in tackling adult literacy; if a financial allocation is provided for same; if so, the way in which it is utilised; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1224","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":1090,"content":"<p>My Department aims to ensure that the needs of all its customers are met and that rights to equal treatment are upheld in the delivery of services.

Reflecting this priority, Ireland has established a very ambitious long-term decarbonisation objective through the National Policy Position on Climate Action and Low Carbon Development for 2050, and has already put in place robust governance arrangements to secure a strong co-ordinated approach to delivery of our ambition on climate action across all relevant Government Departments and Agencies. <\/p><p>The National Mitigation Plan published in July 2017 is a whole-of-Government Plan, reflecting, in particular, the central roles of the Ministers responsible for the four key sectors with the most significant contribution to national emissions - Electricity Generation; the Built Environment; Transport; and Agriculture, Forestry and Land Use - and draws on the perspectives of a range of other Departments. <\/p><p>I subsequently published Ireland&rsquo;s first statutory National Adaptation Framework in January 2018. Under the Framework, seven Government Departments and Agencies, with responsibility for the twelve priority sectors identified in the Framework, are required to submit sectoral adaptation plans to Government for approval by 30 September 2019. <\/p><p>Recognising the significant obligation which has been placed on the Local Authority sector to develop and implement its own climate action measures, I provided funding to establish and develop four Local Authority Climate Action Regional Offices. These offices will ensure links between sectors and provide expertise and capacity at local and regional level to contribute effectively to the national transition to a low carbon and climate resilient economy. <\/p><p>Engagement between the wider public and central and local Government will be underpinned by a structured process of dialogue and engagement under the National Dialogue on Climate Action, with the first, very successful, regional dialogue event taking place last June in Athlone.<\/p><p>The Climate Action High Level Steering Group, which I chair and which includes representation from all relevant Government Departments and Agencies, meets at least quarterly to drive progress by sectors and agencies on the implementation of both the National Mitigation Plan and National Adaptation Framework. This group, in turn, reports to the Cabinet Committee on Infrastructure, Environment and Climate Action, chaired by An Taoiseach. <\/p><p>Technical capacity for climate action policy development and implementation is provided through the Technical Research and Modelling Group (TRAM), which was established by Government Decision in 2015 and is chaired by my Department. TRAM is a high level cross-departmental technical group, with representation from relevant Government Departments and Agencies, supported by a number of academic institutions. TRAM reports to the Climate Action High Level Steering Group.<\/p><p>The Climate Change Advisory Council, an independent body established under Section 8 of the 2015 Act, is mandated to provide advice and recommendations to me, to relevant sectoral Ministers and to the Government in relation to the development and implementation of the National Mitigation Plan and National Adaptation Framework. The Council is also tasked with advising on matters relating to the achievement of Ireland&rsquo;s objective to transition to a low carbon, climate resilient and sustainable economy by 2050. Reports of the Advisory Council are available on its website at<i>www.climatecouncil.ie\u00a0\u00a0<\/i><\/p><p>In accordance with the framework provided by the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015, the Government must prepare and submit to the Oireachtas an Annual Transition Statement. In support of this written Statement I, as well as other relevant Ministers, provide an oral report to each House. This process ensures that responsible Ministers are directly accountable to the Oireachtas to ensure real progress is made in reducing emissions in their respective sectors. I expect to be in a position to lay the 2018 Annual Transition Statement before the Houses in the coming weeks.<\/p><p>My Department is also working closely with other relevant Departments and Agencies on the preparation of the National Energy and Climate Plan through the structures described above. Preparation of this Plan has been in turn informed by work undertaken to prepare the Energy White Paper, the National Mitigation Plan, the National Adaptation Framework, and the National Development Plan.<\/p><p>In conclusion, I am satisfied that robust institutional and oversight arrangements, accompanied by significant resources, have already been put in place in recent years and are designed to ensure that delivery of Ireland&rsquo;s climate policy and integration of climate action is at the core of Government policy making.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018100900092#WRY02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Broadband Service Provision","counter":1217,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018100900092#WRY02800"},{"type":"question","counter":1218,"qnumday":428,"qnumall":"[41154\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018100900092#WRY02900","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the status of the roll-out of broadband to a village (details supplied) in County Cork; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":1219,"content":"<p>In April 2017 I published an updated High Speed Broadband Map which is available at .

Tusla has introduced 'Signs of Safety', a child protection practice model which supports families working with social workers to develop safety plans for their children.<\/p>  <p>  I am informed by Tusla that, when the need to place a child in care is being considered, the decision making supports for parents vary, depending on each family&rsquo;s circumstances. A parent may seek to have their child placed in care in some circumstance. This might arise, for instance, if a single parent, with little community support, needed to undergo treatment for a health issue.  <\/p>  <p>  In all cases, the first step is to keep children safely at home with supports from the State and\/or from their own networks. If voluntary care is required, the possibility of this being available safely with family and friends is always considered in the first instance, and supported as appropriate.  <\/p>  <p>  Parents who seek voluntary care are brought through a supportive process to ensure they understand what they are requesting, including the possible impact on the child, and possible consequences that may arise if their home situation remains unsafe. Parents whose children need care for safety reasons, but who are reluctant to proceed with voluntary care, will be supported to understand their children&rsquo;s needs, the reasons that voluntary care is in their best interest and their right to consult with their solicitor. <\/p>  <p>  The process for voluntary care requires parental consent. However, a parent can withdraw their consent at any time. If consent is withdrawn, a decision is made about the necessity to seek a court order. This will depend on whether it can be deemed safe to return a child to his or her parents' care.<\/p>  <p>  In some areas there is a parent advocacy service.

The situation where there was more than one entry point created a perception of inequality to some parents when they considered the variance in the number of weeks of ECCE provision, dependant on their entry point.  <\/p>  <p>  It must be noted that age limits have been used to determine eligibility since the inception of the ECCE programme in 2010. These rules are a necessary component of any Government scheme and ensure that Exchequer funding is used for its intended purpose.<\/p>  <p>  The upper age limit for the ECCE programme was set in consultation with the Department of Education and Skills. It ensures that children transition into primary school with their peers and limits the age range of children beginning primary school. Limiting the diversity in age ranges in children beginning primary school education is considered generally to be in the best interest of children, in relation to peer interaction in junior infants, as well as other educational considerations.<\/p>  <p>  My Department does its best to ensure, in so far as possible, the equitable treatment of all children and families who apply for childcare funding under the ECCE Programme.  In order to ensure objectivity and fairness, it is essential that clear rules exist for the scheme and that they are applied evenly. An essential component of the ECCE programme rules is an eligibility start date to ensure that the programme can be administered and budgeted for in an appropriate manner.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018100900094#WRAA01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"question","counter":1309,"qnumday":458,"qnumall":"[41122\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018100900094#WRAA01200","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if her attention has been drawn to a cohort of children who are no longer eligible for the early childhood care and education, ECCE, scheme due to changes to the enrolment points eligibility criteria; if measures to cover those no longer eligible will be considered; if changes made to the enrolment points of the ECCE programme, being implemented from September 2018 in order to expand access, will be reviewed; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1433","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":1310,"content":"<p>There is no question of any child losing entitlement to eligibility for the ECCE scheme.

One enrolment period at the start of the pre-school year will help to streamline the administration process and will make it easier for childcare providers to operate and budget for the programme year. It also makes it easier for parents to secure places on the ECCE programme for their children. There are currently no plans to change this single entry point.<\/p>  <p>  Some children will not be able to commence their ECCE in September of the programme year as they will not have reached the age of 2 years and 8 months on or before 31st August. However, they will be able to commence ECCE in the following September and continue for a further year from September of the next programme year. Parents of children born around this time of the year may prefer for their children to start school at 4 rather than 5. These parents may therefore choose to avail of one year of ECCE only.

However, many of those exiting the OFP scheme transferred to other social welfare schemes, such as Jobseeker&rsquo;s Transitional payment, Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance, Working Family Payment or Back to Work Family Dividend, so the expenditure on these schemes increased.<\/p><p>It is worth pointing out that the decreases in the income disregard for OFP that occurred from 2012 to 2014 were <b>unrelated<\/b>to the reforms of the OFP scheme, and were due to budgetary considerations. The lower income disregards meant that more of the earned income was taken into consideration as means, thereby impacting the overall income received by OFP recipients engaged in employment. The Government has been incrementally increasing the income disregard for OFP since Budget 2017, and it is currently set at &euro;130.  I will of course consider further increases in the context of the forthcoming Budget.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018100900095#WRBB03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Carer's Allowance Applications","counter":1384,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018100900095#WRBB03200"},{"type":"question","counter":1385,"qnumday":483,"qnumall":"[40798\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018100900095#WRBB03300","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"when a decision in respect of an application for carer&rsquo;s allowance by a person (details supplied) will be made; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1288","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":1386,"content":"<p>Carer's allowance (CA) is a means-tested social assistance payment made to a person who is habitually resident in the State and who is providing full-time care and attention to a child or an adult who has such a disability that as a result they require that level of care.<\/p><p>I confirm that my department received an application for CA from the person concerned on the 27 June 2018.  <\/p><p>As the applicant has failed to answer a number of questions relating to her means or supplied supporting documentation, the matter was referred to a local social welfare inspector (SWI) on 3 October 2018 to assess the level of care being provided, assess means and confirm that all the conditions for receipt of carer&rsquo;s allowance are satisfied. <\/p><p>Once the SWI has reported, a decision will be made and the person concerned will be notified directly of the outcome. <\/p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018100900095#WRBB03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Jobseeker's Payments","counter":1387,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018100900095#WRBB03500"},{"type":"question","counter":1388,"qnumday":484,"qnumall":"[40842\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018100900095#WRBB03600","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 235 of 27 September 2018, if a payment level in the case of a person (details supplied) will be re-examined in view of an error; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":1389,"content":"<p>A payment increase to a Jobseekers payment for a Qualified Child is usually paid in circumstances here a child up to 18 years of age lives with the client.

This will provide for the continued support of existing HAP households and also enable the additional 16,760 households targeted under Rebuilding Ireland to be supported by HAP in 2019, as well as supporting the roll-out of the HAP Place Finder Support Service across the country. <\/p>  <p>  The Homeless HAP Place Finder Service is a targeted support for homeless households who are finding it difficult to secure HAP tenancies. The Place Finder Service has been successfully utilised by the Dublin Regional Homeless Executive (DRHE) across the Dublin local authorities since February 2015, with more than 3,000 households being supported by the Homeless HAP scheme at end Q2 2018. <\/p>  <p>  The Homeless HAP Place Finder Service is now available to each of the 31 local authorities, with the options to pay deposits and advance rental payments for any households in emergency homeless accommodation, in order to secure accommodation via the HAP Scheme.<\/p>  <p>  A critical focus of Rebuilding Ireland is to intensify the provision of long term local authority and Approved Housing Body (AHB) stock, particularly to accelerate new build activity. However, there is an urgent and immediate need to accommodate households, which cannot be met solely from owned stock. There were 71,858 households on local authority waiting lists as at 11 June 2018. The combination of targeted delivery under Rebuilding Ireland of 50,000 social housing homes under Build, Acquisition and Leasing schemes and 87,000 HAP and RAS supports, which will be funded by the Government out to 2021, offers both long term and flexible options to these individuals and families. <\/p>  <p>  We are delivering on and in fact exceeding on both the 50,000 and the 87,000 targets. The targets under Rebuilding Ireland were carefully set against the reality of deliverables and by 2021 we will be housing more people through new social housing homes than through HAP.<\/p>  <p>  At the end of Quarter 2 2018, over 37,750 tenancies were being supported by the HAP scheme, including over 9,000 additional households in 2018.  I continue to keep the operation of HAP under review but I am currently satisfied with how the scheme is operating and I consider it to be a key vehicle for meeting current housing need and fulfilling the ambitious programme set out in Rebuilding Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018100900097#WRDD01775","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"European Court of Human Rights Rulings","counter":1484,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018100900097#WRDD01800"},{"type":"question","counter":1485,"qnumday":516,"qnumall":"[40595\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018100900097#WRDD01900","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 530 of 25 September 2018, if his attention has been drawn to the fact that this timeline is different to that stated in correspondence to a person (details supplied) in September 2018; the correct timeline of same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1255","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":1486,"content":"<p> I refer to the reply to Parliamentary Question No. 530 of 25 September 2018.<\/p>  <p>  As indicated in my previous reply, the working group referred to has concluded its deliberations and, taking account of the group's analysis and recommended outcome, my Department has been engaging with the European Commission on the matter with a view to issuing to planning authorities, by the end of this year, revisions to the 2005 rural housing guidelines that take account of the relevant ECJ judgment.

Approximately &euro;972 million was spent on the programme, &euro;775.3 million of which was recouped by my Department.  Ballymun is by far the largest regeneration project ever undertaken in the country and the project was largely completed by the end of 2013.  Since construction started in 2000, this significant investment resulted in almost 2,000 new replacement homes being constructed for residents of the original flat blocks and an additional 1,350 homes in the area being provided via private sector investment.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the programme has provided state of the art community facilities, such as the Axis theatre, and invested in neighbourhood centres to improve services.  In recent years the programme has focused on improving the area&rsquo;s environmental performance with various green initiatives, new parks and playing pitches.  Enterprise and employment generation has focused on the main street and retail parks with many new employment opportunities opening up for the residents. <\/p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s oversight of the regeneration projects at this location was concerned with general progress on the overall programme and it continually liaised with Dublin City Council and Ballymun Regeneration Limited on the strategic approach and general phasing of works.

In order to be successful and sustainable in the long term, a regeneration project requires the re-building of a community and a strengthening of community bonds.

It is a matter for each local authority to determine its own spending priorities in the context of the annual budgetary process having regard to both locally identified needs and available resources.  The elected members of a local authority have direct responsibility in law for all reserved functions of the authority, which includes adopting the annual budget, and are democratically accountable for all expenditure by the local authority.<\/p>  <p>  Local authorities are required to adopt budgets which are sufficient to meet the expenditure arising in the year in accordance with the terms of section 10A of the City and County Management Act 1955, as inserted in that Act by section 113 of the Local Government Act 2001.  Local Authority budgets must be balanced, sufficient to defray the expenditure necessary to maintain  a reasonable standard of public services and must provide for payment of any sums which the local authority is bound to pay.  The adoption of a balanced budget is probably the single most important duty that the elected members are called upon to carry out each year.  To achieve that balance, the members must make informed and necessary choices to balance the level of service provision with the available income.  Note 16 in the Annual Financial Statements of local authorities shows the difference between the adopted budgets and the actual outturn in respect of both expenditure and income.<\/p>  <p>  In the context of the budget process, similar to any organisation, local authorities' levels of expenditure and income are forecast based on informed judgments, assumptions and decisions.  Section 104 of the Local Government Act 2001 sets out the requirements on local authorities governing additional expenditure, which means the spending of money or the incurring of a liability not provided for in a local authority budget.  Section 104 (2) states that \"at any time after it has adopted a budget a local authority may, following a proposal under subsection (3) or otherwise, by resolution authorise the incurring of additional expenditure\".<\/p>  <p>  The Local Government Audit Service provides a professional, independent audit service to local authorities.  In the annual audit reports of local authorities there is a report on any spending in excess of the amount budgeted, along with confirmation that the overspend has been approved by resolution of the members in line with Section 104 (2).<\/p>  <p>  In order to enhance the financial management and audit control systems in local authorities, an audit committee, with both councillor and expert external membership, is now in place in each authority.  The functions of an audit committee are to review financial and budgetary reporting practices and procedures within a local authority, foster the development of best practice in the internal audit function, review auditors&rsquo; reports and special reports and assess follow-up action by management, assess and promote efficiency and value for money, review risk management systems and make such recommendations to the authority as the committee considers appropriate in respect of such matters.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018100900098#WREE05500","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"County and City Managers' Association","counter":1583,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018100900099#WRFF00200"},{"type":"question","counter":1584,"qnumday":550,"qnumall":"[41147\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018100900099#WRFF00300","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the detail of an association (details supplied); the function and role it has vis-&agrave;-vis Government; the body which funds it on a day to day basis; the amount of funding it receives annually from the State; the role it has to play in policy creation within his Department; if it has statutory powers; if so, the exact legislation which underpins it; and if he will make a statement on the matter.
