I would like the Minister for Health to oversee the introduction of the loop medicated isothermal amplification, LAMP, test in hospitals.  The test can provide results detecting the presence of meningitis within an hour, dramatically reducing the time taken to produce a result under the current system.  This would allow for life-saving treatment to begin much sooner than currently possible.  There are 200 cases of meningitis in Ireland annually.  Of these, 10% of patients die, 10% suffer major disabilities such as brain damage or amputations and 33% suffer some form of after-effect.  Ireland has one of the highest rates of meningitis in Europe.  A child suspected of having the disease is subject to a blood test, the result of which is returned within 48 hours.  Consequently, some children at serious risk can be sent home with a disease that could kill within a matter of hours.  The LAMP test was developed in Queen's University Belfast.  It is a test for meningitis, the result of which is returned within an hour, and it has the potential to save numerous lives every year.  It is diagnostically as accurate as the current method but it is much quicker and more straightforward for any hospital with a laboratory.  A significant cost would not be incurred and it has been trialled over the past few years by the NHS.  It is a no-brainer and I would love to think it will be introduced in Ireland because we have one of the highest rates of meningitis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018021400002#A00400","speaker":"1406"},{"type":"speech","time":1518604200,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this important matter and for the opportunity to outline the thinking of the Department and the HSE in this regard.  Meningitis is defined as inflammation of the meninges, which is the lining around the brain tissue, and this can be caused by bacteria, viruses or, rarely, fungi.  When testing for meningitis, a sample of cerebrospinal fluid must be taken, which is then examined for white cells that fight infection and subjected to certain culture and molecular tests.  The aim of these tests is to identify the specific organism causing the inflammation.  There are two reference laboratories in Dublin where testing is carried out - the Irish Meningitis and Sepsis Reference Laboratory at Temple Street carries out bacterial testing and the National Virus Reference Laboratory provides the viral testing service.<\/p> <p>There is a move currently in laboratories to test for a greater number of organisms at the same time.  These broader tests provide a number of benefits.  They have quick turnaround times that can provide results in approximately two hours and they can be performed in the local hospital laboratory without the need to send samples to the reference laboratories in Dublin.  The Irish Meningitis and Sepsis Reference Laboratory supports the introduction of tests for meningitis in each hospital that provides an acute emergency service.  There has also been significant progress in research into the use of biomarkers for diagnosing sepsis at the time of presentation.  An advantage of these biomarkers is that they are not specific to a particular organism and, therefore, have the potential to detect sepsis due to any invasive bacterial infection.<\/p> <p>The Senator referred to one particular commercial testing system, namely, the LAMP HiberGene system.  This system can be used to test for two particular organisms in cerebrospinal fluid, namely, meningococcus, and group B streptococcus.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Jim Daly:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2328\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2328&amp;amp;pid=JimDaly&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=14\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->As the Senator said, this system has a quicker turnaround that the broader systems I have mentioned.  However, it only tests for a very restricted range of bacteria that can cause meningitis and will not identify other causes of meningitis such as pneumococcus and E. coli.  The system also does not detect viral causes of meningitis or other viruses that may cause encephalitis, that is, inflammation of the  brain.  Consequently the other tests must still be carried out to ensure that the correct diagnosis is made.  Otherwise, there is a danger that the wrong treatment would be applied with potentially catastrophic consequences.<\/p><p>Finally, I would like to talk about the introduction of immunisation against meningitis into the childhood immunisation programmes in recent years.  Every child receives the meningococcal B vaccine at two, four and 12 months of age; the meningococcal C vaccine at six and 13 months; and a booster dose in the first year of secondary school.  These vaccines have had a real impact, leading to significant decreases in these forms of meningitis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018021400002#A00500","speaker":"1261","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1518604200,"counter":12,"content":"<p>This is a very important topic.

I was brief enough in my initial remarks in any event.  I welcome the move towards testing for a greater number of organisms at the same time and towards a quicker turnaround, which obviously is of double benefit.  I have to take as read what the Minister of State tells me about the test to which I am referring being more restricted in what it tests for.  I hear where he is coming from in that regard.<\/p> <p>In his final comments, the Minister of State referred to vaccinations.  This is a matter of very serious concern generally, particularly as there is a great deal of unnecessary scaremongering about certain vaccinations in this country.  It has been shown that there has been a reduction in the number of children being vaccinated for meningitis and for HPV, which causes cervical cancer.  That is a much larger issue.  This is obviously a system to detect meningitis when it occurs, but there is a way to prevent it occurring.  We are so lucky to have these vaccines.  It is a very serious issue that people are being misinformed and that there is a lot of misinformation about vaccinations.  In many respects it is probably more important than detecting it.  Obviously, we want a good system of detection.  If, however, we have a way of preventing it, surely that is the only show in town.  I encourage members of the public to inform themselves before considering not having any of these vaccinations because we are so lucky to have them and children need to get them.

A public meeting about the threatened closure of this health facility took place on 8 February.  To say that family members of the residents are upset would be an understatement.  The unit was previously threatened with closure in 2015 but, following public protests, this plan was reversed.  The protests were organised by angry family members who then numbered more than they do now.  The cynic in me would suggest that the embargo placed on new admissions since September 2016 was introduced in an effort to minimise the voice of protests which would come once the closure was announced.  In an interview last week, Tony Canavan said that the reason this is arising as an issue is that the numbers in the unit have drifted down to a low level and that is because there has not been any new admissions to the Rosalie unit since September 2016.  There could not be any new admissions because there was an embargo on admissions.  When pressed on the fact that this was because an embargo had been placed on new residents, Mr. Canavan disagreed with the use of the word \"embargo\".  That is, however, what we must call it.  It is an absolute disgrace.<\/p> <p>The unit at &Aacute;ras Naomh Chaolain is currently home to 14 elderly high-dependency residents with mental health conditions including advanced Alzheimer&rsquo;s.  It was developed as a specialised psycho-geriatric unit with capacity for 25 people.  It is not the same as a general nursing home.  I am very familiar with it.  I grew up 300 yd .or 400 yd. down the road from it.  I am very familiar with the area and my cousin works in the unit.<\/p> <p>Fears that the centre would be closed were allayed in July 2015 when then Minister of State at the Department of Health, Kathleen Lynch, told a deputation from Roscommon there were &ldquo;no plans to close it and there will be no such plans.&rdquo;  For the families of the residents, this offered some relief.  That has now been shattered.  These patients and their families have been told by the HSE that there is adequate accommodation available in Ballinasloe, County Galway, and Castlebar, County Mayo.  I am not sure if the Minister of State is familiar with the hinterland around there but it is an hour's journey from Castlerea to Castlebar or an hour and a half on the train.  There is no main direct route to Ballinasloe from Castlerea.  There is a road but it is terrible.  There is no direct rail link or bus route.  It would take at least an hour and a half for families to visit their loved ones in such units.  These sorts of excuses are totally unacceptable.  Uprooting these people, changing their routines and putting them in new settings different from those they are used to is an absolute disgrace.  This unit is their home.  I totally disagree with this move.  I fell very passionately about it.  We in Ireland pride ourselves on having an innate sense of nature.  This is not nature.  It is terrible.  It would not happen in the Minister of State's own home town.  This is a political decision and it can be reversed.  I urge the Minister of State to deal with it as a priority.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018021400002#B00600","speaker":"1373"},{"type":"speech","time":1518604200,"counter":18,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for the opportunity to clarify some of the facts surrounding this story.  I heard the interview to which the Senator refers on local radio, I have read lot of the commentary and I have heard the views of many of the Senator's colleagues and public representatives on this issue.  The HSE has confirmed that no decision has been taken to close the Rosalie unit.  The focus of the executive over recent times has been, and remains, on meeting the needs and best interests of the current residents of the unit.  The 2006 document, A Vision for Change, sets out a comprehensive policy framework for the development of mental health services.  It broadly recommends a move away from the traditional institution-based model of care to a more patient-centred, flexible and community-based service, where the need for hospital admission is greatly reduced while still providing inpatient care as appropriate.  This Government has prioritised the reform and resourcing of our mental health services in line with A Vision for Change.<\/p> <p>On the recommendations in the report, staff and service users are represented on the review group that authored it.  The HSE has advised that a consultant psychiatrist and the chair of the review group have also been appointed to oversee the implementation of the report's recommendations.  The executive has advised me that capacity exists within the Creagh suite in Ballinasloe to accommodate psychiatry of later life patients who have complex continuing care needs.  This is an approved centre under the Mental Health Act 2001, which has recently  been extensively renovated and modernised to the highest standards.  However, the executive has advised that there is no current proposal to move the residents to this facility.  I convened a meeting with local public representatives and the HSE on 24 January last in Leinster House.  A key outcome of this meeting was a commitment by the HSE to fully engage with residents and their families regarding the Rosalie unit.  The chief officer of community  health care organisation area 2 met residents and their families on 8 February.  In addition, I had discussions yesterday evening in Galway with the HSE about the Rosalie unit and I will be visiting it on 27 February.  In  conjunction with the executive, I will continue to closely monitor the development of all community-based mental health services in the  Galway-Roscommon area, including those provided at the Rosalie unit.  The unit, part of &Aacute;ras Naomh Chaolain, is located in Castlerea, County Roscommon.

The population in Roscommon is aging and there are more than 2,000 patients in the Roscommon region with dementia.  This is a callous act that violates people at their most vulnerable, because of their dementia and their cognitive impairment.  These people have no voice and they probably have no vote, but I guarantee that their family and their supporters do and they will not be silenced on this issue.  Nor will I.  It is something about which I feel very passionate and I urge the Minister to ensure that this unit remains open.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018021400002#B00800","speaker":"1373","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1518604200,"counter":21,"content":"<p>The Minister of State has said that he will visit it and that there are no plans to close it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018021400002#C00200","speaker":"1381"},{"type":"speech","time":1518604200,"counter":22,"content":"<p>I thank the Cathaoirleach; there are no plans to close it and I do plan to visit it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018021400002#C00300","speaker":"1261"},{"type":"speech","time":1518604200,"counter":23,"content":"<p>Despite everything else.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018021400002#C00400","speaker":"1373"},{"type":"speech","time":1518604200,"counter":24,"content":"<p>I will clarify some things for the Senator in the interest of being helpful.

This scheme was abandoned or abolished by a decision of the Government in February 2013.  I am concerned it has taken so long to address it.  I will focus on three areas.  In recent weeks, there was a letter from the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath's, private secretary following a presentation that he made to the Joint Committee on Public Petitions last October.<\/p> <p>The point was made there that it is not possible to provide an estimate of how many persons would currently be eligible for the payment of the mobility allowance if the scheme had not closed.  I find that amazing because I asked the Oireachtas Library and Research Service which contacted the HSE and I have come up with my own estimate.  An estimate can be challenged but when one looks at the drop in the number of people in the scheme since it was closed and looks back at the pattern prior to that, I estimate probably up to 900 people have lost out over the past five years since the scheme was closed to new entrants.  The Minister of State has been very strong about telling us that none of the people on the scheme has lost out and that they still have it but the people who would ordinarily have been coming onto the scheme, where others died or moved onto other things, have not been catered for.  It is not acceptable by any means and the Department has not put enough effort into it.  <\/p> <p>At that committee meeting I asked when the Department had been first contacted by the Ombudsman.  Deputy McGrath told that meeting in October that it had been in 2011 but a report undertaken by the Ombudsman includes several appendices.  One, appendix 3 on page 31, is a letter from the chief investigator in the Office of the Ombudsman on 3 February 2009.  There was a response to it three months later from the director of the disability and mental health division in the Department.  Later that year, both the director general of the Office of the Ombudsman and, finally in November of that year, the Secretary General of Health became involved.  Something is going wrong if a Minister of State at a committee does not know the basics of when the Department was communicated with in writing.  On that occasion, I also asked why, in 2013, the Department did not put that scheme on a statutory footing.  The response I received on 24 January 2018 was that it was not possible to place the then mobility allowance scheme on a statutory basis given the finding that the schemes were in breach of the Equal Status Act.  If one reads the Equal Status Act 2000, on page 20, section 14 outlines certain measures and activities that are not prohibited.

In February 2013 the Government decided to close both the mobility allowance and the motorised transport grant schemes following reports of the Ombudsman in 2011 and 2012 regarding their legal status in the context of the Equal Status Acts.  Since the closure of the mobility allowance scheme, the Government has directed that the Health Service Executive should continue to pay an equivalent monthly payment to the now 4,133 individuals, then 4,700, pending the establishment of a new transport support scheme.<\/p> <p>A review group on transport supports for people with disabilities, which was chaired independently, was established in 2013.  Membership of the review group comprised representatives of Government Departments, the National Disability Authority and stakeholder organisations, including the Irish Wheelchair Association, the Disability Federation of Ireland and the Centre for Independent Living, among others.  Informed by the work of that group, the Government decided in May 2013 that new statutory provisions would be established to provide individual payments to people with severe disabilities who require additional income to address the cost of their mobility needs.<\/p> <p>The Government also decided at that time that the details of the new statutory provisions should be worked out by an interdepartmental group to be chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach.  The interdepartmental group comprised representatives of Departments and the National Disability Authority.  On foot of the work of the interdepartmental group, the Government decided in November 2013 that the detailed preparatory work required for the scheme and associated legislation would be progressed by the Minister for Health in consultation with other relevant Ministers on a priority basis.<\/p> <p>In line with the Government decision, the Department of Health has been working to develop legislative proposals for a new transport support scheme.  The Senator will be aware that A Programme for a Partnership Government acknowledges the ongoing drafting of primary legislation for a new transport support scheme to assist those with a disability to meet their mobility costs.  A general scheme and heads of Bill was completed in draft form and has been subject to detailed legal examination, given the complex legal issues which arose in the operation of previous arrangements.  In December 2016, this draft general scheme and heads of Bill was circulated to other Departments and was the subject of consultation between officials in the Department of Health and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.<\/p> <p>The House will appreciate that it has been necessary to estimate both the numbers likely to qualify for payment and the likely overall cost of the proposals.  I can confirm that work on the policy proposals for a new scheme is at an advanced stage.  The legislative proposals for the scheme seek to ensure the following: there is a firm statutory basis to the scheme&rsquo;s operation; there is transparency and equity in the eligibility criteria attaching to the scheme; resources are targeted at those with the greatest needs; and the scheme is capable of being costed and is affordable on its introduction and on an ongoing basis.  It is hoped to bring a revised general scheme and heads of Bill to Government shortly in seeking Government approval for the drafting of a Bill for the new transport support payment.  The health (transport support) Bill is on the list of priority legislation for publication in the spring-summer session of 2018.<\/p> <p>In the meantime, the Department of Health has maintained contact with the Ombudsman in regard to this matter and Department officials have recently met with officials from the Office of the Ombudsman.  The Department has also had ongoing contact with the National Disability Authority on the issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018021400002#D00200","speaker":"1261"},{"type":"speech","time":1518604200,"counter":38,"content":"<p>Go raibh maith agat.  We have heard about the work that went on throughout 2013, culminating in the interdepartmental group that was chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach coming to its conclusion in November of that year and the recommendations to the Department of Health.  We move down a few lines in the Minister of State's statement and, next thing, we are in December 2016.  He then goes on to state, \"The House will appreciate that it has been necessary to estimate both the numbers likely to qualify for payment...\".  That is interesting, given it is part of the engagement between the Department of Health and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, and I am sure there would be tensions there.  However, the reply from the Minister of State states they could not estimate how many people have lost out on the current scheme, when there are 35 to 40 years of trends available and they know the number is going down each year.  I find it puzzling that the Department could not or would not tell us that real people have been losing out year by year on the current scheme.  We are being told the Department of Health will provide comfort to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform about the number of people who are likely to benefit from a scheme we have never seen and that has never been piloted.<\/p> <p>This scheme was brought in back in 1979.  At the time, we had never heard the language of \"personalised budget\", \"money follows the person\" and all of those things, but that is precisely what it was - a simply administered scheme that people had to apply for and which was means tested.  Someone got money into their pocket and they could use a variety of different methodologies to make it work for them.  It is absolutely crazy and ironic that a Government - this was done by the previous Administration and we have had another one for almost the last two years - would abolish a scheme that was about what we are now told is the new policy.  That is exactly what this was doing for over three decades.  There was a very simple device at the time, namely, to put a clause or section into some other piece of health legislation and copper-fasten that until the changes were made.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018021400002#D00300","speaker":"1419"},{"type":"speech","time":1518604200,"counter":39,"content":"<p>I fully acknowledge there has been a protracted period since the problems with the mobility scheme were first highlighted.

The Members of the House will appreciate that we cannot pre-empt the outcome of the Government's considerations.

As he is aware, many towns in the Border region suffered due to the Troubles in Northern Ireland and while, thankfully, that day is now very much in the past, it has left a devastation in many towns.  For example, it is fair to say that, in County Monaghan, no town has suffered as much as Clones.  Given its close proximity to the Border, Clones had many roads closed during the Troubles and, indeed, those that were open to those wishing to visit Clones were subject to military checkpoints and the delays that come with that.  As a result, many businesses have suffered down through the years.<\/p> <p>Thankfully, however, the people of Clones have kept the light on and they are fighting back, and they are a very resilient people.  One of the shining lights, if I can use that expression, during all of the darks days has been St. Tiernach's Park in Clones, where the Ulster football final is held every year.  The first final dates back to 1906.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Robbie Gallagher:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2471\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2471&amp;amp;pid=RobbieGallagher&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=14\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->On that day, Monaghan overcame the Gaels of Antrim to win the Ulster final in Clones.  Since then, thousands of people have visited the facility every July for what is one of the great sporting occasions of the year.  It is fair to say that it has been recognised by commentators the length and breadth of the country that no venue can match what Clones has to offer on Ulster final day.  The Minister of State is a good Kerryman so might argue with that.  Most neutral observers would say that because of the narrow streets and warm welcome the people of Clones offer to all visitors from Ulster and further afield on that day, it is a unique occasion and one to be experienced.  I know Kerry is quite busy at that time of year, but I would like to invite the Minister of State to this year's Ulster final so that he might experience this unique occasion for himself.<\/p><p>The Government has allocated &euro;50 million to upgrade football stadiums throughout the country.  I am making a case for St. Tiernach's Park in Clones.  It is a fabulous facility capable of holding over 30,000 people, which is a sizeable amount.  I understand it is the eighth largest stadium in the country.  It needs refurbishment and the facilities it has to offer need a lift.  I would like to make a strong case for the Minister of State to seriously consider St. Tiernach's Park for funding for an upgrade.  It has the potential to become a regional centre.<\/p><p>Clones recently opened a new peace park which is a fantastic sporting facility that adds to the many things it has to offer.  We now need some money from the Minister of State so that we can upgrade the facilities.  It is not just that Clones will look after the people of Monaghan and Ulster, it can also cater for events that would attract individuals from across the entire country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018021400002#D00500","speaker":"1396","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1518604200,"counter":43,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Gallagher.  I very much appreciate him raising this important matter.<\/p> <p>The venue in question is synonymous with everything that constitutes Ulster football.  As the Senator said, the Ulster final is one of the great occasions on the football calendar.  What is special about a facility such as St. Tiernach's Park is the fact it is a town-centre facility and it helps create a fantastic feeling and experience for people on the day of the final.  I am very familiar with Fitzgerald Stadium in Killarney, which offers quite a similar experience.  I was in Mullingar yesterday and visited Cusack Park.  The point was made that it is also located near the town centre.  These types of stadium give events an exceptional feel because they are located in the middle of towns, which benefits local economies and creates a festive atmosphere.<\/p> <p>I visited Clones in September at the request of the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Heather Humphreys, and was accompanied on the day by the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Shane Ross, and members of the Monaghan county board, the Ulster council and the &aacute;rd sti&uacute;rth&oacute;ir, P&aacute;raic Duffy.  I saw first hand the situation there and agreed that there needs to be investment, in particular on the health and safety front.  A number of other areas also require investment.  This is something I would like to see go ahead.<\/p> <p>We were brought to the Peace Link to see the fantastic facility that has been developed in very close proximity to St. Tiernach's Park.  It is a very impressive and is an excellent facility.  When one stands on the track and looks to the left, one can see that the Football Association of Ireland, FAI, is developing facilities for the area.  Clones has a great opportunity to become a fantastic sports hub.  Everything is within walking distance.  We put funding into the area and want to do so in the future.<\/p> <p>The most recent sports capital programme delivered &euro;60 million throughout the country for over 1,800 successful applications.  We know the funding requirement for St. Tiernach's Park is higher than the threshold for the regional or local sports capital programme.  Projects like this and other projects which are seeking large investment from the State to be met, in most cases, with investment from sporting, voluntary or community bodies point to the need for a larger scale project scheme.  That is why the Minister, Deputy Ross, and I campaigned for the introduction of a new large scale project scheme in the most recent budget. <\/p> <p>We were able to secure &euro;50 million which can be drawn down from 2019 to 2021.  We are in the process of drawing up the scheme.  We are considering all of the terms and conditions, how the scheme could be administered and what the best use of public money would be in respect of the scheme.  It may be one which is suitable for St. Tiernach's Park at some stage.  I hope to open the scheme in the coming months.  It is something I am very anxious to see proceed because there are many facilities around the country which require large investment from the State.  They are now waiting to progress their applications and I am keen to see those projects going ahead.<\/p> <p>This is something I know is critically important in the overall scheme of things in terms of economics.  What the State might invest in St. Tiernach's Park would be matched by the economy of this jurisdiction with one, two or three Ulster finals.  The economics of the project make sense.  As the Senator pointed out, we have to acknowledge that this area along the Border was devastated for over three decades during the Troubles and needs additional help even now, 20 years on from the Good Friday agreement.  Catching up needs to be done in certain areas. <\/p> <p>As Minister of State with special responsibility for sport, I want to be able to assist in whatever way I can.  This matter is very much on our radar.  As I said, when I visited the area in September with the Ministers, Deputies Heather Humphreys and Ross, I saw, at first hand, what needs to be done and how there is a compelling argument for the investment to be made.  I know the project has the backing of the county board, the Ulster council and the &aacute;rd sti&uacute;rth&oacute;ir in terms of it being a priority for the GAA.  We intend to pursue the project and find the correct avenue as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018021400002#E00200","speaker":"1318"},{"type":"speech","time":1518604200,"counter":44,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his contribution, to which I was very heartened to listen.

One cannot underestimate the economic benefits that the Ulster final brings to a town like Clones.  Local people have embraced with open arms the visitors who come to Clones on Ulster final day.

Some people receive very little communication and a small gesture like this can go a very long way.<\/p> <p>Many of us have raised the issue of divestment from church-run schools to Educate Together schools.  This affects the Canal Way Educate Together school in Basin Lane.  I have raised this in correspondence with the Minister for Education and Skills but no satisfactory solution has been reached.  The school was established as a two-stream school and has been located in its current premises since 2014.  Due to its success, there is an increased demand for places and the waiting lists are very long.  Unfortunately, this demand has resulted in a severe accommodation problem.  As a result, the school has been forced to offer only a single stream to new junior infants for the coming intake in 2018 and could have no space for a junior infants class in 2019.  There is a clear and desperate need for further classrooms to be installed to adequately accommodate the needs of the local community and those of the parents who wish to send their children to these schools.  <\/p> <p>It has been brought to my attention that in this school, there is no special education teaching centre and it is reported that the school has only half the required number of toilets to meet the needs of the students.  The lease on the school is so short that investment is difficult.  This stems from a failure in the divestment process.  Caveats placed on divested schools have been raised in this House.  The Department of Education and Skills needs to examine Educate Together schools and the divestment process and act pragmatically to ensure that parents who wish to send their children to particular schools are allowed to do so, that these schools are facilitated and children are accommodated.  We need to do this urgently because parents are waiting for places for their children in 2019 and they do not know if there will be room in certain schools.  <\/p> <p>Today, very important statements on Brexit are being made in the UK and in Europe.  An independent study, published today by Copenhagen Economics, examined the impact of Brexit on Ireland.  It finds that our economy will grow by 7% less than it would without Brexit in the worst-case scenario and by 2.8% less in the best-case scenario.  We have already seen the consequences of Brexit.  Senator Gallagher successfully amended the Order of Business due to the possible closure of a Kerry Foods plant in County Monaghan.  Worryingly, the report also said that Brexit will have a negative impact on Irish wages for all skills groups.  One scenario shows that real wages will be 8.7% below the 2030 non-Brexit scenario.  <\/p> <p>I welcome the new Brexit website, albeit that it is quite late.  I would like to see proper policy decisions for small and medium sized enterprises, SMEs and larger enterprises.  I have a small business in Crumlin and have had no interaction with the Government on how to Brexit-proof my business.  The Government needs to make practical efforts and policy changes to mitigate the possible losses that will accrue when Brexit goes ahead. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018021400002#G00300","speaker":"1407"},{"type":"speech","time":1518604200,"counter":49,"content":"<p>It is my understanding that the national planning framework must be approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas.

It was humans versus the computer, but they coded the entire programme themselves.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018021400002#H00800","speaker":"1384"},{"type":"speech","time":1518604200,"counter":58,"content":"<p>Who won?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018021400002#H00900","speaker":"1392"},{"type":"speech","time":1518604200,"counter":59,"content":"<p>It is a very positive development that the STEM subjects are being highlighted at primary school level.<\/p> <p>On a different note, I had the pleasure of visiting Troy Studios in Limerick last Monday along with some of my colleagues where \"Nightflyers\", which will be released on Netflix in the summer, is being filmed.  It is a very good news story in that more than 400 people are employed in Troy Studios.  It is an up and coming film studio.  It was pointed out to us that the height of the ceiling allows them to higher and lower the stage and the cameras.  They sometimes have cameras that have to come in overhead.  It is conducive, therefore, to making films such as this one.  It was very interesting to see the way the set is put together because when one is looking at something that is supposed to be in the future, and it is a science-based film, it is as if the corridors extend for miles yet they are very short.  It is amazing what they can do with imagery and special effects.  I congratulate all those involved because it has given local employment to dressmakers, painters, carpenters and students, which is very much welcomed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018021400002#H01000","speaker":"1384"},{"type":"speech","time":1518604200,"counter":60,"content":"<p>I wish to raise the topic of the charity sector.  We saw the alarming situation in Oxfam UK where the chief of operations in Haiti, Ronald Van Hauwermeiren, was relocated to Bangladesh after the natural disaster for admitting to having prostitutes in an Oxfam sponsored home in Haiti.  That is a violation that occurs every day of the week but in the aftermath of a disaster, it is totally disgraceful.  I ask the Leader to invite the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to the House soon to discuss the charity sector in Ireland and to ensure that the charities regulator has adequate resources to combat any activity that may be happening in our charity sector.  I understand Oxfam Ireland has distanced itself completely from the activities of this gentleman who used to work for Oxfam UK.  He has been moved on to another aid agency in Bangladesh.  He was not sacked.  He should have been sacked but to protect the reputation of the charity, his job was protected in that he was moved on to a different agency, which is disgraceful.  I want to know if our charities regulator has the powers it needs to combat such activity?  Are we depending on whistleblowers or undercover reporters to uncover such activity?  I would like to Leader to facilitate a debate on this matter and invite the Minister to the House.<\/p> <p>I add my support for comments made yesterday by Senators from across the House regarding female genital mutilation.

To his eternal credit, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin introduced the smoking ban in pubs, which was revolutionary at the time.  Our colleague, Senator Reilly, accepted a Private Members' Bill that banned smoking in cars when young children are present.  I think we should go a step further by banning smoking at bus stops, outside railway stations and within a certain distance of the front gates of schools, community centres and youth clubs.  Vulnerable people and others should not have to contend with cigarette smoke when walking out the gates of public buildings.  No parent with a child should have to pass a group of people smoking when walking out the gate of the school.  I am seriously considering introducing a Private Members' Bill that would ban smoking within a certain distance of schools, bus stops, hospitals and other community and voluntary facilities.  We have achieved a lot through the introduction of no-smoking zones, but we still have some distance to go.

I remember moments in Irish history, such as the signing of the Anglo-Irish Agreement, the signing of the Good Friday Agreement, the visit of the Queen to the Republic and the visit of the President to the United Kingdom.  We need another such moment now and, in that context, I suggest we need to look at the east-west relationship.  It is obvious that the two main parties in Northern Ireland are not going to reach a deal to restore the institutions at Stormont.  I would like to propose five solutions.  First, two seats are available in the Seanad.  There should be a unionist person sitting in the House.  I think that would send out a signal of inclusion.

Fourth, the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly has provided huge opportunities to parliamentarians from Britain and Ireland and the North-South Interparliamentary Association has been meeting since October 2012.  It has gone under the radar and unannounced that MLAs from the DUP have been sitting in the Seanad Chamber for the past five years.  We have sat in Stormont.  We meet every six months.  We need to look at enhancing all of these good and positive things.  Perhaps they have been done under the radar because it was politically correct to do so.  We need to send out a signal that we have met and we will meet.  Fifth, we must look at the east-west relationship.  We must set up an Oireachtas-Westminster group, along the lines of the North-South Interparliamentary Association, to try to break this logjam.

Five or six families have said they will leave the island come 31 March if this is not resolved.  This would take five or six families from a population of 119 people.  The Government is talking this week about protecting rural Ireland and launching the national planning framework while at the same time presiding over shocking treatment and a tender process that is clearly neither efficient nor effective and does not represent value for money for the taxpayer.  I therefore ask the Leader to call the Minister of State and Government Chief Whip before the House to explain what the hell is going on with this service because it is clearly not good enough.  It is wrong for a Government Minister of State to go around willy-nilly allocating and promising money to build up people's hopes while the people whom he is trying to fool have their lives to live on an island 9 miles off our coast.  It is totally unacceptable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018021400002#K01000","speaker":"1382"},{"type":"speech","time":1518604200,"counter":94,"content":"<p>Well said.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018021400002#K01100","speaker":"1388"},{"type":"speech","time":1518604200,"counter":95,"content":"<p>It reminds me of a pre-Magna Carta Latin phrase, <i>contra proferentem<\/i>.

The conference was in recognition of the fact that the Council of Europe has recognised PDFORRA's submission to register as a trade union.  The Government has opposed such registration.  I remind the Government side that it was the late, great Brian Lenihan Snr. who brought about the recognition of PDFORRA and the Representative Association of Commissioned Officers, RACO, in the late 1980s.  The measure resulted in these representative bodies, which are very active.  To give this matter proper airing - I am sure Senator Craughwell will agree with me - it would be appropriate that the Leader arranges a discussion on this important issue.  We have plenty of time but I cannot outline all of the intricacies of the matter.  Basically, the Council of Europe committee has stated that PDFORRA is entitled to be registered as a trade union with ICTU and to negotiate on behalf of its members.  Senator Craughwell will agree with me that the pay and conditions for the armed forces is not in keeping with the demands placed on them and the risks that they take on behalf of Irish citizens.<\/p> <p>I compliment Mr. Mark Keane, president of PDFORRA, Mr. Emmanuel Jacob, president of the European Organisation of Military Associations, EUROMIL, Mr. Gerry Rooney, former general secretary of PDFORRA and Mr. Gerard Guinan, general secretary of PDFORRA, on their work and commitment to this matter.  I also wish to place on record that PDFORRA is part of the nominating body for Senator Craughwell and me and we have declared our interest in this matter.  Senator Craughwell has been very active, as a former member of every defence force in Europe that I could fit in - definitely at least two of them - which is rather rare.  He is an exception.  What an achievement.  He has survived both of the organisations, which is a great achievement.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018021400002#L02200","speaker":"1393"},{"type":"speech","time":1518604200,"counter":125,"content":"<p>They were both in the British Isles to coin a phrase.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018021400002#L02300","speaker":"1392"},{"type":"speech","time":1518604200,"counter":126,"content":"<p>I hope that the Leader will consider my request to arrange a debate on this very important issue.

Given that the news from the North this morning is not encouraging, and from the DUP in particular, an east-west dimension would be well worth pursuing.  It could be valuable because there are people short of enlightenment over there.  In terms of Brexit, it is in our interest to have an east-west dimension and a proper all-encompassing free trade agreement between the UK and the EU.  While the UK does not want to say whether it will be part of the customs union or the Single Market, whatever it is called it has to be negotiated.  The UK must be reminded that there are more then legal niceties - obligations - to be complied with and observed in leaving as much as when joining.  That aspect does not seem to have fully dawned on them.  We await the speeches that will commence today with the UK's Foreign Secretary, Boris Johnson, to see what, if anything, they have learned.  Hopefully, there will be some enlightenment.  In the medium term, Senator Feighan's proposal to have an east-west dimension and link between these Houses and Westminster would prove valuable and might counter some of the forces over there that do not work in our interests.

I noted from Senator Noone that in Taiwan today love symbols have been put up on traffic lights.  Perhaps we could start doing that around here as well.<\/p> <p>I join with Senator Ardagh in agreeing with the need for all of us, as citizens of a republic and as residents of communities, to make sure that no person is isolated or feeling lonely today.  The taskforce she has called for is a good idea.  Perhaps we do not need a taskforce; it is a matter of all of us extending the hand of friendship and checking in on neighbours to make sure everything is okay.  It is an important suggestion.  <\/p> <p>The issue of Educate Together schools, raised by Senators &Oacute; Riord&aacute;n and Ardagh, is important.  I am not familiar with the Canal Way Educate Together school.  The context is that the Government has committed, as per the programme for Government commitment, to reach 400 multi-denominational schools by 2030.  The world is changing.  It is ironic that today is Ash Wednesday, and that those who are from a faith community can begin a spiritual journey today.  As a society, as a Government and a State, we have to recognise that we are in a changing world and that families should be able to have choice in the education system.  The Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Bruton, is committed to this, and has announced plans to accelerate the provision of multi-denominational schools.  We want to learn from the previous announcement under former Minister for Education, Ruair&iacute; Quinn, where ten schools transferred to multi-denominational patronage.  On the five schools that Senator &Oacute; Riord&aacute;n referenced yesterday and again today, and which Senator Ardagh also mentioned, there is a need to ensure that the correct process is engaged in.  It is important that certainty is provided to the teaching staff and parents, and that we can offer choice to all people who want to go to Educate Together schools.  I am a firm advocate and strong believer in Educate Together.  I see such schools in my own city of Cork, where they are providing tremendous education to young people, in a different model from what we were used to as students and teachers.  It works.  We must learn from the mistakes of the past and deliver more multi-denominational and non-denominational schools.  That is what the Minister is going to do.  The Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Bruton, will come to the House in the coming weeks.  He is committed to it.  He is finalising plans with education and training boards, ETBs, to commence surveys of preschool parents.  It is fair to say that both this Government and the last Government have been committed to delivering on the Educate Together model.  <\/p> <p>The subject of Brexit is not going to go away.  It is a very important topic.  Senator Norris posed a very good, even jocose, question today, asking if it will ever even happen.  That is a question that the British Government-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018021400002#M02100","speaker":"1391"},{"type":"speech","time":1518604200,"counter":157,"content":"<p>I hope it does not happen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018021400002#M02200","speaker":"1392"},{"type":"speech","time":1518604200,"counter":158,"content":"<p>We hope it does not happen.

The report Senator Ardagh mentioned, the Copenhagen Economics study, was commissioned by the Government, and the Government is already taking steps to ensure that the impact of Brexit is minimised.  Therein lies the question: how will we know what the real impact of Brexit will be until we see the final outcome?  The T&aacute;naiste, the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy McEntee, and the Taoiseach have been very strong across Europe, as was iar-Thaoiseach, Deputy Kenny, on the views of Government.  The report commissioned by Government is there to guide and help us to prevent the worst from happening.  It is important to recognise that the Government is taking action, despite what Senator Ardagh says.  It has already taken steps to prepare the economy.  If one looks at budget 2018, we have the Action Plan for Jobs in the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, a new Brexit website, the rolling out of the Brexit loan scheme worth up to &euro;300 million, including the development of a longer-term loan scheme, and the announcement of a &euro;25 million response loan scheme for the agrifood sector, along with the provision of a range of grants and incentives to businesses.  I appeal to Senator Ardagh to bring her business to the local enterprise office to find out about these schemes and engage with them, if she has not already done so.<\/p> <p>Brexit is important, and that is why this House supported the continuation of the Seanad Committee on the Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union engagemtn north, south, east and west.  Senator Feighan referenced this as it concerns the North.  That is important, and we will have an ongoing debate about Brexit in this House.  It is important to ensure that Government is ready, and it is being proactive.  <\/p> <p>Senator Boyhan raised the issue of the national planning framework, as did Senator Wilson.  I am happy to have a debate on the plan when it is published on Friday.  In response to Senator Boyhan's direct comment, my information - and if I am wrong I am happy to stand corrected - is that no vote is required for the national planning framework plan.  We certainly will have debate on the matter in the House.  I have no issue with that.  It was never intended that there would be a final vote on the development plan.  There has been engagement and consultation with all sides of the House.  Members of this House made submissions.  The important point now, in the context of Senator Davitt's contribution on the national development framework and national plan, is to ensure that the regions benefit from such a plan with the investment that so many Senators call for every day.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Jerry Buttimer:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=14\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->What we are doing in the national development plan is investing so that we can have opportunities for people to grow businesses and create jobs in areas outside of Dublin, be it in Mullingar, Athlone, Cork, Carlow, Cavan, Roscommon, Limerick or wherever.

It is an ambitious plan for our country and I hope that we will all get behind it, wear the green jersey and put aside the narrow focus of our parochial interests.

I also congratulate those at Troy Studios on their success.  It shows that there is innovation and creativity in the schools.  We commend our teachers, the students and their families.  With &quot;The Young Offenders&quot;, we have witnessed the success of our film sector and here is another good news story.<\/p><p>Senator Swanick raised a very important issue about the charity sector and Oxfam in particular.  I am not fully aware of the complete story but I read some of it and heard a little about it on Sky News yesterday.  The Senator is right in making his points about the charity sector.  I am glad that Oxfam Ireland has disassociated from the mother ship, if I can put it that way, in terms of what has happened.<\/p><p>Senators Swanick and Noone raised the issue of female genital mutilation or circumcision.  I agree with them.  As I said on yesterday's Order of Business, it is not a medical procedure.  It is inhumane and barbaric treatment of women and it is wrong.  We should all stand united in our condemnation of it and work to change the mindset of some people.  I know others of the Islamic faith have a different viewpoint on the practice and we welcome that.<\/p><p>Senators Craughwell and Leyden referred to PDFORRA and the case in the European Union on the acknowledgement of its members' rights.  I welcome that and congratulate PDFORRA.  Mark Keane is a very fine person whom I know well.  We all accept that there should be collective bargaining.  That is important.  I hope that as a consequence of this ruling the Department, the Minister and those in the Army and Navy will co-ordinate to implement the outcome.  I am not familiar with the case of the <i>L&Eacute; Cliona<\/i>which the Senator raised.  He raised it in the House and had spoken to me about it already.  I am happy to meet him, talk about it and, as I said, take the matter to the Minister.<\/p><p>Senator Martin Conway raised the issue of reusable coffee cups.  We all welcome any progress in that regard.  On tobacco-free Ireland and Ash Wednesday, it should be the aspiration of all of us to have a tobacco-free Ireland and to encourage people to stop smoking.  An old advertisement was played on &quot;Morning Ireland&quot;, the purpose of which was to try to encourage women to smoke.  We should all work together to make sure that big tobacco does not recruit more young people, and young women in particular, to smoking because tobacco is dangerous and causes cancer.  We should all stand united on that.<\/p><p>Senator Grace O'Sullivan raised the issue of the cath lab in Waterford.  I know there was a protest last Saturday.  I would be happy to have the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, come to the House.  A national review of cardiac specialist services is taking place.  I know that the mobile cath lab in Waterford is continuing to operate and that Senators Grace O'Sullivan and Coffey have been very proactive on the matter.  I would be happy to have the Minister come to the House to discuss the wider issue of health.  I will come back to him on it because it is an issue which is prevalent on the Order of Business most days.<\/p><p>Senators Feighan, &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in and Coghlan referred to the North.  I appeal to all of those involved in the talks to negotiate and reach an agreement.  The impasse has remained for far too long, from last year's elections up until now.  There is a need for devolved government in the North of our country.  I know that Senators Feighan and Craughwell were in Glencree yesterday.  We need to ensure that we have a government to represent the people of the North at a very critical time in terms of the Brexit talks and in the context of the need for a devolved government in the North.  There is a duty on all sides.  Senator &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in is right.  It is about meeting in the middle, whether on the proposed Irish language legislation or marriage equality, and about getting an outcome that is to the benefit of the people.  I would say to our unionist friends in the North that there is nothing to fear from an Irish language Act.  I would ask them to work with us to ensure that we can have our own language and culture preserved and protected.  Equally, there is nothing to fear from marriage equality.  I ask Sinn F&eacute;in to move with the unionists on certain issues.  Let us have a government that can work for the people at a critical time.<\/p><p>I also join with Senators &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in and Feighan in their comments.  Although we have no role in how Senators are elected to the House, we have been well served by unionist Members.

It is built.  It is in use to a limited extent to provide vital transatlantic connectivity for a multinational company.  It is poised to meet its full potential and the Bill before the House is the key to the fulfilment of that ambition.<\/p> <p>The Bill has two principal objectives.  The first is to give rights of access to private lands through which the ducting and cables pass so that those managing the network, the MSE, or managed service entity, will be able to fully maintain and operate the network.  The second is to minimise impacts to landowners along the route and to provide compensation and safeguards to those landowners arising from the use of their land.  I propose to address each of these objectives in turn.<\/p> <p>First, I will address the proposal to provide rights of access to all lands through which the Galway-Mayo ducting passes.  In 2005, during the planning of the Galway-Mayo gas pipeline by Bord G&aacute;is Eireann, BGE, now Gas Networks Ireland, GNI, my predecessor funded the installation of underground telecommunications ducting alongside the pipeline.  The pipeline and ducting were installed between Ballymoneen in County Galway and the new gas terminal constructed in Bellanaboy County Mayo.  Construction took place between 2006 and 2008.  In 2013 Shell E&amp;P Ireland Ltd, or SEPIL, proposed to install fibre optic cable into the duct and to gift this to the State.  This process concludes in the first quarter of 2018.  The ducting and cables traverse approximately 500 separate interests in land.  GNI managed the ducting build and managed access to private lands for that purpose, and also for the laying of the optical fibre cable.  GNI  acquired access rights over the majority of the private lands but not all.  While the network is built, it cannot be fully managed. maintained or upgraded without securing access rights to all lands along the full route of the ducting and cables.<\/p> <p>Section 2 of the Bill is the section that provides the Minister, and consequently the MSE, with the necessary rights to enter lands for the purposes of running the Galway-Mayo ducting and cables network  These access rights are described in Schedules 1 and 2 and are limited to those which are necessary to properly manage the ducting and cables network for telecommunications purposes.  They are subject also to the obligations contained in Schedule 3.<\/p> <p>The access rights acquired by GNI on my behalf stand vested in me by virtue of section 2(2) while access to all other lands along and adjacent to the route are granted to me under section 2(3).  GNl's rights stand protected by section 2(4), which ensures that GNI&rsquo;s other access rights over the lands, such as access to the gas pipeline, are unaffected, and also section 2(5), which releases GNI from any obligations entered into in regard to the access rights acquired by GNI on behalf of the Minister under subsection 2.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Se&aacute;n Kyne:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2343\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2343&amp;amp;pid=SeanKyne&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=14\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Turning now to the matter of protecting landowner interests, sections 3 and 4 provide compensation and safeguards to landowners and ensure that any impacts arising from the presence and operation of the network are minimised.  Section 3 provides for a claim for compensation by landowners in respect of any diminution in the value of their land arising as a consequence of the Minister's right of access to the land to tend to the ducting and cables.  It provides all landowners along the route with the right to claim compensation on the same terms while also taking account of any moneys already paid as compensation by GNI.<\/p><p>Section 4 is broader in scope.  It provides for a compensation scheme to be established in law to reimburse owners or repair damages caused by the MSE or others working on my behalf.  This scheme also provides for landowners to be compensated for any such damages or any injury, loss or disturbance suffered by the owner and caused by the MSE or others in the performance of their duties.  This scheme or any amended schemes will continue to operate for the entire lifetime of the ducting and cables.  Section 4 also provides for regulations which set out the rules to be followed by the MSE and others working on my behalf in order to ensure minimal disruption to landowners and so that they are given adequate notice when works are planned.<\/p><p>Other safeguards also exist.  Section 7 requires a map of the route be deposited in my offices and made available for inspection by all interested parties.  Section 8 ensures that information is given to all landowners and interested parties at least 28 days before enactment and including details of the legislation, the deposited map and how and where to make claims for compensation under section 3.  Section 9 sets the procedures to ensure that all notices are delivered to the intended parties.<\/p><p>T&aacute; an g&aacute;s &oacute; gh&aacute;scheantar na Coiribe ina bhunt&aacute;iste don t&iacute;r toisc nach bhfuil muid ag brath go huile agus go hiomlan ar gh&aacute;s iomp&oacute;rt&aacute;ilte.

I welcome the Bill and will not delay its passage through the House because it is a very important Bill.  Is this a retrospective provision?  The ducting is there but there was no legislative authority to provide it through private property, which is the norm.  I understand that the gas network would have had legislative authority to lay its pipes.  This was an additional idea to provide the ducting which I would fully concur with.  The Bill does not seem to involve the purchase of private lands but the establishment of a right of way over private lands to maintain the ducting.  I understand that &euro;90,000 has already been paid in compensation to 500 farmers along that route.  The Department is providing for &euro;200,000 in further compensation.  What exactly is the compensation for?  If the pipes have been laid and backfilled was there much damage to the properties involved?  I presume compensation was paid by GNI for the laying of the pipework.<\/p> <p>In July 2017 Fianna F&aacute;il introduced the Planning and Development (Rapid Broadband) Bill 2017, which provided a consistent and streamlined framework for the development and sharing of broadband infrastructure in Ireland.  If enacted this Bill would make it much easier for operators to find and share existing broadband infrastructure, making it more convenient and efficient to provide services to areas not serviced at the moment by requiring new roads and buildings to have fibre optic ready ducting in place.  The Bill would also help to bring Ireland's planning laws into the digital age and speed up the roll-out of broadband.  I suggest that the Minister of State examine that.<\/p> <p>There is quite a lot of ducting laid and I can never figure out exactly who owns what, where and when.  Some years ago ducting was laid in a ring around Roscommon and connected up, whether to the Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann lines adjoining them or through the ESB I do not know.  There is much confusion about this.  The broadband connection to the Oireachtas provided to Members from a designated office in our areas comes through the Eir copper wire instead of fibre optic cable.  I understand there is a fibre optic cable around Roscommon which would be more efficient. <\/p> <p>I regard this as retrospective legislation which is not a very good idea.  Somebody somewhere did not feel it necessary to have separate legislation for the ducting but when the matter was examined the question of compensation arose which could not be paid out unless there was legislation to allow the Exchequer to do so.  I hope this does not create a precedent that would allow the Minister and Department to issue approval to private wind operators giving them rights over properties to bring electric power to the nearest major electricity infrastructure.  That is one factor we have resisted in respect of the provision of wind turbines in our beautiful, scenic, tourism area.  The developers would not have the necessary legislative approval to bring overhead wires over private property.  That power rests with the ESB.  I hope this is not a back door approach to allowing these rights develop for multinational companies to put pylons on private property with no political oversight.  I welcome the Bill.  Fianna F&aacute;il supports it and wants to see it passed as quickly as possible. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018021400002#P00200","speaker":"1393"},{"type":"speech","time":1518604200,"counter":254,"content":"<p>I welcome this important Bill.  In respect of wayleave agreements, and in particular access to broadband, it is important that where we do work of any description we should ensure that we also put in ducting for additional services that may be required in the future.  When I was Lord Mayor of Cork city in 2003 and 2004 and we did major work on Patrick Street we insisted on an adequate amount of ducting being put in place, with agreements signed by all the utilities.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Colm Burke:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2353\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2353&amp;amp;pid=ColmBurke&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=14\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We invited them to put ducting in place so that the street would not need to be excavated again for a long period of time.  It is important that ducting is put in place in any urban development.  This is about providing an additional service along a gas line where ducting is already in place and the need for legislation.<\/p><p>When wayleave agreements are put in place it is important that we work towards making sure additional services can be planned for.  We have not done that in the past and we now need to do so.  Likewise, when we are building new road infrastructure we should also invite utility companies to discuss whether they want to install ducting in order to plan for the future.  Local authorities or the National Roads Authority could install it, and recover the cost of same by granting a licence for the use of that ducting.  We are not doing enough in that regard.<\/p><p>I welcome the Bill which is now getting over a legal issue that needs to be resolved.  It is important that there is adequate compensation for those who have wayleaves going through their lands.  It is not just the case that lands may be disturbed; once a wayleave is put in place there is also a restriction on the landowner in terms of what can be done on the land.  A landowner cannot erect permanent buildings or may have difficulties in running other services through the land.  That has to be taken into account.  That is the reason the compensation element has to be put in place.  It is important that recognition is given to that.  People do not realise that wayleave agreements create restrictions and it is important that all utility companies make sure that landowners are consulted and take legal advice, and utility companies provide for the cost of that legal advice.<\/p><p>An issue which arises in respect of getting wayleave agreements is a difficulty with titles.  I have dealt with a number of cases where estates have not been administered when a person is registered as an owner despite the person having been dead for 30, 40 or 50 years.  That causes problems and delays in finalising the process because no one can sign a wayleave until a grant of administration has been taken out.  A person working in a legal capacity has to sign the documents.  We are not doing enough to make sure that when someone dies who is the owner of a property, the estate is administered and the proper legal processes are followed.  This problem can cause delays with putting services in place because there are no legal agreements and the person concerned does not have title to sign the required documents.<\/p><p>I dealt with a case involving Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann going back to 1965.  A number of people had died between 1965 and 2005 and we had to deal with seven different administrations while trying to sort out the legal issues before we could sign the documents and a final agreement with Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann.  They are issues that arise from time to time.  It is important that the Bill is passed, the necessary legal entitlements are put in place and there is adequate compensation for the people affected by wayleave agreements.  I again thank the Minister of State for bringing the Bill forward to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018021400002#P00300","speaker":"1409","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1518604200,"counter":256,"content":"<p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it agus gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis as an reachta&iacute;ocht seo a lagadh os &aacute;r gcomhair.

Sinn F&eacute;in has asked the Government to explore the possibility of progressing the national broadband plan, which I presume is a State broadband plan, through State ownership, given the disarray which exists in the procurement process.  There is only one bidder left and this leaves the entire plan in utter chaos. <\/p> <p>The effects of the decision to privatise the State company Telecom &Eacute;ireann in the past has had a negative impact on citizens and telecommunications services.  State ownership would have facilitated a less complex and possibly less expensive roll-out of broadband and broadband services. There are many possibilities open to the Government now to continue the roll-out of high-speed broadband, including gas lines, railway lines and main haul lines which have already been completed.  All of these could be used to bring high-speed broadband to areas which in 2018 have no regular and reliable access to high-speed broadband services.<\/p> <p>We have asked that the Government explores the feasibility of using existing State infrastructure held by the ESB for the future roll-out of broadband.  I see in the briefing note from the Department that it is stated that Shell EP will gift fibre optic connection to the State in 2018.  Who shouldered the vast majority of the cost of building the duct in the first place?  Is this really a gift and will the State benefit?  What impact will the Bill have on the national broadband plan?  The programme for Government has a commitment to provide broadband to every house and business in the country - I presume it means State - by 2020.

I also welcome the Bill which will formalise the situation in respect of fibre optic cables running from Killala to Galway.  This was a very sensible move on the part of the Government, which was facilitated through Gas Networks Ireland.  While the gas pipeline was being laid, ducting was also laid so that fibre optic cable could be placed within it.  It means that the State or a company or agency did not have to go back onto people's land.  As a solicitor I am very familiar with the situation having dealt with many people whose lands were required for the purposes of wayleaves.<\/p> <p>Wayleaves were originally granted for a gas pipeline and ducting.  I assume that all landowners have been compensated in respect of that part of the job which has been done and the Bill makes provision for any loss to land or disturbance which would occur in the future if the State or a company has to fix cables for any reason.  I ask the Minister of State to clarify whether people will be compensated because clearly that is required.<\/p> <p>The Bill is timely.  I am glad the situation is being regularised.  Wayleaves can be incredibly complex and can lead to all sorts of complexities in regard to land ownership, rights and entitlements as my colleague, Senator Burke, alluded to.  It is best that everything is set out clearly, as envisaged in the Bill.  We are at a point where the hot topic is balanced regional and rural development.  The national planning framework will be launched on Friday.  Ducting and fibre optic cabling is very practical for the economic development of the region.<\/p> <p>Killala is the landfall point of a state-of-the-art transatlantic fibre optic cable from New York which connects to London and mainland Europe.  There is a break out point in Killala, which means there can be access to the cable for a data centre or any other endeavour which requires access to fibre optic cable.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Michelle Mulherin:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2309\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2309&amp;amp;pid=MichelleMulherin&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=14\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We are looking for ways to grow our economy.  The north and north west have particular issues in terms of a history of poor investment in infrastructure and they also lag behind in terms of job creation, which was identified in the draft national planning framework.  There are plans to address this.  However, this cable - and the connectivity it provides - offers a golden opportunity to create a technology hub in the area.<\/p><p>The Minister of State was in the House yesterday, as was the Minister, Deputy Naughten, to discuss the national broadband plan.  In my county, there are six metropolitan area networks with very good broadband, although many isolated rural areas do not have broadband.  There is a metropolitan area network in my home town of Ballina and quite good broadband.  The biggest challenge, to which Senator Leyden may have alluded, is to bring fibre to premises because the fibre is there and there is a cost in that.  The national broadband plan is ambitious in regard to bringing high-speed broadband to people's homes and premises but this cable presents an obvious opportunity.<\/p><p>The focus must also be on what the cable can deliver for this region because other regions do not have such a facility but we do and are looking for unique selling points.  There is an appetite for that.  There was all sorts of trouble with the data centre in Athenry in the Minister of State's county in terms of objections to planning permission.  The matter is still not fully resolved.  At the break-out point at the former Asahi plant in Killala, County Mayo, there is planning permission for a full data centre but we do not have one.  I am not sure how that can be so when planning permission is cited as one of the key obstacles to the construction of such data centres.<\/p><p>The region has many selling points and I hope that the Minister of State, as a fellow representative from the west of Ireland, will bear that in mind at the many interdepartmental and intergovernmental meetings in terms of the whole-of-Government approach to and regional strategies for job creation.  Something can be done with the opportunity offered by the cable but the progress from  an idea to the actualisation of a benefit for the region must be kick-started.  This can help to refocus interest and, it is to be hoped, investment in the region and we are ready, willing and able to snap up the resultant opportunities.  I ask the Government to try to facilitate that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018021400002#Q00300","speaker":"1425","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1518604200,"counter":259,"content":"<p>I call on the Minister of State to conclude.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018021400002#R00200","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speech","time":1518604200,"counter":260,"content":"<p>I thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach.

I welcome the support of Senators and parties and look forward to consideration of the Bill on Committee Stage.<\/p><p>Senator O'Donovan raised the issue of costs and whether this is a gift to the State.  In March 2013, Shell E&amp;amp;P Ireland Limited, SEPIL, offered to install the fibre-optic cable into the duct to a value of &euro;750,000 and gift ownership of the cable to the Minister.  SEPIL has spent far in excess of the &euro;750,000 budget.  Full acceptance of the network was delayed as the overground cabinets and associated infrastructure did not meet the agreed specification.  However, handover arrangements are currently being finalised with a view to closing out the involvement of SEPIL in quarter 1 of this year.  Some costs did accrue to the State.  The Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment paid Gas Networks Ireland, GNI, approximately &euro;900,000 between 2005 and 2010 in respect of the costs to GNI of obtaining easement rights.  This included compensation payments to landowners in addition to GNI's administrative and overhead costs.  The Department frequently consulted GNI from 2006 to 2015 and understood that all easements were in place.<\/p><p>This matter also relates to Senator Leyden's question on retrospective provision.  Concerns regarding the nature of the interest acquired by GNI were raised by the Office of the Chief State Solicitor in May 2015 and subsequently affirmed by counsel on behalf of the State.  The uncertainty created by legal opinion concerning the nature of the deeds of easement resulted in definitive advice issuing from the Office of the Attorney General on 4 September 2015.  That advice recommended that the Minister consider an amendment to section 72 of the Registration of Title Act 1964, which would have the effect of explicitly conferring on the telecommunications a deed of easement, the same legal effect conferred on the gas pipeline deed of easement by that section.  The easement was subsequently passed as part of the Energy Act 2016.  However, in the course of discussions with GNI between October 2015 and January 2016, it became clear that deeds of easement had not been executed in all cases.  GNI advised that approximately 68 interests on land were not closed and, of those, at least 13 would necessitate recourse to some form of compulsory acquisition.  The legal counsel for GNI advised that it did not have the necessary <i>vires<\/i>to exercise compulsory purchase orders for the purpose of securing the remaining easements on behalf of the Minister and the Office of the Attorney General advised that the arguments of GNI's counsel were compelling and could not be dismissed.  The Bill has thus been brought forward on the advice of the Attorney General and in the context of advice regarding GNI and easements.<\/p><p>There has been some mention of the national broadband plan.  This gas network is a very different proposition.  As Senator Mulherin said, it made sense to lay down the ducting and allow for the fibre to be rolled out when the opportunity was there.  The State has built the network and the tenderer is permitted to use the network and all of its assets under a concession agreement.  The network will not provide access to individual premises but will deliver ultra-high-speed broadband and dark fibre services to businesses and telecommunications operators in the area.  A high level of interest in the network will ensure that it can be operated at a profit and developing the network to its fullest potential will maximise those profits.  By the end of quarter 1 of this year, the interest of SEPIL will be removed and the State will have control.<\/p><p>Senator Mulherin referred to issues of access and Killala.  If the State has control and access, issues such as those can be considered in the context of any projects that might come to the area.  She mentioned data centres but there are other issues in that regard, including grid connection, which is separate to what is provided for in the Bill.

I understand the rationale behind this approach but I must reject the amendment.  We discussed this matter in the D&aacute;il also.  The primary role of the office of the planning regulator, as set out in the Bill, is to evaluate and assess development plans and regional strategies, and to make statutory observations and recommendations on them.  I do not believe it is necessary to amend the Bill to give the planning regulator the power to make legally binding determinations, and I do not believe that is what the Mahon report required either.<\/p> <p>The Bill provides that the planning regulator will be independent in carrying out its functions.  As currently drafted, it provides the regulator with sufficient powers to make recommendations to planning authorities and regional assemblies on development plans and on regional strategies, and for those recommendations to have sufficient weight.  The planning regulator can submit observations or recommendations to the relevant planning authority on draft plans and strategies.  A planning authority is then required to notify the planning authority and state the reasons its plan has been made in such a manner as to be inconsistent with any office of the planning regulator observations or recommendations.  Where the planning regulator is subsequently of the opinion that the development plan or regional strategy, as made by the relevant planning authority, does not set out an overall strategy for the proper planning and sustainable development of the area or region concerned, the regulator shall recommend the use of the ministerial direction powers in the Act to ensure that the plan sets out an overall strategy for proper planning and sustainable development, and shall submit a draft direction to the Minister of the day for issue to the planning authority concerned.  <\/p> <p>The Bill further provides that where the Minister agrees with the recommendations of the planning regulator in relation to a plan or strategy, he or she will issue a direction to the relevant local authority or regional assembly.  If the Minister does not agree with the recommendations of the planning regulator, the Bill provides that he or she is required to explain the reasons for the disagreement and must lay the reasons before the Houses of the Oireachtas and publish them on the Department's website. <\/p> <p>While the introduction of the regulator explicitly recognises the need for oversight of the planning system, the Government's goal in establishing the office is not to overlap with the criminal justice system or to replace democratic decision making, but to ensure transparency, integrity, consistency and quality outcomes within the planning system.  I believe the existing Bill has sufficient provisions to make certain that the recommendations of the planning regulator are given due weight within the planning process and that the regulator will have the necessary powers to succeed in the execution of its function.  <\/p> <p>At the moment, those decisions are made directly by the Minister of the day and I, as the Minister of State, make those recommendations on a weekly basis and often on a daily basis.  We judge development plans and local area plans and make those decisions, but not in a very transparent way.  I do not have to come into the Houses of the Oireachtas to explain decisions or talk about them.  Under this Bill, the regulator will do all of that and he or she will make all of those observations and do all that work on a weekly or daily basis.  When it is required, he or she will recommend that the Minister of the day, who could be anyone from this House in the future, from any party, will then make a direction.  That is a very clear and transparent process, which I believe achieves what the Mahon tribunal wanted it to achieve.  If the Minister does not agree with that direction, he or she has to come to the Houses of the Oireachtas and explain why he or she does not agree.  That is a very clear and transparent process, and it is a very good planning system.  We have gone far enough in this legislation.<\/p> <p>We have to have some democratic accountability.  Senators, councillors, Deputies and Ministers are elected to make final decisions on issues.  I do not believe that the Mahon tribunal requires that we go beyond that, but there is a transparency element to this.  A planning regulator will do all of that work and issue the suggested direction to the Minister.  We believe that is sufficient and should give everybody the trust required in the planning system.  <\/p> <p>Amendment No. 7 seeks to grant the planning regulator an additional investigative function and while I acknowledge that it is well intentioned, I cannot accept it.  In this regard, there must be clear lines of demarcation between the role of the planning regulator and other responsible bodies, particularly in the areas of corruption and planning decision making.  In instances where there is any evidence relating to planning corruption or breaches of law, these are strictly a matter for investigation by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  In the area of decision making on individual planning applications, the planning Acts already provide a clear hierarchy of decision making from the local authority to appeals by An Bord Plean&aacute;la and thereafter where matters are brought before the courts. <\/p> <p>The Bill as drafted already has sufficient provisions regarding the investigation of complaints by the office of the planning regulator and ensures that these complaints can, where appropriate, be referred to more appropriate State authorities.  Again, the regulator has the power to carry out the investigation and gather all the information, but then has to bring it to the next relevant authority to be dealt with thereafter.  It provides proper channels to go through.  There is no reason to reinvent the wheel.<\/p> <p>The Bill provides that the planning regulator may at its own behest, or at the request of the Minister or on foot of a complaint received, carry out reviews and examinations to determine if a planning authority is carrying out its functions under the planning Acts.  The Bill further allows the regulator to form its own opinion and make recommendations as appropriate to planning authorities and the Minister, and to other authorities if corruption or impropriety is discovered.  That ability already exists for the regulator.  <\/p> <p>The Bill also provides that in relation to complaints made by any person to the planning regulator regarding a planning matter, it can refer the matter and any related documents to the competent authority, be that the Ombudsman, the Standards in Public Office Commission, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or any other State authority, as required for appropriate investigation.  That is the correct way to do business and, therefore, I cannot accept amendments Nos. 4 and 7.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018021400002#DD00600","speaker":"1264"},{"type":"speech","time":1518604200,"counter":294,"content":"<p>Is Senator Warfield withdrawing amendment No. 4?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018021400002#DD00700","speaker":"1412"},{"type":"speech","time":1518604200,"counter":295,"content":"<p>No.  It should go to a vote.

In seeking to achieve a similar objective, I acknowledge Opposition amendments Nos. 3, 5, 6, 9 and 23 which have been put forward by Senator Murnane O'Connor.  I agree with the Senator and her party colleagues in the D&aacute;il that it is appropriate for the planning regulator to have a role in evaluating transport strategies.  It is vital that our strategic forward planning is cognisant of an inclusive and wider transport infrastructure.  However, upon further examination of the issue by my officials, it was considered appropriate that any function conferred upon the office of the planning regulator in this regard must relate to a specific statutory plan.  The only transport strategy we have referred to in the Planning and Development Acts 2000 to 2017 is the transport strategy, which is provided for in section 12 of the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008.  This Act regulates the work of the national transport authority and comes under the remit of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Damien English:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1781\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1781&amp;amp;pid=DamienEnglishFG&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=14\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Consequently, I am proposing to give the planning regulator a specific additional function to evaluate and assess strategic transport plans made by the National Transport Authority.  This is in line with the original Fianna F&aacute;il proposals in this regard.  I hope the Senator can understand the clarity I am providing in this respect.  Following consultation on this matter between officials from the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, it was agreed that the proposed role of the planning regulator would best be incorporated as a function in the Planning and Development Acts and also in the framework of the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008.<\/p><p>Accordingly, I am opposing Opposition amendments Nos. 6, 9 and 23 in favour of Government amendments Nos. 10, 47, 48 and 50, which will achieve a similar objective in a cohesive manner that integrates with existing transport legislation.  Specifically, amendments Nos. 10 and 47 will confer on the regulator the power to evaluate and assess strategic transport plans made by the National Transport Authority.  Amendment No. 48 will amend the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008 to make the office of the planning regulator a statutory consultee in the drafting of transport strategies as they occur under the Act.  This means that in the future, the planning regulator's office will be consulted when a transport strategy is being developed by the National Transport Authority and the planning regulator will receive a draft of the plan at the same time as the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.  The regulator will then simultaneously issue a notice to the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, and the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government stating whether the overall plan is consistent with planning policy.  The regulator can also make recommendations for any amendments required.<\/p><p>While the ultimate authority to determine the transport strategy will continue to rest with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, in cases in which the Minister does not accept or fully accept the advice of the planning regulator, he or she will have to inform the regulator in writing of the reasons for such a decision and will also have to consult the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government before finalising the strategy.  This will be in addition to the provisions in the Bill that already place the planning regulator as the reviewer of regional, spatial and economic strategies.  As such strategies are drawn up in consultation with the National Transport Authority and Transport Infrastructure Ireland, they will already be cognisant of strategic transport plans and wider transport concerns.  This will mean the regulator will have a double lock on strategic transport planning, initially as a consultee in the formulation of transport strategies and again as the reviewer of regional, spatial and economic strategies that incorporate transport strategies.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 50, which will be moved later, is a minor amendment that proposes to update the legislation so that a reference to the \"Dublin Transport Authority\" is replaced by a reference to the \"National Transport Authority\", as it is now known.  I think most Senators will agree that these changes represent a positive development.  People want to have full access when it comes to planning and transport.  I hope the approach I am advocating is agreeable to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018021400002#DD01200","speaker":"1264","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1518604200,"counter":301,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018021400002#EE00200","speaker":"1395"},{"type":"speech","time":1518604200,"counter":302,"content":"<p>I remind Members that we are discussing amendments Nos. 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 23, 47, 48 and 50.

No. 139\/2008 - Recognition of Professional Qualifications (Directive 2005\/36\/EC) Regulations, 2008.&rdquo;.&rdquo;.<\/blockquote><\/blockquote><\/blockquote> <p>On Second Stage I addressed this issue and the opportunity the Bill presents to address a glaring deficiency in our planning law, that is, the lack of regulation of planners, or those who call themselves planners.  The points I made at the time still stand: anyone in this House, or outside it, can legally refer to himself or herself as a planner.  This has had highly detrimental consequences for many individuals and I believe such people calling themselves planners have been responsible for some of the poorer planning errors we have had in the past.  I am very exercised about this.  Even though this Bill concerns a planning regulator and relates to matters that arose out of the Mahon tribunal, it is an opportunity to address this glaring deficit.  People like to believe that the professional whose services they are availing of has the necessary qualifications and training.  I think they would also be glad of a register and a council that ensured a proper code of ethics and that ensured that the standard in practice was maintained, planners having achieved the qualifications and training they should have, and glad of some element of continuing professional development, CPD, being involved, as there is in many other professions.  If one of the issues in this regard is that there are people working in the planning sector who have great experience but do not have the standard qualification, I am sure that CPD and grandfathering could address that.  I have not had the chance to talk to the Minister of State since last we discussed this issue on the floor of the House.  This is a very serious matter and one that this Bill could address.<\/p><p>I have tabled a very simple, straightforward amendment as a first step in this journey towards a proper register and regulation of planners that would define what a planner is and who can call oneself a planner.  It defines a planner as<\/p><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>(a) a corporate member or fellow of the Irish Planning Institute; or<br \/><br \/>(b) a person who has been permitted access to pursue the profession of planner pursuant to Article 5 of S.I. No. 139\/2008 - Recognition of Professional Qualifications (Directive 2005\/36\/EC) Regulations, 2008.&rdquo;.&rdquo;.<\/blockquote><\/blockquote><\/blockquote> <p>I believe the amendment can at least start the first step of this journey.  We would still have some way to go, and I understand the journey could be more complex, but I seek with this amendment to start that journey and send a message to people that those who would profess to be planners and who are not properly trained would need to get that training organised for themselves if they wished to remain in the planning profession.  This is critically important now because at the end of this week we will see the launch of the national planning framework.  Our capital plan will also being launched, with &euro;113 billion to be spent.  These are very welcome developments and show the very serious intent of Government to plot a way forward.<\/p><p>One big issue that arises out of these two documents is the need for brownfield sites to be used and for Dublin to go higher rather than spread wider.  My view, as someone who lives in Fingal, is that Dublin needs to go higher and places such as Fingal need to develop as well.  The Fingal development plan for the next five years has land zoned for 49,000 units.  Many people living in Fingal who have young families wish and hope their families could live in the area with them.  We have also mentioned Dublin Airport, which contributes &euro;8.3 billion to the economy.  One example of its potential is that it has four office blocks capable of housing 4,000 workers.  These people will want to live near their workplace.  I know I had Senator Grace O'Sullivan's support when I spoke about short commuting distances.  Why not live in the nice green, sandy-beached area of Fingal rather than in Dublin city if one works in Dublin Airport?<\/p><p>At a time like this we will need the innovation and expertise of well-trained planners, and they also need their reputation protected by a standard and a code to which they can allude and a qualification they can stand over, rather than having fly-by-night operators who are not planners calling themselves planners and bringing the reputation of the planners into disrepute.  As I said, with high density in Dublin, we will need very clever, innovative approaches to providing green space and amenity space, and I have absolute confidence in our planners to do so.  I do not, however, have confidence in those who purport to be planners and who are not properly trained to do so.  I cannot emphasise enough how critically important this is.  I feel if it is not accepted, it will be a missed opportunity and we will be doing the public a disservice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018021400002#FF03100","speaker":"1421"},{"type":"speech","time":1518604200,"counter":353,"content":"<p>I have great sympathy for what Senator Reilly is trying to achieve here.

I understand the observations of his colleagues.<\/p> <p>However, I do not propose to accept amendment No. 24 tabled by Senator Reilly proposing the insertion of definitions of the terms \"planner\" and \"planning consultant\" in the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended.  He said it is a small step but while it might seem a small step in the writing of it, this would kick off a much larger process.  Senator Humphreys touched on that.  There is a process to go through if we want to achieve this.  We have not had the chance in the past week to discuss this but even that week would not have been enough for us to get this dealt with.  I understand what the Senator is trying to do and would support it because the idea behind this Bill is to bring more transparency into the planning system, to have much better planning and more people involved in the process, and observing the national planning frameworks, county development plans and regional strategies that we have all been involved in over the past two or three years.<\/p> <p>Planning has improved considerably over the past ten to 15 years.  We want to improve it again, to make it clear and transparent and to put trust into the system.  That means that when people hire what they think is a planner or planning consultant they can be sure they are getting someone qualified to do the job.  That trust is betrayed if that person does not have the required skills.  We see that in other professions and we are dealing with it bit by bit in them, and rightly so.  I support the Senator but am not ready to put this into this Bill.<\/p> <p>The terms \"planner\" and \"planning consultant\" are not mentioned anywhere in the principal Act and, therefore, I do not see any useful purpose, or legal requirement, to include such definitions in the principal Act.  I acknowledge that several submissions have been received in the Department seeking to define these terms and to regulate the planning profession.  Whereas I recognise the role and qualities of professional planners in the Irish planning system, there are a series of questions that remain to be resolved, such as the potential for anti-competitive challenges from workers from other EU member states with professional planning qualifications and how the regulatory function will operate practically in terms of regulation, policing and funding.  These are issues we have discussed with the relevant bodies over the past couple of years but there have not been any solid proposals in this area.  We would need those and I would be happy to engage with the relevant authorities.<\/p> <p>I addressed a conference at the IPI last week.  A group of people in the room were members of the IPI and have expertise in planning.  We need that and want it but there is a process to go through.  Inserting this amendment would not do the process justice and would not be fair to the system.  It would be wrong to do that.<\/p> <p>When we discussed this last week I mentioned precedent.  Senators Humphreys and Boyhan referred to the regulation of specific professional groups.  I namechecked the architects profession last week as provided for in the Building Control Act 2007.  Without having any further flesh on the bones as to how a register of planners would operate, I am not in a position to accept this.  We went through a similar process with the architects and there are still unresolved issues, years on.<\/p> <p>If we are going to do this we need to do it the right way with proper consultation involving everybody.  I would be happy to engage in that process and legislate or regulate for it later.  There are quite a few fundamental issues that require further consideration and development in this regard.  I want to proceed with caution in this matter for the moment.  While we would all agree that it is something we want to achieve, we have to do it in a proper manner.  I would not be in a position to take it on Report Stage.  I and the officials give a strong commitment that we will engage on this and we can achieve it if we want to but that will take longer than putting it into this Bill. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018021400002#GG00300","speaker":"1264"},{"type":"speech","time":1518604200,"counter":359,"content":"<p>I thank the Senators for their contribution.  I accept Senator Humphreys's bona fides on this.  The second part of the amendment relates to \"a person who has been permitted access to pursue the profession of planner pursuant to Article 5 of S.I.

I accept fully what the Minister is saying about architects and the fact that anyone could use that term up to a couple of years ago and that problems arose subsequently.  Unfortunately, to make an omelette one has to break a few eggs.  We cannot continue to run away from it on the basis that we may discommode certain people.  No one rule will always be fair to everybody but the greater good demands that we do something about this, that we have protection for the public and that we protect the name of planners as well.  It is not a case of pulling the ladder up after them but there are the IPI, the RTPI and our European brethren with whom in many professions we have equivalence of certification and acknowledgement of their degrees.  The one I know most about is the medical profession.  That is not without its problems.

There are a number of local authorities where councillors have initiated changes to the county development plans.  There is a lack of coherence across the 31 local authorities in this matter.  There was a case in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council in which the manager and the executive sought clarification and decided to get an independent view.  Every time one looks for a view, one gets a different view from somebody else.<\/p><p>There is some ambiguity about the role and the function of elected members in initiating a variation of the county development plan.  I am talking about a variation as opposed to any other mechanism, for instance, if a number of members of a local authority wished as a group to vary their development plan to have regard for a number of protected structures or an architectural conservation area - I am giving those examples as being not too controversial - some local authority members have been told by their chief executive that they cannot initiate this process.  <\/p><p>I believe fundamentally, and there has been a judicial review on similar matters, that the making of a development plan is the most powerful instrument of an elected member in a local authority.  In many ways this takes up a lot of members' time, in terms of ensuring that it is followed to the letter of the law.  Members will know from their experience in local government that councillors guard that power and are very proud of their county development plans.  They put in an enormous work into the county development plans.  I do not have a problem with the executive initiating change and having a variation to the county development plan but it is important that members have the power and the right to initiate a variation.  I say that under very definite circumstances.  It is to be about process.  It is not just members willy-nilly making up some idea, but it is going through a long process of giving notice.  It is a public system that is transparent.  A variation in the county development plan requires public consultation, a planner's report, various amendments, teasing it out and coming back.  The executive has a role, as do the elected members.  I want both parties to have a equal role in this.  That is important.<\/p><p>The Minister of State will be aware that in County Meath, there has been controversy about planning issues.  The elected members have successfully initiated variations.  The power is there and the ministerial advisers should be telling him that it has happened.  I took on the task of going around a number of local authorities to find out how many variations took place in a number of local authorities, particularly in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown, because it is the local authority I know best.  Clearly I can see that variations were initiated by the executive but there were also variations initiated by the elected members.  It is a question of how do we start the process, how does an elected member come to a local authority and start the process.  That is where the problem lies.  I think there needs to be absolute clarity that elected members have a role and a function about initiating a variation of the development plan.  If the members do not have any power to initiative a variation, in effect once they sign off on the county development plan, they can do sweet damn all in terms of making changes.  Plans evolve, as the Minister of State knows.  Plans have to have regard for change in circumstances.  That is what I am trying to achieve.  I do not wish to weaken or dampen down the powers or the functions of the executive.  I want to put the reserved functions of the elected members on an even keel with the executive functions which the executive hold.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018021400002#HH02100","speaker":"1379"},{"type":"speech","time":1518604200,"counter":379,"content":"<p>I am pretty much in agreement with Senator Boyhan.  This is about strengthening local democracy and I support this amendment.<\/p> <p>Local councillors take great pride in the development plan.  Certainly on many occasions in Dublin City Council, local councillors had to go to An Bord Plean&aacute;la to keep the integrity of the development plan when the executive failed to it.  The prime example was when the then Jury's Hotel was given planning permission for an inappropriate development and local councillors had to appeal that decision to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, which then upheld the development plan.  Anything that strengthens local councillors in respect of planning is good.  Anything that clarifies clearly the reserved functions of councillors, to allow councillors to initiate a variation of the development plan along with the executive is important.  Five years can be a long time in terms of a plan for a city or town.  There is a need for the elected members of the council to know their reserved function and that they can initiate a variation of the development plan, even though it is tightly regulated and ensures there is proper consultation during the process.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Kevin Humphreys:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2289\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2289&amp;amp;pid=KevinHumphreys&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=14\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I thank the two Senators for tabling the amendment.

It is important that there is a clear and robust planning rationale for embarking on a variation procedure in respect of a development plan.  The current requirements in the Act recognise the fundamental role of elected members as decision-makers in this regard, which would be undermined by this proposed amendment as it seeks to permit the amalgamation of policy formulation with the decision process on policy.  However, I know what the Senators are trying to get at.<\/p> <p>It is important that we recognise the different roles of both elected members and the executive.  Planning and local government legislation distinguishes between legal functions reserved for the elected members, on the one hand, and the executive functions of the executive on the other hand, and both are part of the planning authority's procedures.<\/p> <p>The development plan variation and amendment process is intended to operate as a well-informed and open dialogue between the elected members and the executive regarding the wishes of the elected members on planning policy, in their local authority areas, and the legal responsibilities of the executive to advise the elected members of the council of their duties and responsibilities from a legal and technical perspective.  Furthermore, there is a need to ensure that the integrity of the development plan and local area plan, as adopted by the elected members, is maintained and is not subjected to an ongoing review and change without the required level of technical examination.  There is a danger that the overall coherence of the adopted plan will be undermined by piecemeal and frequent changes that would create uncertainty in the development plan process.  I am not saying that would happen.  I am saying that the wording of the amendment poses a danger and I am prepared to talk to the Senators in order to come up with a different wording.  Both elected members and officials must work together in harmony.  They must recognise their respective roles for the purpose of shaping the proper planning and sustainable development of the functional area of the relevant planning authority.<\/p> <p>The actions involved in initiating a variation of a development plan include a number of steps such as: preparing for and undertaking a public consultation; reporting on the public consultation; and the subsequent preparation of recommendations for the members to consider further to the public consultation.  From a practical perspective, the function under section 13 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, which governs variations to the development plans and local area plans, requires that reasons be stated for the initiation of a variation.  The reasons must stand up to scrutiny from the perspectives of proper planning and sustainable development, consistency with the overall national policy and the regulatory framework for planning, and fair procedure.<\/p> <p>I, therefore, oppose the amendment tabled by Senators Grace O'Sullivan and Victor Boyhan.  I do so on the grounds that their amendment could facilitate piecemeal and frequent changes to development plans and local area plans, which would give rise to and create uncertainty in the development plan process.  I know what the Senators are trying to achieve with their amendment.   I am prepared to discuss some other wording with them, which will also provide a clear definition.  I am sure we all agree that we do not want a variation to become a regular occurrence as it would undermine the plans.  It might also generate a legal doubt so it is best not to do so.  I accept, however, that there might be a need to do so in certain circumstances.<\/p> <p>In general, this process has worked quite well.  It has been mentioned at a committee meeting that the process has not worked in a couple of cases.  I am happy to meet the Senators to discuss the matter before Report Stage.  We could review the cases that the Senators are aware of but that I am not aware of and try to agree on a new wording for the amendment.  I cannot accept the current amendment because it does not achieve what they want.  Perhaps we will not agree on a new wording and we will have to agree to disagree.  Before the Senators decide to press their amendment I suggest that there may be time in the months ahead to discuss the matter and perhaps reach an agreement.

As I have told him, I have consistently been in dialogue with his officials for over a year who have continually told me that they will bring in guidelines.  The last correspondence I received from them stated the guidelines will come in when the national planning framework is adopted.  Will it?  Is it a <i>fait accompli<\/i>?I have no difficulty with discussing this primary legislation here and now.<\/p><p>The variations that we have talked have been, in many cases, initiated to facilitate the building of houses.  The Minister of State has talked about the Government's policy entitled Rebuilding Ireland.  He is not here in isolation but as part of a three-person ministerial team for whom I have respect.  The Minister of State has said that it is okay for the chief executive of a local authority to initiate a variation but it is not okay for the members of his political party, or members of any political party or none to initiate a variation.<\/p><p>We have been lectured to and heard a lot of talk about devolving powers to communities and to the elected members of the Minister of State's party and other parties.  However, when there is an opportunity to devolve power there is a reluctance to do so.  I have no issue with what the Minister of State has said.  I would like to read his speaking note but I think what he has said has been really positive.  Of course there must be a process, analysis and a public consultation.  Local authorities and planners are very familiar with the planning process and the statutory planning and public consultation process.  They are all obvious things.<\/p><p>I want an open and transparent process.  I want democracy and elected people to be empowered.  There are controls in the form of a planning regulator and many of the Mahon recommendations have been adopted.  All of that means we now have, hopefully, a cleaner, more open and transparent planning process than we have ever had and I thank all of the politicians who fed into that process.  This Bill will go a long way to achieving all of that.  What is the Minister of State and the Government afraid of?  <\/p><p>In terms of the suggestion that elected members approach councils willy-nilly everyday, there were approximately 14 variations in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council.

First, I will home in on five local authorities, including Meath and D&uacute;n Laoghaire, and produce a printout within a week of every variation that has taken place in the past ten years.  I will give him a list of who proposed the variations, their party affiliations, their reasons for the proposals, where they went to and confirm whether homes have been built on the sites, whether there has been economic activity on the sites or if the sites went dead.  I will not do the work all on my own.  I shall call on officials who work in some of the local authorities and see how they respond to my request for information.  I shall tell them that I want to supply the Minister of State with a list in order that we can talk about this process at the next Stage.  I hope that something can be worked out here.<\/p><p>As he will know, the Government cannot talk about empowering local government, devolving powers to local government and empowering local county councillors from all parties yet at the same time come in here and say, &quot;We cannot let these fellas run amok.&quot;  That is what I believe the Minister of State has said about this matter.  I believe we already have an open and transparent system.  He has talked about the matter and played a role in providing a good, open and transparent system.  My colleagues and I have introduced a Bill that will address many of the anomalies and many of the recommendations made by Mahon.  All of that is in order.

This issue must be addressed.  However, one must consider how a development plan is dealt with in practice.  I was first elected to a city council in 1999 and, as a new councillor, had to try to deal with a complicated development plan that was a foot thick for a city.  That plan was revised several times at each election.  New councillors were coming in to deal with a major development plan and found it very difficult to grasp.  The Minister of State is nodding in agreement so I presume he had a similar experience at some stage.<\/p> <p>The amendment makes good common sense.  Consultation will be better because it will deal with a variation of the plan.  The process must be correct but the key issue in this regard is divining what councillors' responsibilities and powers are in regard to initiating a variation of the development plan.  During my time on the council, managers often told me that they would love to implement a variation of the development plan in a particular area because housing development was required but because of the make-up of the council the manager would get his or her head chopped off and the variation would not be progressed.  If councillors are prepared to show the leadership to initiate a variation of a development plan in order to allow homes to be built, in particular at a time when we so badly need homes, they must be facilitated to do so.  However, proper controls must be in place.<\/p> <p>Nobody wishes to undermine public consultation, proper scrutiny taking place or, most importantly, a role in the process for the community.  There is now a totally different public attitude to this issue because people now understand the problems in regard to a city and the need for housing.  They understand the problems of density and are far more open than was previously the case to consideration of a variation of a development plan, in particular when it is an improvement of the plan and one is rezoning from industrial to residential and wants to move from a brownfield site to building homes.  We must empower councillors who are aware of such needs in local communities to be able to initiate that, as well as management.<\/p> <p>The Minister of State should consider this amendment before the Bill goes to Report Stage.  There is a sense that Senators wish to support the amendment and facilitate change.

From the fact that it is being announced in County Sligo, I assume there is good news for Sligo, and I wish its people well.  This is a plan that has been put together over a short period of time.  Granted, there was time allowed for public consultation and submissions, but we do not believe that is sufficient.  If the draft is anything to go by, many parts of rural Ireland, which is on its knees in many respects, will be closed down altogether.  This plan involves the spending of &euro;115 billion of taxpayers' money.  I repeat, &euro;115 billion.  <\/p> <p>Last October, we passed a budget of &euro;60 billion, which was for a 12-month period, and both Houses of the Oireachtas had to vote.  This is twice that amount, and the Government expects us as Members of this House, and our colleagues in the Lower House, to be satisfied with statements about what the Government will decide to do next Friday.  For me, and for the members of my party, that is not good enough.  This is the future of our families and the families to follow for many generations in this country.  This infrastructure will be their future.  There is an obligation on us to vote to approve or reject what the Government comes up with next Friday.  This plan will spend &euro;115 billion of taxpayers' money over the next several decades.

At the very outset, I welcome it.  We do not know the full and final detail of it, but we have had a lot of discussion.

We had an exhaustive debate about it and people expressed their views and concerns.<\/p><p>As someone who travels up and down the country, I am keenly aware of provincial newspapers and their power.  I go to the library here on a weekly basis and pull out the provincial papers, because I like to get a sense of what is going on.  It is sometimes very different to what is said here.  Spin of all sorts comes from all sorts of parties, welcoming all sorts of initiatives and the fact that they had a part to play in them.  I was in Laois yesterday, and I picked up the <i>Laois Champion<\/i>.  I was in Donegal a few days ago and I had another look there.  I saw many of my lovely friends and colleagues here making all sorts of claims to fame on the basis of what they got in this national planning framework.  That is very interesting.<\/p><p>I am also conscious that a confidence and supply arrangement sustains this Government.  Can I give a little bit of advice, for what it is worth?  I would love the Minister to come before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  I think it would be a clever political move.  Sometimes people do not really want the things they bark and shout about.  I learned that in politics a long time ago.  I do not know why the Minister has any fear.  He should call off his Sligo gig next Friday, if necessary.  Why not?  It is only a gig.  It is only a part of the PR machine, though that is an important aspect of any plan.  I call on the Minister to move on.  Bring it back into these Houses.  Call a spade a spade.  Put it up to them.  Ask them to vote for it.I guarantee him that he will have overwhelming support.<\/p><p>If it was put to them that there was a vote of both Houses, the people who complain about the national planning framework would have a different song to sing.  What I am saying is that I think it is a good plan.  It is about time that we had a co-ordinated approach to planning and development, underpinned by proper capital funding that is open and transparent and spreads right across this country.  That is really important.<\/p><p>I hope that is what is going to happen.  I am not privy to the inner details of the national planning framework, but it makes sense to have an overall national planning framework for our country.

I do not know why Members do not come into the Houses, have a final debate and call for a vote on it.  Is it not better to have a ringing endorsement of the national planning framework?  Is it not better to put it up to the parties that sustain the Government?  I believe they will support it.

There is a beautiful Army barracks there that is open to the world but there are no soldiers in it anymore.  One can go up along the west coast and through towns such as Foxford.  Westport is a fantastic town, but anyone coming into some of the other towns in Mayo will see the state of them.  Anyone can see the state of parts of Leitrim.<\/p> <p>The plan is therefore needed and, in fairness to the Government, it has put a plan in place, but what the hell is wrong that the Government cannot bring the plan in here to the democratic heart of the country and allow a vote to take place on it?  What is wrong with that?  These statements are nonsense.  They are a waste of time.  People will stand up here next week and say with great indignation, \"Damn this to hell,\" and \"Damn that to hell,\" and \"The Government did not do this and did not do that\".  However, if the Government made them vote on it before it kicked off with the gig in Sligo, they would have very little to say.  I get tired of the goddamn history lessons.  We get it in here every bloody week.  We have people shouting at us about trolleys and housing.  Are they expecting all these things to materialise out of thin air?  The Government is doing the best it can, but would it for God's sake respect democracy, bring such plans to the House and let people who will shout their heads off next week about the plan do so before they vote on it?  I agree with my colleague, Senator Boyhan.  If Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin so wished in the morning, he could force a vote on this today, and that is the truth of the matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018021400002#MM00500","speaker":"1390"},{"type":"speech","time":1518604200,"counter":424,"content":"<p>We will vote on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018021400002#MM00600","speaker":"1418"},{"type":"speech","time":1518604200,"counter":425,"content":"<p>Let us have it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018021400002#MM00700","speaker":"1390"},{"type":"speech","time":1518604200,"counter":426,"content":"<p>I thought we were debating Committee Stage of the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill.

They have to make a final decision.  The legislation we are discussing in the context of these amendments refers to the draft legislation.  I point that out in case people have not had a chance to read what is in the legislation, this relates to what is expected of future national development plan framework discussions.  The legislation is not finished yet.  The discussion will continue for a few more weeks or months, as we have a few Report Stage amendments to go through.  We also have a few more meetings on it.  Therefore, the discussion on it could continue for a bit longer.  The current national plan was meant to be finished last November or December and it has dragged on a little longer than anyone would have hoped, albeit for the correct reasons.  The two are not parallel, rather they are a little separate from the point of discussing legislation for now and for the future.<\/p> <p>The legislation proposes that: \"The Government shall submit the draft of the revised or new National Planning Framework, together with the Environmental Report and Appropriate Assessment Report for the approval of each House of the Oireachtas before it is published.\"  It also states: \"In preparing or revising the National Planning Framework, the Government shall have regard to any resolution or report of, or of any committee of, the Oireachtas that is made, during the period for consideration, as regards the proposed strategy or, as the case may be, the Framework as proposed to be revised.&rdquo; That is what is in the legislation.  <\/p> <p>What the Senators are asking for in these amendments is that the final draft would have to be voted on before it becomes a statutory document.  I disagree with that proposal.  It was never the intention in putting forward the legislation that this is what would happen.  A formal vote on the final national development plan was never envisaged under this legislation, rather it was envisaged that all parties would have a formal opportunity to discuss and input into the drafting process.  In drafting the current plan, that is what we did.  This has been facilitated through a motion approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas referring the draft national development plan, published last November, to the Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government for its consideration and to submit a report to the Minister.  <\/p> <p>The two provisions in the Bill, as recommended by the Mahon tribunal, provide that we would have the involvement of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  That is what we are trying to do with this legislation.  It is also what we have tried to do in the debate we have had during the past three years on the national planning framework to be launched this week.   <\/p> <p>Regarding Sinn F&eacute;in's proposal that the final vote on the draft of the national planning framework must lie with the Houses of the Oireachtas, this is a planning and consultation document that has been under consideration for the past three years and there is a danger we might never get it finished.  That is why governments have to eventually make a decision.  It is provided in law that the Government must consider the Houses of the Oireachtas.  That is what we are proposing in law.<\/p> <p>In the spirit of that legislation, we have during the past year made sure that we have involved everybody as much as we could in the planning framework strategy that has come through.  We have done that.  That is why we have had debates in this House, we have had discussions on the floor of the D&aacute;il and both Houses passed a motion that the committee would do the detailed work on their behalf and submit a report.  That has happened.  The committee did that work in October.  The Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, and I went to that committee, as well as to other committees, and the rural affairs committee also had a discussion on this.  We teased through draft national planning framework documents line by line for hours.  The committees made reports which fed into the process.  I can assure Senators that during the past few weeks and months all the recommendations from those committees, all the questions that were asked and all that discussion has been part of our finalisation of this legislation.  That is what has happened during the past few months.  <\/p> <p>As referenced by Senator Buttimer, the final consultation with the public was held last September or October.  More than 1,000 submissions were received, 150 of them were from Oireachtas Members, councillors, Senators and so on, people involved in local government and people from different parts of the country.  All those 1,000 submissions, including the 150 I referenced, have been read and worked on to reflect what we are trying to do here.<\/p> <p>Consultation is the cornerstone of what we are trying to do with this new national planning framework.  That is what it is about for two reasons.  One is the recognition of new politics and that is what we have been trying to do here.  We have recognised that it is a good way to involve both Houses of the Oireachtas and the committees.  Everybody has had their say and there have been numerous meetings.  Anyone who has asked me or the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, for a meeting to discuss this has got it.  There has been no shortage of that.<\/p> <p>I went to local authorities and begged councillors of all parties to make submissions on this.  A year and a half ago I asked councillors to get involved in this process.  We had 40 regional events during the past two years.  We asked people to get involved in this process because we want their involvement in it.  The legislation we are debating, which the Senators want to amend, recognises the importance of having that involvement in future plans.  We have recognised that in the plan we are working on and we will try to honour the spirit of the legislation, even though it has not gone through yet.  We have achieved that by having discussions here and in the committee.  <\/p> <p>After the committee report there was a nine-hour debate on this plan in the D&aacute;il during which 45 Members made contributions.  I do not know the length of time it was debated in this House after that.  However, the consultation we propose should happen in future legislation has happened in this context and I would like to see it happen in the future.  However, the Senators' request that the final vote on the draft plan would lie with the Oireachtas would take from a Government doing its job, which is to make decisions on behalf of the country to implement plans.  <\/p> <p>I would cite the example of the Action Plan for Jobs, which most people said could never work and would not work.  The Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton, brought it forward under the previous Fine Gael-Labour Party Government.  It involved many actions, many Departments, a great deal of money and many changes.  If that plan had been brought to both Houses for a final vote before it could have been implemented, would we have the jobs recovery we have?  We probably would not.  We had to implement that plan straightaway and get stuck in.  Like the housing plan, it was a five-year plan.  Everybody said it could not work but it did work.  It disappointed many people that it worked.  It helped to facilitate the creation of over 240,000 jobs in this country during recent years.  If that had to be approved by way of a final vote by both Houses before the then Government could have acted, I am not sure we would have made any progress on it.  I doubt we would have.  <\/p> <p>With the national planning framework, Ireland 2040, we have involved everybody as much as we could but at the end of day somebody has to make a decision and that is what governments are meant to do.  That is the reason I believe the Senators' amendments go a little too far.  I understand what they are trying to do.  I have discussed this with Minister, Deputy Eoin &Oacute; Broin, perhaps a future Minister - I meant to say the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018021400002#NN03400","speaker":"1264"},{"type":"speech","time":1518604200,"counter":499,"content":"<p>Perhaps a new coalition.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018021400002#NN03500","speaker":"1417"},{"type":"speech","time":1518604200,"counter":500,"content":"<p>We also had this discussion on Committee Stage.

This Government has made sure we have honoured the spirit of it on this occasion by having that consultation.  If the Acting Chairman will allow me, I will take a minute or two on this point as people have referred to the plan.  I have heard people say that it will kill rural Ireland.  I have watched rural Ireland.  People mentioned Westport and Clonakilty.  In some of those towns, rural Ireland is flying and in other towns it is not.  However, it has been declining for a long period of 30 or 40 years, not seven or eight years, because there was no national plan to address the problem.  I strongly believe the national plan which we will launch on Friday will help save rural Ireland.  It will give many towns and villages a purpose and a reason to function, develop, grow their populations and secure investment in their areas.  Similarly, it will strengthen our cities and our regions to compete on an international level.  They will compete with one another but also on an international stage to win jobs and investment.  That is what having a national plan is about.  I have no doubt about it.  I am a Deputy whose constituency covers rural and urban areas.  It is very close to Dublin and suffers the consequences of that, as well as some gains from that.  I have no doubt in telling this House that the Ireland 2040 national planning framework to be launched on Friday will - if implemented, followed and invested in - save rural Ireland and future-proof this country.  Future-proofing this country is what it is about.  It is not about every town or village.  Some people have said it should not be like the \"Late Late Show\" where there is one for everyone in the audience, but it might become that if there was a final vote in the D&aacute;il.  It is correct that the Oireachtas, through the D&aacute;il, Seanad and the committee, has an involvement in the draft and that it would have this in the future.  It is very important that it has that.<\/p><p>There is some confusion on the spend of &euro;115 billion.  That figure is separate to the planning framework that we will launch but they are being launched together because it is important that they are linked.  While the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, and the Taoiseach will announce the commitment of taxpayers' money, it is also true that it will have to go through a budget every year too.  It is not correct to say that we are spending &euro;115 billion of taxpayers' money without any say on the part of the Oireachtas.  It will go through a budget.  Every year, we come into the House for the current and capital budget.  If we are to implement the proposed national planning framework, Ireland 2040, along with the capital plan, it must come through these Houses every year in order for the money to be allocated each year to the various Departments.  That is the correct channels by which to spend money.  Other national plans have been announced with a commitment of money.  Other Governments have done so in the past, and rightly so, and the Oireachtas votes on them year-to-year with the money to be allocated.  <\/p><p>On the commitment to regional balance, in order to get that growth again it must include cities, towns and villages and that those national decisions are made.  Consultation is absolutely built-in.  The reason we had this consultation is recognising new politics and how we do our business here, which is beginning to work quite well.  I would hate for it to be spoiled over the next week over silly, petty arguments.  There has been consultation on this for a long number of years.  Anyone who wanted to could feed into this.  I sat in on the first advisory meeting on this.  We made sure that every Department and agency sat around the table on this plan, bought into it and had a role.  Previous plans did not have that and they failed.  I think it will be a top-class plan because of the consultation and the involvement of all Departments, all political parties, all councils which wanted to and all regional assemblies, and I have sat through many of those, which meant they all had a chance to feed into this.  Everyone's view was taken on board, including all the Departments, and they were all part of this, which is why it will be a top-class plan but we must stand behind it and invest in it, and that includes the decisions we make every year after it.  I have seen plans in the past that did not have that consultation and involvement.  The reason for this legislation is it ensure that plans of the future have this involvement and consultation.  That is what it is about.  This debate has been confused about what we are doing this week and next week too.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018021400002#NN03600","speaker":"1264","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1518604200,"counter":502,"content":"<p>There are many speakers who wish to come in so I will allow the Minister of State back in later.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018021400002#OO00200","speaker":"1412"},{"type":"speech","time":1518604200,"counter":503,"content":"<p>As a final point, I note this House and the D&aacute;il made a decision.

I am speaking on this Bill on behalf of my colleague, Senator Swanick, who is unfortunately unable to be here this evening.  It is great to see this Bill get to this Stage.  It has passed all Stages in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and was prioritised by the Joint Committee on Health.  This demonstrates the appetite there is for change.  I commend the work of our mental health spokesperson, Deputy James Browne, in this regard.  He has overseen the passage of this Bill through D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, the establishment of a dedicated committee on mental health and the introduction of further Bills which will benefit those who suffer from mental ill health.<\/p> <p>The Bill contains certain significant changes which strengthen the rights of people who are in hospital for mental health care.  The Bill will also support the right of inpatients to make decisions about their own treatment by linking the Mental Health Act 2001 with recent law that affirms that everybody should be presumed to have capacity to make decisions.  I wish to flag that we will be introducing an amendment on Report Stage to replace each instance of the word \"patient\" in the Bill with the word \"person\".  The reason for this is that under the Mental Health Act 2001 a \"patient\" is defined as someone to whom an admission order relates.  This excludes those who do not fall under an admission order.  We reserve the right to introduce an amendment on Report Stage which will remove reference to section 3 of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 and replace it with the same text as in section 3 of the 2015 Act.  The reason behind this is that the reference to capacity as defined under section 3 of the 2015 Act means that section 2 could not commence until the 2015 Act commences.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018021400002#PP00800","speaker":"1418"},{"type":"speech","time":1518604200,"counter":545,"content":"<p>I would like to make a few short statements.

I also commend Deputy Browne and, indeed, Fianna F&aacute;il for pushing the issue of mental health.  As an aside, our Government seems to feel absolutely no embarrassment that the existing Mental Health Act 2001 is not compliant with either the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child or the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  Fianna F&aacute;il, Sinn F&eacute;in, Labour, the Green Party and Independent Members have so far been unwavering in supporting a positive mental health agenda and they should be commended on that.<\/p> <p>In a very fundamental way, this legislation supports the rights of inpatients to make decisions on their treatment by reflecting the policies of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015.  The existing framework, whereby a person who has no capacity is nonetheless deemed to consent to treatment, is quite wrong both in law and as a matter of practice.  This is an important amendment that respects the capacity of persons to have a proper say in their own treatment.  The autonomous decision making of a patient is also given new protection in the child-specific provisions.  It is important that the Deputy included these in the amendments.  I have a particular interest in the amendment to section 25 of the 2001 Act, by which Deputy Browne proposes to include best interest principles where a child is admitted to hospital under a court order.  As we know, there have recently been horrific cases of young people being admitted to hospital by court order with neither their autonomy or privacy rights being given full protection.  This is the precise type of child-focused modernisation that is required by our Mental Health Act and I fully support it.<\/p> <p>As the Minister of State is aware, we had a lively discussion here last week about the manner in which the Mental Health Act 2001 protects the rights of the child.  Unfortunately, the Act is dramatically out of date.  I think I am correct in saying that as few as one out of 160 recommendations from the expert review of the Mental Health Act 2001 were implemented.  We still stand by the practice of admitting children to adult units in this country.  I often meet GPs who say that this would never occur for a child with acute illness, for example, a kidney infection.  Such a child would not be admitted to an adult unit and yet, in mental health care, the HSE will stand by this practice which its regulatory body has openly condemned.  It is important that section 25 spell out the rights of the child which need to be considered by the courts when this kind of order is made.  I also note that the adoption of the best interest provisions proposed by Deputy Browne would reflect and protect international human rights law and the necessity for children to have a say in their own treatment.<\/p> <p>I congratulate Deputy Browne once again on this excellent legislation.  I hope that these provisions can be reflected in what needs to be a more timely and better staffed mental health service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018021400002#PP01100","speaker":"1428"},{"type":"speech","time":1518604200,"counter":548,"content":"<p>I commend Deputy Browne and the Fianna F&aacute;il Senators who are progressing this Bill through the House.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator M&aacute;ire Devine:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2468\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2468&amp;amp;pid=MaireDevine&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=14\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I suppose this arose as a result of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015, where it has been three years but it has not been enacted.

I ask the Minister of State to give us some idea as to when that might happen because many other things depend on it.<\/p><p>I will outline some of the reasons for this Bill.  Given that people are unable to make decisions, the decisions are made in their best interests.  They are considered voluntary patients even though they have not given consent to being admitted voluntarily.  From my experience, I am thinking about elderly people wandering aimlessly around psychiatric institutions, crying out, \"Let me go home\" and \"Why is the door locked?\".  They do not understand what situation they are in but know that they do not want to be there.  Surely that is an infringement of their human rights.<\/p><p>This proposed amendment to the Mental Health Act would strengthen that area and make us, as professionals, listen and take seriously what those people are saying.

We need to listen to their cries and take them seriously instead of prescribing more medication to keep them quiet.<\/p><p>I ask the Minister of State to outline when the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act will be enacted so that we can plough with reform that is people-centred and that takes into account people's wishes and needs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018021400002#PP01200","speaker":"1388","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1518604200,"counter":550,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1518604200,"counter":551,"content":"<p>SECTION 3<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1518604200,"counter":552,"content":"<p>Question proposed: \"That section 3 stand part of the Bill.\"<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1518604200,"counter":553,"content":"<p>We reserve the right to introduce an amendment on Report Stage to this section of the Bill that would retain subsection 4(2) of the 2001 Act.

I support Deputy Browne's Bill, which takes some very positive and necessary steps to address some of the shortcomings in our mental health system and puts in place some constructive measures to improve it.

Mental health reform has been a very useful guide to us.<\/p> <p>The Bill gives more power to the patient, the person involved, and that is an important clarification to be made.  Too often we talk about service users and clients, but we are talking about people.  Having that written into the Bill is a really important language change.<\/p> <p>The Bill targets the inherent deficiencies in the Mental Health Act, seeking to make our system more compassionate and more flexible, reinforcing a basic human right with the highest attainable standards of mental health and the right to the least restrictive care.  It is almost three years since the publication of the report of the expert group on the review of the Mental Health Act and the Government has consistently failed to meet its own timeframe for publishing a general scheme of a Bill to update the 2001 Act in full.  Under the existing Mental Health Act 2001, there is continued violation of human rights standards among people who are being treated in hospital for mental illness.  Senator Devine outlined how that looks with people wandering around corridors, lost, not knowing how they got there and certainly not knowing how they can get out.  Rectifying this is overdue and this is an opportunity to advocate for the amendment of the Mental Health Act 2001 in full.  It seeks to give voice to those directly affected - voices sometimes weakened, often unheard or even silenced within the mental health system in the past.<\/p> <p>It is good that this important Bill on mental health is being discussed and debated in the Seanad.  The Taoiseach recently described this House as a place where courageous and outspoken things were said, a place which brought together diverse collections of men and women, poets and thinkers, specialists and innovators.  It is the responsibility of this House, therefore, to speak out and to work on behalf of those who cannot speak out.<\/p> <p>Last week, we had another important debate on mental health in the presence of the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, when Senator Freeman introduced another important Bill on the care-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018021400002#QQ02200","speaker":"1430"},{"type":"speech","time":1518604200,"counter":567,"content":"<p>I remind the Senator that this is Committee Stage and not Second Stage.

As I have stated previously in the House, I recognise and value the importance he and others in both Houses attach to the need for introducing these changes to our mental health legislation.  While there were no amendments before us, I would like to apprise Members about the reason for that and my plans to amend the Bill on Report Stage but, before I get into that detail, I would like to make a few remarks.<\/p><p>It is incumbent on me to flag the amendments I wish to table.  The Bill has three main goals.  First, section 2 seeks to amend section of the Mental Health Act 2001 by updating the definition of &quot;voluntary patient&quot; to include the need for the patient to consent to admission.  Second, sections 3 and 4 seek to amend sections 4 and 25 of the Mental Health Act 2001 by replacing the existing principal consideration in the Act of best interest with a number of principles, including, i<i>nter alia<\/i>, the highest attainable standard of mental health autonomy, dignity and with due respect for the person's own understand of his or her mental health.  Third, sections 5 and 6 seek to amend sections 56 and 57 of the Mental Health Act 2001 by linking more directly the issue of consent with section 3 of the Assisted Decision-Making Capacity Act 2015, which deals with a person's capacity to be construed functionally.  The final two changes relating to best interest and consent closely mirror recommendations of the expert group review of the 2001 Act.  The move away from the often paternalistic interpretation of the existing legislation best identified by the inclusion in the Act of the principal consideration of best interest is both necessary and welcome.  We all want a scenario where in so far as possible individuals have the final say in what they feel is in their best interest and receive the best quality of service they need to reach the highest standard of mental health.  This change will effectively move away from paternalism and place grater autonomy in the hands of the individual.  However, when the analysis of the Mental Health Commission and my Department of the Bill's proposals is complete, I intend to revisit the list of adult guiding principles and it is likely that further changes in line with the recommendations of the expert group review will be proposed.<\/p><p>Deputy Browne sets out proposed guiding principles for children in section 4.  I have concerns, as the principles are more adult-related and do not take account of the child-friendly guiding principles recommended by the expert review group.  The commission is yet to give us its views on this but when they are received, I intend to discuss them further with the Deputy.  In this regard, an important issue yet to be decided is whether &quot;best interests&quot;, which will remain for children, should be a principal consideration in revised mental health legislation, as it is in the current 2001 Act, or whether &quot;best interests&quot; should be one of the list of child-friendly guiding principles, all of which would have equal value and merit.  The views of the commission will be key to how I intend the phrase specific amendments on Report Stage.<\/p><p>With regard to consent, which the Assisted Decision-Making Capacity Act 2015 was not in place when the expert group reported, nonetheless, what the Deputy is proposing is considered to be broadly in line with what the group proposed in respect of consent and capacity.  In addition, the specific reference to capacity and consent, which is now likely to be included in revised legislation, requires further examination as to whether other changes relating to assessment of capacity and who can assess capacity in the context of the Mental Health Act 2001, notwithstanding the fact that under the Assisted Decision-Making Capacity Act 2015, only a court can determine capacity.  How further amendments on Report Stage may be framed will depend on whether capacity can be assessed other than just through the courts as the Assisted Decision-Making Capacity Act 2015 would seem to suggest.<\/p><p>The first change relating to the need to specifically include consent in the definition of &quot;voluntary patient&quot; was fully accepted by the expert group and is a change I fully support.  The definition of &quot;voluntary patient&quot; proposed by the Deputy, however, differs from the one recommended by the expert group.  While the Deputy's definition references the Assisted Decision-Making Capacity Act 2015, the expert group specifically spelled out a more detailed definition that did not reference the Act.  The Department is waiting on the advice of the Mental Health Commission as to what the exact wording of the new definition should be.  Furthermore, the Deputy proposes to amend sections 56 and 57 in Part 4 of the Mental Health Act 2001 and add provisions that specifically relate to consent and voluntary patients.  Unfortunately, Part 4 of the Act only deals with involuntary patients and the inclusion of these provisions could fundamentally alter the nature of this Part.  My Department is in consultation with the commission regarding the effects such a change might have elsewhere in the Act.  The outcome of the discussions will help determine how we can best amend the Act to deliver on the aims of the Deputy in sections 5 and 6 of this legislation.<\/p><p>Finally, I would like to highlight one further significant issue regarding the Bill in respect of the amendment of the definition of &quot;voluntary patient&quot;.  If the proposed changes to the definition are accepted, persons without capacity who need inpatient mental health treatment but who do not have a mental disorder will be unable to gain admission to a psychiatric hospital because they cannot personally consent.  A new definition of &quot;voluntary patient&quot;, which includes the need for consent must commence only when other changes are introduced to allow patients without capacity to access treatment.  There are no proposals to deal with this in the Bill and, on the face of it, this would be an impossible position for any legislator to defend.  In this regard, my Department has separately launched a public consultation on draft legislation relating to deprivation of liberty with the final date for receipt of submissions being 9 March.  It is intended that the new provisions will be included in the Assisted Decision-Making Capacity Act 2015.  This is new complex legislation, which will also cover anyone who lacks capacity and is a resident in a range of health facilities, including nursing homes or facilities for persons with disabilities or mental illness.  It is intended that the draft provisions, now published, will also apply to mental health facilities in circumstances where persons have mental health issues but are not suffering from a mental disorder and, therefore, cannot be involuntarily detained under the Mental Health Act 2001, nor can they be admitted as voluntary patients under the new proposed definition, as they lack capacity to give such consent.  It is likely that the deprivation of liberty provisions will go before the Oireachtas later in the year.<\/p><p>We must all be conscious as legislators that, in amending the definition of &quot;voluntary patient&quot; as proposed, without at the same time passing alternative legislative provisions to allow persons without capacity or a mental disorder to access inpatient treatment, we leave ourselves open to criticism that the measures in this Bill alone seek to introduce an incomplete proposal.  In this regard, it is also important to mention that, while the proposed amendment relating to changing the definition of voluntary patient can be amended by the Oireachtas in the short term, any such change agreed by the Oireachtas also cannot be commenced until the decision support service, DSS, to be established under the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 is operational.  This is because the draft safeguards contained in the deprivation of liberty proposals use the framework set out in the Act and envisage a role for the service and, therefore, before such provisions can be operationalised, both the Act needs to be commenced and the DSS needs to be in place.  We have time available to us to ensure we properly scrutinise the text of this Bill and ensure it is appropriately drafted and is fit for purpose.  <\/p><p>I once again thank Deputy Browne for introducing the Bill.  I have asked him not to proceed to Report Stage until the Mental Health Commission and the Department have completed their analysis of the Bill.  As the provisions cannot be enacted until the DSS is commenced, there is no impediment to the Deputy holding off on going to Report Stage until the final text of the legislation is agreed between myself and the Deputy.  I do not envisage that this will take too long, but it is essential that this work be allowed to finish its course.  I am supportive of the changes being proposed in the Bill and we are all in agreement here that the changes the Deputy proposes need to be made.  However, I have outlined my concerns regarding certain aspects of the Bill and as the analysis and legal examination of the text has not been finalised by the Department and the Mental Health Commission, I will only be in a position to propose amendments on Report Stage.On that basis, the Government will not oppose the Bill but will table amendments on Report Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018021400002#RR00200","speaker":"1261"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1518604200,"counter":573,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1518604200,"counter":574,"content":"<p>Bill reported without amendment.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1518604200,"counter":575,"content":"<p>When is it proposed to take the next Stage?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018021400002#RR00400","speaker":"1412"},{"type":"speech","time":1518604200,"counter":576,"content":"<p>Next Tuesday.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018021400002#RR00500","speaker":"1418"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1518604200,"counter":577,"content":"<p>Report Stage ordered for Tuesday, 20 February 2018.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Job Losses at Kerry Foods, Carrickmacross, County Monaghan: Statements","time":1518604200,"counter":578,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018021400002#SS00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1518604200,"counter":579,"content":"<p>I am disappointed by the announced redundancies at Rye Valley.  Although the country as a whole is moving towards full employment, that does not make it easier for any person faced with redundancy.  It also underlines that although the economy is performing well overall, there are challenges that require every company to make sure it is competitive and capable of satisfying the needs of its customers.<\/p> <p>Kerry Group is Ireland&rsquo;s largest food company and a world leader in ingredients and flavour technologies.  It has 132 manufacturing facilities across five continents and provides food and ingredient products to a wide customer base in 140 countries.  With its headquarters in Tralee, the Group employs over 23,000 people worldwide.  It operates two consumer food production facilities in Ireland, one of which is Rye Valley in Carrickmacross.  Rye Valley is a major employer in the north east region.  The facility at Carrickmacross currently employs 420 people and most of its sales are to the UK.<\/p> <p>According to the company, the objective of the announcement is to improve the overall competitiveness of the site and to future proof it such that it can continue to operate effectively in Monaghan.  The company envisages that after this process the site will be better prepared to continue to supply and sustain its commercial opportunities in the marketplace, where it currently has a strong position.  The ongoing formal consultation process began a month ago.  The company envisages that the redundancies will be achieved on a voluntary basis.  I strongly urge the parties to continue their extensive engagement locally with a view to reaching a resolution to the satisfaction of employees and the company.  I will work with my colleague, the Minister for Employment and Social Protection, Deputy Regina Doherty, to ensure that redundant workers are given the support they need to find alternative employment.  I hope that having worked for the Kerry Group, which places emphasis on the professional development of its employees, they can quickly find alternative employment in the region.<\/p> <p>My objective as Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation and as a local representative is to ensure that new job opportunities are created in the local area.  As I said, the national economic picture is strong and, in fact, the number on the live register in Monaghan is down by 53% since 2012.  However, I am very conscious that more needs to be done.  One of the first things I did following my appointment as Minister was to meet with the CEOs from counties Monaghan, Cavan, Louth and Meath along with senior officials from Enterprise Ireland, the IDA and my Department to discuss how we can drive job creation in the region.  I will be working with my Department and agencies to ensure there is an even greater focus on the Border and, in particular, on counties such as Monaghan and Cavan.<\/p> <p>The north east-north west regional action plan for jobs is the key policy response for supporting employment growth in the region.  The core objective of the plan is to have a further 28,000 people at work in the region by 2020.  Sectors targeted as part of the Border plan include traditionally strong sectors for the region such as agrifood, manufacturing, engineering and tourism.  Importantly, the plan has been embraced by public and private sector bodies in the region and over 90% of its actions are on track for delivery.  In terms of impact, over 12,000 more people are in employment in the Border region since the plan commenced.<\/p> <p>At agency level, Enterprise Ireland recently announced a 4% employment growth in its client companies for the Border region, which now employ almost 11,500 people.  Knowing the considerable challenges that companies in the region are facing, Enterprise Ireland continues to engage on a one-to-one basis with established clients in County Monaghan.  Across the period 2014-17, it has invested approximately &euro;18 million in client companies in the county.  Through partnership between Enterprise Ireland and local authorities, local enterprise offices supported 1,152 small and micro-businesses employing over 5,720 people in the Border region during 2016.<\/p> <p>To keep this momentum going, in December last year I announced an allocation of &euro;30.5 million in funding to support enterprise capability in the regions, with 21 projects from all over the country receiving funding.  Three projects from the Border region were successful: a regional food centre of excellence at Ballybay in County Monaghan, a network of three digital and innovation hubs, including one in County Cavan, and a new digital innovation hub and enterprise capacity building programme in County Donegal.  In order to pursue this policy of growing new and exciting businesses across the regions, I look forward to launching a second call under the regional enterprise development fund in late March to allocate the balance of the &euro;60 million earmarked for the scheme.  If quality applications come in from the Border region for that scheme, they will be supported.<\/p> <p>The period ahead will be a very challenging one for the employees who may lose their jobs.  As I have outlined, all State relevant supports will be made available to them.  The best response is to continue to invest in programmes and policies that generate new jobs and to assist those seeking work to be able to take up the available opportunities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018021400002#SS00200","speaker":"1249"},{"type":"speech","time":1518604200,"counter":580,"content":"<p>I extend a very warm welcome to the Minister and thank her for taking time out of her busy schedule to come to the Chamber.  I have no doubt that she is extremely disappointed to learn of the 31 proposed job losses at Kerry Foods in Carrickmacross, as am I.  Our thoughts are with the workers and families affected.  It must be a very difficult, worrying and stressful time for them as I am sure they all have financial commitments to which they must adhere.  The Minister will agree that it is a huge blow for the town of Carrickmacross, in particular in light of the 150 job losses at the Bose factory in 2015.<\/p> <p>Kerry Foods has cited the volatility of sterling as a result of Brexit as one of the main reasons for the proposed job losses.  This is a very alarming development in view of the dependence on the agrifood sector in County Monaghan, of which the Minister is aware.  We have a huge number of jobs in that sector and it is of critical importance to the area.  All Senators have been warning for some time about the threat posed by Brexit and, unfortunately, the events of recent days once again highlight how real that threat is to the 31 workers faced with redundancy and the people of Carrickmacross.  It is important that the Government stays close to major employers in County Monaghan, in particular those involved in the food sector, who are acutely at risk because much of their produce goes to the United Kingdom.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Robbie Gallagher:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2471\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2471&amp;amp;pid=RobbieGallagher&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=14\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We need to help them by making sure they get all the help possible to navigate their way through this difficult period and to find new markets, where possible.  I am disappointed to have to say that the Government's record of attracting new employment to counties like Monaghan and Cavan is dismal.  Earlier this week, I received the most recent IDA Ireland statistics regarding visits to both counties.  I learned that in 2017, there was one visit to County Monaghan and there were two visits to County Cavan.  In the last six years, there have been seven visits to County Monaghan and ten to County Cavan.  I am sure the Minister will agree that none of us can be proud of this dismal record.  I have been saying for some time that no part of our country is more exposed to Brexit than the Border counties.  I am sure the Minister agrees with this.  I call on the Government to create a special economic zone in the Border region because such an initiative is much needed.<\/p><p>There is no reason large companies cannot locate and flourish in counties like Monaghan and Cavan.  A number of companies are already located in both counties.  As the Minister is well aware, Monaghan Mushrooms is the largest exporter of mushrooms in Europe and the second largest in the world.  Another company, Combilift, exports its products all over the world.  Our deep exposure to Brexit is a cause of great concern.  The Government needs to stay awake.  We need to stay close to our existing employers to ensure they can navigate their way through these turbulent times.  We must also focus on finding alternative employment.  I am concerned that County Monaghan is over-exposed to the agrifood sector.  I am heartened by the fact that the Minister, who is new to this portfolio, is a Monaghan lady born and bred.  I get great confidence from that.  I wish her well in her new post as she tries to convince her Government colleagues that the Border counties have a special case that deserves to be listened to.  I hope our day will come very shortly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018021400002#SS00300","speaker":"1396","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1518604200,"counter":582,"content":"<p>I join other Senators in welcoming my constituency colleague, the Minister, Deputy Humphreys.  We are happy to have her participate in this important debate.  At present, 420 people are employed in Rye Valley.  Most of the company's sales are in the UK.  I am keen to put the level of employment in perspective.  Of course it is always regrettable to hear about job losses.  Our hearts go out to those affected.  We stress the urgency of rectifying this situation.  It is important to note that the 31 redundancies will take place on a voluntary basis and are not forced redundancies.  We are not happy about the redundancies, but it is better that voluntary redundancy is being offered to people who might wish to retire for various reasons.  Of course this is not what we want.  I gather that the redundancies are needed to improve competitiveness.<\/p> <p>Kerry Group is renowned for investment in, and the professional development of, its workforce.  This means when these redundancies arise, this well-trained and skilled group of 31 people will be well placed to gain other forms of employment.  I consider it important that any upskilling sought by these people should be available to them.  All of the agencies, including the local education and training board, should be brought together to ensure any training needed by those who take voluntary redundancy to help them to get other employment is available to them.  I urge the Minister to ensure all the agencies are there to help.  I was impressed to hear her say she will be in contact with the Minister for Employment and Social Protection, Deputy Regina Doherty, to ensure active and personalised one-to-one support is available.  I know such support has been available in the past in these kinds of situations.  It is important that everyone is treated as an individual and met and dealt with personally.<\/p> <p>If it is possible, even at this stage, for the jobs to be saved through negotiations, I urge all parties to engage.  If there is any possibility to change work practices within the enterprise, for example, we appeal to those involved to facilitate this.  If alternative employment can be secured, that is the ideal to which we would aspire.  The north-west and north-east regional action plan for jobs, which includes a number of practical actions, is the key policy response on jobs in the Border region.  The core objective of the plan is to have a further 28,000 people at work in the region by 2020.  It places an emphasis on agrifood, manufacturing, engineering and tourism.  The number of people in employment in the Border region increased by 12,000 between the first quarter of 2015 and the second quarter of 2017.  Obviously, we want the Government to target its efforts in the Border region and we are delighted that we now have a Minister from the region to do that.  The great news that 12,000 additional people are working in the Border region belies the notion that job creation is not spread across the regions.<\/p> <p>In December of last year, the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation announced an allocation of &euro;305 million for a number of initiatives, including a digital hub in Cavan and a food excellence and innovation centre in Monaghan.  I congratulate the Minister on these great initiatives, which we welcome.  We hope they will contribute to a solution to this difficulty.  It is important to note that there has been a 4% increase in the number of IDA Ireland-backed jobs in this area.  Some 12,500 people in the Border region are employed in companies that are supported by IDA Ireland.  The local enterprise offices support 1,152 small businesses and microbusinesses, which employed more than 5,220 people in the Border region in 2016.  Between 2014 and 2017, Enterprise Ireland invested up to &euro;80 million in client companies in support of enterprise capacity in the region.  It is very important that this is the case.  Again, there has been a 4% increase in jobs in the region.<\/p> <p>I agree with my colleague, Senator Gallagher, that the matter of Rye Valley needs to be addressed and that the social protection aspects of this issue, such as the retraining of employees, need to be emphasised.  We need to ascertain whether there is any potential for the situation to be resolved onsite and inhouse, for example through discussions between all the agencies, the unions, management and workers.  If such potential exists, of course that is an optimum thing.  We need to continue to focus on job creation.  A great deal has already been achieved.  There is a spread of jobs in the region.  I am very happy with many of the announcements that have been made.  We want to achieve more.  We are very optimistic for the future of counties Cavan and Monaghan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018021400002#TT00200","speaker":"1397"},{"type":"speech","time":1518604200,"counter":583,"content":"<p>I thank Senators O'Reilly and Gallagher for their contributions.  I know the coming period is going to be difficult for the local workers at Rye Valley.  As I have said, I will work to ensure all the supports of the State are made available to the workers affected by this.  The best response is to continue to invest in programmes and policies that generate new jobs and to help those who are seeking work to be able to take up the available opportunities.  There is no doubt that these policies are working.  In 2012, there were 6,620 people on the live register in County Monaghan.

That is not a new problem but it is certainly one that I am determined to address.  I know both Senators will support me in every way they can to address it.<\/p><p>Under this Government, the IDA has a strong commitment to increase foreign direct investment in each region by 30% to 40% including, of course, the Border region.  In fairness to the IDA, it does absolutely fantastic work on a global basis in attracting investment to Ireland.  I was at an event yesterday where 550 jobs were announced in two different locations by cutting edge international companies.  The IDA does great work in attracting them into this country and while it will make every effort to show them the facilities outside of the city, they want to come to Dublin.  To be honest, I would rather see them coming here than not coming at all.  We need to say that very clearly.  All foreign direct investment is very welcome and this is a wonderful country in which to do business.  The chief executive of one of the companies said to me that the reason they are coming to this country is because of the highly-skilled workforce and the growing economy.  They want to be part of the success of this economy.  The company was emphatic about that.  <\/p><p>Enterprise Ireland also had a record year in 2017.  Enterprise Ireland supported companies employ 209,000 people and IDA client companies employ 210,000 people.  Almost half of the new jobs created by IDA last year were outside Dublin.  Some 64% of the new jobs created by Enterprise Ireland were outside Dublin.  We are moving in the right direction.  The latest figures from the CSO show that there are an extra 48,100 people at work in comparison to this time last year, with nine out of every ten new jobs being created outside Dublin.  It is clear that a lot of good work is going on and that we are heading in the right direction.<\/p><p>I make no apology for standing here when we are speaking about a company in Monaghan and saying that I will have a strong focus on the Border region.  I will be treating it as an area that deserves special attention through the different initiatives, the regional plans and the regional development fund.  As I have said, one of my first acts as Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation was to arrange a meeting with the four local authorities, Cavan, Monaghan, Louth and Meath and senior officials from Enterprise Ireland, the IDA and my own Department to discuss how we can drive job creation in the region and also to discuss how we can work on a collaborative basis.  The food, mushroom, pig and engineering industries are all very strong in our area.  It is a question of how we can support existing businesses and encourage new start-ups.  The foreign direct investors are also looking for clusters and we have to show them the strength of what we have and that we have something special.  I know we have that in counties Cavan and Monaghan, indeed right across the Border region.  I am committed to that goal. <\/p><p>I have only been in the Department two months.  Things take time, but I will be working towards that goal.  My door will be open to anyone who wants to assist in driving that agenda.  I understand that Brexit will present challenges but it will also present opportunities.  I want to use this opportunity to say to our indigenous industries that they should get in touch with the local enterprise office and Enterprise Ireland.  There are many supports out there to help them prepare for the risks that Brexit will present.  They must identify the risks in their companies, mitigate for the risks by diversifying the markets and investing in research, development and innovation.  One thing that has been found is that companies that invested in innovation during the difficult years of the downturn were the ones most likely to survive.  Companies need to be Brexit ready and ensure they remain competitive.  There are supports out there and I ask them to please use every opportunity to avail of the services that Enterprise Ireland in particular and the local enterprise offices have put in place.<\/p><p>I thank the Senators for raising this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018021400002#TT00300","speaker":"1249","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1518604200,"counter":585,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for that response.
