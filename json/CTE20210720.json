This follows on from our meetings with Horse Racing Ireland, the Irish Horse Racing Regulatory Board and Irish Racehorse Trainers Association.  This series of meetings was called on foot of recent allegations made in the media.  However, it must be stated, we are not a committee of inquiry, so we are not here to judge the veracity of statements made or explore any allegations of wrongdoing against any person.  Our only objective is to establish what systems and processes are in place and to see if they are up to international standards and to discuss any policy issues arising.<\/p> <p>  I remind witnesses and members that I will not allow criticism of anyone in particular and anyone who is not here to defend himself or herself.  I remind them of the parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.<\/p> <p>  I welcome the following officials from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine: Dr. Kevin Smyth, assistant secretary general; Mr. Michael Sheahan, deputy chief veterinary officer; and Mr. Tim Drea, head of the investigation unit.

The support provided by public funds through investment in the industry has enabled Ireland to develop a world-class reputation for excellence in thoroughbred horse racing and breeding.  The most recent estimates provided by Deloitte in 2017 show employment from the core breeding and racing industry, off course betting and secondary expenditure resulted in 28,500 jobs and generated &euro;1.84 billion.  Ireland is the largest producer of thoroughbred foals in Europe and the third largest in the world, behind the US and Australia.  Some 60% of Irish thoroughbreds born annually are exported, with 80% exported to Britain.  Thoroughbred breeders are based in every county and 92% own five mares or fewer.  The value of thoroughbreds sold at public auction in 2020 was &euro;151 million.  Britain accounted for &euro;123 million of this amount.<\/p> <p>  Horse Racing Ireland, HRI, is a commercial state body established under the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act 2001.  It falls under the aegis of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  The Horse Racing Ireland Act 2016 provides that Horse Racing Ireland is responsible for the overall administration, governance, development and promotion of the Irish horse racing industry, and for guaranteeing funding to the racing regulatory board to carry out its functions through an integrity services budget which is agreed annually.<\/p> <p>  Financial support is received from the State through the horse and greyhound racing fund under section 12 of the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act 2001.  Some &euro;96 million was allocated to that fund in budget 2021, of which &euro;76.8 million was allocated to HRI.<\/p> <p>  Oversight of the role of HRI is provided through a shareholder&rsquo;s letter of expectation, the HRI strategic plan, compliance with the code of governance for State bodies, and regular liaison meetings among other things.<\/p> <p>  Since 1 January 2018, the Irish Horseracing Regulatory Board, IHRB, is the regulatory body for all horse racing in Ireland.  The IHRB is a company limited by guarantee set up by the Turf Club, which was established in 1790, and the Irish National Hunt Steeplechase Committee for the purpose of carrying out the regulatory and licensing functions for Irish horse racing.  This body is responsible for protecting the integrity and reputation of Irish horse racing in Ireland.  The Irish Horseracing Industry Act 1994, as amended, provides for the IHRB to have the following functions: to regulate horse racing; to make and enforce the rules of racing and in so doing to promote integrity and fair play in horse racing; to provide adequate integrity services for horse racing; and to license racecourses under the rules of racing.  Legislation provides for the IHRB to be responsible for the &ldquo;making and enforcing of the Rules of Racing&rdquo;, including &ldquo;making all decisions relating to doping control, forensics and handicapping in respect of horse racing.&rdquo;  Funding is provided by HRI on the basis of an agreed annual budget.  <\/p> <p>  In regard to welfare initiatives, HRI has an industry assistance programme in place called EQUUIP which provides education and upskilling with other supports through industry assistance programmes.  The Irish Thoroughbred Welfare Council was formed in January 2020 to guide HRI policy in this area.  This is a project working to ensure the widespread adoption of International Federation Horseracing Authorities, IFHA, basic standards.  HRI and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine work closely with the Irish Equine Centre, and its impending redevelopment is a future keystone of horse care in Ireland.  HRI&rsquo;s policy is reflected in the document Promoting Responsible Thoroughbred Ownership, to which bodies concerned with welfare within the horse racing and breeding industry subscribe.  The key message is that those who own or keep a horse are morally and legally responsible for its health, welfare and safety.  HRI directly supports the Irish Horse Welfare Trust which seeks to rehome and retrain thoroughbreds no longer active in training or racing.<\/p> <p>  In regard to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine's role in investigations, the Department is the principal regulator of the agrifood sector with regard to non-compliance with the illegal use of veterinary medicines and animal welfare issues.  The IHRB regulates horse racing, as previously described.  There are common compliance issues of interest to both regulatory bodies.  The investigations division was established in 2014 as part of the ongoing modernisation of the structures of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the wider public service reform process.  The division&rsquo;s mission is: to support the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, its agencies and other relevant bodies by providing the capability to have investigations carried out as requested and to ensure that such investigations are carried out to a standard that will withstand legal scrutiny; to contribute to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine's capacity in horizon scanning and risk analysis; and to support the implementation of control regimes and the development of legislation underpinning these within the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and its agencies, as required.<\/p><p> The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine's investigations division supports the work of IHRB through a memorandum of understanding, and the Department's principal regulatory activity involves risk-based inspection regimes and non-compliance generally, which attract financial and administrative sanctions.  The Department carries out thousands of inspections annually in many diverse areas.<\/p><p> As members will see from my statement, the relationship between the Department, HRI and the IHRB is complex.  The Department&rsquo;s remit covers not just the issue of finance but also issues of governance and standards in areas such as welfare and inspection.  The operation of the rules of racing and doping controls are clearly within the legislative remit of the IHRB, which is set in statute, to safeguard its operational independence.  I am happy to take questions but first, with the Chairman's agreement, I would like my colleague, Mr. Sheahan, to say a few words about last night's programme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021072000002#A00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Kevin Smyth","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1626735600,"counter":12,"content":"<p>That is fine.  I thank Dr. Smyth.  Many of us saw the programme last night and it was extremely disturbing.  It was not pleasant viewing for anyone who loves horse racing.

It was not a nice programme, so we would welcome a comment from Mr. Sheahan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021072000002#B00200","speaker":"1611"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1626735600,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I will not comment on the programme in detail, as, like the members, I saw it for the first time last night.  I will need to watch it again to pick up on some of the points in detail.  Obviously, a few issues came up.  For me the most striking issue was that of horse slaughter, so I might say a few words on that point in particular.  There are other points as well, but the horse slaughter and the footage from the abattoir in Swindon struck home with me most.  I will say a bit about what happens in Ireland in regard to horse slaughter.<br\/><br\/>For background, until January of this year, there was a so-called tripartite agreement in place which effectively allowed for the free movement of horses between Ireland, Britain and France.  That free movement meant that there was no need for a health certificate or any other documentation apart from the passport to move a horse from here to Britain or to France.  That has changed since 1 January 2021.  Since then, if you want to move a horse from Ireland to Britain, you have to go through the full rigours of involving a veterinarian, obtaining a health certificate and so on, so it is now more complicated than it was before.  Until January, horses could be moved between here and Britain and <i>vice versa<\/i>without any difficulty.<br\/><br\/>In regard to horse slaughter, I have been involved in this area for about 20 years within the Department.  At various times, we slaughter horses in Ireland.  The number slaughtered varies from year to year.  At one stage, we had as many as four slaughter plants in Ireland involved in slaughtering horses.  Currently, we have only one slaughter plant.  We have two approved plants, but one of them is out of action because there was a fire on the premises.<br\/><br\/>I am happy to say we are very satisfied with how the slaughter plant here operates, or how the plants operated in the past.  They are operated and regulated in much the same way as beef or sheep slaughter plants.  We have a full-time official Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine veterinarian present at all times when slaughter is taking place.  Ante and post-mortem inspection is carried out, and temporary veterinary inspectors carry out the post-mortem inspection, supported by technical staff.  We have very detailed guidelines as to how the slaughter plant operates, and in fact we have a 51-page standard operating procedure detailing every aspect of how the horses are taken in, the documentary and identity checks, the ante-mortem and post-mortem and so on.<br\/><br\/>I have been in our slaughter plants, although not in the last two years due to Covid-19 restrictions but certainly in the past, and they operate to a very high standard, as do our other slaughter plants.  Probably, for those who saw the programme last night, and for myself certainly, the single most surprising thing about it was the apparent method of slaughter of the horses.  What we saw on the footage appeared to be horses being led into a room or ante-chamber, and we appeared to see a slaughter-man with a rifle.  In some cases, it appeared that he was taking a shot at the horse from a distance and in other cases it looked like he was holding the horse by the halter with one hand and apparently trying to shoot the horse with the other hand.<br\/><br\/>I have to say it was, to put it mildly, very surprising for many reasons, including health and safety reasons, and from an animal welfare point of view.  For the avoidance of any doubt, that is certainly not something that happens here.  I do not know if it happened in the distant past, but it certainly did not in my time.  That does not happen.  When horses are slaughtered in a slaughter plant here, they are dealt with in the same way as cattle.  I am sure members have seen how slaughter plants operate.  The horse, bovine or sheep goes up along a shoot and into a restraining box where it is properly restrained, stunned and killed.  There is no question that we would allow an animal, such as a horse, to wander around a room or to be held by an individual attempting to shoot it.  That was a surprising element of the programme, and that is certainly not what happens here.<br\/><br\/>As recently as 2019 we were audited by the European Commission's DG for Health and Food Safety, which used to be called DG SANTE.  It did a comprehensive audit of our whole horse slaughter procedure, including the identification issues, residues, the ante-mortem, the welfare and so on.  Their report is publicly available.  In general, it was a very positive audit, as I would have expected.  There are other aspects of the programme I can talk about, if the members so wish.  However, for me, the aspect of slaughter was certainly the most striking.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021072000002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Sheahan"},{"type":"speech","time":1626735600,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Sheahan.  I will move to questions, but I would like to ask Dr. Smyth some questions first.  I return to the opening statement which states that legislation provides for the Irish Horseracing Regulatory Board, IHRB, to be responsible for the making and enforcing of the rules of racing, including making all decisions relating to doping control, forensics and handicapping in respect of horse racing and that funding is provided by HRI on the basis of an agreed annual budget.  I have two questions on this and a third question for Dr. Smyth.  Does he think it is appropriate that the membership of the IHRB is self-appointed from within the horse racing industry, given the fact that it is responsible for all surveillance of controls?  In order to have proper governance and to restore public confidence in the system, is it time this legislation was revisited and the appointment of people to IHRB was re-examined?  This has come up at our two previous meetings.  It seems odd in the modern world, and in the context of proper governance, that the people who are in charge of the industry are appointed from within to govern the surveillance and the integrity of that industry.<\/p> <p>  The second question to raise its head is that the IHRB is funded by the HRI, with very significant State funding being contributed.  Does Dr. Smyth believe it is correct that the salaries of senior members of the executive of the IHRB are not publicly available?  What is his view on that?<\/p><p>I cannot understand, in this age of computers and traceability, how there is not a proper traceability system for horses to enable us to know where they are all the time and all their movements.  I am a farmer.  If we take cattle to the mart, that movement is recorded.  If there is movement from farm to farm, that is also recorded.  It is done on computers and in a seamless fashion.  I cannot understand how every movement of horses is not tracked and monitored by computer in such a valuable industry.  If we had that type of modernised tracking of movement in place, I do not think we would have seen last night's programme investigating the movement of horses to slaughter.  <\/p><p> An important issue was raised last night.  Today may not be the day to address this aspect, and we might need another meeting in that regard, and I also do not expect Dr. Smyth to be fully briefed on it, but the programme last night dealt with the case of a horse being raced in Fairyhouse.  The horse had an accident on the racecourse and had to be euthanised.  Five or six years later, that microchip turned up in Swindon.  That was a serious finding in that programme last night.  Dr. Smyth may not have had enough time to have researched the details the programme last night and I respect that.  This is an issue that the committee will be returning to in future.  If we had a properly computerised and monitored traceability system for the movement of horses, I do not think we would be dealing with a situation such as this.  I ask Dr. Smyth to address those questions first.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021072000002#B00400","speaker":"1611","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1626735600,"counter":16,"content":"<p>I will deal with the first two questions and then leave the matter of the identity of horses to Mr. Sheahan.  On the first question, it is clear in law where responsibility lies regarding the regulation of horse racing.  The IHRB is legally responsible for making and enforcing the rules of racing.  It makes all the decisions regarding doping control, forensics and handicapping, and the organisation is independent in respect of what the law states.  Having said that, strict controls are imposed on the IHRB concerning corporate governance and financial accountability.  The issue that seems to be arising, and the one the Chair has referred to, is the make-up of the committee.  It has six members and one chairperson and there are two issues in this regard.  One concerns whether it is necessary to have an independent person or persons on that committee.  A second issue which has come up is the gender balance of the committee.  It is not for me to dictate its make-up, but a strong message is coming through in that regard.<\/p> <p>  Turning to the funding of HRI, the &euro;9 million and the situation with the salaries, this is a complex issue and it does not just apply to the IHRB.  Several State bodies do not report the exact salaries of their staff.  That is permitted under the 2016 Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies in respect of provision 1.4 of the subsection on business and financial reporting requirements.  State bodies covered by this provision are allowed to publish details of the number of employees within pay bands.  From &euro;60,000 upwards, it is necessary for such bodies to report in lots of &euro;10,000 roughly what is being paid to their employees.  <\/p> <p>  Generally, what is reported is just the amount paid and the number of employees in that band.  That is perfectly permissible.  It is being done by HRI and the Irish National Stud as well.  It is allowable under the code of governance.  The actual salary of the chief executive, for example, is reported to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  Exact details are provided, but that information is confidential and commercially sensitive.  It would be a breach of the general data protection regulation, GDPR, to disclose it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021072000002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Kevin Smyth"},{"type":"speech","time":1626735600,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I am not asking Dr. Smyth to disclose the information.

I thank the officials from the Department for coming in.  The Chair has touched on some of the issues already and the programme last night was harrowing to watch.  However, not every horse going through that abattoir was a racehorse.  Many of them were ponies and probably sport horses originating in Ireland and the UK.  We have an issue regarding the traceability of horses in this country and the responsibility in this regard is spread across several regulatory bodies, including the HRI, Weatherbys and Horse Sport Ireland, HSI.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Finnian McLoughlin, a constituent of mine, contacted the Department last November and highlighted that 18 horses on the sport horse register were still registered in his name.  Of those 18 horses, two were dead, two had been exported and were dead, another two had been exported, nine were sold, one he had never owned and two more had been sold and exported.  When Mr. McLoughlin contacted Horse Sport Ireland, he was informed that it was the responsibility of the new owners to complete the transfer of ownership forms and not his.  Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine permits were issued for at least two of these horses and Mr. McLoughlin understood that at least two more of those horses were disposed of in one of the Department-approved abattoirs mentioned earlier.  Mr. McLoughlin also understood that four more horses had been exported to the UK.  In that instance, however, the new owners are not required to complete a change of ownership form with Horse Sport Ireland.  <\/p> <p>  Therefore, we can see that there is a major grey area regarding the ownership of horses in Ireland and we have a responsibility in this regard.  We are a horse-loving nation and we take great pride in and highly value our reputation as an equine nation.  The onus in this regard must be on the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to get to grips with this issue of horse ownership.  As the Chair rightly said, and as my colleague, Deputy Fitzmaurice, stated at our last meeting, we know exactly where a calf has been from the moment it is born until the day it ends up on a plate.  Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for horses originating in Ireland.  This is a major grey area.  I appreciate that the witnesses are not going to be able to wholly address this aspect with us here today, but we must get information on horse ownership, traceability of horses, where and how horses are sold and where they are exported to collated in one central database.  In this modern age, it is inconceivable that we have not been able to hack this.  I appreciate that other members have questions as well, but I would like the witnesses to address this issue before the close of this meeting and to state what the Department is going to do in this regard.  I refer to going away, examining this issue and then trying to devise one central source of information on the ownership of horses and the tracking of horses post-sale.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021072000002#C00600","speaker":"1597"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1626735600,"counter":21,"content":"<p>Does the Chair want me to address that issue of traceability now?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021072000002#C00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Sheahan"},{"type":"speech","time":1626735600,"counter":22,"content":"<p>We constantly get stuck for time in these meetings, but if Mr. Sheahan can give us a brief answer, I ask him to go ahead and do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021072000002#C00800","speaker":"1611"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1626735600,"counter":23,"content":"<p>I agree with the Chair and Deputy Flaherty that traceability in the horse sector is nowhere near as good as it is in the cattle industry.  I have no hesitation in saying that our system of traceability for cattle is, if not the best in the world, then definitely among the best in the world.  It is a superb system and the envy of every other agricultural country in the world, and indeed of health systems.  We really do have a Rolls Royce-standard system in place when it comes to the traceability of cattle.  Having said that, it has taken us more than 50 years to develop that system.  We started off with tagging and blue cards and since then we have slowly but surely built up the system over the years.  A huge impetus came from the bovine spongiform encephalopathy, BSE, crisis, which basically forced Ireland, and other countries, to develop the exemplary system we have now.<\/p> <p>  We do not have such a Rolls Royce-type system for horses.  We have come a long way in this regard, however.  I was first involved in this area back in about 2007.<\/p><p>There was very little traceability of any sort in respect of horses.  Things have improved considerably since then.  For example, we now have premises registration legislation, which, I believe, was introduced in 2014.  There are now 27,000 premises registered in Ireland.  At least we now know where the vast majority of horses are.  We have the change of ownership legislation, which we did not have previously.  We also have a central database within the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  It is not as good as the cattle database, but it is good.

In the thoroughbred sector it is 100%.  There is no question about that.  With regard to the non-thoroughbred sector, I will give an example.  We started going to the Ballinasloe horse fair.  Everybody knows that the Ballinasloe fair is the biggest of its kind in Europe.  We started going there about ten years ago when we first started making a move to improve traceability and identification.  We set up a number of checkpoints with the co-operation of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na around the entrance and exit to the Ballinasloe fair.  During the first year we did this, it is fair to say that the number of horses with passports and microchips was very low.  We are talking about 10% to 15%.  Obviously, these were not thoroughbreds.  During that first year of checkpoints, we advised people that if they turned up the next year without a passport and microchip for the each horse, they would be turned away.  The second year the compliance level was very high and the third year we had nearly 100% compliance.  This was even among the horses belonging to the Traveller community who would frequent the fair at Ballinasloe, and including a lot of horses at the lower end of the market as well as the top-class sport horses.<\/p> <p>  Even at the Ballinasloe fair end of the market, the compliance levels are now light years ahead of where they were.  We have come a long way, but there are still a few more pieces of the jigsaw to be put in place before we have the sort of traceability in the horse sector that exists in the cattle sector.  There are plans in place for that.  My colleagues on the equine identification side are working on having an equine census in place before the end of the year.  This will be another bit of the jigsaw to improve the traceability.  There is still a way to go.  The sector is on a journey.  It is clear that this committee is of the view that more should be done and perhaps it can give the issue of traceability a further push.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021072000002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Sheahan"},{"type":"speech","time":1626735600,"counter":27,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Sheahan.

Doping often involves considerable cruelty to the horses involved.  Obviously, what we saw on the programme last night was extremely disturbing.  As a person who sees horse racing on television every week, I am always struck that in the presentation of it to the public, and the reason people like it so much, a great love for the horse is projected in all the talk around the sport and in the commentary about the animals.  The picture we are getting in recent times in Ireland, however, is that while we might be a horse-loving nation - to use Deputy Flaherty's phrase - and while there might be many people in horse racing who do love horses, there seem to be many people in the horse racing industry who do not love horses and who see them as machines and entities to be used for making money.  One of the reasons we are so concerned about the possibility of a massive drug problem in Irish horse racing is because we know what is going on in America where horses have been broken down and given drugs to mask pain so they can be used to death.  We have now seen a documentary that tells us 4,000 horses are being slaughtered in Britain.<\/p> <p>  I thank our guests for coming in.  My questions for them today really come down to whether they are being too conservative in approach to their work and whether they are actually pursuing an animal welfare agenda.  I will start by asking the officials whether it is against the law in the State to transport over a long distance injured animals for slaughter?  If this is not against the law, why is that the case?  While the officials cannot comment here because they cannot criticise policy, and their answers here today are very guarded, they are the people responsible for encouraging policy-making and urging legislation.  The officials are behind the legislation that is brought before these Houses.  If such a practice is not against the law why is it not?  If it is against the law how is it that the Department is not enforcing the law?  With great respect to the officials, it is hard for us to believe that they are very surprised by what was on the documentary last night.  Most people would feel that the Department had a fair idea for some time that this kind of thing is going on.

I am not at all clear whether an investigation was done to establish that whatever contaminant was in the feed was not there for a nefarious reason.<\/p><p>I do not know whether it was a contaminant that got into particular horse feed or whether it got into horse feed used by certain stables or yards.  Did the Department chase that down and did it act in time to take samples?

Zilpaterol is a beta-agonist that is illegal in Europe.  It is used in the USA, South Africa and other countries as a growth promoter for beef cattle.  When discovered in Ireland, it is treated as a food or feed safety incident, which triggers our incident management plan.  The Department's response is governed by the official control of foodstuffs regulation, namely, Regulation (EU) 2017\/625, which requires all member states to have the capacity to respond to these types of incidents.  In practice, all the relevant staff in the Department, the Food Safety Authority and associated agencies would have been brought together in a small group.  This all happened over hours and days so it was all done very quickly; as quickly as the laboratory results could be generated.  It is a requirement of the official controls regulation that the animal feed industry has full traceability from raw material to finished product and out to the customer, and Ireland has that.  Once this issue was identified, Department staff would have gone to the feed mill, gone through its feed milling process and sampled the raw materials, and then gone back to the importer.  Within a very short period - from memory it was a matter of a few days - the origin of the problem was discovered.<\/p> <p>  The origin of the problem was a molasses mixing plant in South Africa.  It was the first shipment from that plant to Europe and that plant had a mixing system that allowed it to incorporate Zilpaterol into molasses as a growth promoter in beef cattle, which can be done legitimately in South Africa.  That is the practice in America as well.  Unfortunately, an importer, a Belgian multinational company, bought molasses from that plant.  The level of Zilpaterol identified in the samples was very low.  We got samples and tested feed and raw materials.  We communicated with the European Commission and other agencies.  The level of Zilpaterol in both the feed and the raw material was low enough for us to conclude that there was no feed or food safety issue, which is our focus.  However, the fact is Zilpaterol was there and that is also an equine doping issue.  We and the equine industry have no tolerance for Zilpaterol.  You cannot have it so when it is there our focus is around food and feed safety.  We were satisfied that it was not a food or feed safety issue.  All the product was withdrawn and taken out of the feed chain as a precaution.  The conclusion of that investigation is that this was what is described in the legislation as a contained isolated incident of external cause.  We are absolutely satisfied that this was not deliberate.  There was no logic to the possibility that there could have been a deliberate cross-contamination here and there was no line of sight between the raw material importer and the end user.  The zilpaterol came from South Africa in a load of molasses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021072000002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tim Drea"},{"type":"speech","time":1626735600,"counter":73,"content":"<p>Did the Department take samples from the end users?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021072000002#F00300","speaker":"1673"},{"type":"speech","time":1626735600,"counter":74,"content":"<p>We have to move on to other members.

Some &euro;96 million was allocated to the horse and greyhound racing fund in budget 2021, and &euro;76.8 million of that went to HRI.  According to the Department's submission to the committee, an investigation division was established in 2014, with three of the main purposes being:<\/p> <blockquote> \t1. To support [the Department], its agencies and other relevant Bodies [like the IHRB] by providing the capability to have investigations carried out as requested and to ensure that such investigations are carried out to a standard that will withstand legal scrutiny.<br \/><br \/>2. To contribute to [the Department's] capacity in horizon scanning and risk analysis.<br \/><br \/>3.

If they were to contact the Department directly, what would its course of action be?  Have such allegations come across the witnesses' desks directly?  If so, what actions have they taken?  Since this controversy arose, I have been refused details about the number and nature of concerns that have been submitted to the IHRB's hotline.  Much of what we have heard from the IHRB we have to take on good faith.  Would the Department consider demanding a full account of the allegations that have been made to the IHRB and how these allegations have been assessed?  Has the Department considered holding an inquiry into the operations of the IHRB and HRI to ensure full transparency at this stage and to ensure that all allegations are being fully followed up?<\/p><p>There seems to be a difference of opinion between the IHRB and the Irish Racehorse Trainers Association about whether authorised officers should conduct inspections without the presence of a vet.  Is the Department aware of this difference of opinion and what is its view on that?  Why were the results of the PRISM Leadership and Change Consultingemployee survey?  These have not been made public.  Millions of euro of taxpayers' money are given to the industry each year, but we are not allowed to see the issues that report may have uncovered.

There are no formal qualifications necessary for authorised officers.  The Minister authorises officers to carry out regulatory functions across all of our areas.  We treat IHRB authorised officers like our own authorised officers.  There are couple of important points about authorised officers.  Authorised officers in the context of the IHRB act as part of a team.  While there are concerns about individual qualifications, the legislation underpinning this authorisation is the veterinary medicines legislation.  It requires people who carry out any of the functions of an authorised officer are authorised to do so.  I think in the last session there was a discussion around an example of five or six people arriving to a racing premises to carry out an inspection.  All those people need to be authorised officers.  For example, the man who stands at the back gate to make sure a lorry does not drive out needs to be an authorised officer.  He does not need to be a vet.  That is how my division functions, and has functioned for years.  The division I manage has all four streams of Department staff.  All of them are authorised officers.  Basically, the requirement to be an authorised officer is to have the capacity to fulfil the duties of the job.  In the case of IHRB, that would be to have a knowledge of horse racing and to have experience in a role in the IHRB.  Maybe this information will help members understand about the qualifications and the authorised officers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021072000002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tim Drea"},{"type":"speech","time":1626735600,"counter":84,"content":"<p>Would Deputy Martin Browne like to respond?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021072000002#G00400","speaker":"1611"},{"type":"speech","time":1626735600,"counter":85,"content":"<p>I would like to ask about the \"Panorama\" programme.

Deputy Browne mentioned the \"Panorama\" programme.  I could go on for the full remaining hour about last night's \"Panorama\" programme.  Without being flippant, I am conscious that we convened today with a different agenda, which was formed prior to the airing of last night's programme.  However, I would hate to miss the opportunity to get the bottom, or as close to it as possible, of the accusations of doping.  I will concentrate on that.  We may have to have a separate, stand-alone meeting on last night's programme.  There are many unanswered questions.  As a horse owner, I had a pit in my stomach last night watching the programme.  I could only visualise my own horse.  The vast majority of owners would look at it in that way.  There are questions to be answered on last night's programme.  If there is time at the end, the Department might comment on how horse agents are registered.  Are they registered or licensed?  There are many questions to be answered which were not asked of horse agents, hauliers, and both the proprietors and management of the abattoir in question.<\/p> <p>  I want to move back to the agenda, which was on the recent articles with accusations of doping.  I have a few questions for the Department.  It was in its submission to us, and it is a historical fact, that the Turf Club was founded in 1790.  That was under a different administration.  Which came first?  Was it the chicken or the egg?  We had a Turf Club and we had horse racing before we had an Irish Department.  If it is the monitoring and controlling body, how did that relationship evolve?  It had a stronger foundation.  The Department might comment on how it thinks things evolved there.  Who has control of the situation?<\/p> <p>  I want to go back to the well-documented issue of the quarter tonne of nitrotain that came in.  That was an equivalent of 62,500 doses.  Did the Department pursue where that went?  Where were they administered?  Does it have any idea in what establishments the horses were based?  Where were 62,500 doses going?  Where did they possibly even get to?<\/p> <p>  On the question of the zilpaterol, who brought the horse to France?  If nobody brought the horse to France, would we have ever discovered that within our system?  For how long could it have been going on?  For how long could it have been prevalent?  If the horse had not gone to France and if the French had not detected the drugs, for how long could it have been an issue here?  How far behind the curve are we?<\/p> <p>  I presume the Department has a regulatory role for feed contact.  Maybe it is a different section of Department but is it not analysing feed?  It would be the source of the drug.  We seem to be looking at the blood and urine samples of the horse.  If the feed had been tested, the problem would have been solved straight away.  How long would it have taken if the horse had not gone to France?<\/p> <p>  With a view to solutions to the issues at hand, to the issues highlighted by some people or to the accusations that have been made, what changes can we make going forward?  What changes can the Department make?  Could the Department comment on the role of the Irish Equine Centre in Johnstown.  What role does the Department have there?  A major capital development project has been put forward in plans by HRI.  Does the Department believe we could possibly do our own testing on a national basis in the Irish Equine Centre in Johnstown?  How well would that improve the control of doping, or suggestions of doping, here?  We would not be exporting samples or using labs outside of Ireland if we had our own national lab in the Irish Equine Centre.<\/p> <p>  As I said, I do not mind questions on last night&rsquo;s programme being deferred to the end.

These entities are a great deal older than us.  However, there has been a sea change since 2018, both in corporate governance and in accountability.  The IHRB has a strong relationship with HRI.  It explains how it spends money, its integrity budget, its regular meetings, and how its accounts for it.  It is still independent with regard to the rules of racing.  Its accountability, from a financial and corporate governance point of view, has moved greatly.<\/p> <p>  The second area I want to deal with is the issue of the Irish Equine Centre.  The Senator is correct that there is a commitment in the programme for Government for a major overhaul of the Irish Equine Centre.

The figure, which is well documented in the media, is about 225 k of nitrotain.  That figure came from the supplier who provided the 6 k that were seized in, I think, 2012.  It was imported by a vet who was subsequently prosecuted.  The evidence, which is not disputed, was that individual had purchased 225 k of nitrotain over at least ten years.  It was over a long period, but it was still approximately 25 k per year, on average.<\/p><p>I do not have the historic data on when that started and finished, but I know it was a ten-year period.<\/p><p> In terms of the Department's follow-up, it was well before my time.  I know a little bit about the case.  There was one prosecution and there may have been a second.  A number of premises were visited.  The person who imported the Nitrotain refused to reveal where he had used it.  The only evidence I am aware might have existed at the time was certain weak material that investigators tried their best to use to arrive at a point where they could take it further.  I had no knowledge of the case beyond that, other than what I know from colleagues who are no longer with our division.  A significant effort was made at the time.<\/p><p> There are real evidential problems.  If residue, the physical product or something else that has evidential value is not minded that is always a challenge with this type of things in terms of getting to court.  The national residue control panel in the Department tests for zilpaterol.  Under that plan, I understand that approximately 900 animals are tested, including cattle, sheep, horses and anything that can end up in the food chain.  Zilpaterol is one of the things for which tests are carried out.  Testing is carried out with a view to identifying food or feed safety issues.  We have never found zilpaterol under the national residue control plan.  Would we have found it if it had not cropped up in France?  I cannot honestly say that we definitely would have found it.  The level that was found in that sample would not have indicated a food or feed safety issue.  We might not have found it.

Why have the witnesses been lagging behind and not bringing this system from the 1970s up to standard?  This passport system is costly for horse owners.

That is what EU legislation requires.  EU legislation on this has been updated a number of times and extra safeguards have been built into the system so there is now a more standardised system of passports.  The reality is that in Britain, for example, there are 90 different passport-issuing bodies.  Germany has a similar number.  We have a relatively small number of passport-issuing bodies but they are all governed by EU legislation.  That dictates that horses have to be accompanied by a passport in a relatively standard format.  They have to be microchipped and so on.  There is room for improvement regarding traceability, as I talked about at the start.  While we have a central database, which is required by EU legislation, it is not as slick an operation as the AIM system, which the Deputy mentioned earlier.  There is a worldwide system.  Horses travel all over the world for competition for the passport and microchip system is the internationally recognised standard.<\/p> <p>  As already stated, there are moves towards more digital systems.  Those who are involved in the sector will know that this year, for the first time, Weatherbys in Ireland and, presumably in Britain too, has started to issue the so-called smart card in addition to the standard paper document.  That is something that will develop further over time.  We will probably move more towards electronic systems.  At the moment, nationally, at EU level and indeed internationally, your book, passport and markings taken by a vet, as well as microchipping, are the standard system.  It has improved a lot.

If it takes me 50 years to build something, and if I move it on to something else, doing so is not that complex.  With the horse industry, why have we not brought in a chip, DNA and AIM system where there is a card set up for each horse?  If a farmer wants to move a calf, a weanling or a bullock, he or she can go online and do it in a matter of five or ten minutes.  It is no big deal.  If it goes to a mart, the mart will do it automatically.<\/p><p>If an animal is exported it basically tells them straight out so you can write them off.  If an animal dies and goes to a knackery, it is the same system.<\/p><p> There was talk of the EU wanting this and the EU wanting that, in the line that we are sort of doing what the EU wants.  For an industry that is so important, why is Ireland not leading the way ahead of everyone else?  Mr. Sheahan talked about Hong Kong but he also mentioned the UK, France and other places.  When we have probably one of the best systems brought in for cattle why are we not leading the way?  Will we lead the way in the next six months because of the controversies and the dangers involved with the talk at the moment about all of this?  There was a programme last night but I did not see it.  That programme covered the investigative side of it, the doping side of it and all the different angles.  Why are we not European leaders on this?  Forget about EU legislation; we should ensure Ireland is out there in front and has the transparency.  That system is on our right hand because we have had it done for some time.

To be quite frank about it, it could be done over a six-month period provided everyone is told.  Everyone has an equine number if he or she has a horse, at least, or he or she has a herd number.  Generally though, it is an equine number.  If everyone were told he or she had six months to regularise that animal, that it must have a chip in it or he or she must have a card for it, and we got that up and running, would it not be a massive step towards putting Ireland to the fore first of all?  It would cut out a lot of this stuff that is going on, sort of under the breath, about what is happening in Irish horse racing.  We hear it day in and day out that horses can go out the back door when the boys or girls come to the front door.<\/p> <p>  There is an onus on the Department to lead the way on this.

The \"Panorama\" programme influenced the meeting.  It was not on the agenda but serious questions were raised in that programme last night.  That is something the committee will be revisiting as quickly as possible.  The witnesses said earlier in the day that we have two abattoirs in this country.  There is a question over how many horses are euthanised there and various questions were asked but I keep going back to the fact that a microchip appeared in an abattoir in Swindon in a horse that had been euthanised six years beforehand.  That really brings the authenticity of microchipping into question.  The Department will investigate that.<\/p> <p>  In the \"Panorama\" programme last night it was stated that there were numerous cases of horses with two microchips appearing in that abattoir.  Do we have any instances of horses appearing in an abattoir in Ireland with two microchips?  Will there be correspondence between the abattoir in Swindon and the Department to get further information from that abattoir and from the officials there about what the incidence of horses appearing with two microchips is and how many of those have involved Irish horses?  I will not go back to the witnesses for answers today but there are a lot of questions arising from last night's programme and it did not do the reputation of horse racing any good.<\/p> <p>  As I said previously, it is not all thoroughbreds that are going into that abattoir.  I would like to get the figures on how many are thoroughbreds and there are a lot of other horses going in there as well.  Horse welfare is universal and it is not just confined to thoroughbreds.  Any horse being mistreated is completely and utterly unacceptable.  As Senator Paul Daly said previously, one would be abhorred to be a horse owner and see the way horses were being treated in that abattoir.  It raised questions.  We will be returning to that programme and we will be coming back to the Department to get answers on how Ireland operates euthanasia.  Unfortunately, when a horse has a serious injury or has certain ailments, euthanasia is the most humane way to treat that animal but it has to be done under veterinary control and in a supervised manner.  Last night's programme left an awful lot of questions to be answered and it is something we will return to with the Department in the near future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021072000002#O00900","speaker":"1611"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1626735600,"counter":220,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 11.46 a.m. and resumed at 3.30 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Impact of Peat Shortages on the Horticultural Industry: Discussion","time":1626735600,"counter":221,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021072000002#P00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1626735600,"counter":222,"content":"<p>From the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, I welcome Mr. Barry Delany, chief plant health officer, and Mr. Declan Harty, agricultural inspector.

To say there is huge frustration among the horticulture and nursery industries would be an understatement.

They are facing huge financial difficulties as they find themselves facing importation of peat for their industries.  In my view, and I do not think anyone on the committee would argue with me, that is both environmental and economic madness.  Organic industries in this country, both horticulture and nursery, including our mushroom industry, which is financially competitive, could be forced out of business.  Some of them are even considering relocating.  There will be robust questions for the witnesses.  As a committee we want a solution to this impasse.  We feel it is nonsensical.  Hopefully the witnesses will enlighten us as to when we will get over this impasse at which we find ourselves.

In addition, peat extraction involving a new or extended area of 30 ha or more requires an EIA and, therefore, planning permission.  If the site is 30 ha or more, that automatically requires an EIA and, therefore, it automatically requires planning permission.

Both of those regimes require EIAs to be carried out by their respective competent authority, which is the planning authority or the EPA, as well as an AA, if relevant.  An AA or an EIA may not be required if the site is under 30 ha but the best thing to do would be to carry out the EIA screening and an AA screening as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021072000002#P00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Lucas"},{"type":"speech","time":1626735600,"counter":229,"content":"<p>I met Mr. Lucas fairly often in his former life, when he was with the National Parks and Wildlife Service.

Has it tried to prepare any legislation that would resolve this issue in the interim or wind things down as part of a just transition?  I will tell both Departments represented here today that I do not buy into this idea.  In Germany, 3,000 ha, including land on which there is housing, can be blown out for lignite up until 2039 or 2040.  Other EU countries are sending peat and peat briquettes here.  We seem to be the gatekeepers of Europe, if not the world, in the context of this type of legislation.  How are they able to work around it while we are not?  How are they able to keep working while we are not?  How can they do so under their own legislation when we are in the same EU?

The provisions in the Planning and Development Act 2000 as regards environmental impact assessments and appropriate assessments have been in place since 2011.  The regulations have been in place since 2001 and the Planning and Development Act provisions have been in place since 2011.  Each provision has to be looked at separately.  You have to ask yourself whether the exempt development provisions apply.  You are looking at whether it is a new or extended area of less than 10 ha or a new or extended area of 10 ha or more where the drainage of the bogland commenced prior to 21 January 2002.  You would then need to carry out an environmental impact assessment screening and an appropriate assessment screening.  If these show that no environmental impact assessment or appropriate assessment is required, an application can be made under section 5 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 for a declaration to the planning authority that it is exempt development.  As I said earlier, however, if a new or extended area of 30 ha or more is involved, an environmental impact assessment and planning permission are automatically required.  The applicant would have to apply to the planning authority for planning permission.  If the area involved is greater than 50 ha, planning permission and an integrated pollution control licence from the EPA are required.  The law has been there for quite a while.  There is no ban on peat extraction.  The type of peat extraction you engage in does not matter.  The law is the same across the board.  I have tried to summarise the various legislative provisions.

I just wish to put that on the record.  I do not believe any Department was invited.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the position on integrated pollution control, IPC, licensing, Mr. Lucas has hit the nail on the head.  There is no ban and no restriction.  There is just a clear requirement, which is common to all types of development, for operators to meet their legal obligations and to have the necessary consents in place.  That is not the case and has not been for some time.  The requirement to have an IPC licence is not new.  In fact, peat extraction on sites of 50 ha or more became an activity subject to Part IV of the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992 in 1994, meaning that it required an IPC licence.

Legislation was drafted before.  Has the Department liaised with Europe?  Let us look at Germany and many other European countries which are supposed to have the same legislation.  They are supposed to have the same rules in respect of the 10 ha area and the 30 ha area and the same screening-out process if you are to go by the legislation.

Has any Minister or anyone from the Department gone over to Europe about a just transition in horticulture or any other area?  Has anyone liaised like we did years ago?  We were over with those in Europe, not that I have great suss for them or anything.  We were over to DG XI on numerous occasions.  Deputy Carthy would be well familiar with it.

That is the reality.  Our Departments are not doing anything to make sure that this blockage is resolved for a transitional period.  No one is talking about 20 or 30 years.  We are talking about a five to ten-year transition period for the milled peat sector for the sake of jobs, for the mushroom industry down in Monaghan and all those areas, for the horticulture sector and for people who want to buy flowers, whether in cities or rural areas.

We have had a lot of debate and discussion on the production of milled peat at this stage.  We need to talk about solutions.  As someone who has studied horticulture and who has worked in the horticultural sector most of my working life, I acknowledge that soft fruit production, forestry propagation and even nursery stock can manage without the same amount of intervention with regard to peat.  There are loams and soil-based composts.  There are other alternatives but there are no alternatives suitable for mushroom production.<\/p><p>With regard to mushroom production, there are no alternatives.  I do not know if anyone heard or listened to \"CountryWide\" on Saturday.  Mr. Dermot Callaghan, head of horticulture, Teagasc was on.  It was a really good interview.  He again convinced the audience there was no short-term alternative.  We will need a transitional period, as Deputy Fitzmaurice talked about, of a minimum of ten years.  We look at counties Monaghan and Cavan where most of the mushroom production is, though it is around the country but it is predominantly there.  We know we have about 2,000 directly or indirectly involved in the industry.  One of the first things I did when I was elected here was to go to visit County Monaghan and spend a day up there with Monaghan Mushrooms and go through all the various cycle of mushroom production.  What struck me about it was from the very beginning, right out to transport and the fact they were sending mushrooms to the UK.  Some 90% of our mushrooms go abroad.  It is a vast industry with a sort of farm gate value in excess of &euro;120 million in 2019.  This is a wonderful industry.  It needs to be protected.<\/p><p> One of the things I have been told by the people in this sector is that labour is cheap in Poland and other places for this industry.  Many Polish, Latvian and other people worked here in the industry ten years ago, went back home and are now in this sector.  The availability of peat there is easier.  The costs of peat, production and wages are lower.  It will clearly be a real alternative to move this industry out of Ireland.  We have to wake up to that.  We have to look again at Bord Bia and the amount of money it is spending.  I am in support of Bord Bia but they are branded in Bord Bia with regard to Irish produce in mushroom production and it stands over it.  Our demand for our production could increase.  The market is huge.  It has not been fully developed.<\/p><p> It is back to this medium of milled peat.  Really, what I would like to hear today is what the alternatives are.  What research is going on?  Can the Department share with us where we are in terms of funding for research and innovation and alternatives?  It will not happen in the next ten years.  That is clear.  We know that peat will be at the centre of various mediums for horticulture production but especially 90% for the mushroom centre.  I want to hear where we are in terms of research.  What funding has been put into that?  Is there an international or European dimension to this innovation and research?  Clearly we have to do something.<\/p><p> In the short term, we are told by the sector, and I can only go by what we are told, that we will be out of milled peat - forget about all this stockpiling - appropriate for mushroom production this autumn.  That is what we have been told.  What will we do about it?  I want to hear what we will do about it?  Deputy Carthy represents that constituency of those employees whose jobs are on the line.  Deputy Fitzmaurice talked about just transition.  We have to support these people and support this farm gate industry.<\/p><p> My real concern is where we are today.  Can we put the pressure on to agree that we will have to accept peat will be there central to this food production but especially for mushroom production for the next ten years?  Remember what our remit is in this committee.  We are involved in the agrifood sector.  We want to support the agrifood sector.  We want to retain the jobs here.  We want to support rural communities.  It is a win-win-win for us if we can get some sort of movement on allowing milled peat to continue to be milled, albeit at a slightly reduced level.  Let us call a spade a spade.  We want free access to milled peat, especially for the mushroom sector over the next ten years.  I am interested to hear what is happening and what negotiations are going on in the past few weeks especially with the mushroom sector in order that we can protect the industry, the product and the jobs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021072000002#Q00800","speaker":"1634","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1626735600,"counter":238,"content":"<p>Will anyone give us an answer?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021072000002#R00200","speaker":"1611"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1626735600,"counter":239,"content":"<p>I apologise.  I was waiting to be let in.  I hope the committee can hear me clearly.  I am the head of horticulture and plant health.  I thank the Senator for his questions and I take many of his points on board in terms of the importance of the sector.  There is a difference between the peat that is used in mushrooms, black peat, as opposed to that which is used in the amenities sector, brown peat, which is harvested in a different way, comes from different bogs and is approached slightly differently.  In terms of the peat for the mushroom sector, it is a matter of compliance.  When one looks at the figures the horticulture sector is putting forward to us in terms of what is required domestically each year to produce that &euro;120 million that is traded, it is 113,000 cu. m or ten to 15 ha. in total.  The reality is it is a compliance issue here and we should be able to work towards that with the appropriate parties which are extracting.  There does appear to be a route for that given what Mr. Lucas has said earlier on in explaining the approach that can be taken there.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the peat alternatives, as the Senator has said, the head of horticulture in Teagasc gave an interview on Saturday and outlined some of the issues and proposals it has done.  We actively looked to alternatives on peat and we funded a number of research projects through the producer organisation scheme of which commercial mushrooms are part, as well as Monaghan Mushrooms.  Within that, they are looking at stabilisation and peat-casing reduction, spent mushroom compost and the potential for blends and substitutes and partial peat replacers.  That is ongoing.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is supporting that via the implementation of the producer organisation scheme.  We also issued the 2021 research call.  Within that one of the areas of research was to find alternatives to peat-based growing media for horticulture production which are available, affordable, sustainable and meet quality, environmental and productive requirements.<\/p> <p>  One is looking at evaluating each sector because, obviously, what will work in the ornamental sector is different to what will work in mushrooms at the amenities side in the vegetable sector as the Senator has outlined.  One is looking at options around coir, green waste compost, rock wool and then further diluting and blending.  That is all ongoing.  Within all of that, there are further considerations around research beyond that as well.  We hope that the research call will issue its approvals shortly and we will come back and let the committee know what is approved and update it on that.  We are actively involved in that space but as the Senator pointed out, a period of time is required to get to the use of all these alternatives.<\/p> <p>  On the amenities side in particular, blends are already being used.  When growing, peat with blends of 10% to 20% including wood fibre, coir and rock wool are being used.  It is moving and steps have been made in that direction and it is conscious of needing to make a transition towards peat-free and has committed to doing so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021072000002#R00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Barry Delany"},{"type":"speech","time":1626735600,"counter":240,"content":"<p>In terms of the other witnesses' engagement in these past two weeks, what is the level of engagement with the big mushroom producers?

I have to say I am getting to the point where I am frightened for the mushroom industry in my county, as has been referenced.  It is hugely important to our local economy and I am frightened because the opening statements we have before us appear to point to inaction and procrastination and I fear that will result in the mushroom industry in Ireland, as we know it, moving somewhere else.  Probably across the water.  I am also frightened as to what that will mean in the long term for anyone who is genuinely concerned about climate action because the position we are in, as I have said on countless occasions, is built upon tokenism and hypocrisy because this is not being done to preserve or protect the environment.  This is to give a semblance that we are doing something.<\/p><p>To summarise the statements we had, in fairness to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, its opening statement outlines in a very fair way the crux of the issues.  It recognises that there is difficulty but, essentially, it says the Department cannot do anything about it.  The statement from the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage acknowledges that there are issues at play and goes through in detail some of the steps that have been taken in terms of working groups and review reports.  It mentions that an interim report indicates that there is general agreement among the members that peat should be available for the professional horticultural sector until the target date of 2030 and a maximum date of 2035.  The Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications essentially says that there is no problem at all and that this is an issue that is 27 years old.  If I was depending on a job in the sector and I saw that on my laptop, the laptop would be out the window.  It is frustrating that the Department is basically saying that this is all the industry's fault and there is nothing to see here in terms of the Department.<\/p><p> The question has been asked a couple of times and it has not been answered yet.

At the outset, I will repeat the point I have made a number of times that I believe it is remiss that we do not allow our guests to read their statements into the record.  We are unique among committees.  All committees are operating under the same Covid regime with the two-hour limit but guests generally are allowed to read their statements into the record.  We are skewing the discussion by not allowing that.<\/p><p>With respect to his characterisation of the statement from the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Carthy said its view is that &quot;there is no problem at all&quot;.  That is absolutely not true in respect of Mr. Nugent's written statement.  I have significant sympathy for Deputy Carthy and his constituents in County Monaghan.  It is a serious issue and a crisis that requires all hands on deck.  To be fair to our guests, we should accurately represent what they have sent into us.<\/p><p>What I am reading in Mr. Nugent's statement is that the Department is &quot;acutely conscious of the supply difficulties being experienced by the horticulture sector.&quot;  It goes on to state that its remit &quot;relates to one aspect of the existing regulatory regime that applies to peat extraction on sites of over 50 hectares.&quot;  It talks about:<\/p> <blockquote> \tA history of widespread non-compliance with this dual consent process, with many operators in the peat extraction sector lacking planning permission and \/ or an IPC licence while others have failed to engage or been slow to engage with these regulatory processes at all. <\/blockquote> <p>It goes on to state that:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIndustrial scale peat extraction absent planning permission constitutes unauthorised development, [and] the onus has been on operators to first regularise their past activities and then secure the necessary consents before any recommencement can take place. <\/blockquote> <p>It states further that:<\/p> <blockquote> \tNot all of the relevant peat extractors have engaged, as required, with the planning system as they are required to do initially before seeking an IPC licence if successful in obtaining the necessary planning permissions. <\/blockquote> <p>The next point in Mr. Nugent's statement is perhaps the most important and I would like him to elaborate on that, if he could.  He said that:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIt is not open to the State to simply remove the requirement that operators must regularise their past unauthorised development, as this requirement is derived from EU law. <\/blockquote> <p>That is perhaps the bind that we are in.  If I am to take Mr. Nugent's words at face value, the situation appears to be that there has not been a proper engagement between the sector and the regulatory system and that is the principle reason why we have the advice that we have.  Our guests so far have suggested that there are interim solutions, particularly with regard to the sub-30 ha possibilities.  Perhaps, however, Mr. Nugent might elaborate further on the bind the State is in with respect to its obligations under EU law.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021072000002#T01000","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1626735600,"counter":274,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  He characterised it really well and laid it out very clearly.  Essentially, there is no way for the State to remove the requirement that operators regularise their past unauthorised development.  This is the substitute consent requirement.  Substitute consent is how it has been dealt with through Irish legislation.  This is something that is derived directly from the environmental impact assessment, EIA, directive and was very clearly addressed in the judgment of the High Court in 2019.  That is why we I keep coming back to this point.  The route to reactivating peat extraction is through the exiting dual consent process, which provides for the regularisation of past activities and then the authorisation of the prospective activity or the prospective development under both the planning and licensing systems.  It is not, therefore, through a policy choice on the Department's part or through the introduction of a ban or a restriction.  It is because of a requirement, which is common to almost all types of development, to have the consents in place.<\/p> <p>  I should also say that the dual consent aspect that applies to industrial heat extraction is not unique.  More than 800 Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, licences are held by operators across all sections of the economy and with all those 800 plus licences there would also be a planning permission associated.  There are, therefore, 800 licences issued by the EPA that also have planning permission attached.  In other words, they have been subject to the dual consent regime and those operators have successfully navigated that system.  We do not, therefore, accept that the dual consent regime is uniquely onerous.  Industrial peat extraction is a significant intervention in the landscape and it is right and appropriate that there should be a reasonably proportionate bar for authorising that activity.  The dual consent regime is not, therefore, unique and, as the Deputy said, it is not open to the State to walk away from its obligations under the EIA directive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021072000002#T01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Philip Nugent"},{"type":"speech","time":1626735600,"counter":275,"content":"<p>May I ask Mr. Lucas a question, Chairman?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021072000002#T01200","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speech","time":1626735600,"counter":276,"content":"<p>Yes, of course.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021072000002#T01300","speaker":"1611"},{"type":"speech","time":1626735600,"counter":277,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Lucas for appearing before us again.

The best thing to do is to give a practical example.  If I wish to engage in peat extraction and if I have a site which I think fits into the exempted development category, for example, an area of 10 ha or more where the drainage of the bogland commenced prior to January 2002, then I would first conduct an environmental impact assessment screening and an appropriate assessment screening.  If the results of those screenings show that an EIA and AA are not necessary, then I would go to the planning authority and seek what I referred to earlier, namely, a section 5 declaration.  My recollection of the Planning and Development Act 2000 is that the planning authority must respond to such an application within four weeks.  It is open to anyone to pursue that process.  However, it would be necessary to at least do an EIA screening and an AA screening and then provide the outcome of those to the planning authority as part of the application for a section 5 declaration.<\/p> <p>  During my time working in the area of peatlands, although it was for domestic turf cutting, as I mentioned, the planning regime and the law is the same no matter what type of extraction is involved.  The Department sought section 5 declarations from planning authorities for peat extractions in the circumstances which I set out and received such section 5 declarations.  In addition, for two sites where we felt there was a need for a full EIA, we applied for and received planning permission to develop those two sites for domestic peat extraction.  To complete the picture, we applied for planning permission for one more site and we were refused.  We appealed that decision to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, but it also ruled against us.  Therefore, that there is still a requirement to go through a process of seeking consent and a section 5 declaration.  It is then a matter for the planning authority to decide whether to grant that declaration.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021072000002#U00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Lucas"},{"type":"speech","time":1626735600,"counter":279,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Lucas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021072000002#U00200","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speech","time":1626735600,"counter":280,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Martin Browne.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021072000002#U00300","speaker":"1611"},{"type":"speech","time":1626735600,"counter":281,"content":"<p>I also welcome our guests.  Some of them have said that they are conscious of what is going on in the sector and that there is a journey under way.  After what we heard at several of our recent meetings and from talking to people in the sector, it does not appear that there is much of a drive going on between the different Departments.<\/p> <p>  I have some comments and questions.  A major factor in this whole mess is timing.  The Department has admitted that finding peat-free growing media alternatives is a challenge and that wood production is a particular challenge.  The future of the sector is in the hands of the three Departments represented here today, but no workable solution has been forthcoming from any of them regarding the problem this sector faces.  The Departments might have all the time in the world to deal with this issue, but the sector does not.  The point has often been made, and especially since April, that time is running out fast.<\/p> <p>  Ultimately, if there is further resistance to reaching a resolution that works for all, then jobs, exports and communities will suffer the consequences.  Recent comments from the Minister of State, Senator Hackett, encapsulate the problem.  On one hand, she has told us that the harvesting of horticultural peat must stop in favour of alternatives, while, on the other hand, she has also stated that a stockpile of peat can be used during the time while research is being carried out into these alternatives.  No one seems to be able to tell us what these alternatives are or if they will even work.  This process could take years.  We are being told that the stockpile of peat that the Minister of State has spoken about is unsuitable due to its age and that the source will run out at the end of September.  That is according to those in the industry.<\/p> <p>  Meanwhile, the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications seems to be totally resistant to amending the planning rules which could be tweaked to save jobs.  The representatives of the industry have proposed the introduction of a fair and workable licensing system, similar to the single consent process that has been in operation elsewhere.  It has also been proposed that an interim period be allowed for the phasing out of horticultural peat harvesting over a transitional phase to allow the alternatives to be developed.  The sector is involved in trying to devise alternatives to what is being proposed and it is seeking to secure a supply of a growing media up to 2030, which is the period that has been suggested.  Can the representatives from each of the Departments outline the obstacles which are delaying this approach for the sector?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021072000002#U00400","speaker":"1613"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1626735600,"counter":282,"content":"<p>I am happy to go first.

It is also important to state that we do not have responsibility for the planning system.  Mr. Lucas may wish to speak about that matter.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy spoke about the possibility of replacing the dual consent regime with a single consent regime.  We do not regard that as something that will accelerate this process at all.  A new consent regime would require primary legislation, which obviously takes time to prepare and get through the Oireachtas.  It would also require the introduction of new systems and processes in whatever statutory body was given responsibility for such a new system.  Only at that point could the regularisation process commence, that is, the application for leave to apply for substitute consent.  That would then be followed by the application for substitute consent and then the application for the prospective consent.  It is also important to bear in mind that, as we have seen in recent years, the process is very likely to be challenged along the way, possibly at several stages.  It is for this reason that we think that following the route of a single consent regime would not allow for an earlier resumption than would engagement with the current system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021072000002#U00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Philip Nugent"},{"type":"speech","time":1626735600,"counter":285,"content":"<p>That is fine.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021072000002#U00800","speaker":"1611"},{"type":"speech","time":1626735600,"counter":286,"content":"<p>Can I pose a question to the representatives from each of the Departments?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021072000002#U00900","speaker":"1613"},{"type":"speech","time":1626735600,"counter":287,"content":"<p>Yes, that is fine.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021072000002#U01000","speaker":"1611"},{"type":"speech","time":1626735600,"counter":288,"content":"<p>Starting with the representatives from the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, I noted with interest the second last paragraph of the opening statement.

The undertaking of an EIA will be mandatory in an application for consent to undertake large-scale peat extraction on a site of 30 ha or more.  As a result of this, there has to be a consent system in place.  It has to provide for EIAs and AAs.  As already stated, in some cases, screening for AAs and EIAs would be possible.

I appreciate the efforts that the Chair and committee staff have made to accommodate every party in respect of this issue.  It is a crisis.  I have been discussing this with the nurseries and the horticulture sector on a regular basis.  They are pressurising us, as politicians, for results.  I appreciate that we get ample time to question the witnesses and I welcome them here.  I thank the Chair for not spending too much time on statements in order that we do not lose the valuable time we need to get our points across.<\/p> <p>  The point I want to get across is that I cannot understand for the life of me why this crisis has continued in the way it has.  Who is in the wrong here?  Why can it not be resolved temporarily until something is put in place?  Somebody has got to put up their hand and take the blame.  It is either Minister or the Department that needs to do so.  Who in the name of God is going to take the blame?  Will the buck be passed from one to the other?  As Deputy Carthy said, maybe we will just have to come back here again to see if we can get to some kind of solution.  I have no issue about coming back here; the nurseries are severely affected on the ground.<\/p> <p>  I only have a few questions.  Many of those I was going to ask have already been dealt with.  My argument is that there was a withdrawal from peat without a plan being in place.  The nurseries have been left flat-footed.  They were given no time to adjust.  When other businesses are affected, there is some kind of compensation package put in place.  Has the Department considered a compensation package?  If it has, what kind of package is it?<\/p> <p>  The issue of the timeframe was raised.  Can we have Irish peat for Irish growers?  It is a simple question.  The third question is whether some bogs can be redefined as no longer being peatland habitats.  Is it possible to re-wet bogland and then have suitable peat that can be used for horticulture?<\/p> <p>  I have a fourth question and then I will leave it at that.  Last week, the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Pippa Hackett, released a statement to say that a stock of Irish peat will alleviate the immediate issue may have been secured.  The industry would like to clarification on this stock of peat.  If it is stockpiled peat, it will not be suitable for the casing layers used in mushroom growing.

There is no way for extraction to take place legally on a site greater than 50 ha in 2021.  The only way to reactivate sites like that is through engagement with the system.  It may be difficult to hear that this is the case but the system is in place and has been for some time.  The requirement to have an integrated pollution control, IPC, licence is not new.

We would probably be a lot nearer to a solution if the three Departments banged their heads together and if there was a bit of a dispute between them.  That could be part of the problem.  There is a bit of a <i>laissez-faire<\/i>attitude and a sense that it is everybody else's problem.  Has anybody sat down and looked at what is happening on the ground?  We can blame the High Court ruling and say that it caused a problem but the High Court ruling just set standards.  What caused the problem was Bord na M&oacute;na walking off the pitch without bothering to follow through with the new standards for applications.  That is accepted.  Bord na M&oacute;na is now rewetting bogs.  It walked away from them practically overnight.  I presume many of these bogs will need manicuring before they are in an ideal position for rewetting.  That manicuring may or may not require the removal of peat.  Has anyone sat down with Bord na M&oacute;na and asked it to do an analysis of the bogs before wetting them to see if there is a surplus layer of peat that will need removal?  Could that be used to solve, in the short term, the problem facing the horticulture people as part of a just transition while we are waiting for the development of these alternatives?<\/p><p>With regard to the applications for areas greater than 30 ha and areas greater than 50 ha, are there many, or any, applications in the system?  If there are, how long have they been in the system and how long is it expected to be before a decision is made on them?  How many applications from the private sector have been granted with the extraction now up and running?  What kind of lifespan do they have?  That is it for the moment.

I can talk about sites greater than 50 ha.  I do not agree with the characterisation of Bord na M&oacute;na walking off the pitch.  Bord na M&oacute;na was affected in the same way as every other operator by the 2019 High Court judgment.  It is not true to say that it voluntarily walked off the pitch.  It was quite severely impacted by that decision.  Bord na M&oacute;na has been a very active member of the working group Mr. Lucas talked about and has done quite a lot to support the horticulture sector.  Since 2019, Bord na M&oacute;na has not harvested any peat.  It cannot harvest peat without further regularisation.  Since the judgment, Bord na M&oacute;na has actively engaged with all customers of professional grade horticulture peat and their representative organisations.  Bord na M&oacute;na has been clear and transparent in communicating its exit from peat harvesting and the impact this will have on the sector but, to assist the sector, it ensured that Irish customers of professional grade horticulture peat were supplied with 40% more peat in 2021 than the equivalent period in 2020.  It has also formally ceased the export of horticulture grade peat, which resulted in 94% of pre-existing and planned shipments to all export customers being cancelled.  Bord na M&oacute;na is very active in this space and has been very supportive of the horticulture sector.<\/p> <p>  With regard to applications that are in the system, at the meeting on 6 July, the representative from Growing Media Ireland said that two or possibly three had engaged or had submitted applications to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  I am not entirely sure.  That is a matter for it to address but it is a small number that have engaged with the system.  With regard to sites greater than 50 ha that are operating at the moment, none are operating lawfully.

In setting aside the 2019 regulations, the court noted that that was quite a serious matter for the courts to do and the reason the court was comfortable doing so in part was because the court's view was that the pre-existing dual consent, substitute consent based system was broadly legally sound.  While any specific decision can be challenged on its merits, that was taken into account in the 2019 ruling.  I do not want to say specifically it is in the judgment but certainly, in his oral remarks, the judge's view was that the substitute consent process is fundamentally sound.<\/p> <p>  One of the issues with introducing a new system is it would open up another front for legal challenge because one would not only have individual decisions through the dual consent system challenged on their own but no doubt one would also have this whole new legislative framework challenged.

Under the habitats directive, you had to say whether a bog was degraded or restorable.  Even though they are talking about rewetting bogs, there are an awful lot of degraded Bord na M&oacute;na bogs that it will not be possible to restore.  That is my experience and anyone involved in bogs would agree.  This system does not even give you the opportunity to state that the bog is degraded.  The drains could be every 12 m apart and the bog would be a degraded bog.  The projection under the EU habitats directive was - and Mr. Lucas can correct me if I am wrong on this - that the bog had to be restorable inside a period of 30 years.  With the best will in the world, many of them would not have been restorable, including the likes of the Bord na M&oacute;na bogs, if we call a spade a spade.  From everything I have looked at in legislation under EIA, appropriate assessment and the whole lot, there is nothing to state that a bog can or cannot be restored inside a 30-year period.

The officials are here today for pre-legislative scrutiny of the general scheme of the Higher Education Authority Bill 2021.  The format of the meeting is that I will ask Ms Kenny to make a brief opening statement, followed by Mr. Conlon and Dr. Maguire.  The statements will be followed by questions from members of the committee.  Each member has a six minute slot to ask questions and for a witness to respond.

They are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.

The vision for the higher education system is that it provides high quality education, which is innovative and adaptive to the needs of the learner, advances equality, diversity and inclusion, strengthens engagement with the wider education system and wider society, creates knowledge and maximises the contribution of higher education to social, economic and cultural development.<\/p> <p>  The new legislation will provide a detailed and modernised framework to achieve this vision and safeguard the reputation of the Irish higher education system aligned with best international practice.  There is no doubt that the HEA legislation needs to be reformed.  The HEA's responsibilities have evolved from a small number of universities in 1971 to an expanded number of universities, new technological universities and institutes of technology.  There is also a substantial number of not-for-profit and private institutions catering for students.<\/p> <p>  The overall aim of the proposed legislation is to provide a high quality, student-focused system with appropriate oversight and accountability to underpin the confidence of stakeholders, students and the public.  The Irish higher education system is based on strong, autonomous institutions.  We recognise the importance, the excellence and diversity of education and research which results.  We have no desire to change this.  However, institutions need to be accountable for Government funding.<\/p> <p>  The HEA is responsible for allocating a significant amount of recurrent funding to higher education institutions.  The planned legislative approach is that of a co-regulation model.  This model provides for a robust system of internal governance for institutions, balanced with a strengthened oversight role of the sector by the HEA.  To secure strong internal governance, governing bodies should be of a size to allow for effective oversight.  Membership should be predominantly competency-based with a strong external component to provide genuine accountability.  These governing bodies will include staff and student representatives.<\/p> <p>  The legislation will also put in place effective consultation structures within institutions and the higher education system to maintain a strong voice for stakeholders.  There are very strong legislative provisions for the academic freedom of institutions and for academic staff in the existing sectoral legislation.  There will be no change to these existing legislative provisions.<\/p> <p>  The legislative approach will set out to achieve clarity of roles for the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, the HEA, SOLAS and Quality and Qualifications Ireland.  The legislation will also include important provisions for engagement with students, equity of access and participation, lifelong learning and data collection and sharing.<\/p> <p>  A comprehensive consultation process has been undertaken with the sector since 2018, with ongoing engagement with key stakeholders.  As part of this consultation, the HEA and QQI have worked with Department officials on developing the general scheme through the establishment of a working group.  This was key to ensuring that the legislation reflected  the appropriate interaction of these agencies with each other and with the Department.<\/p> <p>  The constructive, co-operative approach by key stakeholders has been very helpful and is much appreciated.  Furthermore the close collaboration between all stakeholders, institutions, public bodies' staff and student representatives in responding to Covid-19 has been exemplary in seeking to ensure the continuity and quality of teaching and learning, and in the planning for a return to onsite education.  The Department's objective is education.  There will be continued engagement with stakeholders throughout the development of this legislation and we look forward to its successful implementation.  <\/p> <p>  This is a priority for the Minister and, therefore, we will be seeking to bring the Bill before Government in the next term.  We have followed closely the pre-legislative scrutiny process and look forward to considering the views of the committee as part of this drafting process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021072000002#A00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Tanya Kenny"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1626735600,"counter":470,"content":"<p>I thank the Chair.  My colleagues and I are pleased to assist the committee in its consideration of the general scheme of the Higher Education Authority Bill today, further to the observations we have earlier provided in response to the request for submissions.  We consider the revision of the 1971 Act necessary and timely given the rapid pace of development and change in higher education both nationally and internationally.  Ireland&rsquo;s higher education system has been responsive to national needs, providing education and training, building the skills base, assisting people in their lives and in conducting high quality research that attracts and retains people and investment in Ireland.<\/p><p>In order to prepare for the next five decades of social and economic progress, the HEA and higher education institutions need to be fit for purpose.  They must be appropriately governed but sufficiently free to act responsively and innovatively where needed.  This new legislation protects the academic freedom of institutions and, importantly, provides the HEA with the powers to collect relevant data, regulate and be the authority in the sector, holding institutions to account should issues arise.  In doing so, we will be assisting institutions in the delivery of their missions.  We believe the balance in the draft legislation is appropriate and workable.  However, as noted in our letter to the committee of 14 June, the HEA has some suggestions that the committee may wish to consider in seeking to balance autonomy and accountability, through co-regulation, as set out in the draft legislation.<\/p><p> The HEA is the statutory funding authority for the Irish universities, technological universities, institutes of technology and a number of other colleges.  In that regard, it provides annual funding in the region of &euro;1.6 billion.  This funding supports the provision of high quality higher education to almost 240,000 students.  It supports other key aspects of the overall mission of higher education, including the advancement of research and engagement with industry and wider society.  The HEA leads the strategic development of the Irish higher education and research system by encouraging best practice and engaging with institutions on setting and delivering on their individual strategies.  The HEA also has responsibility for the effective accountability and oversight of governance in HEA-funded higher education institutions and is accountable to the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science for the achievement of national outcomes for the higher education sector.  The HEA takes this responsibility very seriously but is somewhat weakened by the processes and tools available under what is now dated legislation.<\/p><p> This new Act is expected to give the HEA appropriate regulatory legislative powers.  The original Higher Education Authority Act is 50 years old this year and, while it has done the nation some service, it is no longer fit for purpose.  This new legislation will provide greater clarity in respect of the extent and operation of the HEA&rsquo;s responsibilities, those of the institutions and those of the Minister and Government.  In order to deliver on these responsibilities, the HEA will need to be resourced and empowered appropriately, for example, through an ability to recruit and deploy staff as required within agreed ceilings or budgets, rather than on a consent per post basis, as is currently the case.<\/p><p> In exercising its oversight role, the HEA seeks to be respectful of institutional autonomy but requires institutions to act appropriately within an accountability framework.  The role of the HEA is distinct from the responsibilities of the governing authority of each institution and from that of the Department. <\/p><p> This new HEA Bill should give the HEA revised and appropriate legislative powers to regulate an autonomous higher education and research system and to intervene where remedial action is necessary.  Interventions might include where a situation or issue arises in terms of governance, financial management or other matters, allowing the HEA to hold the institution and its governing authority to account.  Such structures in legislation allow the HEA to protect the academic and operational freedom of institutions, holding institutions to account should issues arise without micromanaging or interfering with their institutional autonomy.<\/p><p> This draft Bill will also provide the HEA with the opportunity to collect information and data on the performance of institutions and the higher education and research system in a timely manner.  This information gathering will support system-level planning, evidence-based policy making, risk management, financial and other monitoring requirements and will provide key performance indicators of overall system health and performance. <\/p><p> While there are both challenges and opportunities in higher education and research, nationally and internationally, the clarity this new legislation will bring will empower the authority to lead and drive change.  It will enable the HEA and higher education institutions to contribute to the next five decades of social and economic progress by being fit for purpose.  It will see institutions appropriately governed but sufficiently free to act responsively and innovatively where needed.  I thank members for their time and I am happy to answer any questions they may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021072000002#A00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tim Conlon","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1626735600,"counter":472,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for inviting QQI to assist the Oireachtas in shaping this legislation through written submission and, now, oral hearing.  Some members may recall the work of the last Oireachtas in amending the QQI Act.  That Bill was triggered in part when QQI learned the hard way, through being on the losing side of a judicial review, how vital it is that the functions of statutory bodies are made as current and explicit as possible by the Oireachtas.  The fact that a body has previously undertaken certain activities, either on its own initiative or at the request of a Minister, or that many stakeholders, including public representatives, might reasonably expect certain actions to fall within the remit of a body, does not necessarily give those actions legal effect.  As the higher education system has grown in size, complexity and importance to Irish society over the half century since the HEA was established, it is vital that the statutory basis of its functions be brought up to date.<\/p> <p>  When QQI was established in 2012 with responsibilities including the quality assurance of higher education, it was not long before some stakeholders, including the universities, began to question the relationship between this new body and the long-established HEA, and whether any overlap of their functions was giving rise to unnecessary regulatory and reporting burdens on the institutions.  In response to this, QQI and the HEA put in place a voluntary memorandum of understanding.  This set out our mutual understanding of our respective roles and responsibilities, how these were distinct and complementary and how we intended to co-operate in carrying them out.  For example, we co-ordinate our schedules for visiting institutions and share various pieces of information.  Our memorandum has been implemented and reviewed several times.  Head 19 of this legislation proposes to put this agreement between the agencies on a statutory footing.  We welcome the legal clarity this will bring.  The Bill also sets out how QQI&rsquo;s work in regulating access to private higher education will be relied upon by the HEA in defined areas.<\/p> <p>  The philosophy of co-regulation expressed in the scheme mirrors the approach taken to the quality assurance of higher education in Ireland and internationally.  Quality assurance is, in the first instance, the responsibility of the institution.  QQI&rsquo;s approach to the exercise of its powers of monitoring, review, approval or authorisation reflects this co-regulation model.  In this model, mechanisms of transparency and engagement between the regulator and the regulated address and resolve any problems that the institution&rsquo;s internal processes have not been able to sort out.  As a result, we have rarely had to invoke the more intrusive powers of intervention given to us in law.

Their presentations and submissions were great.<\/p><p>It is wonderful to see this legislation is putting the student first and foremost and at the centre in everything we are doing here and to see the increase in student numbers alone and, as was mentioned, the number of institutes of technology, IOTs, our new technological universities and our existing universities.  It is important to keep the reputation of our colleges in terms of their rankings.  I am thinking here about world-wide rankings and QS rankings and things that are based an awful lot on research publications.  It is about the masters and PhD students and those cohorts who are really developing the basis for excellence in our third level sector.<\/p><p> I will go through a few of the questions I have.  On the HEA, Ms Kenny mentioned the budget as being &euro;1.6 billion.  I was curious about that.  From what I understand, the majority of the budget, 80%, is core teaching and research, with another 20% contract, which I am guessing would probably be Science Foundation Ireland, SFI, and the Irish Research Council, IRC.  SFI would have rolled out a type of capital infrastructure for universities that was based on access, in that it had an access model.  What is the most recent spend on capital infrastructure?  I am looking at labs and how we develop that sort of space within our universities.  What are the plans in regard to the TUs?  Does she have a general comment to make on that?  That was a quick query.<\/p><p> Quality and Qualifications Ireland, QQI, is very welcome.  We are big advocates here of the apprenticeship programme and how we promote it, especially in our further education and training, FET, sector.  I do not know who developed the national framework of qualifications, NFQ, the lovely circle where everything fits in, but it is my go-to all the time.  Is it the NFQ cycle?  My apologies, but I do not know the name of it.  Mr. Maguire mentioned an overlap with the Higher Education Authority, HEA.  Can he talk to me about what that overlap is?<\/p><p> Mr. Conlon mentioned the HEA Act is five decades old and Ireland has changed an awful lot in 50 years.  We are looking at the student numbers and at how to accommodate our new technological universities.  The governance factor, which was mentioned, is very important.  Mr. Conlon noted there is representation from staff and students on that and that it will be competency-based.  What does he see as a metric once this Bill goes through?  In, say, three or four years' time, what would be two or three things we could point to as achievements from this legislation?  I hope that is not too broad a statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021072000002#B00600","speaker":"1654","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1626735600,"counter":478,"content":"<p>Can I come in on the first question on capital?

The Senator made particular reference to the technological university advancement.

It is a signature of the coherence we have in our system across the further and higher education system.  The apprenticeship is one example of that.  It is also an example of where there is complementarity between what QQI and the HEA do.  The HEA, initially through the co-operation with SOLAS in the Apprenticeship Council and in future through the national apprenticeship office when it is established under the apprenticeship action plan, co-operates on identifying which fields get funded and the direction of funding to the institutions.  When it comes to setting out what the academic parameters are, that falls more to QQI.  It has issued quality assurance guidelines on what we expect to see in programmes of apprenticeship.  We have a review process that sees that they are being implemented either directly by QQI, in the case of private sector institutions, or indirectly through the reporting the institutions make to QQI of their activities in apprenticeship, for example.  One can see there is some potential for double reporting but that is why we have worked so closely with Mr. Conlon and his colleagues to streamline this in order that they are not saying one thing to QQI one week and something else to the HEA the following week.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021072000002#C00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Bryan Maguire"},{"type":"speech","time":1626735600,"counter":484,"content":"<p>It is great to see so many courses being regulated, especially around the apprenticeship programme.

I might jump back to the previous question for a moment in terms of what we would like to see different in five years' time.  It is very interesting.  We would like to see a HEA that is resourced and empowered.  That is what is envisaged in this Act and in this legislation.  Again, on that previous question, we are lucky; we have a diversity of institutions with differing strengths and differing scale across the system.  We have to respond to and engage with them all in different ways.  As I said, each of them has its strengths.  They are within regions and understand the regions in which they operate.  We would, therefore, like to see them responsive and regionally engaged by responding to national requirements while fulfilling local and regional missions at the same time.<\/p> <p>  That goes to Senator Byrne's question about the relationship.  The amalgamation of the further and higher education research system under one Department has really improved the overall landscape.  We are seeing a greater relationship with our parent Department in terms of improving the setting up of policy and strategic direction versus the operational balance that we have to see.<\/p> <p>  One of the challenges, perhaps, as I mentioned in our submission, is that when we spin up a new project or respond to an emerging situation, even where we have the financial resources, we do not have the ability to hire staff, for example, to see something through and make it happen.  Again, some of that economy would be an improvement.  It is difficult when one wants to respond rapidly that the chain of command and control can be a break on that.  As I said, however, overall, the landscape has improved and changed.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the boundaries and nationally setting strategy, I absolutely agree with my colleague, Ms Kenny.  It is for the Minister and Government to set policy and for the HEA to implement it.  Setting that national policy agenda needs to be at a sufficiently high elevation so as not to be getting into the micro-managing of institutions.  Setting a sufficiently high-level policy, which then allows institutions to respond within that and the HEA to oversee it, would be an ideal situation.<\/p> <p>  In terms of what the sanctions would be and where they would be applied, a number of options are set out for us in the legislation.  Some of them are sanctions and some are remedial actions.  In our experience of engaging with institutions, sometimes where one has a problem, at the back of the issue is a financial issue or a lack of resources to do something in the way an institution might like.  A further sanction does not help them.  Going back to some of the earlier comments, students are the most at-risk group.  A financial sanction on an institution can hit the front line and hit students who, most importantly, are the ones we are trying to protect.  I will not go on further than that.  I hope that was helpful with the Senator's questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021072000002#D00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tim Conlon"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1626735600,"counter":495,"content":"<p>I will come in on response to the Senator's question on micro-credentials, which are obviously a key part of trying to respond to the emerging needs of industry and the skills market.

It would be a special purpose award.  It is not, therefore, just degrees and major qualifications.  It is, in fact, that we have a system that can allow the generation of micro-credentials.  We know that the Irish Universities Association, for example, currently has the multi-campus micro-credentials project under the human capital initiative of &euro;12.3 million to develop qualifications.  It is working with QQI to ensure to find the best way to make these framework-friendly, as it were, in order that they will be widely recognised, portable and not just industry oriented, which is key, but that they will also build up the learners' portfolio and give them some lifelong achievements to take with them through their careers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021072000002#D00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Bryan Maguire"},{"type":"speech","time":1626735600,"counter":496,"content":"<p>Is that okay for Senator Byrne?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021072000002#D00700","speaker":"1619"},{"type":"speech","time":1626735600,"counter":497,"content":"<p>Yes, I thank the Chairman.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021072000002#D00800","speaker":"1638"},{"type":"speech","time":1626735600,"counter":498,"content":"<p>The next speaker is Deputy Conway-Walsh followed by Deputy &Oacute; Cathasaigh.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021072000002#D00900","speaker":"1619"},{"type":"speech","time":1626735600,"counter":499,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for the presentations.

It is a day when few people would prefer to be in a committee room to being somewhere else.  It is a testament to the amount of stakeholder consultation that has happened in preparation for this general scheme that nearly all of the feedback provided to this committee at the pre-legislative scrutiny stage has been positive.  A few recurring themes have been raised by a number of stakeholders as well as members of the committee.  The three that jump out to me include the relationship between the HEA and the Minister, which Senator Malcolm Byrne has already spoken about, so I do not intend to go back to that.  The issue of competence versus representation governance structure needs to be returned to.  Autonomy of the universities, their research direction and whether we are doing enough to promote primary research as well as applied research is another.  It is easier to find funding for applied research but primary research has significant value in and of itself.<\/p> <p>  I will return to the competency versus representation issue.  Many people are worried about that.  Deputy Conway-Walsh adverted to Mayo and the GMIT structure.  It is a function of this new technological university structure where there will be multiple campuses.  I am based in Waterford in the south east.  There are similar concerns about the representation that will be provided for in Waterford, Carlow and Wexford.  There is possibly some way to go to address those concerns.  It probably should not be the case that we feel like each campus needs representation and that it should not be geographically-based but people have significant concerns that this is an issue.<\/p> <p>  Regarding an adequate voice for the various needs of people within that governance structure, Ms Kenny adverted to the staff representative bodies, which is proxy language for trade unions.  I am delighted to see a student voice in there although I think we need to put flesh on the bones of the student forum and how that will work.  I imagine that there will be adequate representation from academic voices but I wonder about non-academic people working within the institutions and whether staff representative bodies adequately capture the needs of people who may not be academic or research staff but are working within these institutions.  Will Ms Kenny comment on that?<\/p> <p>  I referred to putting flesh on the bones of various provisions.  I know this is only a general scheme.  We talk about provisions for engagement with students, equity of access to participation, lifelong learning, data collection and sharing, but I would like to see more detail about how exactly those are going to work.  They are fine ideas to have in a general scheme but how will they translate into the actual structure?  I want to allow an opportunity for Ms Kenny to respond to the HEA suggestion that section 31 could benefit from a provision for the HEA to recruit, where it may be required, within agreed ceilings or budgets, rather than on a consent per individual post basis.<\/p> <p>  I have a specific question and I am sorry if I am scatter-gunning with questions.  Under heads 29(2) and 30(8), the general scheme constrains the role of the CEO of the new HEA from giving an opinion before either the Committee of Public Accounts or the wider committee structure.  Is that normal practice for CEOs in the public sector or is it specific to this role?  If it is specific to this role, why was it deemed necessary?<\/p> <p>  I think the preponderance of those questions are for Ms Kenny rather than Dr. Maguire or Mr. Conlon.  I apologise for that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021072000002#F00400","speaker":"1617"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1626735600,"counter":531,"content":"<p>There was a multitude of questions so I will address the student aspect first and the recognition and consultation.

That follows engagement at an institutional and national level and a survey.  The Deputy is correct that the heads need further development.  The intent of the legislation is to address the aspects raised by the students in the consultation phase to ensure that we capture those three strands.<\/p> <p>  The governing body structure is to be smaller and competency-based.

It goes back to my earlier point about the level at which we set that framework or engagement.  The Deputy will be aware of the work of higher education institutions around sustainable development goals or just transition.  Different institutions are responding to that in different ways depending on their region.  Some of them have an international outlook in their engagement with just transition whereas some of them are far more local.  In the midlands, for example, we are seeing that change in the industry base as part of an economic and social response.  We need to set those system-level indicators at a sufficiently high level in order that we can talk about the overall contribution of the higher education and research sector and allow each institution to play to its strengths.  We have some institutions that are very high performing and internationally relevant as regards research and then we have other institutions that are performing equally well in getting people from non-traditional entry backgrounds into and through higher education and out the far end into better lives, which is just as relevant a contribution in a national context as the research contribution is in an international context.  It is about respecting that diversity of institutions, the diversity of missions and that balance, and seeing that each institution can make a contribution.  I would ask that the framework be sufficiently high level, rather than granular, to allow every institution to play to its strengths, to demonstrate how they are playing to their strengths and to demonstrate the contribution they are making at national level.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021072000002#G00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tim Conlon"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1626735600,"counter":536,"content":"<p>As Mr. Conlon said, the institutions have various performance targets that are individually crafted to match their local missions and ambitions but it is not just a question of meeting quantitative targets.

To give a concrete example, last year there were a lot of questions about institutions shifting to online in the Covid pandemic.  That was not envisaged as part of the performance framework and yet it had to be done.  QQI co-ordinated a response with a number of other agencies, including the HEA, to gather as much evidence as we could to see what kind of response there had been in the circumstances, whether the students had been well served, if we could have confidence in the graduates who graduated last year and so on.

This should be affordable for all and available to all.  The officials might give me a run-down on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021072000002#H00600","speaker":"1619"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1626735600,"counter":552,"content":"<p>I might start.  I thank the Cathaoirleach for a good question.  It reminds me of Deputy Conway-Walsh's point earlier about the reference to democratisation in the earlier legislation that is not present now.  The intention of that democratisation of higher education was access for all.  Higher education was a very different place 50 years ago and was far more limited with respect to the opportunities for access, transfer and progression through it.  That democratisation has almost been changed now by a very specific access, transfer and progression agenda around target core groups, for example, and opening up higher education to everyone.  That is very important because we can see from the data the HEA collects and the reports we have published that to get into and through higher education vastly changes life outcomes, such as the likelihood of being in employment, remaining in employment through economic cycles and so on.  Of course, employment, income and so on also have health impacts on individuals.  There is an important part of democratisation and equality there in that not getting access to higher education locks a person out of so much else in life.  It is very important, therefore, that provision and opportunity is spread as widely as possible.  I thank the Cathaoirleach.  It is a very good point.  I do not think there is anything in this legislation that undermines that or reduces that, rather it strengthens it as calls out in particular the access agenda.  It also calls out the equality, diversity and inclusion agenda.  That could be gender equality but also equality of inclusion.  The legislation is sufficiently robust in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021072000002#H00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tim Conlon"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1626735600,"counter":553,"content":"<p>I can come in on that to build on what was said on student engagement.  From the onset of the general scheme, the objects very clearly put the student at centre there as a primary consideration.  The student and learner being at the centre of the legislation came through in the very first consultation process in 2018 and therefore we have added these student engagement provisions.  The students are also included as members of the governing bodies, the HEA and QQI as well, so there is representation there to ensure the voice of the student is coming through and heard.  It is informing policy.  We also heard from the students about the importance of training at institutional level for going on and representing students on governing authorities.  These are all captured and reflected in the legislation as well.  As Mr. Conlon mentioned, the legislation is strengthened around access, participation, equality and diversity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021072000002#H00800","nonspeaker":"Ms Tanya Kenny"},{"type":"speech","time":1626735600,"counter":554,"content":"<p>I thank the officials.  I know this is beyond the remit of what we are here for today but it does concern me on occasion.  One will often see in the national newspapers that they have gone through every school in the country and shown where students placed after they did their leaving certificate and what colleges they went to.  Some schools have a very low rate of take-up in the context of students going on to third level education.  It is really concerning that people might think that if a person is going to a particular school then he or she must not be going to third level.  Some of these schools are absolutely excellent education providers.  Maybe it is the cases there are people who do not want to go on to third level, but it is something the Government must remain cognisant of.  It is one of the reasons we will be doing some form of module before the end of the year on accessibility and accessibility for all because it is really important.<\/p> <p>  Just to finish up on my questions, the importance of primary research and the role of researchers were also highlighted by witnesses at previous meetings.

We have a new Department coming together which has a remit across higher education, research, innovation and science, which is a real opportunity.  There is work ongoing on the national research and innovation strategy.  The shape of that strategy, when it emerges in the later parts of this year, will probably have an influence on national science policy.  There is sufficient opportunity to look at that balance.  As a number of members, including the Cathaoirleach, stated, there is a piece around balancing that basic research with the applied sort because one never knows what the next challenge is going to arise.  Nobody saw the pandemic coming or that there would be a need for epidemiologists, for example, to manage the response.  Luckily enough, we happened to have a couple on hand.  It is about that balance in the system.  There is the economic endeavour and applied research in terms of meeting an industrial needs and obviously an economic need but there is also that part about knowledge for knowledge's sake, that is to say, there are certain disciplines we need research in to progress the discipline and to progress thinking about aspects other than just the economic or social.  The balance piece will be important to watch and it will be interesting to see what comes through in the national research and innovation strategy later on this year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021072000002#H01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tim Conlon"},{"type":"speech","time":1626735600,"counter":556,"content":"<p>Okay.  I am going to go beyond the remit of what we are doing today.  I know the clerk will hand me a note saying I have done so, but I am going to do so anyway.  We are doing a module on leaving certificate reform in September.  I will not ask Ms Kenny for her opinion because she is working with the Department but I will ask Mr. Conlon and Dr. Maguire.  On leaving certificate reform, students currently sit their exams in June.  Continued assessment is the way to go.  It gives people a better opportunity to get into colleges and everything like that.  A final exam often scares students away.  They do not get the full bang for their buck that they would tet if there were continuous assessment.

Dr. Maguire will give the Cathaoirleach chapter and verse because he is far more expert in academic assessment than I am.  I will address what we see coming through.  This goes to the Cathaoirleach's earlier point as well about students who are leaving second level and going on to higher education.  One of the challenges we perhaps have - and again, this legislation addresses it efficiently - is we are not strong enough on lifelong learning.  It might be that an individual of school-leaving age does not think about higher education as an option at that point in time but may want to go back later in life.  Our system is not as strong as it could be with respect to lifelong learning opportunities or returning to education later and the international evidence shows this.  That is improving, and we are seeing changes as a result, for example, of the experience of the emergency online provision during the Covid pandemic that there will be new and different ways.  However, to date one of the challenges of the system has been how do we take a more flexible approach to students at a later stage in life who might want to come into higher education.<\/p> <p>  On students coming into higher education without the appropriate academic capital, for want of a better expression, institutions do a lot, such as remedial maths programmes for example, to support students who might not have the required maths.<\/p><p>The required maths is an underpinning part of so many programmes such as ICT.  Institutions can do a lot but the revision of the second cycle has been very successful.  Important work is happening there and it is important for higher education institutions education to that accordingly.  There are two sides to it and we need to make sure that we work together appropriately.  That is my observation on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021072000002#H01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tim Conlon","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1626735600,"counter":559,"content":"<p>I will return to the framework, where the emphasis on the learning outcomes is what the students have learned and not how they have demonstrated that learning at any given point in time.  It is certainly not about how they have learned it at three weeks in June of the year they happen to sit the leaving certificate.  The pandemic has disclosed that there is more than one way to assess what students have learned and I hope we will be learning lessons from this and that the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment will learn lessons.  Obviously, it is their prerogative to advise the Minister on that.<\/p> <p>  From the perspective of general qualifications the point we need to know is whether a student has achieved enough to have a sound basis to be able to go on to the next step.  Whether that stage is into further education, into higher education, directly into the workplace or an apprenticeship, or another on-campus course, it is important that we have a variety of opportunities.  One of things the HEA is doing, and which this Bill will facilitate further, is a lot of research on where students are coming from.  This goes back to the Chairman's question about which schools and which areas, including the geographical and electoral districts, the students are coming from, and what this does for the students' progress right through the journey of further education, into higher education and onwards into employment, through linking up with the data collected by the CSO.  We are just bringing big data to bear on this question of progression so we can get well beyond the headlines we have had in the past.  This will help to give the schools, colleges and universities the information they need to help put students in the position where they can get the courses they can profit from, and to give them the support they need if they have gaps in their background.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021072000002#J00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Bryan Maguire"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1626735600,"counter":560,"content":"<p>I will add one additional observation.

We are aware there is a large number dropping out at third level.  Perhaps it is young people who are not exactly sure about the courses they are taking, and it is about them having the basis to go forward.  This data would really inform how we look at further education and training, and at building up the apprenticeship and in-learn sector.<\/p> <p>  Reference was made to research.  I believe that the societal impact of the research we are funding is extremely important.  This has come across through the research prioritisation in the past years.  Our researchers are doing an excellent job in describing the impact to society of the research they conduct, and even in the way they put together the research now.  In the last decade or so there has been a real focus on how one looks at the voice of the user in putting together a research plan.  Researchers have really looked at the fact that we are no longer in ivory towers or hidden behind university walls where our research has no impact.  Our researchers are first and foremost out there in designing the research to have impact from the very get go.  It is crucial and it shows where funding has impact.<\/p> <p>  I have one or two questions for Mr. Conlon on the HEA.  I apologise for earlier as my laptop overheated and literally shut down.  Perhaps I could get some research innovation on how to keep these cool.  I may put in for the AI, robotics and engineering section.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Conlon referred to having more resources and widening the remit of the data being gathered.  How will the current skill set in the HEA be broadened in that regard?  We would love to see the HEA also taking on apprentices.  We are looking at public sector organisations being able to take on apprentices and train people up.  Will Mr. Conlon note the amount of resources in the HEA for this or can he share that information at the moment?<\/p> <p>  My other question is for Ms Kenny on the performance framework and the resources we have in our universities.  We are aware that universities are always trying to encourage research but it is difficult with such a heavy teaching load, the high student numbers in courses and the course work involved.  We are all ways trying to encourage our lecturers to take on more research.  In this performance framework is there anything that would point towards how we would support higher education institutions to encourage the lecturers and professors in doing more research and in building those research teams?  The technological universities have done a mammoth amount of work for the applications they submitted in order to increase the amount of research performing staff at PhD level and that they are also looking at taking on more research.  Ms Kenny may not be able to go into that again but does she have any thoughts on that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021072000002#J00500","speaker":"1654"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1626735600,"counter":563,"content":"<p>The HEA is in constant conversation with our parent Department about resources.  Perhaps we can provide the committee with some information about the background to that.  On the general point, yes we are reasonably sufficiently resourced but as we expand into new areas of endeavour there is a requirement for increasing specialisation and specialist resources, for example with data analytics.  We have a very capable statistics section.  Building that out and increasing resources is one of the challenges.  We will come back to the Senator separately on that off-line.<\/p> <p>  The Senator asked about the technological universities and the expanding research performance.  We are seeing a rapid increase in the outputs and the staff profile of the former institutes of technology, now the technological universities.  There are more people with PhDs, for example, and by virtue of having more staff with PhDs they want to use that PhD because otherwise why would they have one.  This is in the context of supervising students and progressing their disciplines, engaging with enterprise in their regions and so on.  The supporting infrastructure for that has been a bit slow to catch up.  We have been lucky that we have an allocation from the Government and from the Department in the technological university transformation fund, which is starting to put in place some of those scaffolding and resources around and about this research endeavour.  They are challenged, as we all are, to build that in and to put it in place.  As the Senator has said, there is vast detail in the applications about the strategies for research, what they want to do at what their ambition is.
