I was very pleased to announce a package of &euro;85 million extra investment in child care, including important improvements to the early childhood care and education, ECCE, preschool programme.<\/p>  <p>  At present, the ECCE programme covers children who have reached the age of three years and two months by 1 September of the relevant year.  From September 2016, I am expanding the ECCE programme to allow children to access free preschool from the time they are three years of age until they start primary school.  There will be three intakes of eligible children during the preschool year.  Children who reach the age of three between April and August can access the programme from September, children who reach the age of three between September and December can access the programme from January, and children who reach the age of three between January and March can access the programme from April. <\/p>  <p>  The number of weeks of free preschool a child will benefit from will depend on their birth date and the age at which they start primary school.  This number ranges from 38 weeks for children born between April and August, who start school at the age of four, to 88 weeks for children born between January and March who start school at the age of five.  This equates to an estimated 23 additional weeks on average.<\/p>  <p>  The number of children benefiting from the ECCE programme will increase from 67,000 to more than 127,000 in a given year.  This extended free preschool provision was first recommended by the expert advisory group on the early years strategy in 2013.  It was also one of a series of recommendations of the recent interdepartmental group on future investment in child care which I established in January last.  The group consulted widely with a range of stakeholders, including the early years sector, during the course of its work.  The recommendation was included in the report of the interdepartmental group which I published in July to facilitate a further debate on how best to meet the needs of parents and children.<\/p>  <p>  I have recently met senior representatives from the early years sector to discuss this and other improvements that were announced as part of the &euro;85 million investment package in budget 2016.  The meeting was positive and constructive, with all parties expressing commitment to work together on the issues of capacity and high-quality preschool provision.  My Department will be working closely with the early years sector to build capacity in time for the first intake in September 2016 and for subsequent increased availability in January and April 2017.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102100003#A00300","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"speech","time":1445416200,"counter":11,"content":"<p>While it is welcome that additional resources are being allocated to this sector, there was widespread common ground on the need for issues of quality to be addressed across the sector.

I believe they are the ones contained in a study that was published some 15 years ago and are based on a very small sample size.  I am pleased to inform the House that of those leaving care this year, approximately 80% were reported as having an allocated aftercare worker.  In addition, Tusla has advised that almost 90% of young adults currently receiving an aftercare service are in some form of stable accommodation, including 45% who remain living with their former foster families.  The figures of 80% and 90% are important.<\/p>  <p>  Every year, between 450 and 500 young adults leave the care of the State.  The majority of those are eligible for an aftercare plan.  The Government has decided to amend the legislative provisions regarding aftercare.  The aim is to create a clear statement of Tusla's duty to satisfy itself as to the young person&rsquo;s need for assistance by preparing a plan that identifies those needs for aftercare supports.  I published the new Aftercare Bill yesterday.<\/p>  <p>  I am concerned about the one in ten young people who have left care and are reported by Tusla to be in unstable accommodation.  The purpose of the legislation is to ensure that an aftercare plan, developed before the young person leaves care, identifies his or her care needs and that appropriate supports are put in place.  Some young people may not engage with the supports offered or, in some instances, appropriate services such as accommodation may prove difficult to source.<\/p>  <p>  Funding is made available to support a young person leaving care who is to remain on with his or her foster family as part of his or her aftercare plan.  In other cases, funding supports are available to facilitate independent living or supported lodgings.  Supports are also provided by other State bodies.  For example, an exception is made to the jobseeker's allowance payment in favour of young adults leaving care, in that those aged 18 to 24 receive a higher rate than other jobseekers of the same age.<\/p>  <p>  Tusla has continued to develop its aftercare service since the introduction of its national leaving and aftercare policy of 2011.  The implementation of the policy has seen the introduction of new practices, including the establishment of steering groups and the standardisation of the aftercare allowance.  I am happy to report that the additional funding I have secured for Tusla will drive forward this essential service for children and families into 2016 and beyond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102100004#B00600","speaker":"952"},{"type":"speech","time":1445416800,"counter":28,"content":"<p>As the Minister is aware, HIQA released findings of reports on the recent inspections of the foster care systems in both the Galway-Roscommon and Cavan-Monaghan regions, respectively.

This is what is at the core of the debate in the Chamber today because ultimately, if the economy is delivering the income to the Exchequer, the Government can then invest in these services in education, health and, most important from my perspective, child care and family resource centres.

It remains the aim of my Department to achieve a bilateral agreement, but I do not believe this will be possible to finalise it in the short term because of a number of difficult issues outstanding.<\/p>  <p>  I recently met representatives of the Russian Irish Adoption Group.  I am conscious that members of the group have adopted Russian children in the past, prior to the current arrangements, and many, very understandably, seek to adopt another child from Russia.  The Russian Irish Adoption Group gave a powerful presentation of the sensitivities involved.  I am of the view that it is essential to give clear, frank information about the likely timescale potentially involved in trying to secure an agreement with the Russian Federation in order to allow fully informed decision-making.  I advised the group of the current position regarding a bilateral agreement and I outlined to them the issues that still remain despite our continuing efforts.<\/p><p>The Adoption Act 2010 provides for adoption of children into Ireland from countries that have signed and ratified the Hague Convention and from countries where a bilateral agreement on adoption is in place.  The Hague Convention is a landmark in regard to inter-country adoption and provides an international architecture that prioritises the best interests of the child.  While it has signed the convention, the Russian Federation has not ratified the treaty, and this has prevented recent adoptions from Russia into Ireland.  We have been trying to reach a bilateral agreement with the Russian Federation on inter-country adoption for a number of years, but significant issues remain in the way of an agreement.  For example, the Irish Constitution is very clear on the integrity of the family unit and the Russian requirement for post-placement reports on adopted children poses a real difficulty in this regard.  Other practical issues include the accreditation of adoption mediation agencies to facilitate inter-country adoption between Ireland and Russia, the fees to be charged by agencies for facilitating adoptions, and matters relating to re-adoption in cases in which an earlier placement has broken down.  We will continue to pursue the matter and try to resolve the difficulties outstanding.  <\/p> <p> In the meantime, I will seek to progress very important improvements in Irish adoption services, including the draft legislation for adoption information and tracing, which is currently undergoing pre-legislative scrutiny by the Joint Committee on Health and Children.  This is important legislation affecting all adoptions, past and future.  We are also working on the adoption (amendment) Bill which incorporates amendments required to the Adoption Act 2010 arising from recent referendums, including the children's referendum.  The Bill will include other important changes, including provision for step-parent adoption.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102100008#F01300","speaker":"952","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1445419800,"counter":89,"content":"<p>I remind the House that we have only 14 minutes remaining in this slot and two Deputies are waiting to ask questions.

However, concerns were raised during the committee's deliberations which pointed to the continuing risk posed by these provisions.  Following careful consideration by the Department of Justice and Equality, the Department of Health and the Office of the Attorney General, it is considered prudent to remove these provisions entirely from the Bill.  Their original purpose was to protect health care workers from liability for health care related actions taken on behalf of a person lacking capacity.  I have been advised that the existing provisions on civil liberty, including those which protect good samaritans, are sufficient for this purpose and that sections 61 and 62 can be removed safely from the Bill.  As my amendments respond to Deputy Mac Lochlainn's concerns, I ask him not to press amendments Nos. 82, 83 and 85 to 87, inclusive.  Amendment No. 121 is intended to remove a reference which is obsolete if amendments Nos. 81 and 82, which propose the abolition of informal decision-making, are accepted.  If informal decision-making is removed from the Bill, it will no longer be necessary for a code of practice to be prepared to guide persons making decisions on an informal basis.  Amendment No. 148 is a consequential amendment arising from amendments Nos. 81 and 82 which propose to remove sections 61 and 62 on informal decision-making.  If the amendments are agreed, the provisions on offences in section 127 do not need to provide for offences by informal decision-makers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102100010#H01900","speaker":"982","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1445421000,"counter":120,"content":"<p>This is a welcome initiative by the Minister of State and appears to address one of the key concerns we had and in respect of which I resubmitted amendments.

The proposed amendment clarifies that the decision on the donation of organs from living donors who lack capacity will have to be determined by the High Court.  The jurisdiction will remain that of the High Court, which reflects the seriousness of decisions that might need to be taken on this issue.  The proposed amendment relates only to organ donation from living donors and will not have any impact on current or planned policies of the Department of Health on cadaveric organ donations.<\/p><p>An amendment is necessary to the Bill's provisions with regard to the withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment.  Medical personnel have alerted us to the risk that the provision as currently drafted would cut across existing clinical practice and would make it impossible for clinicians to take the decisions they take every day to determine when treatment should cease, for example, where further treatment would be considered futile or would create unnecessary suffering for the patient at the end of life.  The provisions as drafted would require hospitals to have recourse daily to the courts to decide when life-sustaining treatment might be withdrawn from patients in terminal cases.  This would create circumstances of great trauma for families at a time when a loved one is at the end of life.  The amendment I propose is intended to rectify the situation where an application is made to the courts in the context of the dispute or where legal clarity is required on a decision to withdraw life-sustaining treatment.  This application will be reserved to the High Court.  Reserving such cases to the High Court reflects the seriousness of such decisions where they have to be determined by the courts.  This means that if a family member disagrees with a clinical decision, she or he will have the option to apply to the High Court for a determination on the matter.  Similarly, if a hospital is unclear as to the decision that needs to be taken, it can apply to the High Court for adjudication.<\/p><p>On the issue of non-therapeutic sterilisation, my amendment seeks to strengthen the legislative protection in this area.  The amendment would bring the Bill into compliance with a series of international human rights conventions that reject forced sterilisation of a person without his or her consent.  Forced sterilisation of girls or women with disabilities is a breach of Article 10 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.  The Committee on the Rights of the Child has identified forced sterilisation of girls with disabilities as a form of violence, while the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women regards forced sterilisation of women as contrary to the woman's right to informed consent.  Similarly, Article 23(1)(c) of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities requires state parties to ensure persons with disabilities retain their fertility on an equal basis with others.  The amendment, therefore, would strengthen the legislative protection for persons with capacity difficulties by preventing anyone from using the Bill as authorisation to take a decision on the non-therapeutic sterilisation of a person lacking capacity.  The effect of the amendment would be to reinforce the right to bodily integrity of a person with capacity difficulties.  I consider this amendment to be a significant step forward in protecting persons with capacity difficulties against non-therapeutic sterilisation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102100013#L03200","speaker":"982"},{"type":"speech","time":1445422200,"counter":173,"content":"<p>I agree with the Minister of State that this is a significant amendment and we will support it.<\/p><p>I would anticipate that there is nowhere in this legislation that the Minister of State would expressly provide for the effecting of consent around marriage, civil partnership, civil relationships, placing children for adoption, any sexual relations, or voting on election days.

Substantial amendments were agreed to on the provisions of co-decision-making on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il. However, further review of the co-decision-making provisions indicated that additional amendments are needed to clarify the intent of the policy and to provide further safeguards regarding co-decision-making appointers.  The majority of the amendments are technical in nature and have no policy implications.  The technical amendments were advised by the drafter to provide clarity and coherence within the Bill.  Where several amendments are being proposed to a section, whether on technical or policy grounds, it was decided substitute the entire section in order to provide a clear picture of how the section would read with all amendments included.<\/p><p><b><\/b>Amendment No. 26 proposes to delete the current section 14 and replace it with amended text.  The majority of the proposed amendments to the text of section 14 are technical in nature.  The main substantive proposed amendments to the text are as follows: the provisions in regard to the interaction of the various other instruments, such as enduring powers of attorney, with co-decision-making agreements have been removed and will be moved to the new nullity section, as provided for by amendment No. 29; subsection 8 has been amended in order to clarify that, although a person may appoint multiple co-decision-makers in regard to different relevant decisions, he or she may only appoint one co-decision-maker per agreement, which is reasonable and rational; and the provisions regarding the witnessing of a co-decision-making agreement have been tightened.  A further safeguard has been inserted that provides that an employee or agent of the co-decision-maker may not be a witness to a co-decision-making agreement.  The Bill already provides that at least one of the witnesses is not an immediate family member of the appointer or the co-decision-maker.  For clarity, I propose to insert a definition of immediate family member to include a spouse, civil partner, cohabitant, child, stepchild, parent, step-parent, grandparent, aunt, uncle, nephew, niece or immediate in-law of the appointer or co-decision-maker.  Amendment No. 93 will insert the same definition into section 65 of the Bill in regard to the witnessing of an advance health care directive.  This amendment to the definition of immediate family member is to provide an additional safeguard so that an independent person must be involved  as a witness.  This is to reduce the risk of a relevant person being pushed by family members into a co-decision-making agreement against his or her wishes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102100014#M01300","speaker":"982"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1445422800,"counter":187,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1445422800,"counter":188,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 27:<\/p><blockquote>In page 25, to delete lines 10 to 41, and in page 26, to delete lines 1 to 31 and substitute the following:<b>&ldquo;Persons who are not eligible to be co-decision-makers<\/b><br \/><br \/><b>15. <\/b>(1) Subject to <i>subsection (2)<\/i>, a person shall not be eligible for appointment as a co-decision- maker if he or she&mdash;<blockquote><blockquote>(a) has been convicted of an offence in relation to the person or property of the person who intends to appoint a co-decision-maker, or the person or property of a child of that person,<br \/><br \/>(b) has been the subject of a safety or barring order in relation to the person who intends to appoint a co-decision-maker or a child of that person,<br \/><br \/>(c) is an undischarged bankrupt or currently in a debt settlement arrangement or personal insolvency arrangement or has been convicted of an offence involving fraud or dishonesty,<br \/><br \/>(d) is a person in respect of whom a declaration under section 819 of the Act of 2014 has been made or is deemed to be subject to such a declaration by virtue of Chapter 5 of Part 14 of that Act,<br \/><br \/>(e) is a person who is subject or is deemed to be subject to a disqualification order, within the meaning of Chapter 4 of Part 14 of the Act of 2014, by virtue of that Chapter or any other provisions of that Act,<br \/><br \/>(f) is the owner, or the registered provider, of a nursing home (whether or not it is a nursing home registered under the Health Act 2007), a mental health facility, or a residential facility for persons with disabilities, in which the person who intends to appoint a co-decision-maker resides, or a person residing with, or an employee or agent of, such owner or registered provider, as the case may be, unless the person is a spouse or civil partner, parent, child or sibling of the person who intends to appoint a co-decision-maker,<br \/><br \/>(g) has been convicted of an offence under <i>section 127<\/i>, or<br \/><br \/>(h) previously acted as co-decision-maker for the person who intends to appoint a co-decision-maker and there was a finding by the court that he or she should no longer act as co-decision-maker for that person.<\/blockquote>(2) <i>Paragraphs (1)(c)<\/i>, <i>(d) <\/i>and <i>(e) <\/i>shall not apply where the co-decision-making agreement contains only relevant decisions concerning personal welfare.&rdquo;.<\/blockquote><\/blockquote><p>Amendment No. 27 proposes to delete the current section 15 and replace it with amended text.

as well as any special visitor or general visitor who has had contact with the appointer or co-decision-maker, as he or she considers necessary to determine whether&mdash;<blockquote>(a) <i>paragraphs

sections 22 and 23 set out the review and reporting procedures for co-decision-making agreements.  Amendment No. 38 proposes the deletion of section 22, &quot;Review of co-decision-making agreements,&quot; and the substitution of amended text.  Section 22 provides for the director to review co-decision-making agreements at regular intervals.  The majority of the amendments to the text are technical in nature to provide clarity.<\/p><p>Two substantive changes are contained in the amended text.  The first substantive change increases the interval at which the director must review a co-decision-making agreement from 12 months to three years.  The review will now take place every three years because an annual review would be onerous for a relevant person and for a co-decision-maker.  It would introduce unnecessary uncertainty for the many people involved in such agreements that are currently working well.  I am aware that there will be problems with some co-decision-making agreements and for some co-decision-makers.  I have chosen to address problem situations not by imposing additional requirements on all but rather by proposing to strengthen the provisions that will operate when problems arise.  Where an agreement is not working well for either the appointer or the co-decision-maker, other provisions allow the agreement to be varied or revoked.  The director will continue to review reports from co-decision-makers relating to the performance of their functions annually.  The reporting provisions and the proposed strengthening of the complaints system, as proposed in amendment No. 42, provide adequate safeguards to alert the director to problems with an agreement.  The director will still have the discretion to review an agreement at intervals of less than three years if he or she believes it necessary.  Amendment No. 53 will also provide for offences that can be incurred by the co-decision-maker if he or she subjects the relevant person to fraud, coercion or undue influence.<\/p><p>The second substantive change to the text of section 22 provides for the insertion of a new subsection 6.  Subsection 5 allows the director to apply to the court if, following a review of a co-decision-making agreement, he or she is of the view that certain criteria that applied at registration of the agreement no longer apply.  The new subsection 6 allows the court, if it is satisfied that the given criteria no longer apply, such as that the co-decision-maker has not effectively performed the functions of a co-decision-maker, to determine that the co-decision-maker may no longer act as a co-decision-maker for the appointer.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 39 proposes the deletion of section 23 and its substitution with amended text.  The amendments to the text are mainly technical and clarify the intent of the policy underpinning this section.  Section 23 deals with the reports that a co-decision-maker has to submit to the director.  The amended text provides for the director to notify the appointer as well as the co-decision-maker if a report is incomplete or if it has not been submitted at all.  A new subsection 5 clarifies that the court, on application to it by the director, may determine that the co-decision-maker who has not fulfilled his or her reporting obligations may no longer act as a co-decision-maker for the appointer concerned.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102100015#N01800","speaker":"982"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1445423400,"counter":215,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1445423400,"counter":216,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 39:<\/p><blockquote>In page 34, to delete lines 2 to 24 and substitute the following:<b>&ldquo;23. <\/b>(1) A co-decision-maker shall, within 12 months after registration of the co-decision-making agreement appointing him or her, and thereafter at intervals of not more than 12 months, prepare and submit to the Director a report in writing as to the performance of his or her functions as such co-decision-maker during the relevant period.<br \/><br \/>(2) Every report submitted to the Director pursuant to this section shall be approved by the appointer and shall be in such form as shall be prescribed by regulations made under <i>section 27 <\/i>and shall include details of all transactions relating to the appointer&rsquo;s finances which are within the scope of the co-decision-making agreement and details of all costs and expenses paid to and claimed by the co-decision-maker in the relevant period together with such other matters as are prescribed.<br \/><br \/>(3) Where a co-decision-maker fails to submit a report in accordance with this section or submits an incomplete report, the Director shall notify the appointer and the co-decision-maker concerned of that failure or incompleteness and give the co-decision-maker such period of time as is specified in the notice to comply or submit a complete report.<br \/><br \/>(4) Where a co-decision-maker fails to comply with a notification under <i>subsection (3)<\/i>, the Director may make an application to the court for a determination as to whether the co-decision-maker should continue as co-decision-maker for the appointer.<br \/><br \/>(5) Pursuant to an application to it under <i>subsection (4)<\/i>, the court may determine that a co-decision-maker who has not complied with this section shall no longer act as co-decision-maker for the appointer concerned.<br \/><br \/>(6) In this section &ldquo;relevant period&rdquo;

The new subsection (6) clarifies that &quot;revocation in part&quot; means a revocation whereby the co-decision-maker continues to act as a co-decision-maker for the appointer for more than one relevant decision.  Again, it provides the type of flexibility that is required.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102100016#O00900","speaker":"982"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1445424000,"counter":231,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1445424000,"counter":232,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 42:<\/p><blockquote>In page 35, to delete lines 38 and 39, and in page 36, to delete lines 1 to 27 and substitute the following:&ldquo;<b>26<\/b>.

It deals with the question of outlawing chemical restraint.  The amendment states:<\/p><blockquote>Nothing in this Act shall be construed as authorising any person to administer to a relevant person any medication for the purpose of controlling or modifying the relevant person&rsquo;s behaviour or to ensure that a relevant person is compliant and not capable of resistance when no medically identified condition is being treated; where the treatment is not necessary for the condition; or the intended effect of the medication is to sedate the relevant person for convenience or for disciplinary purposes ... Notwithstanding [the above], the appropriate use of drugs to reduce symptoms in the treatment of a medical condition does not constitute chemical restraint but the administration of such medication should be clearly documented on the relevant person&rsquo;s file and the reasons for the administration of such medication specified.<\/blockquote><p>Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights applies specifically to chemical restraint, and I will repeat it.  It states: &quot;No one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment.&quot;  This right is an absolute right, with no exceptions, as distinct from the exceptions present in article 7.  Chemical restraint is inhuman and degrading, and should be prohibited.  Medication should only be used if there is a medical or therapeutic necessity and not for any other purpose.  I understand the Law Society submits that this definition should be set out in the Bill.<\/p><p>I draw the attention of the Minister of State to the Department of Health policy document, Towards a Restraint Free Environment in Nursing.  It states:<\/p><blockquote>Chemical restraint is the intentional use of medication to control or modify a person's behaviour to ensure a person is compliant or not capable of resistance, where no medically identified condition is being treated; where the treatment is not necessary for that condition; or the intended effect of the drug is to sedate the person or for convenience or for disciplinary purposes. <\/blockquote><p>I understand that when the Minister of State replied to Deputy Mac Lochlainn on an earlier amendment, she said she was prepared to introduce amendments.<\/p><p>I welcome what she has done and I support the legislation, and obviously as a Government Deputy I will vote for it, but this amendment is critical because it goes to the heart of abuse of elderly people particularly, and people with dementia or other medical conditions, who are unable to speak for themselves and who may display very challenging behaviour.  The use of chemical restraints solely for the purposes of the convenience of the staff or other non-medical reasons should be outlawed by the legislation, where chemical restraint is used as a first resort, including where people with dementia are admitted to acute hospitals, and is not confined to situations where there must be a clear medical reason where medication must be required  The distinction between the administration of medication for therapeutic reasons and the administration of medication simply to control behaviour must be clearly understood and provided for.  I appreciate this is Report Stage and the Minister of State will bring the Bill through the Seanad.<br\/><br\/>I note the draft guide to professional conduct and ethics for registered medical practitioners at paragraph 18.2 provides, &quot;If patients lack capacity to make a decision about treatment or examination, you may use appropriate physical or chemical restraint&quot;.  I find this absolutely shocking and unacceptable.  This applies to people who lack capacity, and it states a medical practitioner can use physical and chemical restraint.  Chemical restraint is inhumane and degrading treatment and should never be used.  The drafters of the guide to professional conduct and ethics for registered medical practitioners do not seem to understand the issue.<br\/><br\/>There is clear evidence, internationally, on the abuse of patients by using chemical restraint and behaviour-calming drugs and I direct the Minister of State to a recent article in the <i>British Medical Journal<\/i>by the University of Michigan medical school and Johns Hopkins University, which reviewed two decades worth of research to reach conclusions on antipsychotic and antidepressant drugs and on non-drug approaches which help care givers address behavioural issues in dementia cases.<br\/><br\/>I am aware of and acknowledge the interest and concerns of the Minister of State in this area.  I urge her in her reply to give serious consideration to the amendment.  I accept she may not be in a position to accept the amendment today, but I ask her to look at it again seriously for the Seanad.  At the end of the day, it is about training staff and caregivers and recognising the fundamental human rights of people who can never speak for themselves because of the medical condition from which they suffer, because of advanced dementia or other medical problems.  It is never acceptable that they would be drugged to facilitate understaffed nursing homes, which happens regularly.  This goes to the very heart of the quality of care for people in institutions who cannot speak for themselves.  Now is the time and this is the opportunity for us to fundamentally state the abuse of elderly people or citizens by using antipsychotic drugs for the sole purpose of facilitating staff, and there is understaffing in many of these institutions, is entirely and absolutely unacceptable and is an appalling abuse of the human rights of the people concerned.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102100016#O06000","speaker":"1069","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1445424600,"counter":291,"content":"<p>I apologise as I understand I missed amendment No. 63.

Amendment No. 66 relates to what Deputy O'Dowd said.  The issue of restraint of relevant persons is addressed by a reference to restrictions on decision-making representatives in previous sections of the Bill.  We consider it imperative that the provisions permitting restraint of a person by a decision-making representative should be strictly construed and should explicitly require that the decision-making representative acts in a manner consistent with the principles of the Bill.  The provisions should only allow restraint where this is the least restrictive measure to prevent harm.  We consider that the definition of restraint as provided in previous sections should be extended and we consider it necessary that a specific provision be included in the section dealing with informal decision-making.  We have dealt with this, and amendment No. 69 is similar.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102100017#P00200","speaker":"998"},{"type":"speech","time":1445424600,"counter":292,"content":"<p>I remind Members we must adjourn the debate at 12 noon and if we could get this part finished by then, it would be appreciated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102100017#P00300","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1445424600,"counter":293,"content":"<p>I will be brief.

The Minister of State has been in a facility, which I visited recently, which provides long-term care for people with a learning disability.  We were given the example of one individual who was literally sedated for all of the time spent in a previous institution and now receives absolutely no medication whatsoever all because resources, staffing and training have been put in place.  My big fear is that making provision for chemical restraint will allow facilities to wallpaper over massive cracks in staffing resources, the capacity and training of staff and the general resources available.  In the vast majority of cases these issues can be quite easily addressed by putting in place the proper supports, and because of this I ask the Minister of State to take note of the amendment tabled by Deputy O'Dowd.

The fundamental question for our republic that we must answer and which the report does not ask is the threat to democracy from an organisation that is involved with politics but which retains a military structure, with an active intelligence gathering department and access to weaponry.  Those fundamental questions leap from this report, no matter how uncomfortable and unpalatable they may be, and we need to respond to them.  We need full honesty and transparency in that regard.<\/p>  <p>  Additionally, the report indicates that individual PIRA members remain involved with criminal activity, such as large-scale smuggling, and there have been isolated incidents of violence, including murders.  We know from the report of the Commissioner of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that the Criminal Assets Bureau, since its establishment in 1996, has raised approximately &euro;28 million from the proceeds of crimes, actions and tax assessment with respect to over 50 individuals with connections or associations with the Provisional IRA in the past.  Other investigations are proceeding.<\/p>  <p>  I put the fundamental question to the Taoiseach yesterday.  This illustrates the absolute need for the British and Irish Governments to establish a strong, well-resourced joint agency to tackle, once and for all, the organised crime being undertaken by paramilitaries.  In the context of the Provisional IRA and its members, we must ask whether people are absolutely certain that any of the proceeds from the organised crime being committed by alleged individual provo republicans is not finding its way to the political project.

For the last few years, the political institutions in the North have been on the verge of collapse.  Let us remember that the heart of the current contrived crisis is the murder of two men, Jock Davison and Kevin McGuigan.  The Fianna F&aacute;il leader's contribution to this crisis was an idiotic call for the suspension of the political institutions.<\/p>  <p>  The basis of the very welcome recommencement of the talks today is the publication of a report by the British and another by the Garda Commissioner.  Some elements of these reports have been seized upon by opponents of Sinn F&eacute;in, not least the Taoiseach and the leader of Fianna F&aacute;il.  I want to deal with two aspects of this.  One is that Sinn F&eacute;in is totally and absolutely opposed to criminality of all kinds, and we stand with communities across this island and with the police services against criminality.  We have paid a price for that: my home has regularly been targeted with bomb alerts, and I and other Sinn F&eacute;in representatives are under active death threats.  That is a matter of fact.  We have had property attacks.  We have had one young man, Frank McCabe junior, blinded in one eye because of our party's and his family's stand against criminality.<\/p>  <p>  This is not an academic exercise for us and it is not electorally driven point-scoring.  We put our lives on the line against those who are engaging, in the name of republicanism and otherwise, in criminality.  Second, like all other Members, Sinn F&eacute;in Members are accountable to one grouping - that is, the electorate.  They are the people who give us our mandate.

That is why this Government has made a point of making the resources and facilities available to the Garda to do its job.  We had the murders of Adrian Donohoe and Tony Golden.

Is Ma&iacute;ria Cahill wrong?  When Deputy Adams says that anybody out there who has information about these matters should bring them to the notice of the Garda or the PSNI, he, as the president of his party, knows many of the people who live in the Border area.

When it comes to Ireland's future stability and prosperity, our education system is our single greatest asset.  The Minister went on to state that this Government over the past five years has supported education but, of course, that is not the reality.  The Government has effectively abolished the career guidance counsellor role and it has increased class sizes.  It has imposed wide-ranging cuts to resource teachers.  Higher education has seen cuts of one third and capital investment in higher education has been cut by over three quarters.  What is the result of this support from Labour-Fine Gael?<\/p>  <p>  Only five days ago, a mother chained herself to the gates of the Department of Education and Science protesting at the closure of her son's autism unit.  In 2011, when the Taoiseach came into power, Ireland had two universities in the top 100 ranked globally.  Today, we do not have one in the top 150 ranking globally.  One university president described what this Government has done to the university sector as \"asset stripping\", and the same can be said for what has happened to the primary and secondary education systems.<\/p>  <p>  Then came the budget last week.  Up until now, Labour-Fine Gael has been following a Fianna F&aacute;il troika programme but last week's budget was the Government's opportunity to set a vision for Ireland for the future.  When it came to education, big claims were made in the form of 2,200 new teachers and smaller class sizes, but when one follows the money none of that stacks up.  In last week's budget, of the &euro;1.5 billion available to the Government, it invested &euro;24 million in the entire education sector, that is, less than 2% of the budget available and less than one fifth of 1% of the education budget.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102100020#S03400","speaker":"1201"},{"type":"speech","time":1445426400,"counter":397,"content":"<p>How much is the capital programme?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102100020#S03500","speaker":"1048"},{"type":"speech","time":1445426400,"counter":398,"content":"<p>This Government, in last week's budget-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102100020#S03600","speaker":"1201"},{"type":"speech","time":1445426400,"counter":399,"content":"<p>A question, please.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102100020#S03700","speaker":"1112"},{"type":"speech","time":1445426400,"counter":400,"content":"<p>-----did not put a single euro into higher education.

It was based on talent coming through an educational system that, despite all the challenges, has measured up to the range and the kind of quality that companies look for, be they in the financial services, pharmaceutical or ICT sectors.

It is almost five years since Mr. Justice Moriarty, in his tribunal report on payments to politicians, found that it is beyond doubt that Deputy Michael Lowry imparted substantive information to Denis O'Brien which was of &quot;significant value and assistance to him in securing the licence&quot;.  It has since emerged that there has been, for over three years, a Garda investigation following the Moriarty tribunal's findings of suspected criminality in payments to politicians.  Extraordinarily, this has not yet led to an investigation file being sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP.  No one has yet been charged and there have been zero consequences for two of the key individuals against whom adverse findings were made.  Denis O'Brien, whose massive wealth was accumulated in the aftermath of the granting of the mobile phone licence, now has ownership stakes in most of our media, in water, gas and even in sport in this country.

Unfortunately, however, there have been no consequences.  A file has rested with the Director of Public Prosecutions for three years.  The individual named in the Moriarty tribunal report has threatened and is proceeding to try to silence Parliament through the courts system.  That the Taoiseach has left the Chamber is telling.  We have not had a response either from the Taoiseach or the Government to defend the interests of this House, the Chamber of Deputies, which is being sued by the individual in question.<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach may have left the Chamber but I have no doubt the Chief Whip will convey the following message to him.  Given that there have not yet been any concrete, tangible consequences in the criminal sense for any of the individuals named in the Moriarty tribunal report, I hope the Taoiseach will make a clear commitment that no individual named in the report will be invited to make up the numbers to put a Government in office after the next election.  That very clear statement of intent could be offered by the Taoiseach to show some degree of leadership.  It would also go some way towards rebuilding trust in the political system and creating confidence that corrupt payments to politicians will never again be tolerated in this country.  That is what the Bill is about.<\/p>  <p>  I am pleased to recommend the Bill to the House.  I look forward to it being debated in this Chamber and seeing the Government parties, which expressed outrage in 2011, supporting us in trying to ensure all the recommendations of the Moriarty tribunal report of 2011 are implemented.

The most recent annual report of the Ombudsman for Children outlines the appalling vista created by the refusal of a public, State-funded school to enrol a teenage girl because she was pregnant and to refuse again to enrol her after she had her baby because she was a single mother.  The school in question is funded by the taxpayer.  Modern Ireland is supposed to be a pluralist, inclusive society.  The Office of the Ombudsman for Children investigated the case at the request of the girl's parents.  When it sought notes and records of the school's decisions in the matter, it found that no records were held.  In addition, it emerged that the school did not have a board of management or patron but was run by one individual.<\/p><p>That parents or teachers who have a grievance arising from decisions taken by school boards or authorities do not have an avenue of appeal is an appalling vista in this day and age.  The Office of the Ombudsman for Children dutifully carried out an investigation into the case to which I referred but found it was powerless to compel the school to act and could only recommend to the Department that such decisions cease.  The Department responded that it does not have any control, power, role or function in the actions taken by the management of schools.  I cannot understand how such circumstances are allowed to prevail in 2015.<\/p><p>The education sector was described earlier as the cornerstone of society and engine of economic growth.  Notwithstanding the wonderful terminology used to describe it, the system is not accountable or transparent when people with a grievance arising from decisions taken by school management have no avenue of appeal.  People who receive a parking ticket are entitled to appeal the decision to a superior independent authority, yet no such avenue is available in the education system.  It is to our eternal shame that this continues to be the case.<\/p><p>The purpose of the Bill is to establish an office of ombudsman for education which would allow for independent, professional adjudication of grievances of all partners and stakeholders in the education system, whether parents or school staff who are also victims in many cases.  Unlike the Office of the Ombudsman for Children which deals with thousands of such complaints every year but has no power of compulsion or direction, the new office would have the power to compel and direct school boards and authorities to act under its direction.  Its decisions would also be enforceable in the District Court.<\/p><p>This is not populist legislation.  If anything, it will be difficult to implement because many of the vested interests in the education system, which is funded to the tune of &euro;8.2 billion per annum, do not want an office of ombudsman for education with real powers of compellability to be established.  However, this is the right thing to do and we as legislators owe it to the nation's children to right this wrong.  I commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102100024#W02300","speaker":"994"},{"type":"speech","time":1445428800,"counter":556,"content":"<p>Is the Bill opposed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102100024#W02400","speaker":"1112"},{"type":"speech","time":1445428800,"counter":557,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102100024#W02500","speaker":"1098"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1445428800,"counter":558,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1445428800,"counter":559,"content":"<p>Since this is a Private Members' Bill, Second Stage must, under Standing Orders, be taken in Private Members' time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102100024#W02700","speaker":"1112"},{"type":"speech","time":1445428800,"counter":560,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be taken in Private Members' time.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102100024#W02800","speaker":"994"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1445428800,"counter":561,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1445428800,"counter":562,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 1.08 p.m. and resumed at 2.08 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Topical Issue Debate","time":1445429400,"counter":563,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102100025#X00100"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Northern Ireland Issues","time":1445429400,"counter":564,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102100025#X00200"},{"type":"speech","time":1445429400,"counter":565,"content":"<p>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this very important matter for discussion.  Yesterday's report by the PSNI and MI5 on paramilitary activity in Northern Ireland contained serious findings that have profound repercussions for the island.  Its basic conclusion that the Provisional IRA army council directs both the IRA and Sinn F&eacute;in strategy and that its members are engaged in serious criminality, particularly around the Border, is a direct threat to democracy on this island.  The IRA has not gone away and it has not left the stage.  Instead, the report states, it is writing the entire script.  I refer also to the report's findings on other paramilitary groups.  It states \"All the main paramilitary groups operating during the period of the Troubles remain in existence: this includes the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF), Red Hand Commando (RHC), Ulster Defence Association (UDA), Provisional Irish Republican Army (PIRA) and Irish National Liberation Army (INLA)\".  It is absolutely horrendous that these paramilitary groups remain in existence on our island 17 years after the endorsement of the Good Friday Agreement by the overwhelming majority of the people on all of this island.  North and South, we are left with a party that is actively controlled and directed by an armed criminal group.  The nexus of money, intelligence gathering and community control is part of a poisonous political project.<\/p><p>I understand that the Criminal Assets Bureau, CAB, has extracted more than &euro;28 million in ill-gotten gains from more than 50 IRA members since the ceasefire, as mentioned in the House today.  A number of court cases are ongoing as CAB delves into a dark financial empire worth an estimated &euro;500 million that generates &euro;70 million per annum.  This is a criminal conspiracy founded on racketeering, fuel laundering, cigarette smuggling and other illicit activities.  Its direction and objective are political control.  Its legacy is murder and fear stalking the Border.  We know its calling cards, for example, the brutal murder of Paul Quinn, who had every bone in his body smashed by the IRA before a twisted code of <i>omerta<\/i>and community intimidation silenced his screams from ever being heard in the justice system.  That bloody violence and grim control is the conspiracy's hallmark.  Paramilitarism in any community and from whatever source can no longer be ignored or indulged.  Paramilitarism manipulating and controlling a political party are nothing short of a direct threat to our democracy and the hard-earned and tested institutions of this State.<br\/><br\/>It is imperative that we renew and revitalise the hope and energy of the Good Friday Agreement.  We are all aware of the major effort made by various Governments, organisations and parties to bring the Agreement about.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade should consider whether a fresh mandate for the Independent Monitoring Commission, IMC, is needed to keep paramilitarism under check until it withers away from the communities that it is sucking dry.  We need fresh resources for the Garda to confront the rampant criminality in the Border region.  In particular, I reiterate my calls for a cross-Border agency to get to grips with the challenge.  Last March, I introduced legislation in the House regarding the establishment of a cross-Border agency, the remit of which would be to deal with this criminality.<br\/><br\/>Fianna F&aacute;il believes in the Good Friday Agreement and its great potential for all of the island.  We believe that we can work peacefully and openly towards reunifying this historic island.  The spectre of armed gangs calling the shots in political parties and orchestrating a criminal empire is a fundamental threat to that ideal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102100025#X00300","speaker":"970","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1445429700,"counter":567,"content":"<p>On behalf of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, I thank the Deputy for raising this important and pressing issue.  The Minister regrets that he cannot be present for this debate but, as the House will understand, he is in Belfast attending the roundtable talks that are addressing the challenges posed by the continuing impact and legacy of paramilitarism.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister agrees with the Deputy that the assessment of various paramilitary groups in Northern Ireland by the British Government as well as the Garda Commissioner's assessment of the status and profile of the Provisional IRA, both of which were published yesterday, make for sobering reading.  The assessments raise issues that are of grave concern, issues such as the existence of illegal organisations and command structures, access to weaponry and widespread criminality.  Every Deputy would agree that these have no place in our democracy.  They never did.<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach made the Government's position clear when he spoke in Cambridge last month.  He stated that we needed clear lines, not blurred lines, between constitutional politics and criminality and that there could be no shared platforms or strategies, no shady grey areas between right and wrong.  He made it clear that, 21 years after the IRA and loyalist ceasefires and ten years after decommissioning and the IRA announcement of a cessation of paramilitary activity, it was past time that paramilitarism should carry any capacity for threat.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that the assessments conclude that these paramilitary organisations no longer represent a terrorist threat and that a threat is only posed by dissident groups that are the enemies of peace in Northern Ireland.  The assessments none the less present a complex and challenging profile of the unacceptable residual activities of various groups in Northern Ireland that are damaging to communities and must be addressed.  The issue of associated criminality and the involvement of those linked with paramilitary groups in organised crime is highlighted by the assessments.  The Garda and the PSNI will continue working closely together to combat criminality in all its forms on both sides of the Border.<\/p>  <p>  The British assessment and that of the Garda Commissioner underscore the critical importance of the ongoing talks process in Northern Ireland.  A key element of these talks, in addition to the full implementation of the Stormont House Agreement, is to address the impact and legacy of paramilitarism.  It is hoped that complementary assessments will provide fresh momentum to the talks process.<\/p>  <p>  The political reaction to the assessments has been calm and measured.  The Northern Ireland parties have maturely acknowledged the challenges and seem intent on addressing them.  The stance taken by the First Minister and the fact that the DUP has resumed its seats in the Northern Ireland Executive are to be particularly welcomed.<\/p>  <p>  Twenty-one years after the first paramilitary ceasefires, the transition to a fully normalised society in Northern Ireland must be progressed.  Therefore, the Government continues to encourage all parties to seize the opportunity of the talks and to redouble their efforts to bring an end to the remaining blight of paramilitarism in communities and agree outcomes that provide a lasting peace and political stability in Northern Ireland.  This is nothing more than what the people of this island deserve.  For his part, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade will continue to engage with all of the parties in Northern Ireland in order to address these issues and preserve the peace and stability that has been so hard won.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102100026#Y00200","speaker":"1046"},{"type":"speech","time":1445429700,"counter":568,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his reply.

It reads: \"It was never the position of the IMC - nor has it been the position of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na - that PIRA had disbanded and, accordingly, ceased to exist.\"  It also reads: \"However, separately from the activities of dissident groups, there is clear evidence that a significant number of persons who have been associated with PIRA remain criminally active, particularly in organised crime, and continue to associate together.\"  Elsewhere, it reads: \"Like other persons involved in organised crime, some have access to weaponry.\"  These statements in the Garda's report must be a source of concern for us all.<\/p>  <p>  Many people on this island put a major effort into bringing about the Good Friday Agreement.  Those of us who were privileged to campaign for its acceptance by the people in May 1998 were overjoyed that, in this State alone, more than 94% of those who voted endorsed it.  That was a significant figure.  Similarly, well in excess of 70% of those who voted in Northern Ireland endorsed the Agreement.  We all recall the major block of Unionist opinion that campaigned against the Agreement and the lukewarm campaign, if it could be called that, on the part of some people who deemed themselves republicans.  The people spoke, and the mandate that everyone on this island has is to work the Good Friday Agreement.<\/p>  <p>  Major risks are posed when paramilitary organisations exist and weaponry is available to some paramilitaries, thugs, murderers and other criminals.  People must face up to these questions.  Smuggling, counterfeiting and cross-Border crime must be tackled in a determined and comprehensive manner.

Certain events happened and the Mallow report stated accident and emergency units such as those in Mallow and in Roscommon were unsafe.  There was a junior hospital doctor crisis, and the consultants in Roscommon hospital wrote a letter stating they could not stand over the safety of the patients in that hospital.  There was a vote on a motion tabled by the Sinn F&eacute;in party.  The motion stated all accident and emergency units in the country should be retained and allowed to remain open.  There were 3,000 people outside, mostly from my county.  There was very heated, emotive commentary and people wanted me to resign.  At the time, I did not stand by the vested interests and the ill-informed political pressure groups but by the people of Roscommon and Leitrim.  I gave a strong commitment to secure significant investment for Roscommon hospital.  The &euro;8 million investment in the endoscopy unit is part of the &euro;20 million investment earmarked for the hospital.  The other flagships are a rehabilitation unit and a hospice care centre.<\/p>  <p>  The 14,000 sq. ft. endoscopy unit is set to become a diagnostic centre for the whole western region.  It will facilitate a range of scope procedures for patients, including colonoscopy.  It is also hoped the service will be widened to offer bronchoscopy, cystoscopy and range of other scope services.  This investment ensures the number of patients being treated in Roscommon will continue to increase.  When the unit is open, the hospital will be able to perform three times as many endoscopy procedures.  The construction of this major development endorses my public commitment to securing the long-term future of Roscommon County Hospital.<\/p>  <p>  As the only Government Deputy in the constituency, I have exercised my influence at the highest level of government to ensure significant investment in the hospital.  Since 2011, I have attended more than 100 meetings, at every level, to ensure the hospital's long-term future.  Evidence shows clearly that the Government and I have worked and will continue to work hard to make Roscommon hospital a leading example for all small hospitals around the country.  Along with the endoscopy development, the &euro;8 million rehabilitation unit is a very exciting development for the hospital.  We will see the construction of a 20-bed, single-room inpatient ward, with integrated therapy spaces, on a greenfield site adjacent to the hospital.<\/p>  <p>  Geographically, Roscommon hospital is ideally located for capital developments.  I warmly welcome the development of the 12,000 sq. ft. palliative care centre, which will have not only an eight-bed inpatient centre but also a palliative day-care service, a family support service and a bereavement service.  It will serve as a base from which the existing community palliative home care team will operate.<\/p>  <p>  We must not forget that the air ambulance has played a key role in providing critical air support options.  It has saved dozens of lives in my county and many hundreds in the past two years.  I am delighted it has been made permanent.  I was the politician who set up that initiative and the one who helped deliver it with the two Ministers at the time.  Any other politicians or vested interests who claimed an interest in this are simply not telling the truth.<\/p>  <p>  With endoscopy services and other services, Roscommon hospital is safer and busier.  This is because a high volume of lower-complexity cases have moved to it.  People said four years ago that lives would be lost.  Not one life has been lost because of the downgrading of Roscommon accident and emergency unit.  The only casualty of this has been my political career as a Deputy for Roscommon and Leitrim.  If that is a sacrifice that must be made, I am very happy to make it.<\/p>  <p>  The endoscopy unit is ready.  It has been passed on from the builders to the HSE or the hospital group.

An allocation of &euro;5.5 million was provided for the building of a new endoscopy unit at Roscommon hospital.  The new facility will increase the capacity of the hospital from 16 endoscopy procedures per day to 30 procedures per day, or 6,000 per annum.  This new endoscopy unit will provide a significant addition to what is already an impressive range of services at the hospital, including extended day surgery, selected acute medicine, a large range of diagnostic services, specialist rehabilitation medicine and palliative care.  More important, it will support the work of the hospital as an approved centre for colorectal screening under the governance of the National Cancer Screening Service.<\/p>  <p>  The endoscopy service at Roscommon hospital is accredited by the joint accreditation group and maintains the highest possible standards of care for its patients.  These patient-centred goals are best described by the endoscopy global rating scale, which endeavours to maintain standards in clinical quality, patient experience, workforce and training.  These standards contribute significantly to the comfort and dignity afforded to the patient, the timeliness of the procedure, the quality of the procedure and the speed and accuracy of communication with the patient and the referring doctor.  Work commenced on the new endoscopy unit at Roscommon hospital last year and I am assured that the construction has progressed well and is on target for completion and commissioning.

The key benefit arising for the credit union movement from this proposition is that it would enable the movement to put a significant portion of the members' funds of &euro;8.5 billion into social housing.  If I were the Minister and I had heard that on 29 September, I would have been on to the Irish League of Credit Unions immediately to invite its members to my Department to discuss how we would do this.  One billion euro would build nearly 7,000 homes.  Seven billion euro would build 45,000 homes in a short period of time if that money were invested immediately.

The credit unions have been established since the 1960s and there are more than 354 credit unions across the country.  Fewer credit unions were baled out during the financial crisis than banks.  Currently, the credit unions have &euro;8.5 billion on deposit with the banks, which they are not allowed to lend out under Government policy.  That is providing liquidity for the banks but giving a very low return to the credit unions and their members.<\/p>  <p>  When the housing strategy was launched, the Minister, Deputy Kelly, stated that the funding of the housing programme would require the development of innovative funding mechanisms that do not increase the general Government debt.  On his desk is an innovative funding mechanism from the credit union movement representing millions of people across the country with funds that they are ready, willing and able to invest in order to achieve a return for their members.<\/p>  <p>  The credit unions have said they could invest up to &euro;2 billion in a special purpose vehicle that could lend money on to local authorities or approved housing bodies, whichever the State would require.  That would go a long way towards helping to solve the housing crisis.

That would lead to an easing of the crisis, which I believe has developed through a lack of Government policy.  It is a deliberate crisis rather than a crisis that happened because of something over which we have no control.<\/p>  <p>  This proposition is part of the solution.  It is a matter that should be addressed urgently in the Department.

I am happy to make a statement to the D&aacute;il.  I agree that we need to look at how the credit union movement can be facilitated in providing financial investment into social housing.  I particularly acknowledge the willingness and eagerness of credit unions to do so.  As we all know, credit unions play a vital role in the social and economic infrastructure of this State.  The credit union movement has 2.89 million members and over &euro;13 billion in assets.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputies are right.  Recently, I received a detailed proposal from the Irish League of Credit Unions setting out a means by which funding could be provided to approved housing bodies by credit unions for the development of social housing.  The proposal is comprehensive and contains some progressive and imaginative ideas.  It is currently being examined in my Department, and I look forward to further engagement with the Irish League of Credit Unions on the issues addressed in its submission.<\/p>  <p>  When the Government launched the Social Housing Strategy 2020 less than a year ago, we made clear that the State should have a central and significant role in the provision of social housing.  We also made clear that we need to look at new ways of funding social housing.  While we are currently witnessing significantly increased levels of State investment in social housing, the scale of the challenge we face is also substantial.<\/p><p> As the strategy acknowledges, the Government is committed to putting in place mechanisms that are capable of raising additional finance in a sustainable manner and which can be used to drive, plan and co-ordinate the provision of new social housing projects.  The strategy includes a commitment to commence work on a financial vehicle to be known as the strategic housing fund whose purpose is to raise funding for the social housing sector.  Work on the development of this new funding model is under way in my Department.  This work is being progressed under the oversight of a group known as the finance work stream.  This comprises of a range of key stakeholders, including the Housing Finance Agency, the National Development Finance Agency and the Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform.  The aim of this work is to deliver a new funding source for social housing.  The intention is that this new source of funding will enable approved housing bodies to deliver more housing from scarce Exchequer resources.  In simple terms we are looking to facilitate investment in social housing that does not impact on the general Government balance.<\/p> <p> Arising from the opportunity offered by the strategy, a range of developers, investors, financiers and others expressed interest in being involved in the provision of social housing.  A protocol was put in place in March of this year under the auspices of the finance work stream to facilitate individuals and entities seeking to engage with the State to provide investment for the delivery of social housing.  A single point of contact for submitting proposals was established.  The social housing proposals clearing house group operates through my Department under the oversight of the finance work stream.  To date, 24 different proposals have been received and 20 of the proposers have presented their ideas to the group.  The clearing house group is in the process of concluding its work and bringing forward further recommendations.<\/p> <p> The submission from the Irish League of Credit Unions is in addition to these other proposals.  It is a timely intervention that sets out how the Irish credit union movement could create a dedicated funding vehicle to provide finance for social housing in line with the aims set out in the social housing strategy.  Two possible models are proposed.  The first would provide for investment to be made in a State-owned financial vehicle which would then lend to approved housing bodies to fund the development of social housing.  The second model sets out a scheme whereby credit unions would invest and then lend directly to the approved housing bodies.  It is envisaged that the investment provided in this way would not impact on the general Government balance.  This point needs to be tested and examined in greater detail, a process currently being led by my Department.<\/p> <p> From the Government's point of view, the fact the credit union movement is willing actively to seek a role in financing the delivery of social housing is welcome.  We need to use every available resource and funding mechanism to provide housing in areas that require it most and we need to do so as quickly as possible.  I therefore welcome the opportunity to debate the matter publicly and I look forward to further engagement with the Irish League of Credit Unions on its submission.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102100028#AA00600","speaker":"1092","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1445431500,"counter":582,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister State for his reply.

There is a concerning sentence in the reply of the Minister of State, \" The clearing house group is in the process of concluding its work and bringing forward further recommendations.\"  The Minister of State goes on to say that the credit union proposals are outside any of the proposals that have gone to the clearing house group.

In fact, local authorities and approved housing bodies are struggling to keep up with it, such is the demand that exists and such are the resources being provided.  We have provided more than 300 staff for local authorities to assist in the provision.  The challenge lies in the delivery of social housing.  The finance, ambition, strategy and objectives are very clear.<\/p>  <p>  The clearing house group has nothing to do with the banks.

The Irish League of Credit Unions in its submission has made a specific request for regulatory change .  It has requested that the Central Bank amend its 2006 guidance note for investments to allow credit unions to loan money to approved housing bodies for property schemes.

Amendment No. 66 concerns the circumstances in which restraint can be used or authorised by a decision-making representative.  We are in agreement that restraint should be tightly regulated and only used where absolutely necessary.  I proposed amendments on Committee Stage which limit the circumstances in which restraint can be used.  The situation has to be an exceptional emergency in which there is an imminent risk of serious harm to the relevant person or to another person.<\/p><p><i>3 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p> Deputy Mac Lochlainn&rsquo;s proposal would remove the concept of exceptional emergency circumstances.  In the spirit of what we are doing, we all want to get to the same goal, and sometimes ensuring one does not reflect on another can be quite difficult.  It would also remove the concept of imminent risk of serious harm.  Instead, it proposes a lesser test &ndash; the test in the Bill as published &ndash; that restraint could be used at any time when there was a risk of harm to the person or to another.  The time-limited nature of the amendments that I proposed would be lost.  Similarly, the safeguard that restraint could be used only in exceptional emergency circumstances would also be lost.<\/p> <p> While the Deputy&rsquo;s amendment specifies that restraint could be used only if it were the least restrictive measure, this addition is already encompassed in the guiding principles of section 8, which requires an intervention to be in a manner that minimises the restriction on the person&rsquo;s rights and freedom of action.  That covers this element of the amendment.  As the Deputy&rsquo;s amendment would, I believe, dilute the safeguards now in the Bill and allow for restraint to be used more widely than is permitted under my formulation, I cannot accept his amendment, although I fully understand from where the argument comes.<\/p> <p> Deputy Mac Lochlainn proposed an amendment on Committee Stage whereby the concept of chemical restraint would be added to the categories of restraint which can be used only with tight safeguards by a decision-making representative or by an attorney.  I have considered Deputy Mac Lochlainn&rsquo;s proposal carefully.  Following legal advice and consultation with the Department of Health, amendments Nos. 68 and 79 that I propose will address the Deputy&rsquo;s concern.  I propose a definition of restraint that would apply when a person is administered a medication with the intention of modifying or controlling the relevant person&rsquo;s behaviour so that the person would become compliant.  The definition of chemical restraint would also apply in circumstances where someone authorised another person to administer the medication.  It is not just the immediate administration but second-hand administration also.  I thank the Deputy for bringing this issue to my attention.  I ask him not to press amendment No. 69 and to accept instead the amendment that I propose.  Of course, it is entirely up to him but I believe we have managed a reasonable compromise.<\/p> <p> I ask Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd, in similar fashion, not to press amendment No. 142, which proposes to insert a new section 119 into the Bill.  I consider that the amendments that I propose will address his concerns and will ensure that chemical restraint is subject to the same tight safeguards that will govern the limited use of restraint possible under the Bill.<\/p> <p> Amendments Nos. 67 and 78 are consequential amendments that follow from amendments Nos. 68 and 79.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102100030#CC00700","speaker":"982","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1445432700,"counter":597,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for her response.

We feel a three year review for those under the old ward of court system is too long.  The review should be carried out within six months to allow these people benefit from the new legislation.

I am also very fearful that there are people in wardship who may not be ready to move to a new system and who may not have the decision-makers in place to look after property or such required mechanisms.  I worry that such people could be forced into a less favourable position because the time would be too short.  Those who are ready to come out of wardship and who have those mechanisms in place have nothing to stop them from applying to the court.  It is not that we are saying people must wait for three years.  We need the courts to do this within a three-year timeframe, but the six-month timeframe is way too short and may not be favourable to the people involved, even if we forget the mechanisms we would have to put in place for the court.  Our focus will always be on the person, and that is our major concern.  I hope the Deputy understands that.<\/p> <p> If all reviews had to be done in a six-month period, as proposed by the Deputy, many wards would be rushed into a position in which potentially more favourable options might not be feasible, as the time needed to plan for them would not be available.  Reviews would have to be shortened to meet this pressurised deadline.  I hope I am clear in stating that this is not related to resourcing or anything else, but rather being very careful about ensuring that people who find themselves in this new process will be comfortable about it and have enough time.  Those who are ready can apply to the court and there should be no difficulty in that regard.  For these reasons, I cannot accept the Deputy&rsquo;s amendment.<\/p> <p> Deputy Mac Lochlainn proposes in amendments Nos. 126 and 127 that reviews of detention orders of persons detained in an approved centre or in an unapproved centre on the order of a wardship court would be undertaken within a minimum period of six months from the Act's commencement.  It is the intention that reviews of persons detained on the orders of a wardship court will be undertaken soon after the Act's commencement.   I need to take legal advice to assess whether that would be legally possible and whether such amendments could have unintended consequences.  I ask the Deputy not to press these amendments but to accept my assurances that I will examine them and, if they are feasible, will bring forward amendments along these lines on Committee Stage in the Seanad.<\/p> <p> Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd&rsquo;s amendment No. 128 proposes to insert provisions on deprivation of liberty into the Bill.  Deprivation of liberty is a very serious issue.  The Department of Justice and Equality and the Department of Health have been working intensively on this issue to consider how it should best be approached.  This is a very complex issue.  Persons who have capacity but who have serious health issues may also be affected.  Further work is needed to develop a suitable approach.  This work needs some more time, but it will be undertaken in the context of the disability\/equality (miscellaneous provisions) Bill, and we have been advised that that is the best place to deal with the issue.  It is included in the current legislation programme and is required to enable us to ratify the UN Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities.  We need to recognise also that the problem can potentially affect people who have physical disabilities as well as those who lack capacity.<\/p> <p> I assure the Deputy that I am taking this issue very seriously, because it is one of the major issues relating to our ratification process.  I cannot agree to this amendment, as detailed policy and legal consideration is needed to ensure that the approach enshrined in legislation is appropriate and feasible.  However, work is currently being undertaken as part of the overall process of preparing for Ireland&rsquo;s ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.

We must look at putting resources in place to protect people's civil liberties.  We know the wards of court system was widely abused in the past in order to deny people the right to make decisions because they simply did not fit with the social milieu of the time.  I am not saying that is the case today, as society has moved on, but there could well be cases in which people are unjustly detained.  Surely the Minister could admit that a six-month review is something basic to be put in place, rather than saying that we could not handle it and we will have to retain what is a potential block on civil liberties.  We will have to put resources in place, and the Minister should not argue on those grounds.<\/p>  <p>  I want to speak generally on the amendments.  This is a long-awaited piece of legislation and I welcome many of its provisions.  It is an effort by the Government to make the State compliant with the United Nations Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities.  It is replacing archaic legislation such as the Lunacy Regulation (Ireland) Act 1871 and the ward of court system.  It is incredible that it is only now that we are replacing those outdated and archaic laws.  Many amendments have been made, reflecting pressure from disability rights organisations, and it is good that a system of co-decision-making and decision-making is being put in place.  I welcome the Government's deletion of the category of informal decision-makers, as this was potentially open to abuse.  I am also glad that a decision support service and advance health care directives, for example, are being included.<\/p>  <p>  The issue of resources is critical.  We can give people all the rights we want on paper, but unless resources are provided, particularly in the Minister of State's own area of mental health, we will see people suffering.  We must give support to individuals in making their own decisions, and that would require substantial investment in health care and more training for staff.  It is shameful that we are still not ready to ratify the UN Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities.  The Government should accept amendments in the Seanad.  We must end austerity, which has hit the health sector in particular and mental health and old age services within that.  We must end cuts to the carer's allowance, and we have also seen how the respite care grant was cut.  We have witnessed long waiting lists for people seeking autism assessments and the Government has taken legal cases against those attempting to access services for their children.  Irish Sign Language has not been recognised, and people with disabilities in the mental health area have been particularly hit by austerity.  We saw shameful scenes over the summer when people with disabilities picketed Government Buildings and stayed overnight.  Unless there is a commitment to end austerity, the rights being put in place in this legislation will not be fulfilled.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102100032#EE00500","speaker":"1195"},{"type":"speech","time":1445433300,"counter":615,"content":"<p>I welcome the clarity that the Minister of State intends to bring to the issue, particularly with respect to amendment No. 128.  I also welcome her commitment, which I do not doubt, to have it included in the legislation that is about to be published.<\/p><p>I acknowledge that absolutely, but there are issues that need to be ventilated at this stage.  The first point is that the European Convention on Human Rights states that \"[n]o one shall be subject to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment\" and that every single citizen \"has the right to liberty and security of person\".  No one can be deprived of their liberty, except \"in the following cases and in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law\" as the European Convention on Human Rights states.  They include \"the lawful detention of a person after conviction of a competent court\" and the lawful detention of a person who is suffering from a mental disorder, as defined under the mental health Acts.  In addition, \"Everyone who has been the victim of arrest or detention [...] shall have an enforceable right to compensation\" and \"[e]veryone has the right to respect for his privacy and family life\" and \"there shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law\".  In fact, there is no clear law for the deprivation of rights of an individual that does not fall into category 5.  The Law Society has been concerned about this issue.  To enjoy the rights to liberty and security of a person, nobody can be deprived of their liberty unlawfully or arbitrarily, and any deprivation of liberty must be in conformity with the law.  There is a duty on us as a State that if persons with disabilities are deprived of their liberty through any process, they are, on an equal basis with others, entitled to guarantees in accordance with international human rights principles.<\/p> <p> Again, older persons who are placed in institutional care have the right to freedom of movement.  Any restrictions must be lawful, necessary and proportionate in accordance with international law.  Older people, in principle, should only be placed in a residential institution or in psychiatric care with their free and informed consent.  Any exception must fulfil the requirements of the European Convention on Human Rights.  This amendment defines deprivation of liberty and states that \"[a] relevant person or any person having an interest in the well-being of a relevant person or any person who is concerned that the relevant person may be deprived of his or her liberty or where there is an interference with private and family life which is not in accordance with the European Convention on Human Rights, may make a complaint to the Director of the Decision Support Service\".  There is a clear vehicle where somebody who is concerned and has a right to be concerned can exercise that right by referring it to a very important officer, which is at the core of this legislation and the director, on receipt of such a complaint, can investigate it immediately and, if necessary, refer it to the courts.<\/p> <p> The Council of Europe recommends that older persons, in principle, should only be placed in residential, institutional or psychiatric care with their free and informed consent.  Any exception to this principle must fulfil the requirements of the convention on human rights.  There are issues, clearly, where people with an intellectual disability and people who suffer from dementia are placed in institutional care.  The question of whether they are there with their consent has to be properly and fully decided with respect to the deprivation of their liberty.  It is not tenable that vulnerable persons can be deprived of their liberty when there is no clear guidance as to what constitutes deprivation of liberty or any indication of the limitations or procedures.  It is absolutely vital, and I accept the Minister will take steps on this, that where a relevant person has been deprived of his or her liberty or where there is interference in article 8, the legislation will relate to that.  It is right and proper that the Minister of State offered consultation with the responsible officials.  I am happy to withdraw this amendment on the basis of what she said, but I would like her assurance that we will have recognition of the policy issue to be addressed with those officials and any other parties outside who should be concerned.<\/p> <p> Finally, we all come across in our work as public representatives people who suffer from dementia and whose family reach a stage where they cannot look after them anymore.  We all know that and we all acknowledge it.  We also acknowledge the care, love, attention, and commitment that leads whole families to exhaust all the members of those families in looking after people with dementia and people who suffer from intellectual and other disabilities.  That is not always the case.  It is to protect the people who may be placed in care when there are other alternatives for them.  That is a very important point.  I know the role of the State is not a matter for debate today but we spend hundreds of millions on the care of people under the fair deal scheme and in nursing and institutional care, and yet we do not spend one fifth of the funding we should spend on keeping those people in their homes for as long as possible.  One of the key challenges facing the next Government is to make sure that people in our community who are in the area we are talking about are looked after for as long as possible in their homes.  I welcome the return of the respite care grant.  Supports to families and to carers to look after people in their home are absolutely essential and need to be fast-tracked.  The money must be put into supporting families who are looking after their loved ones in the community.  The best possible place for people to be is in their homes and in family care, but to avoid having exhausted family members and people who are on the brink of serious medical problems themselves because of the stress they face, we need much more support from the State for home help and care at home.<\/p> <p> Another issue that needs to be addressed is the question of technology to help people stay in their homes for longer.  I know the Minister of State has been to Dundalk, where she has looked at the Great Northern Haven, a place for people who are mobile and able to look after themselves but which ensures that as they get older, they will be able to stay in their homes.  Technology is used to turn on the light when they get out of bed, to interrogate them in a friendly way about whether they took their pills or not that day, or to know whether they have fallen on the ground.  There are all sorts of other issues that need to be addressed, which are absolutely critical for the future of our society and for the care of older people in our community.  When somebody is of advanced years, the last place to put them is into care.  The first place must always be to keep them in their homes, but it is necessary to increase significantly the State help to those families and to be generous in that.  No longer do I want to be called to a house to speak to a lady who is in her late 70s and whose husband in his 80s, where she cannot look after him because he is doubly incontinent and the house is upside down because the woman is at her wits' end.  She cannot look after her husband, whom she has loved and cared for all her life and he has always cared for her.  It is not good enough to have a woman in that position having to face the vista of four and a half hours of home help for the week to look after her husband.  It is not good enough and it is not acceptable.  I hope, as things improve financially, that Members will make significant commitments.  All political parties and none, whoever they are and whoever they are not, when they stand for the election in the next few months should put on the record where they stand on these issues.  They are the most important basic issues of care into the future for our society as it gets older.<\/p> <p> Finally, on the question of dementia care and the Alzheimer's Society, I find it difficult to defend situations where people who offer respite and help to people in their homes are being challenged by the budgetary situation they are in.  There is significant human suffering going on.  There are families bearing major burdens of care and we are not doing enough to help them.<\/p><p>I hope that every party, including my own, will step up to the mark on this in the next general election.<br\/><br\/>I welcome the Minister of State's commitments.  Perhaps she would give the reassurance of consultation at the appropriate stage.  Accordingly, I will withdraw my amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102100032#EE00600","speaker":"1069","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1445434500,"counter":618,"content":"<p>I note the Minister of State's comment.

That will not be a difficulty.  The deprivation of liberty is a particular difficulty for us.  I would hope to get the capacity legislation in place before Christmas but the deprivation of liberty is an issue.  As Deputy O'Dowd correctly pointed out, it is not only about persons with mental health difficulties because they are dealt with under the mental health legislation more than any other legislation.  It is not about prisoners because they are dealt with under justice legislation.  The issue of persons with intellectual disability and older persons with dementia is a particularly challenging difficulty.  We are advised, because we have been asking for a considerable period, that the best legislation in which to include it is the disability equality (miscellaneous provisions) Bill which is being worked on as we speak.  We probably have greater scope in that to do something comprehensive.  It will be one of the pieces of work that will be out of the way in terms of ratification.<\/p>  <p>  In response to Deputy Naughten, it will not be possible to stay in wardship.  I understand the Deputy's point.  It is one of the struggles we have had in terms of questions about a person's will and preference and if he or she wants to stay.  The difficulty, as all the experts, especially Professor Gerard Quinn and his team, will tell the Deputy, is that wardship is too paternalistic and we must move away from it.  However, we must move away from it in a way that we have safeguards in place to ensure those involved are not left floundering and that a structure is in place to protect them as they move away from wardship.  It will not be possible to stay, however.<\/p>  <p>  I say to Deputy Coppinger that it is a terrible pity she entered in the middle of the debate because I am sure what I stated to Deputy Mac Lochlainn, who has been centrally involved in all this, is that it is not an issue of resources.

As agreed by the D&aacute;il on Committee Stage, the person appointed to head the decisions support service will be titled the director.<\/p><p>Deputy O'Dowd's amendments Nos. 105 and 106 propose that the director of the decision support service would be appointed by the Minister for Justice and Equality rather than by the Courts Service.  However, it would not be appropriate for the Minister for Justice and Equality to make this appointment if the decision support service is to be located in the Courts Service.<\/p><p>As the Deputy is aware, the Government decided in June 2013 that the body responsible for undertaking the functions foreseen under this Bill would be located in the Courts Service.  As a consequence, I cannot accept the Deputy's amendments.  Similarly, I cannot accept the Deputy&rsquo;s amendments Nos. 117 to 119, inclusive, which propose that the director of the decision support service would make an annual report to the Minister for Justice and Equality rather than to the board of the Courts Service.  The director&rsquo;s reports will have to be made to the body to which he or she is answerable.  The Bill provides, in line with the Government&rsquo;s decision of June 2013, that this should be the Courts Service.  For this reason, I cannot accept the Deputy&rsquo;s amendments.<\/p> <p> Amendments Nos. 107 to 109, inclusive, propose that the functions of the director of the decision support service would be amended to remove the requirement for him or her to give guidance to persons such as decision-making representatives, attorneys, designated health care representatives, co-decision-makers, decision-making assistants or other persons exercising decision-making roles under the Act.  The reason for the amendment is that the director will have the role of supervising persons with decision-making functions under the Act.  It could compromise the director&rsquo;s supervisory role if he or she also gave guidance to those persons under the Act.  If the director were to advise a person to enter a co-decision-making agreement, for example, and a complaint was subsequently lodged by a third party against the co-decision-maker, the director's ability to investigate the complaint might be affected because of the advice previously given.  In view of the director's regulatory functions, it is more appropriate, therefore, to limit his or her role to that of providing information on the provisions of the Act.  The director will continue to have the role of offering guidance to specific sectors, such as the health care sector, given that they will not come under his or her supervisory functions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102100034#GG03100","speaker":"982","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1445435100,"counter":649,"content":"<p>While I hear what the Minister is saying, I want to make it very clear that at the very heart of the Bill is a very important person, namely, the director of the decision support service.  The functions under the Bill have been greatly expanded, which I welcome.  There are very positive and important aspects of the legislation which everybody wants to pass and I very much welcome it.  However, many of the issues which need to be addressed are multidisciplinary and administrative and do not require or are not appropriate for a court hearing.<\/p>  <p>  The director has been given powers to investigate complaints formally, by calling witnesses, or informally.  The director will have a supervisory function including the establishment and maintenance of a number of registers and will have responsibilities to formulate codes of practice, identify and make recommendations for changes of practices and so on.  The view of the Law Society is that given the wider context in which the director must operate, it should not constitute an element of the administration of justice.  The legislation should provide that the decision support service would be an agency directly within the Department of Justice and Equality and not be an agency within an existing agency.  This is critical and would mean the service would not be under the thumb of the Courts Service but would be independent in its function, which is broader than the Courts Service, separate from it and under the jurisdiction of the Minister and Department.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill provides that the director be appointed by the Courts Service, that the staff should be members of the staff of the Courts Service and that the Courts Service shall be the appropriate authority regarding members of staff.  This will give rise to perceptions on the part of vulnerable people who in many cases, with their families, require information, assistance and direction in coping with capacity issues and who do not see themselves as looking to a legalistic Courts Service for such assistance.  It does not take account of the wider context of the decision support services operation and is a mismatch between the statutory function of two services.  There is no synergy between the legal function of the director and that of the Courts Service.  This is very important.<\/p>  <p>  The provision in the legislation is not the best place for this power to reside.  It should be independent of the Courts Service.  The Minister said it would not be appropriate for the Minister to appoint the director, and I agree it should not be a political decision.  Like the Garda assistant Commissioner posts, which were filled by open competition yesterday morning, the job should be advertised under the proper independent procedures and appointed by the accountable Minister.  It would give greater separation of powers from the functions of the Courts Service which is entirely different in every respect from the function of this office.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102100035#HH00200","speaker":"1069"},{"type":"speech","time":1445435100,"counter":650,"content":"<p>I understand perfectly where the Deputy is coming from and we have agonised over it.  Even if the job is filled as a result of public advertisement and open competition, perception is reality in politics.  Once it is considered to be a decision ultimately made by the Minister, even if drawn from a list into which the Minister had no input, it will be perceived as a political appointment.  The service is very clearly embedded in law.  The person who heads the service will be essential and important.  His or her attitude will be determined not just by the legislation but by the guiding principles behind the legislation.  The director should be not too formal yet very conscious of the legal framework behind the office.  We have discussed the issue in great detail and our recommendation is that it be within the Courts Service.  Therefore, I cannot accept the amendment.<\/p>  <p>  Having spoken to people who are experts in this area, I am not certain we want to establish a whole new apparatus around the service.  We want to get away from the paternalistic attitude we had and still have.  We are at the discussion stage on the legislation and as of now it will be in the Courts Service.  It is essential we get the right person as director and that he or she has the right to assemble his or her own staff.

If we did so, it might prevent a treatment from being developed which could be to their benefit, such as a drug for Alzheimer's disease.  The key issue is not to prevent people who lack capacity from participating in clinical trials but rather to ensure that if they do so, there will be robust safeguards in place.  There is already an extensive framework in place to protect subjects participating in clinical trials, including incapacitated subjects, in the EU (Clinical Trials on Medicinal Products for Human Use) Regulations 2004, SI 190\/2004, as amended.  In addition, the clinical trials regulation, EU No. 536\/2014, which is due to come into force in 2016, also contains extensive provisions relating to the protection of subjects.

However, there is nothing in the current Bill that specifically enables patients in approved centres to avail of the assisted decision-making provisions of the Bill.  We consider that patients in approved centres should have the same rights as others to avail of assisted decision-making in respect of day-to-day decisions.  We consider that the Bill should contain a clear statement that it applies in full to all patients in approved centres, save in so far as section 104 applies to any such patient.  The inclusion of an express statement to this effect will ensure that the benefits of the legislation are available to people in approved centres.  This amendment is not intended to be taken as an endorsement of the current provisions in Part 4 of the Mental Health Act, and previous submissions to the Department of Health regarding the review of the Mental Health Act should be borne in mind in this context.

The group's recommendations around this issue are quite interesting.  We are currently devising the general scheme of a Bill to amend the Mental Health Act of 2001, which dovetails with this legislation.  That is important, and it is what Deputy Mac Lochlainn is seeking to achieve with his amendment.<\/p>  <p>  Section 119 of the Bill seeks to ensure that there is no conflict between the Bill and the Mental Health Act 2001 with respect to the treatment of a patient with a mental disorder in an approved centre.  It is clear from this section that a person with a mental disorder receiving treatment in an approved centre is governed by Part 4 of the Mental Health Act 2001.  Under that Act, one of the conditions that a patient must fulfil in order to be involuntarily admitted to an approved centre is that he or she must have a mental disorder as defined in section 3 of the Act.  Section 8 of the Act provides that a person may be involuntarily admitted to an approved centre pursuant to an application under section 9 or 12 and detained there on the grounds that he or she is suffering from a mental disorder.  Therefore, all persons referred to in section 119 would have to be involuntary patients in an approved centre admitted under the Mental Health Act 2001.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Mac Lochlainn's amendment seeks to ensure that the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Bill applies to all persons receiving treatment in an approved centre, with the exception of those referred to in subsections (1) and (2) of section 119 or otherwise expressly provided by any other provision of the Act - that is, involuntary patients.  Therefore, it would appear that the persons to which this amendment could apply are voluntary patients receiving treatment in an approved centre.  Sometimes a perverse logic appears in legislation.<\/p>  <p>  It is contested that section 119 already provides for the amendment that the Deputy is seeking by expressly not authorising a person to give treatment for mental disorder or to consent to a patient being given treatment for mental disorder if his or her treatment is regulated by Part 4 of the 2001 Act - that is, involuntary patients - and the implication is that the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Bill applies to all other persons, including those voluntarily admitted to an approved centre, once they fulfil the definition of a relevant person in the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Bill.<\/p>  <p>  I recently received Government approval to proceed with a general scheme of a Bill to amend the Mental Health Act 2001 based on the recommendations of an expert group report published in March this year.  The expert group report contains 165 recommendations, a number of which relate to the assessment of capacity.  It is interesting to look at what the group is recommending and what is already contained in the Bill.  The expert group acknowledged in its report that when revised mental health legislation is being framed a further look at the final proposals in this Bill will be required.  The group was not certain how this Bill would finally shake out and had to make certain assumptions.  <\/p>  <p>  The expert group has recommended that it will be necessary to develop simultaneously recommendations and guidelines for the assessment of capacity of persons who require admission to an approved centre for mental health treatment.<\/p><p>In other words, the group fully accepts this position.  Before the Bill was drawn up, it expressed the view that capacity must also be assessed when a person is being admitted or assessed for admission.  The expert group was very clear on the need for the admitting mental health professional to establish if the person has the capacity to understand and give his or her consent to the proposed admission to an approved centre.  If the admitting mental health professional forms the view that the person may lack capacity to understand and give his or her informed consent to the proposed admission, he or she must refer the person for formal capacity assessment.  If, following assessment, it is deemed that a person has capacity to admit himself or herself, a voluntary admission may proceed.  If it is deemed that the person needs support to understand, make or convey this decision, such support must be provided and the exact detail of how this support will be provided will be examined in further detail during the preparation of the general scheme of the revision to the Mental Health Act.<\/p> <p> As outlined, the revision of the Mental Health Act 2001 will put procedures in place to ensure the capacity of persons being admitted to approved centres is assessed and, where necessary, supports are put in place.  The exact detail of how this will work and how it will interact with the legislation before us will be explored and examined in greater detail during the preparation of the general scheme of a Bill, a process that is under way in the Department of Health.<\/p> <p> There may be a danger that the proposed amendment will be interpreted as meaning that all patients receiving treatment in an approved centre will need to avail of the provisions of the Act, which cannot possibly be the case.  While a large number of patients will lack capacity or need assistance making decisions, there will be patients with full capacity who will be able to decide on all issues by themselves.  The issue of whether a person needs the assistance of the Act should be determined by whether he or she is a \"relevant person\", as outlined in the definitions, not by the fact that he or she is receiving treatment as a voluntary patient in an approved centre.  <\/p> <p> That was a long-winded way of informing Deputy Mac Lochlainn that I will not accept his amendment.  I hope he now understands the reasons for my decision.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102100037#KK03000","speaker":"982","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1445436900,"counter":775,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for her response.

The cross-reference remained in the Bill incorrectly following the agreement on Committee Stage to my amendment proposing to delete the provisions that would have allowed an application to be made to the High Court to alter a will when a person has lost testamentary capacity.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 145 proposed by Deputy O'Dowd seeks to re-insert a provision that was removed on Committee Stage.  The principle that a person's will should be respected goes to the heart of our system of succession.  A will is made when a person has capacity and reflects the will and preferences of the person in terms of how his or her property and assets are to be disposed of after death.  As I indicated when I sought the Committee Stage amendment, the court has traditionally been very reluctant to interfere with a will as the expression of a person's will and preferences.<\/p><p>I appreciate that there may be changes in circumstances between the point at which a will is drawn up and the death of the person.  Such changes may make it impossible to carry out the person&rsquo;s intentions at the time the will was drawn up.  At the same time, if the principle is conceded that a will can be changed when a person has lost capacity, we run the risk that a beneficiary may falsely claim to the court that he or she can correctly interpret what the person's wishes were at the time the will was drawn up.  We have no way of verifying the person's intentions with the person as that person will have lost capacity.  The provision could lead to a circumstance in which a will might be altered against the intentions of the person.  I am not satisfied that the provisions allowing for this facility to be used only in exceptional circumstances and where the interests of justice so demand are sufficient safeguards.  <\/p><p>The more appropriate way to approach this issue is for solicitors to advise clients at the time of drawing up a will to ensure they are clear as to the way in which their intentions can be expressed most appropriately in a will, as well as the factors that may prevent their intentions from ultimately being implemented.  This will enable a person, while still retaining capacity, to have the choice as to how to address the problem.  For this reason, I cannot accept the Deputy&rsquo;s amendment.<\/p><p>Deputy O'Dowd proposes, in amendment No. 146, to provide for a trust to be presumed in favour of the transferor in a voluntary transfer of property.  This amendment does not seem to be specifically focused on persons with capacity difficulties and, as such, appears to be beyond the scope of the Bill.In any case, it will require further analysis and legal advice.  While I cannot accept the amendment for these reasons, we will consider the matter further.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102100038#LL00600","speaker":"982"},{"type":"speech","time":1445436900,"counter":780,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for her response.  As she indicated, the Bill, as initially published, included a provision similar to that proposed in amendment No. 146.  However, the proposed measure was subsequently deleted.  She is correct that making changes to wills is a serious matter, which must only be permitted in extremely important circumstances.  The Law Reform Commission recommended permitting the High Court to make changes to a will in exceptional circumstances.  This recommendation is reflected in my amendment.  Why would the Law Reform Commission argue in favour of such a provision and why has the Department not accepted its recommendation?<\/p>  <p>  Given how far we have gone on these issues, it is clear that there are serious and significant arguments in favour of my proposal.  The Minister of State has outlined that, on balance, she accepts the arguments against the measure.  The proposal should be implemented in the legislation because it is based on the experience of legal practitioners who can cite many examples to support it.  In many cases, a person provides in a will for equal treatment to each and all of his or her children and gives specific assets to each of them.  However, during a subsequent lack of capacity, liquid assets bequeathed to a particular beneficiary may be used for the benefit of the testator, thereby leaving one of the children out of benefit.  If the testator had the capacity to do so and in line with the overarching intention to benefit all and each of his or her children equally, he or she would alter the will to ensure equal benefit.  The Law Reform Commission recommended allowing the High Court to alter a will if justice demands and in exceptional circumstances.  The commission was careful to point out that it would not be appropriate to intervene in circumstances where no will had been drawn up as to do so would be to impose a view on the testator.  I reiterate that the recommendation of the Law Reform Commission should stand and apply only in exceptional circumstances. <\/p>  <p>  The manipulation of assets by members of the legal profession, attorneys and family members through joint accounts and other means sometimes, though rarely, results in individuals, primarily family members, being able to arrange inheritance to suit themselves and ensure other family members do not inherit or are disinherited.  In practice, this is an area that is wide open to abuse.  The Law Reform Commission consulted practitioners before making its recommendations.  As such, the proposed amendment has the authority and experience of the legal profession behind it.  The amendment is before the House to deal with such exceptional circumstances.<\/p><p>The second amendment deals with financial abuse.  Financial abuse is clearly a very serious issue.  There are increased levels of financial abuse, particularly of older people, and various HSE reports, including Open Your Eyes, clearly state that legislation must be put in place to provide safeguards and meet our obligations under the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  The convention states that states party shall ensure that all measures relating to the exercise of legal capacity provide for appropriate and effective safeguards to prevent abuse in accordance with international human rights law.  HIQA and HSE reports into nursing homes show that there have been significant allegations of financial abuse.  I am aware of a case in County Meath in which the owner of a nursing home was the beneficiary of a will, which was entirely inappropriate.  There was litigation about that.  It is very important to protect our people from financial abuse.  What is recommended here is only one element.  Joint accounts can often abused, and this may be facilitated by financial institutions which do not raise the appropriate red flags when these issues arise.  Research from the National Centre for the Protection of Older People at UCD and the annual report of the HSE show that there is a large element of financial abuse, particularly of older people.  The abuse is there and my amendments are reasonable and proper.  While they will not be accepted by the Minister of State, I accept in the good faith in which she offers it her commitment to look at this issue again.<\/p> <p> The recommendation of the Council of Europe on the promotion of the human rights of older people sets out that member states shall provide for appropriate awareness-raising and other measures to protect older people from financial abuse, including deception and fraud.  I welcome the Minister of State's response to my second amendment, although I do not agree with what she said about the first.  I am happy to hear her comments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102100038#LL00700","speaker":"1069","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1445437500,"counter":782,"content":"<p>I appreciate what the Deputy has said.

Each and every one of us expects that no matter to whom we leave what little we have as we depart this world, our wishes and preferences will be respected.  It would have to be extraordinary or exceptional circumstances for it to be otherwise.  When these cases arrive in court, it usually ends up that there is nothing left to be distributed.

I accept the Minister of State's point that this is what is going to be in the legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102100039#MM00300","speaker":"1069"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1445437500,"counter":784,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1445437500,"counter":785,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 145 and 146 not moved.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1445437500,"counter":786,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 147:<\/p><blockquote>In page 107, to delete lines 4 and 5 and substitute the following:&ldquo;(b) in subsection (5), by deleting &ldquo;subsections (2) and (3)&rdquo; and substituting&ldquo;subsections (2), (2A) and (3)&rdquo;.&rdquo;.<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102100039#MM00600","speaker":"982"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1445437500,"counter":787,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1445437500,"counter":788,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 148:<\/p><blockquote>In page 108, lines 41 and 42, to delete &ldquo;designated healthcare representative or person referred to in <i>section 61(1)<\/i>&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;or designated healthcare representative&rdquo;.<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102100039#MM00800","speaker":"982"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1445437500,"counter":789,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1445437500,"counter":790,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 149:<\/p><blockquote>In page 109, line 8, to delete &ldquo;5th anniversary&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;2nd anniversary&rdquo;.<\/blockquote><p>This is a self-explanatory amendment.

It will change how people who are close to others will have to think.  Changing how people think is a major task.  My preference would be to introduce the legislation on an incremental basis because the people it affects are people with whom time will have to be spent to explain exactly what its impact is and what it makes possible for their own circumstances.  On that basis, two years is far too short a period after which to review the legislation.  The Bill will have an impact on everyone's life, whether as a carer or as someone being cared for.  It will have a significant impact.  Five years will be seen in hindsight to be a very short period in which to allow the legislation to become embedded and part of the institutional structures which will take us into the future.  I consider two years to be too short, and I do not say so to be awkward; I believe it.  I am still fascinated by the fact that the Mental Health Act 2001 is already being reviewed even though it was due to be reviewed much earlier.  Clearly, all of the elements had not been put in place.  Now that it is being reviewed, we can look back and ask what we would do differently.  We will be doing the same with the legislation before us and determining how it has dovetailed with other Acts.<\/p>  <p>  I can understand the Deputy's desire to have a review more quickly because we are always worried that something may just be something else for the shelf.  Clearly, when it is legislation, it cannot be something else for the shelf.  As such, we must be careful about how we proceed.  There will be certain groups in society whom we can move more quickly with, but there will also be those on whom this will have an impact and with whom we will have to be very careful and tread very softly.  I am not saying \"No\" to the Deputy's amendment for the sake of saying \"No.\"  I believe genuinely that it needs more time, just as the wards of court matter that we dealt with earlier needs more than six months.  I accept fully that the Deputy's job is to ensure that it happens as quickly as possible, but five years is a reasonable timeframe.  If it happens more quickly, happy days, but five years is a decent timeframe in terms of the type of legislation this is.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102100039#MM01100","speaker":"982"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1445438100,"counter":792,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1445438100,"counter":793,"content":"<p>Bill, as amended, received for final consideration.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1445438100,"counter":794,"content":"<p>Question proposed: &quot;That the Bill do now pass.&quot;<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1445438100,"counter":795,"content":"<p>Since this is significant legislation, we can all be justifiably proud when it concludes.

Anyway, I shall do my best to impart my wisdom in 15 minutes.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister has extolled the virtues of the unwinding of the financial emergency legislation.  The dark days are over and we are on the road to recovery, he says.  That is what he would have us believe.  The FEMPI legislation came about because of the catastrophic situation that the country found itself in as a result of the failed and disastrous policies of a Fianna F&aacute;il Government, policies that were compounded by the current Government's response to the crisis.  The current Government championed policies that led to further severe austerity measures that left those on lower incomes and the less fortunate reeling.  While the catastrophe required a response, the cuts and policies were felt most acutely by those whom this Government specifically targeted.  That was certainly the case for low-paid public sector workers.<\/p><p>Starting with Fianna F&aacute;il and continuing with the current Administration, emergency legislation has been put in place that has left the public service with staff cuts, moratoriums on recruitment, cuts in pay, pension reductions, increment freezes and increased working hours.  The legislation before the D&aacute;il today aims to unwind aspects of the emergency Bills.  As explained last night, it sets out the terms for a partial restoration of pension reductions and a restoration of some pay to public servants or, as the memorandum accompanying the Bill helpfully tells us, it will \"reduce the reductions\".<\/p> <p> Sinn F&eacute;in has been very clear throughout this whole process.  When agreements were negotiated and legislation was debated on where we stand in regard to these and other cuts, we were very consistent in arguing in the D&aacute;il, the Seanad, the media and the public domain that we did not and do not support any measures that cut the pay of low- and middle-income public sector workers.  We argued very strongly that any new deal must prioritise pay restoration for low-paid public servants.  We have been consistent in the analysis that targeting low- and middle-income workers' pay is economically and socially unsound.  In addition, Sinn F&eacute;in has consistently argued for a living wage.  In its recent pre-budget submission to the Government, it provided for a living wage to be introduced across the public sector.<\/p> <p> The truth is that long before there was ever a recession in this State, there was an enormous pay gap between the highest and lowest paid in the public service.  If one examines wage inflation between 1997 and 2009 and compares the accumulation in income of a Secretary General by comparison with a clerical officer in that period, the yawning, enormous and indefensible pay gap becomes all the more evident.  It is clear to us that lower-paid public servants not only were left behind by the Celtic tiger but, like other low-paid workers, took the brunt of the Government's austerity measures while the higher-paid public servants forged ahead and were cosseted, resulting in an ever-increasing pay gap.  In negotiating the agreements and implementing the various emergency Bills at all the various stages, the Government had a golden opportunity to tackle once and for all the considerable pay inequity across the public service and Civil Service, yet it failed to do so.  I must emphasise again for the purpose of clarity that those who are overpaid and over-pensioned in the public service and Civil Service comprise a tiny minority of the workforce.<\/p> <p> At the conclusion of the talks that led to the Lansdowne Road agreement, we examined its measures in detail.  We did not take the agreement in isolation.  We met the trade unions and talked to various stakeholders.  It became obvious that, while the Government wished to sell the agreement on the basis that it primarily or wholly targeted low- and middle-income workers, this was not the totality of the story.  I wish to challenge directly the claim of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, last night in respect of this legislation.  He said it was important to stress that the legislation is progressive and measured, with lower-paid public servants standing to gain most.  That is not the truth, yet it has been the substance of the rhetoric on this legislation and the Lansdowne Road deal since it was struck.  However, as with most things in life, the devil becomes evident in the detail.  Section 5.2 of the Lansdowne Road agreement makes a commitment \"to commence the process to reduce the pay reductions applied under the FEMPI Act 2013\".  In other words, it refers to the Haddington Road agreement.  If the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform were here, I am sure he would recall that we have had conversations on this before.  I put it to him before that it is not possible to consider both agreements separately or in isolation.  To understand the impact on public pay and public sector workers, one needs to consider the agreements in the round.  Both must be viewed as one complete whole.<\/p> <p> Far from representing a measured and prudent unwinding of the FEMPI legislation, as the Minister claims, the provision before us is such that, although lower-paid public servants do receive some relief, the reliefs are proportionately far greater for those further up the scale.  The Minister is aware of where our concerns lie.  I believe this should be of concern to him.  I will say more on this subject in a few moments.<\/p> <p> If the Government is serious about the reform of the public sector, it should use every opportunity presented to it to eliminate runaway pay at the top, ensure greater pay parity and eradicate gold-plated pensions.  Such opportunities presented themselves in the midst of the greatest financial catastrophe the State had faced, yet the Government wimped out of dealing with those issues.  I have submitted amendments to FEMPI legislation that would have specifically and unapologetically targeted high-income earners and protected low- and middle-income workers and their increments.  The amendments would have removed the ability of the Government to increase working hours at a whim, but all to no avail.  Time and again, the legislation went through without amendment.<\/p> <p> Not unlike others in society, public and civil servants at lower grades and on low pay struggle badly.  The real question for them is whether there will be some relief in their pay packets and households.  We have brought to the attention of the Minister previously the fact that many public sector workers rely on the family income supplement to make ends meet.  It is a disgrace that anybody employed by the State would be reliant on that supplement.<\/p> <p> While we welcome some amendments, such as the small provision that puts extra money in workers' pockets, we believe that no matter how much one tries to spin the legislation, it shows once again that the Government does not have in mind a fair recovery or restoration.  Recovery and restoration are in mind for those on higher wages, admittedly, but if there were a fair recovery there would be greater pay parity.  Low-income workers, who need full pay restoration the most, would receive it.  Why are the only real beneficiaries of the two agreements, in substantive terms, those who need to benefit least?  If it is the case that the focus is on those earning incomes of under &euro;65,000, who will, let it be said, have an additional &euro;1,000 per annum in their pockets, why is there such a sharp contrast with those earning over &euro;65,000 and up to &euro;110,000, who will see the full unwinding of the FEMPI cuts in respect of the higher portion of their wages?  How could the Government argue that this represents a focus on the lower paid?  Higher-income earners will have the cuts to their pay fully restored in two tranches.  If one earns between &euro;65,000 and &euro;110,000, the first restoration is envisaged to apply in April 2017 and the second is to apply in January 2018.  The real high rollers, on wages over &euro;110,000, will receive a full restoration in respect of the income above &euro;110,000 in three stages, beginning in April 2017 and ending in April 2019.<\/p><p>Where we see the full row-back on the cuts is for the higher proportion of income that higher income earners have.  Full unwinding, therefore, only applies to a select few.  This is a partial unwinding of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest, FEMPI, Act for those earning under &euro;65,000 and a comprehensive and complete unwinding for high earnings thereafter.  Where is the fairness in that?<\/p> <p> When the Landsdowne Road agreement was reached, I was struck that trade union members and workers initially took the Minister on his word that the focus was on those on lower wages, certainly up to the &euro;65,000 bracket.  It was only after the fact that the full picture and consequences came to the attention of those workers and perhaps their trade unions.  This is a matter we will return to on Committee Stage when we will submit amendments in that regard.<\/p> <p> Can the Minister claim that this is a proportionate response?  Can he tell those public sector workers that while the cuts hit those public sector workers on the lowest incomes hardest, they will have to stomach the prospect that restoration is unequally applied and favours high earnings and high earners?  It is disingenuous for anyone to suggest that the Lansdowne Road agreement focuses entirely on the low paid.  That is manifestly not the case in this legislation.<\/p> <p> It is also a fact that front-line workers have been disproportionately hit.  I refer to our nurses, garda&iacute;, firefighters and doctors who are expected to deliver a 24 hours a day, seven days a week service to keep us safe and to look after our well-being.  We must bear in mind that these are not just public sector workers.  They are husbands, wives, mothers and fathers who have mortgages to pay, children to feed and rent to meet, and all from a very depleted pay packet.  These workers, who have had their pay significantly reduced over the years, simply could give no more.  They were squeezed until the very pips squeaked, and what is their reward for their pain?  It is certainly not full restoration of pay or pension deductions.  There may be the promise of that, but that has not become clear.<\/p> <p> Both the Lansdowne Road and Haddington Road agreements were implemented by a Government that saw no other strategy or option but to punish public services rather than invest in them and enhance them, and there is no doubt that the standard of living of public sector workers has been damaged.  I note in his contribution last night the Minister paid tribute to workers across the public and Civil Service.  That is as it should be, but the actions of this Government would not lead any of those workers to believe they are valued.  The truth is that within the sector we still do not have appropriate decent pay and working conditions for all of the workers, and we have the desperate spectacle of the chosen few and the rest.  That is not a tolerable situation.<\/p> <p> The Minister is also aware from previous debates that when benchmarked with other jurisdictions, the pay gap between those on low pay and those on very high pay within the Irish system is at odds with what would be considered to be normal, healthy, acceptable and equitable in an international context.<\/p> <p> I want to comment on the requirement for the additional working hours.  The Minister stated, almost as a boast, these additional hours that have accrued to the system because of the cuts.  These additional hours have had a very detrimental impact on many workers.  In particular, in my experience they have had a great impact on women or anyone who has a child care responsibility.  All of us here know that the cost of child care is literally crippling for many families.  It is a major issue facing any working parent but for those within the public and Civil Service who find themselves in the position of working additional hours, even if it is only a small parcel of time measured out over a working week, that additional time incurs often a disproportionate and very high cost in terms of additional child care.  I know it was very disappointing for many that when the talk about unwinding FEMPI and giving back to public servants was being trumpeted by Government, the issue around these additional hours was not examined nor a cost-benefit analysis done in terms of productivity.  What are we getting for these additional hours?<\/p> <p> I understand that within the health service there may be a particular case in respect of the hours.  I am open to hearing that.  I hope we will discuss that on Committee Stage but I know that in many other scenarios - in the Civil Service, for instance - I would question the value of the additional time in productivity terms.  I know from speaking directly to people that it has had a major cost.<\/p> <p> Public sector workers are the backbone of social provision in this State.  We all depend on them at critical moments so it is not appropriate that schemes like JobBridge are used to fill the gaps in creaking services.  It is all very well to expect productivity but how are public sector workers expected to do more with fewer resources?  The recruitment embargo must be lifted.  That is one measure that will help rebuild confidence in our public services.<\/p> <p> The Minister said last night that he is proud of the considerable improvements in terms of public service provision that have been delivered since 2011.  I am not sure where the Minister is mixing or the services to which he was referring but from talking to public sector workers, and in general conversation with people in the real world, it is apparent that our services are stretched, and sometimes that is the best case scenario.  In other scenarios they are literally fit to collapse.<\/p> <p> We just had a very informative briefing from the ISPCC, which raised a range of issues that are directly attributable to lack of staff, lack of money, lack of investment and lack of understanding in terms of the services that vulnerable children require.  I refer to social workers, for instance, and weekend and out of hours cover.  We have a crisis in that particular service provision, and something that goes to the heart of the safety, well-being and future of children.  I cite that as only one example; I could cite many more.  Let no Minister come in here and pretend that they are presiding over a golden era of building, modernising and revitalising public services.  Far from it.  They have presided over cutbacks, austerity, staff shortages and crises across multiple services.<\/p> <p> It could be said that the public services in this State, taken in their totality, might be described as broken, at times ineffectual and certainly frustrating for all those dedicated individuals who are at the coal-face delivering services.  It will take much more than an election orientated budget to repair the years of neglect that are attributable not only to Fianna F&aacute;il and the previous Administration but directly attributable to this Government.<\/p><p><i>5 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p>We have to address the problems in our public services, repair the damage and invest and build them up.  The scandal of the trolley crisis is probably the most immediate crisis that jumps into the minds of citizens.  It is the clearest illustration of what can happen when we do not protect our services and implement the cuts and other measures that have occurred in recent years.  There has been an ongoing failure on the part of this Government to deal in any meaningful way with the housing crisis and the homeless crisis or to address realistically the deterioration in our health service.  While these crises exist we are not on the road to recovery, contrary to what the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, claimed last evening.<\/p> <p> The money going out on excessive wages, for instance, could be better spent improving services and contributing to the investment we need.  An Taoiseach earns a salary of &euro;185,000.  Under this legislation, he will see reinstatement of his previous salary.  It that not correct?  I see no argument for paying the Taoiseach &euro;185,000 and I certainly see no argument for paying the Taoiseach more than &euro;185,000.  It is a matter of equity and democratic credibility for senior Ministers, Government officials and senior politicians, who insist, to use the old L'Or&eacute;al clich&eacute;, that they are worth it and, moreover, that some are more equal and more deserving than others.<\/p> <p> When taken in the round and considering the struggle that public sector workers have endured and continue to endure to this day, the question of the treatment by the State of its low and middle-income employees arises.  What does it say about the State as an employer?  I imagine any impartial observer would suggest that it reflects the State as not being a good or fair employer.  If there is to be a fair recovery and equitable restoration of pay and pension cuts, and if the Government is really serious about doing something, especially for low-income public sector workers, then those in government must cast their gaze to the bottom rung, where they reside, as well as cast their eyes upwards.  The Government should cut the excessive pay of the tiny minority of the overpaid.  The Government should act to restore fully the cuts to low-income workers.  They deserve more than what is offered in this package.<\/p> <p> I believe the Government's commitment to the investment in public sector services generally will also be reflected in the commitment - if the Government has any - to investing in the pockets and pay packets of those on low and middle incomes, those who essentially and by virtue of their numbers drive, run and produce all the positivity that public services can bring to bear in our society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102100040#NN01100","speaker":"1008","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1445439900,"counter":806,"content":"<p>I understand Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett is sharing time with Deputy Clare Daly and Deputy Ruth Coppinger.

We will take ten minutes each.  The financial emergency measures legislation was used to cut the pay of public servants.  It was an instance of the utterly savage and unjust gouging of the incomes of those who are, for the most part, low-paid or middle-earning public servants.  They were asked to pay a cruel price for the crimes of others.  This was accompanied, of course, with a horrendous wave of hysteria and demonisation directed at civil and public servants.  They were scapegoated for the crimes of others.  At the time, it was a rather Orwellian turn in the political narrative because public and civil servants were vilified as somehow responsible for the unprecedented economic crash when, with the exception of a few of the mandarins at the top, the vast majority had no responsibility whatsoever for the crash.  In fact, that crash resulted from the naked greed of bankers, developers and bondholders, ably accompanied by the mandarins at the top of the Civil Service and facilitated by the political establishment in this country and throughout Europe.<\/p>  <p>  The scale of the assault on pay and conditions was really rather savage.  It is important to emphasise that it was pay and conditions and this point will be relevant when we try to assess the value of this legislation.  Before looking at the facts of that assault and the extent to which this legislation does or does not move towards the restoration of pay and conditions for the majority of public and civil servants in any meaningful way, it is worth giving an illustrative example of what it has meant.  It also serves to make the point to the Minister that this legislation does not do half enough and does not go anywhere near restoring pay and conditions for the majority of civil and public servants.  In fact, it is another instance of the pathetic pre-election crumbs being thrown back to people who have been savaged when, in fact, the bakery has been taken off them.  The Government steals the bakery and then throws back some crumbs and expects people to be grateful.<\/p>  <p>  Anyway, the human reality of the situation was summed up for me in recent weeks by a case that came to my constituency office.  It involves a low-paid civil servant who is facing eviction because his landlord has jacked the rent up from &euro;1,000, which was already a difficult matter for this worker to manage, to &euro;1,300.  He is now facing eviction.  He is married, he has two children and he is in receipt of the family income supplement.  With the family income supplement his total monthly income is &euro;2,054 before tax.  He and his family are now faced with a rent of &euro;1,300.  How can he do that?  How can he pay &euro;1,300 in monthly rent when his income, including the family income supplement, is &euro;2,000?  It simply cannot be done, especially given all the other bills and looking after the children and so on.  They are going to be homeless.  Then, he will go down to the community welfare officer to see if there is any chance he can get rent allowance, but he will be told that he cannot, because he is working and therefore he is not entitled to rent allowance.  This is now widespread.<\/p>  <p>  I offer another example of civil servants caught in this sort of trap.  Let us suppose a man happens to be a low-paid civil or public servant who is married and owns a house.  Then, he becomes separated.  Usually, in separation proceedings the mother and child will get to keep the house, and rightly so.  However, the man has nowhere to live but he cannot get rent allowance because he owns a house, although he cannot live in that house.  This is happening to large numbers of low-paid civil servants.<\/p>  <p>  I remind the Minister of State and the Government that these people were in no way responsible for the economic crisis.  Indeed, they were low-paid even before the crash and the assault on their wages and conditions.  Is it not extraordinary that the group who were vilified to this extent are actually suffering in this way?  They have nowhere to turn.  Aside from this legislation, the Minister and the Government might think about what I am supposed to tell this man and his family or others like him when it comes to how they are supposed to pay the rent.<\/p><p>These are the low-paid civil and public servants who keep the State functioning.  Perhaps the Minister of State could riddle me that one.<\/p> <p> The situation such people find themselves in is as a result of the extent of the assault on their wages and conditions.  People earning &euro;30,000 in 2009, before the attacks started, had &euro;16,500 taken off them between 2009 and 2015.  At the end of the period covered by the Bill and so-called pay restoration, they will receive &euro;4,351 back.  Let us not forget that these figures do not include the universal social charge, which is a further attack on income. <\/p> <p> People earning &euro;40,000 in 2009 lost up to &euro;27,400 by 2015.  Their annual income was reduced from &euro;40,000 to &euro;35,000.  Having had &euro;27,400 gouged from them over those years, they will get &euro;4,000 back by 2018.  People earning &euro;50,000 had &euro;38,000 gouged from them up until this year and will only get &euro;4,000 back by 2018 when the programme is completed, which is a tiny fraction of what was gouged from them.  The overwhelming majority of the extra hours agreed, the flexitime that was taken away, the new sick leave scheme and so on have made it more difficult for families, along with all the other conditions which have been attacked and will not be unwound at all.<\/p> <p> Let us sum it up in very simple terms.  At the end of the period covered by this Bill, which is supposed to be about pay restoration, low-paid public servants will still be earning less than they did in 2009 when the assault took place.  What sort of pay restoration is that?  In 2018 low-paid civil servants will be earning less than they did in 2009.  It is an absolute shocker.<\/p> <p> For the Government and the troika, this Bill was always about what Naomi Klein called the shock doctrine, that is, never to waste the opportunity of a crisis by assaulting the share that goes to wages and workers and boosting the share that goes to profits.  I do not have time to go through the details, but a fantastic paper produced by economist Paul Sweeney demonstrates this point.  I do not know if the Minister of State can see the graph but it shows the collapse in wage share across Europe since the 1970s.  Ireland is the worst in Europe.  In 1970, wage share was 67% as a proportion of GDP in this country; it is now 50%.  The European average wage share is currently 58%.  We are way below the average share that goes to wages.  Profits during that period have rocketed, in a direct transfer from the working people to the rich.  That is what the Government has done, and it has used the opportunity of the economic crisis to accelerate it.<\/p> <p> Why do we need this emergency Bill and to unwind it in phases?  There is no emergency any more, as the Government tells us.  Everything is getting better.  There is an emergency in housing but the Government will not declare that to be so.  However, it wants to retain emergency legislation to make sure workers do not get back what the Government stole and gouged from them over recent years.  Why does the Government not focus on the real emergencies and give workers back what it stole from them?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102100043#QQ00300","speaker":"1003","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1445440500,"counter":809,"content":"<p>It obviously goes without saying that some restoration of public service pay is undoubtedly better than none.  I would imagine that public sector workers have experienced a certain degree of relief that after five years of the Government being in office, during which time it has consistently pilfered large sums of money from their pockets, this year it has thrown a partial amount of that back.  The reality is that what we should be discussing is the abolition of the FEMPI Acts.  They should no longer be in place.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill may partially restore some elements of pay in the public sector, but the number of hours public servants will have to work with still be longer and they will have fewer holidays and far fewer conditions than they had before we bailed out the banks.  That is the reality of the Bill.  In fact, the small pay increases in the Bill negotiated as part of the Lansdowne Road agreement are even smaller than the headline rates flagged by the Government.<\/p>  <p>  The TUI - fair play to it - has been incredibly vocal about the Bill and the agreement.  It has labelled them as unfair and heavy-handed, and I agree.  They give the Government the power to withhold about &euro;1,600 for supervision and substitution duties by teachers due to be paid in two tranches, starting in September next year, and the power to refuse to pay incremental pay rises for members of unions which are seen to have repudiated the Lansdowne Road agreement.<\/p>  <p>  This gun to the head, mob movie-type union busting extremism gives the lie to the Government's propaganda that it is confident that the people believe the lies it is peddling about a recovery and its brilliant economic stewardship.  If it were so confident, why would it need to have such vicious tactics in the Bill?  It is because it has lost the hearts and minds of public sector workers and knows the only way it can get an agreement is by viciously attempting to ram it through.  The TUI correctly pointed out that the pay increases from 2016 will have little if any impact on part-time workers, the most vulnerable sector of in the public sector as it is.  I am so annoyed about this Bill I am almost struck dumb.<\/p>  <p>  We are talking about FEMPI remaining in place until 2016.  In other words, the Government is retaining the right to cut public service pay unilaterally for at least another three years.  That in effect is what it is saying.  It makes a mockery of the recovery and the ending of the emergency.  It exposes its propaganda.  The real agenda is precisely as Deputy Boyd Barrett pointed out, namely, why waste a good crisis.<\/p>  <p>  What this is about is a race the bottom dressed up as reform.  For neoliberalism that means an all-out assault on the terms and conditions and pay of workers which were fought for by the trade union movement over decades.  It has resulted in longer hours, shorter holidays and poorer working conditions, to name but a few.  Precarious and casual labour is now part and parcel of the public service.  There are now JobBridge jobs in the public service.  It is a disgrace and stands on its head what was once something which was not an unreasonable expectation for citizens, namely, that we might aspire to the idea of a secure, permanent, pensionable job that would allow us to put a roof over our heads for our families, give us access to health care when we were sick, access to education for children to achieve their full potential and so on.  All these things have been under attack.<\/p>  <p>  I do not have time to discuss all the points, but the casualisation of labour, which once it sets its stall in the public sector is repeated in the private sector, is being further entrenched as part of this Bill.  The TUI stated that one third of its members at second level and up to half of those aged under 35 years are in temporary or part-time employment.  How in God's name can they buy or rent a house in our economy given those conditions?<\/p>  <p>  Many university lecturers, the people one might think are the elite of academia, are on hourly contracts with very limited hours.  Some 66% of university staff are now casual workers.  We know about the figures on the overall shrinking of the public sector and the massive reduction in numbers.  The consequences of that can be seen in front-line services such as the closure of Garda stations, the people on hospital trolleys and the largest class sizes in the eurozone even after so-called reform in that area.  Members of the Defence Forces are surviving on subsistence, supplementary payments from family income supplement and so on.<\/p>  <p>  It should be pointed out that there are two categories of workers.<\/p><p>The first of these consists of women.  The public sector was one area where women held their own, and there was more of a chance of getting equal pay in the public sector than in the private sector.  Not only this, it was an environment which marketed itself on the idea of being family-friendly and encouraging women in this regard.  Women in the public sector earned 5% more than their private-sector counterparts, and at the lower end of the scale, in the most vulnerable sectors, public sector wages for women were 15% higher.  This is an attack because what happens in the public sector is followed by the private sector.  We know many of the family-friendly working arrangements have been stood on their head in the name of austerity, and none of these things will be protected after the passage of the Bill.  In this sense I see it as a specific attack on women workers because of their prevalence in the public sector.<\/p> <p> The second group of workers being particularly targeted and not having their needs addressed is pensioners.  It is great that there is some restoration of public sector State pensions.  This is brilliant, given the butchery the Government carried out on the livelihoods of pensioners.  However, it is doing nothing in the legislation to deal with occupational pension schemes such as the Irish airlines superannuation scheme, IASS.  IASS pensioners will find themselves in exactly the same position after the Bill is passed as they did before, despite the fact that these workers spent most decades of their working lives building up pensionable service in a State-owned company.  It is a pretty big kick in the teeth, to be honest.<\/p> <p> By next week, when the cuts from their pockets are taken for October, &euro;5 million will have been robbed from the people on a pension in this scheme, who are in their 70s, 80s and 90s, to pay off a section 50 debt they did not even know they had.  This section 50 debt was unilaterally passed over to Aer Lingus and DAA pensioners, who had it deducted at source from their monthly income without their agreement, without consultation, without compensation and without being party to any debt resolution process.  It is a debt they did not even know they had.  Absolutely no compensation or relief has been provided to these workers, who worked in State employment all their lives.  There has been no recognition either for deferred pensioners, whose long service leaves them less well off.  A cut in retirement pension of up to 58% for long-service deferred pensioners with decades of work behind them, 42 years in one instance, is absolutely and utterly disgraceful.  The Government had an opportunity to use some of the money from the sale of Aer Lingus to address the shortfall.  It has another opportunity with this legislation.  Given that the Bill allows for variation of the amount payable or rate of payment out of money provided by the Oireachtas, the Central Fund or the growing produce of that fund to certain persons for certain services to or on behalf of the State, and the Central Fund being one into which the IASS pensioners have paid &euro;35 million to date via the stamp duty pension levy, could this not be diverted to restore some of the savage cutbacks in their living standards which were imposed on them in the same name of austerity?  The Government has not done nearly enough for public sector workers, but it has absolutely ignored pensioners who gave their full working lives in this regard.  The Government is due to face court cases which will ensure it will have to foot the bill by trampling on the rights of these people and taking their pensionable retirement from them.  The Bill is not even too little, too late.  We should be discussing the abolition of this repressive emergency legislation, and the Government should not be attempting to pat itself on the back because it has thrown back a few crumbs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102100044#RR00200","speaker":"1192","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1445441100,"counter":811,"content":"<p>The Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act was misnamed, because the financial emergency measures were not in the public interest but in the bondholders' interest.  With undue haste, the legislation was rammed through the D&aacute;il in 2013 in a particular effort to pressure and blackmail public sector workers who were gearing up to resist the attacks from the Government.  It was also in the interest of Fine Gael, the Labour Party and the billionaire-owned media to try to pretend that public servants were somehow responsible for the recession and for the economic collapse.  If one had to choose a single group that paid extremely dearly in the recession, it would have to be public sector workers, who had imposed on them pay cuts, a so-called pension levy, which was punishing, longer hours and more work.<\/p>  <p>  What we see in the Bill is not pay restoration; it is partial and it is phased.  It was disgraceful, particularly if we consider the presence of the Labour Party in the Government, that the FEMPI legislation was rushed through the D&aacute;il.  It gave the public sector employer more powers than even private bosses have in this country to cut pay and pensions and change working conditions unilaterally without any reference to or agreement from the workers involved.  It is absolutely disgraceful legislation that should have been met with a general strike, but unfortunately we have a trade union leadership that is in collaboration with sections of the Government and that accepted the idea that there was no alternative to austerity or to the market or capitalism itself, and have capitulated completely to this idea.  Of course, many of them have very close connections with the leadership of the Labour Party.  No resistance was put up by the trade union leadership to the legislation at the time.<\/p>  <p>  Why is FEMPI not being removed?  If we are in recovery, why are the punitive measures taken against public sector workers being left in place?  The point has been made that the cost of living has increased dramatically, particularly the cost of renting.  In Dublin, rents have increased by approximately &euro;150 per month over the past two years, and a survey shows that rents in my constituency increased by &euro;241 per month.  However, public sector workers and all workers have had their incomes dramatically cut despite the fact that rents have returned to 2007 levels in cities.  If the restoration continued at the pace of this Bill, it would take six to nine years for public sector workers to regain what they lost at the time of the recession.  There is a recovery all right for the rich; the top 300 have seen their wealth increase by &euro;34 billion while the rest of us have been going through these swingeing cuts.<\/p>  <p>  We have continued tax evasion by corporations.  The Government has decided to create another lucrative loophole with the knowledge development box, and it is taking a case to prevent Apple, the biggest corporation on the planet, from paying tax back to this country, which is incredible.  This level of tax evasion dwarfs the pay restoration taking place in the Bill.  The conditions imposed on workers are being left in place, including the longer hours and many other conditions that the Government forced workers to undertake, including a lack of resources.  The FEMPI legislation has done the damage and the resources are not being restored.<\/p>  <p>  We will continue to see a two-tiered public service, whereby new teachers and nurses will earn 14% less than those in existing jobs.  This is completely disgraceful.  What a legacy to hand young people who have studied and worked hard to attain the qualifications.  Will this be restored or will it be left in place?  We have also seen casualisation and part-time work throughout the public service.  In my sector, approximately one quarter to one third of teachers do not have full-time or permanent jobs.  Many of them work in Aldi and Lidl and do babysitting and other part-time jobs at the weekend to supplement their incomes.  This will do nothing for them.  They will still be left doing this.  I totally welcome and understand the rejection by teachers of this.  Essentially, they see it for what it is because they know the reality. They are still expected to give extra productivity, drive-by inspections are taking place and there are the new curriculums and syllabi.<\/p><p>There are larger classes and special needs assistants and resource hours have been lost.  Large amounts of money have been taken out of schools, etc.  There is a similar story with nurses and other public servants, who have all seen their workloads increase dramatically.<\/p> <p> It is no surprise that nurses and train drivers are balloting and discussing industrial action for the next few weeks as they have been listening to the guff from the Government about a recovery and correctly stating that if there is a recovery, they should have a piece of it; 63% of people have said they do not feel any recovery, although they may see or hear about it.  The Labour Party, in particular, is trying to save the public sector worker vote that it got in 2011, when many public servants looked to the party to protect them from the Tories of Fine Gael.  Instead, Labour put people into the Department that would implement the cuts, including the Minister, Deputy Brendan Howlin, which was incredible.  In many other Departments, Labour was swinging the axe against workers, having bought their votes on the basis that the workers would be protected.<\/p> <p> This Bill will not in any way save the Labour Party and the budget will not do so either.  Public sector workers have long memories because for the past seven or eight years, they have been apportioned the blame.  They were the victims, in many cases, of a very divisive media campaign, which they had to listen to on a daily basis as they got up to do their jobs.  The insinuation was they were somehow to blame for the recession, when it was the bondholders who were repaid, the speculators and the private sector which largely caused the problem.  I wonder why the Minister of State expects public servants to be happy that some of their pay is being restored but the Government is leaving in all the savage conditions it imposed, using the recession and crisis to dramatically drive down the conditions and numbers in the work force.  The numbers in the public service were dramatically reduced, leaving much strain on those who worked in hospitals and key services in the country.<\/p> <p> It is time to stop the war on public sector workers.  The pension levy should be completely removed, as it and the universal social charge was meant to be a temporary measure.  It should be taken out and all public servants should be restored to the same rates of pay.  We should not have a two-tier position, which is extremely insulting for everybody working with a similar qualification.  Young people are being expected to work for less but they will not and should not put up with that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102100045#SS00200","speaker":"1195","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1445441700,"counter":813,"content":"<p>I firmly believe that when the history of this and the last decade comes to be written by social and economic historians, perhaps with postgraduate students applying their minds to it, the fascinating element to which they will commit most writing and thinking is how we maintained social cohesion throughout this period and how society kept its solidarity.

That was illustrated in the number of agreements made with the trade union movement in this period, culminating in the Lansdowne Road agreement.  The public servants who exercised such restraint and the workers who maintained social solidarity in our country are true patriots who should be celebrated in this country.  All of these people should be remembered and held up as heroes for what they did.  As we rebuild a proper and normal society in reconstructing the country, it is important that they feel the benefits and get recognition for the sacrifices they made.<\/p><p>The Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Bill 2015 is an attempt to start that process, effectively implementing the terms of the Lansdowne Road agreement, which was a very patriotic, selfless agreement on the part of the public service workers who were inspired by a Government that knew what it was about.  The legislation involves partial and phased restoration of cuts to public servant salaries and pensions put in place between 2009 and 2013.  As I stated, the legislation arises from the Lansdowne Road agreement, which recognised the contribution of public servants and gave expression to their contribution to the recovery.  It was accepted by the majority of unions.  Part 2 of the Bill proposes the partial and phased restoration of public servants' remuneration.  It is well laid out but I will make reference to the text because there were attempts to misconstrue how this will operate.<\/p><p>A salary of up to &euro;24,000 will see an increase of 2.5%, with effect from 1 January 2016, or immediately, one could say.  A salary of between &euro;24,000 and &euro;31,000 will see an increase of 1% on 1 January 2016, with a salary of up to &euro;65,000 seeing an increase of &euro;1,000 on 1 September 2017.  One can see the logic and fairness in an incremental process, despite the earlier attempts by Opposition speakers to distort the message.  They would love to create the erroneous impression that in some way there is an unfairness in the process; there is an absence of unfairness but there is patriotism, fairness and a democratic buy-in by everybody.  People with annual remuneration of between &euro;65,000 and &euro;110,000 will see a 50% restoration of the 2013 reduction on 1 April 2017.  It goes on in a similar vein.  I read this into the record so people will accept it.  It is terrible and sad that in the absence of positive proposals, people have attempted to distort the message.<\/p><p>Section 3 of the Bill deals with increasing salaries as I outlined.  During the fiscal consolidation and the restoration of public finances, the amount deducted for pensions from salaries increased and the amount paid in pensions decreased.  This is being rectified.  The exemption threshold for pension-related deductions in 2015 will increase from &euro;15,000 to &euro;17,500.  This is at the bottom end of the scale.  From 1 January 2016, the exemption threshold for the pension-related deduction will increase to &euro;26,083 and so on.  The point is the process is designed to favour those in the more difficult position.  The Bill seeks to restore the <i>status quo<\/i>of pay and pensions.<\/p><p>The Bill is effectively restoring the fortunes of our public servants, who so patriotically took those cuts.  The effect of our public servants taking those cuts was to restore public finances to order.<\/p><p>That might sound abstract.  To a person with their back against the wall, living in quite difficult circumstances, talk about restoring public finances is very abstract.  In fact, it makes us competitive, so that we can bring in jobs.  It reduces costs in the country and it attracts inward investment.  In fact, it gives jobs to our children and brings home our emigrants.  That is what this Government is about.  It is not abstract economics; it is about getting jobless people work.  Every time somebody gets work, &euro;20,000 goes back to the Exchequer.  However, there is far more at stake.  There is the dignity of the person, their full participation in society and all that goes with it.<br\/><br\/>I am extraordinarily proud that as a result of all the sacrifices by our people, some of which have been so satisfactorily and fairly redressed and restored in this legislation, we are now creating 1,300 new jobs a week.  Great credit must go to the Government and, in particular, to the Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton, for the extraordinary achievement that we are now creating 1,300 jobs a week and that we have created 125,000 jobs since the beginning of the Action Plan for Jobs.  It is a phenomenal achievement against a backdrop of the sickening spectacle of lengthening dole queues and emigration.  That is the backdrop and that is what has been reversed.  I am so proud of that; this is what politics is about.  We are all in politics because we want our people to have the dignity of work; to have quality of life; to raise families, if they wish, in good circumstances; and to live in dignity.<br\/><br\/>Some emigrants left by choice and with a particular ambition to travel, and that is fair game, but many, tragically, left because they were forced out of this country and we want those economic migrants to have the option to come home.  Thankfully, the statistics would suggest that they are coming home and that the trend is now reversing itself.  Thank God we are seeing the day, and what a wonderful day it is, that somebody who was unhappily exiled in Melbourne, Sydney, New York, London, or wherever, will now be back in their own parish for Christmas.  Many people who come home this Christmas to their families will not be returning abroad.  We can be collectively proud of that.  That is the backdrop and that is what has been achieved by the public servants and by our people.  That is what is being restored and sorted out in this legislation.<br\/><br\/>It is horrific to hear the harping on from Opposition spokespeople earlier, erroneously suggesting an unfairness.  What is unfair about putting 50 cent on the minimum wage, as per the recommended rate?  What is unfair about a &euro;5 increase in the family income supplement?  What is unfair about a phased, graduated and lower income-oriented reduction in the universal social charge?  What is unfair about a 75% restoration of the Christmas bonus?  What is unfair about giving children preschool education until they go into primary school?  What is unfair about a &euro;5 increase in child benefit, which is the most socially equalising and fairest way of distributing income, as is supported by all empirical findings?  What is unfair about all of that?  What is fair about it is that it creates more jobs, because the budget measures that have been taken stimulate the domestic economy.<br\/><br\/>Lower paid people who have been affected and social welfare recipients, the people who get the Christmas bonuses, spend that money immediately on domestic products.  They spend that money on products locally.  A multiplier effect takes hold in the local economy.  They go into the shops to buy gifts for their grandchildren or to buy food, the necessary things, in the local shops.  They buy goods; they do not spend it on exotic imported materials.  It goes into the economy the next morning or the next hour.  It goes into the economy the minute they get it.  It has a multiplier effect.  More money is generated, more jobs are created, more savings are effected in the social protection budget, and there are more implications for the good of our society.  More socially reforming measures can be taken in the subsequent budget as less is paid out in jobseeker's allowance.  Those are the implications of this budget.  That is the strategy on which it is predicated.  That is the whole thinking behind the budget.<br\/><br\/>In the words of one columnist and commentator, the criticism of the budget is a selfish kind of a proposition.  There are people saying that the economy has reached a point where it is all right and it needs no further stimulus.  They say we should let well enough alone and make no further investment in it, that we should selfishly keep the <i>status quo<\/i>for those of us who have jobs, who have a stake in society and have ownership of something.  That selfish view, sadly, permeates fairly well and it is contributed to by some significant commentators in our country who should know better.  The truth is that while we have made mammoth, massive, unprecedented, unexpected and unheralded successes in bringing jobs to our people, while we have created thousands of jobs - 125,000 - while our emigrants are starting to come home, and while all that is true, tragically, over 9% of our people remain unemployed.  While that tragic reality remains, we need to continue to stimulate our economy.  It is wrong and terribly selfish of people to say: &quot;Let's sit on the eggs now.  Let's forget about the unemployed.&quot;  We cannot forget about the unemployed.<br\/><br\/>The Minister, Deputy Noonan, constructed an outstanding, socially progressive budget - the public is very well aware of that and the reaction substantiates it - which will stimulate the domestic economy further, create jobs in retail, create jobs in services, and create jobs for our returning emigrants.  As well as the various measures he took in regard to taxation for our farmers, a wonderful measure in this budget, and one I am particularly proud of, relates to hauliers.  We do not have railways in the part of the country that I and the Minister of State, Deputy McHugh, represent.  The part of Ireland that we represent and that the Acting Chairman represents is not well served in transport terms and the small local haulier is central to the domestic and local economy there.  The local haulier is needed to transport goods from A to B.  It is the lifeblood of society there and now, as a consequence of this budget, a haulier with ten lorries - a very small haulier, as most of them have in excess of that - will have an effective saving of &euro;40,000 a year in road tax.  The maximum tax per vehicle will be &euro;900 when it was in excess of &euro;5,000.  This is the social and economic engineering in this budget to get our people back to work.  That haulier is not going to put that in the Cayman Islands or buy a yacht with it.  He is going to buy another lorry or employ another worker.  It will reduce costs for local businesses and the effect of that provision in the budget, which will be implemented by the Finance Act, will be more jobs in the haulage sector and in every sector, as the cost of moving goods around reduces.  It is a wonderful idea and well done to the Minister and the Government.  I am so proud to stand here as a Government Deputy and to reference that achievement and its implications.<br\/><br\/>Just as that will mean job creation, so too will the taxation measures for farmers.  There are many important and implicit changes here.  For example, it will now become financially attractive for a farmer to form a partnership with his son or his favourite nephew or niece - thank God we have reached that point - or with his favourite relative, to hand over the farm.<\/p><p>We have a wrong age structure in agriculture in Ireland.  We have too old a sector still farming, in many instances, out of economic necessity.  This will make it a financially attractive option to hand over the farm and that will stimulate production and on-farm and off-farm employment.  That is another job-creating measure of the budget and it tallies nicely with this Bill, which is giving back and is the reconstruction of a normal society.<\/p> <p> The Bill gives back in a graduated way the income that public servants lost.  It is only right.  It is their own income returned.  They made the big patriotic selfless step and they will be rewarded for it, or rather given back what is just.  Those public servants, because of what they did, will have now have two years' preschool for their children up to the age of five.  Those public servants may have youngsters working in initial employment where the minimum wage is all they can get, and that minimum wage will increase.  Public servants at the lower end of the public service in terms of salary may be recipients of the family income supplement and they will get a &euro;5 increase.  Public servants who have children will get a &euro;5 increase in child benefit.  In essence, the leap of faith that those public servants made in the Haddington Road agreement, in the Lansdowne Road agreement and in previous agreements was justified and they are now being rewarded for it.  That income is going back into their pocket.  Their society has been reconstructed and they are now the beneficiaries of their own act of patriotism, their investment in their future and their investment in their children's future.<\/p> <p> The alternative was to allow the country to go into the abyss and down a serious road.  As a result of the public servants who wrote the Haddington Road and Lansdowne Road agreements, because of the various social welfare recipients who exercised restraint and because of the general patriotism, selflessness and democratic-rootedness of our people, we will not have the kind of sad and tragic circumstances that apply in other countries.  In Ireland, there will not be a Syriza that will lead the people to the top of the mountain and back down again.  That is the kind of situation we avoided here.<\/p> <p> This legislation is fair and equitable.  It targets the lower paid initially.  It is graduated and it restores the income of our public servants.  It restores the previous rate of deduction of pension and, ultimately, it brings up pension rates.  It also brings back collective bargaining and within the legislation is the potential for increased incomes as society normalises.  It is a good day's work and we should be happy to ungrudgingly and unanimously adopt it in this House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102100046#TT00400","speaker":"971","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1445442900,"counter":818,"content":"<p>Deputy Joe O'Reilly is somebody for whom I have great respect.  He was one of the first Deputies who extended a hand of friendship to me and he has continued to do so since 2011.  I do not want to single out Deputy O'Reilly's speech, but a significant emphasis has been placed here today on fairness.  I do not hear about fairness, however, for the cancer patient who is receiving chemotherapy in an accident and emergency unit in a public area.  I do not hear about fairness for the 2,000 families who turned up for food parcels at the Capuchin centre this morning.  I do not hear about fairness for the 1,500 children who regard their hotel rooms as their home and are ashamed to say at school that their address is a hotel.  I do not hear about fairness for the 431 patients who languish as we speak in accident and emergency units and on trolleys.  I do not hear about those with profound disability who were waiting to see the adaption and mobility grant restored in the budget, and it simply did not happen.<\/p>  <p>  I am aware of emigrants who want to return to Ireland but refuse to do so because of the chaotic existing public services, particularly the health service.  I write to the Minister on a weekly basis about an 18 month old baby who is the daughter of Irish citizens working in Melbourne who are highly qualified, technically superior and required in this economy.  They want to return home but cannot do so because the HSE system will not provide support to keep their daughter on necessary drugs.  We can cherry-pick about the type of recovery we are having.<\/p>  <p>  Before the last election Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn boasted that only the Labour Party could be trusted with the public service because he claimed that it was the only party that would protect the public service's interests in government.  With the benefit of hindsight, we now know that Deputy Quinn's utterances on this matter should be placed alongside his commitment with respect to the introduction of the registration charge that was committed to publicly in Trinity.  I suppose all we have to do is look at all the other claims that were made in a so-called Tesco advertisement.  When we look at the 40 cuts that took place under the stewardship of the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, only two of them have been restored, yet there is a perception, as we heard today from Government backbenchers, that this is a fair budget.  Let us look at the fairness.<\/p>  <p>  Under this Bill, newly recruited public servants are being left at a disadvantage relative to staff who were hired before 2011.  The ladder has been firmly pulled up on a generation of young people in this country.  An essential feature of a republic is that there should be equality before the law.  Unjust differentials should not remain, and there is little sign of any future intent to remove them, particularly in the context of improving economic outlooks.<\/p>  <p>  From time to time, Fine Gael, when not suffering from the strange cultural cringe that lurks in its subconscious, likes to remember that it passed the Republic of Ireland Act 1948.  That might be so, but they have little idea of what a republic looks like because it does not mean that a country attacks its young people, it does not mean that the State tolerates tens of thousands of citizens being caught up in a housing or homeless crisis, and it does not mean that a country continues to fail to secure the rights of persons with a disability in the participation of the broader society.<\/p>  <p>  All of this is part of a pattern that was initiated by the Minister, Deputy Joan Burton, who specifically targeted young people for special treatment.  Their welfare payments were slashed, from &euro;188 per week to &euro;100 per week.  It was as if the Minister thought that young people require less money to feed themselves, clothe themselves and pay the rent.  It was a bizarre decision that young people who were homeless could survive on &euro;100 a week.<\/p>  <p>  During the recent referendum on marriage, many of the Deputies on the Fine Gael and Labour benches preened themselves under the banner, \"Yes to Equality\", but what they meant was, \"Equality for some\".  As ever, they will grant equality where there is no cost involved but once any form of economic inequality is challenged, something that actually costs the Exchequer, the Government runs away.  I regard this type of equality or argument around it as hypocrisy.  Frankly, it is nauseating.  Nobody would expect anything better from the Fine Gael Party - in fairness, at least it is honest about its position - but the Labour Party has promoted itself on the basis of social democracy values.  Alas, all of that was too easily compromised in Labour's wish to be part of a right-wing Government.  As ever, the consequences of that inequality are many and its effects run beyond the individuals directly impacted by those odious and horrific decisions.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of inequality, there are now longer waiting times for public services, changes to duration of employment, slashes to pensions and yellow-pack nurses.  In the past three years graduate nurses and midwives have had a starting salary that was slashed from &euro;28,000 to &euro;20,000.  I do not hear too many of the backbenchers looking at the fairness of that.  The Ministers, Deputies Brendan Howlin and James Reilly, were accused by graduate nurses at the time of instigating the disparagement of the nursing profession and seeking to create yellow-pack nursing.  The Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar, has done nothing to challenge that view.  The attack on nursing is suggestive of an attitude of a mind that disparages professions dominated by women.<\/p><p><i>6 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p> Would any of the three Ministers involved have countenanced such an attack on a male-dominated profession?  The undermining of the pay and working conditions of nurses and the effects beyond young graduate nurses has driven thousands of these young graduates to foreign employers.  With so many young nurses leaving our shores, the health service is struggling to fill vacant posts.  Taken alongside the continuing obstinate refusal to lift the moratorium on public service recruitment, it has led to a continuing degradation of the quality of outcome of our services for the most vulnerable people.<\/p> <p> We have diminished our expectations of public services.  It is now okay to deliver chemotherapy to an immuno-compromised patient in a public accident and emergency unit and nobody lifts an eyebrow.  Nobody is concerned about the delivery of a social wage.  When we discuss fairness, let us remember fairness for the 1,500 children whose address is a hotel somewhere in Dublin and the 431 vulnerable people who are lying on trolleys as we speak.  When I returned home last week, I met a senior citizen who said he did not want &euro;3 extra in his pension but wanted to know whether his wife would get the orthopaedic appointment for which she had been waiting three years.  I want to know if there will be a restoration of the millions of home help hours that were cut.  This is the type of fairness and social wage I want.<\/p> <p> Taken alongside the continuing refusal to recognise the situation in the economy, particularly for younger employees such as nurses, agency staff are being used to fill the gaps.  This practice has been identified as more expensive than hiring staff and contrary to the welfare of the patient consistently having somebody who understands the location and specialty.  Why would the Government continue to adopt a strategy of hiring agency staff at a greater cost to the Exchequer?  It does so because it does not want to have a permanent relationship with people.  The constant churning of personnel undermines the consistency of care, love and attention delivered by front-line staff in the public health service.<\/p> <p> Education has also suffered from the moratorium on recruitment and an increase in the pupil-teacher ratio.  The Government seems to take the view that education is solely an instrument for preparing children to be workers.  The broader view of education that includes character development, social and emotional well-being and the formation of what it means to be a citizen has been completely abandoned in our education system.  Nowhere is that more evident than in the decision to remove guidance counsellors.  Some 500 citizens die by suicide every year and we cut &euro;60 million from a &euro;700 million budget for mental health last year.  Then we attacked children by taking away their guidance counsellors.  If we are to repair the damage done to our society by the economic crisis, which has been magnified by the Government&rsquo;s choices, concentrated and committed action is required to rebuild a broken society and it must begin with public services.  Public services, alongside social protection payments, form the main part of the social wage which we discuss within the community as a key element in challenging economic inequality.<\/p> <p> The debate on the future of public services, the division that underpins them and the ambition we have for their role in society should be the centre of this discussion in the context of a forthcoming general election.  However, we continue to narrow the debate to the economy, taxation and growth.  Last Sunday, a tweet from Fine Gael headquarters stated that if Ireland's economy were a rugby team, it would be accelerating fast in terms of growth of 6.5% to 9% growth.  The significant majority of people I speak to want core issues, such as supports for children, to be addressed.  Some 20,000 children have been waiting more than two years for speech and language therapy, audiology services and occupational therapy.  This is a core part of what we talk about in terms of protecting the most vulnerable people.<\/p> <p> While there are aspects of the Bill that I welcome, there is a significant volume missing from it.  There is little evidence in the Bill of any conviction apart from a self-serving objective of ticking a box coming into the forthcoming general election.  In many of my early speeches to the House, I cautioned that we should not buy an economic recovery at the cost of damaging the social fabric, and I very much fear that this is what has happened.  While I appreciate that it would be the ethos of one political party in government, the absent party has let it happen.  The continued attack on public services and the contraction of public services has gone some way to subsidising what is considered to be an election budget.  The challenge for the next D&aacute;il should not be primarily around a language of taxation and the economy.  We do not live in an economy; we are citizens of a society.  There must be a discussion about the fabric of our social structures.<\/p> <p> Let us have a substantive debate about the reality of people&rsquo;s circumstances, such as the 140,000 people on waiting lists for public housing, the hundreds of thousands of people in chronic pain awaiting an appointment in the public health system, the millions of hours that have been cut from home help services, the most vulnerable people in society, and the homeless people sleeping in turf sheds, even in my constituency.  We need to start talking about delivering the social wage.  We live in a society, not an economy.  We can have the debate side by side.  The Government is intent on driving society and the equality and fairness it delivers further down the agenda.  During the past four to five years, it has diminished public expectation about entitlements, rights and equality in public services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102100048#VV00200","speaker":"1188","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1445443500,"counter":820,"content":"<p>I welcome the legislation, as did most of the previous speakers.  The FEMPI Acts were introduced during a time of economic crisis to try to deal with some of the crises as they emerged.  It is right and fitting that this Bill, the first piece of rowing back on some of those harsh adjustments, would take place now.  There have been five or six FEMPI Acts during the emergency period.  As a result of the public service pay talks which concluded earlier this year, a series of proposals were put forward which led to the Lansdowne Road agreement, which is the main reason we are discussing the Bill.  I welcome the pay restoration proposals for reducing the pension levy on former public servants, which was an especially draconian measure.  Some people who had been retired for many years and had an expectation of an income into the future were severely adversely affected.  This was the situation in which the country found itself.<\/p>  <p>  I was alarmed by the comments of the previous speaker, Deputy Keaveney, who has left.  He said the primary debate in the next D&aacute;il should not be on the economy and taxation.  Fianna F&aacute;il has learned nothing if it believes the primary debate in the next D&aacute;il should not be about the economy and taxation.  The economy should always be part of the primary discussion that takes place here and everywhere else.  The improvement in public services about which he spoke is contingent on having an economy that works and not one that has been driven over the cliff, as it was by his new party.<\/p><p> I have not spoken previously about his position, but I find it interesting that he seems to come in here whenever he contributes to a debate to lash the Labour Party.  I am no particular lover of the Labour Party, but it took an extraordinary neck for the Deputy in question to spend 15 minutes speaking in the Chamber in condemnation of the FEMPI legislation given that virtually all of it was introduced by the party to which he now belongs.  It took an extreme degree of ignorance for him to have a go at the reduction in the pupil-teacher ratio.  Obviously, he does not know the difference between a reduction and an increase in the ratio.  The pupil-teacher ratio was increased some years ago by his friends in Fianna F&aacute;il, but it was reduced in the recent budget.  Perhaps Deputy Keaveney could go back to school to learn that this was a positive move.  Rather incongruously, the Deputy had the cheek to speak about the public service recruitment moratorium.  He might have missed the life of the last Oireachtas - maybe he was having debates about things other than taxation and the economy at the time - so I will remind him that the moratorium was introduced by his colleagues in the party of which he is now a member.  Who knows for how long he will be a member of that party?  He is entitled to join whatever party will have him.  They are welcome to him, particularly in light of his contribution this evening and on previous occasions.<\/p> <p> My primary reason for speaking on this legislation was not to get annoyed with Deputy Keaveney; it was to welcome the fact that the Government is in a position to start rectifying some of the draconian measures that were necessary in recent years.  The measures in question imposed a great deal of hardship on serving and retired public servants and people who might have found themselves in public service positions if the economy had not gone off the cliff.  Of course Deputy Keaveney does not want to talk about the economy.  Obviously, I am a public servant.  In a previous life, I was a maths teacher.  A great deal of younger teachers, in particular, find themselves in temporary and part-time positions.  I refer to people who are younger than me.  I am getting old.  I am positively middle-aged at this stage.<\/p> <p> Many younger teachers, like their colleagues in other walks of life, are not in the country any more precisely because Fianna F&aacute;il and its friends decided not to talk about the economy during the Celtic tiger period.  They did not reflect on the fact that the economy was built on sand.  I suppose I agree with Deputy Keaveney in one respect, which is that debates on public services should be held in conjunction with debates on the economy.  It seems to me, in light of what has happened in this country over the past decade, that the suggestion by a Member of this House that we should not be having debates on the economy and on taxation is living proof that the party to which the Member in question now belongs has not learned one thing from the hardship it has caused for public servants and private sector workers here and for thousands of people who live in all parts of the world as a result of the mess that party made of our economy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102100049#WW00200","speaker":"966","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1445444100,"counter":822,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to take part in this evening's debate.  When this Government took office in 2011, this country was in dire straits.  The previous Government, which was led by Fianna F&aacute;il, had run the country into the ground to such a degree that we had to rely on bailouts to pay our bills, including the public sector wages of nurses, teachers and garda&iacute;.  It should not be forgotten that this was just four and a half years ago.  Fine Gael in government had to take many difficult and unpopular decisions to restore the public finances and rid the country of the troika.  For example, the public sector suffered average pay cuts of 14% and was reduced by 10% at a time of growing demand for public services.  As the economy is now growing as a result of Government policies and the sacrifices of the people, it is right that we should provide for a sustainable system of pay recovery for public servants that is linked to continuing reforms that help to make the public sector more efficient and effective.  I am particularly pleased that the new deal will target lower-income and middle-income public servants.<\/p>  <p>  Although austerity is now over, we must be mindful of how we got into this financial mess in the first place.  We can never go back to the Fianna F&aacute;il approach of making unsustainable and populist pay awards.  These awards, which were not linked to productivity and competitiveness, had to be reversed at great cost to the taxpayer.  The approach pursued by Fianna F&aacute;il in the past to buy votes is now being pursued by Sinn F&eacute;in to buy votes in the future.  Budget 2016 benefits public and private sector workers.  It provides for a marginal rate of tax of less than 50% for anyone earning under &euro;70,000.  These tax cuts will help to sustain affordable pay growth and secure economic recovery.  The sensible budget that has been announced for next year is designed to keep the recovery going, to reduce the deficit to 2.1% of GDP in 2015 and to 1.2% of GDP in 2016 and to eliminate all Government borrowing by 2018.  Tax revenues will increase by 15%, whereas spending will increase by just 4%.  I acknowledge that the Government is continuing to borrow money, but I suggest that this borrowing is manageable because it is at historically low interest rates.  If this Government is re-elected, it will be able to avail of the situation it has created to implement moderate expansionary budgets every year until 2020.  I suggest this should be compared to the situation we faced when we took office in 2011.  Does anyone really want to go back to this?  A vote for Sinn F&eacute;in or Fianna F&aacute;il will make this nightmare a reality.<\/p>  <p>  Our &euro;27 billion capital investment plan is affordable and responsible.  In my own constituency of Louth, we are seeing the benefits of the growing economy and the increased investment in services.  In Dundalk, the Marist secondary school is being completely rebuilt, St. Joseph's national school is getting a major new extension and Col&aacute;iste R&iacute;s has recently opened a new extension.  Elsewhere, the new extension to the CBS primary school, the new Educate Together primary school in Ardee and the new extension at Scoil U&iacute; Mhuir&iacute; in Dunleer are all projects that have benefited from the capital programme being implemented by the Government.  We are making real progress in job creation in the region.  Unemployment in the north east has fallen by almost 30%, as evidenced by the many new jobs announced over the recent past, including hundreds of jobs in the likes of PayPal, eBay, National Pen and SalesSense.  As I have said previously in this House, the economic recovery did not happen by chance; it came from the policies implemented by the Fine Gael-led Government and the sacrifices of the people.  Even though we now have the fastest growing economy in western Europe, we cannot take it for granted.  It is still a fragile recovery.  In my opinion, unemployment is still too high.  The choice for the people at the next general election is simple.  They must choose between stability and economic progress, and between chaos and uncertainty.  It will be as simple as that.  I welcome the Government's decision to restore the pay and services of many public servants.  After four and a half very difficult years, I am pleased that we are now seeing the benefits of the Government's policies and that the sacrifices made by the people are now being rewarded.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102100050#XX00200","speaker":"1068"},{"type":"speech","time":1445444100,"counter":823,"content":"<p>I wish to share time with Deputies Tom Fleming and Michael Fitzmaurice.

It is not about pay increases.  While the Social Democrats would honour the Lansdowne Road agreement, we believe its inclusion in the budgetary arithmetic is a failure of negotiation on the part of the Government.  We believe that as the agreement involves the restoration of existing public sector commitments, it constitutes existing public sector expenditure obligations and as such falls outside the parameters of the fiscal compact, including both the expenditure benchmark and the structural deficit adjustment.  If we are looking at this as a partial adjustment, further pay restoration will depend on the buoyancy of future budgets.<\/p><p>Had the other approach been taken, there would have been a greater degree of certainty around pay restoration under what is a legal agreement.  That comes down to the way it was negotiated.<\/p> <p> When the crash happened and in order to deflect blame, workers were pitched against one another - public sector versus private sector - which was very destructive.  In any future scenario, we must analyse in a wider sense what we mean by reform.  There was a legitimate expectation that the reforms promised would include institutional reforms so that people would see that public service provision was being done differently, was more citizen centred and was delivering the best possible services in the context of the limited money that was available.  In fact, the word reform just became a code word for cuts.  We need to start taking stock now, look to the future and ask what kind of public services we want.  I acknowledge that there were some parts of the budget that went a small way towards improving matters.<\/p> <p> In the context of class sizes, one sees excellent people who are totally demoralised.  Teachers are standing in front of classes of up to 35 children in some cases, many of which are in my local area.  Teachers say that their work is more like crowd control than teaching.  The situation is worse in some parts of the country because of the historical model used for calculating the teacher needs of a school.  Children have to arrive in a school before the Department will determine that the need is growing, even if it is in an area that has a pattern of growth not just over recent years, but over recent decades.  There was an expectation that this would change and that there would be equality in terms of how the pain was felt, for example.  People expected that there would not be disproportionate numbers of children awaiting speech and language therapy in certain parts of the country.  In some parts, there are long waiting lists while in others, the lists are relatively short.  <\/p> <p> I have been highly critical of the way garda&iacute; are deployed and have called for reform in this area.  A policing plan is produced every year and is supposed to take account of demographic shifts and shifts in crime rates.  We have just recently seen an initiative where Garda resources were moved to a part of the country where there is a serious problem.  However, if one looks at the ratio of garda&iacute; to the general population in County Louth and the robbery and burglary rates in that county, it is clear that it should not have taken the recent awful event, the murder of Garda Golden, for Garda resources to be increased in Louth.  If one looks at the statistics for fuel laundering, robberies, theft and so forth, the numbers for County Louth jump off the page.  It is one of the areas where, had there been a normal institutional response to the policing plan in terms of crime rates and demographic shifts, sufficient cover would have been provided before the situation became so acute.  I am very familiar with the issue of Garda numbers because the lowest ratio of garda&iacute; to population is in County Kildare, by quite a distance.  Furthermore, there is a growing burglary rate in the same county, which should not come as a surprise.  The burglary rate in Kildare is one of the highest in the country.  <\/p> <p> When the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, talks about reform of the public service, he may well have a different vision to that of the public.  When the public hears about reform of public services, they tend to look at it from the point of view of better outcomes.  Real reform delivers better outcomes.  I met a man in my office recently who applied for his pension 12 months ago.  However, because he worked in different parts of the country during his 40 year long working life, some records are in Waterford, others are in Donegal and so forth.  He is being sent from Billy to Jack while trying to get something to which he is entitled.  He has been asked to provide information himself and to catalogue where he worked at different points in time even though he worked in the PAYE sector throughout his working life.  That is not the fault of public servants but of the dysfunctional way in which the data is held, which results in a very poor outcome for those seeking a service.  <\/p> <p> We must develop a vision of the kind of public services we want, services that will put the citizen at the centre.  We would make the argument that we must look to really good practice in countries like Denmark and Sweden, where a different value is placed on public services.  If one does it right, one actually puts money back into peoples' pockets.  For example, if we were to provide really free primary education, parents would not be asked for voluntary contributions or would not have to pay for transport if they do not live near a school.  We would be factoring those costs in, which Barnardos estimate would run to &euro;103 million.  Imagine a scenario where, in June and July, parents would not be worrying about how they would get their children back to school in September.  This would particularly favour people on low to middle incomes and would be as valuable to them as a few extra coins in their pockets.  In fact, it would be more valuable because it would give a greater degree of certainty around family budgets.<\/p> <p> I welcome the fact that there will be a partial restoration of pay but it is very precarious because it has not been factored into the budgetary arithmetic.  The Landsdowne Road agreement is a legal agreement.  I would like the Minister to explain why it was not factored in and why he has taken this particular approach.  Further pay restoration can only happen if there is buoyancy in the public finances but none of us can say that there will not be another recession in one or two years' time.  I hope not but the signs are not too good, in terms of the figures that have been floating around in recent weeks regarding fairly significant economies.  A degree of certainty around pay restoration can only happen if it is included within the budgetary arithmetic.  At the moment, there is no certainty.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102100050#XX00500","speaker":"1202","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1445444700,"counter":827,"content":"<p>The Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Bill 2014 proposes to amend previous FEMPI legislation to restore on a partial and phased basis, the reductions made to public sector pay and pensions since 2009.  This Bill gives effect to pay restoration measures agreed under the Landsdowne Road agreement on 29 May 2015.<\/p><p> According to its Long Title, the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2013 provided for the reduction of the remuneration of certain public servants, including members of the Judiciary, a reduction of the amount of the payment of pension or other benefits, other than lump sums, payable to or in respect of certain persons who are or were in the public service under an occupational pension scheme or pension arrangement and the alteration of the operation of scales of pay for public servants, including the suspension of the awarding, for a certain period, of increments under those scales, as well as providing for related matters.  <\/p> <p> The Act placed a freeze on increments for public servants on incremental pay scales commencing in July 2013.  It allowed for modification of the increment freeze, as agreed under the Haddington Road agreement, such that increments were delayed for short periods.  Under section 4 of the Bill before us, the increment freeze under the 2013 Act will be extended to July 2018 consistent with the extension of the Haddington Road agreement by the terms of that particular agreement.<\/p> <p> As a consequence of the emergency measures, Irish people have shouldered a disproportionate amount of the burden created by a reckless financial sector and the subsequent collapse in incomes and property prices.  Many public servants had their pay and conditions changed repeatedly under the terms of the financial emergency measures in the public interest legislation.  One hears a plethora of stories concerning the hardship endured by public servants across the board, for example, teachers and garda&iacute;.  <\/p> <p> New entrants to the Garda and newly qualified teachers are barely able to make ends meet.  This is particularly relevant in light of spiralling rents in Dublin and elsewhere.  Poor rates of pay are forcing new Garda recruits and teaching graduates out of their local communities and ever further from their places of work.  The Government removed the annual rent allowance of &euro;4,115 from garda&iacute; graduating from Templemore who will be paid only &euro;23,171 in their first year of service.  New recruits will struggle to exist on such a basic wage and will find it difficult to secure accommodation near the station to which they have been posted, especially in cities and large urban areas.  The Government should follow the lead of the authorities in London and Paris which provide central accommodation for essential workers such as police officers, firefighters and nurses.  Garda&iacute; who do a ten-hour shift may have to drive two hours each way to and from work.  This will cause fatigue and could mean they are unable to perform their duties in a satisfactory manner. <\/p> <p> The first batch of Garda recruits to be affected by the cut in the rent allowance have completed training and are being posted to stations nationwide.  The approximately 200 garda&iacute; who were recently deployed face soaring rents and a rising housing market that are pricing some of these essential workers out of their communities.  If a decent and fair wage is not established soon, new garda&iacute; will be caught in a poverty trap and key workers will be excluded from the communities they serve.  While Ireland would not be the first country to encounter this problem, we should learn from other jurisdictions where it has arisen by avoiding it at all costs.  It is discriminatory, to say the least, that new recruits are being treated differently from other garda&iacute; and that different wage structures will apply to them.  It is also wrong for us to expect garda&iacute; to put their lives on the line, as they do daily, in such circumstances.  Unequal pay structures make matters worse.  <\/p> <p> The rent supplement for garda&iacute; was introduced not as a housing supplement but to ensure police officers had a living wage.  A living wage is the minimum we can strive to achieve for garda&iacute;.  The current anomalies must be addressed as soon as possible. <\/p> <p> Newly qualified teachers will be paid &euro;1,538 less than teachers who qualified last year as a result of the review of allowances under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act.  New entrants to teaching are also losing the qualification allowance, which is worth approximately &euro;5,000 per annum.  To provide partial compensation for this measure, they will now start at the fourth rather than the first point on the payscale, which translates to a starting salary of approximately &euro;30,700, plus an additional &euro;1,592 for those who sign up for supervision and substitution duties, giving a total of &euro;32,292.  To qualify for the supervision and substitution allowance, new entrants will have to provide 12 additional per hours per annum over and above the existing requirement.  They will also lose the Gaeltacht, island and teaching through Irish allowances, three allowances with which the Minister of State, Deputy McHugh, will be acquainted.  These are worth &euro;3,063, &euro;1,842 and &euro;1,583, respectively. <\/p> <p> All of us are aware that people enter the public service from a sense of civic duty as opposed to the pay on offer.  The cuts made under the financial emergency measures in the public interest legislation have made it very difficult to attract young graduates, many of whom are drawn to professions that provide a living wage, career prospects and job security for themselves and their families.  A further side effect of the cuts has been the haemorrhaging of Irish doctors and nurses to foreign shores in search of better terms and conditions for difficult and highly skilled work. <\/p> <p> The majority of trade unions voted to accept the Lansdowne Road agreement, which proposes the restoration of pay and pensions and the resumption of hiring to fill vacant posts.  However, the agreement did not gain universal acceptance with a number of unions voting to reject it. <\/p> <p> The financial crisis has placed a heavy burden on citizens.  The number of people working in the public service has declined by 30,000 in recent years.  I give credit and thanks to public servants for their hard work across the public sector in striving to keep Ireland moving through tough times.  I hope the unwinding of the FEMPI measures will give them their extended families some extra money.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102100051#YY00200","speaker":"1050","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1445445300,"counter":829,"content":"<p>I am pleased to have an opportunity to speak on this Bill.  I am probably in a unique position in the House in believing that the proposed measures are not the correct course of action for the Government, the State and its citizens.  It is unfortunate that a Member of the Oireachtas or, for that matter, anyone else who questions the almost automatic decision of the Government to reverse the financial emergency measures in the public interest legislation and introduce so-called pay restoration, will be pilloried for being anti-public sector.<\/p><p>I do not regard myself as being anti-public-sector in any way, shape or form.  I have huge respect for the men and women who serve this country and our citizens in the line of duty, whether it is as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, members of the Defence Forces, nurses or those who provide assistance to children with special needs, teachers, doctors or anything else.  Right across the board, our departmental civil servants do very important work.  I want hard-working public and civil servants to have the prospect of better pay and conditions and pay increases, but I do not believe everybody should expect a pay rise.  I do not believe that, irrespective of how good or bad one is at one's job, one should be entitled to expect the same reward as a person who may be better at the job and work harder.  We are taught throughout our education that hard work, enterprise and effort should be rewarded, but we introduce blanket pay deals by way of insider negotiation with certain vested interests.  Many groups are not represented at the table; it is select groups or friends of the Government, if one likes, who get to sit at the table.  It is not democratic or transparent and it is not right.  It has resulted in a really bad culture throughout our public service.  It has led to a bad culture in, for example, the HSE, because people are demotivated and demoralised.  Whether they work hard or not, they can expect the same treatment under our system.  That is fundamentally wrong.<\/p> <p> When we talk about so-called \"pay restoration\", we should reflect on that phrase.  What is pay restoration and what are we restoring?  What is this restoration all about?  It is ironic that today is \"Back to the Future\" day.  It is the day Marty McFly was supposed to jump into the future.  We were supposed to have shoelaces that tied themselves and all sorts of things that were predicted in the movie.  I feel like it is \"Back to the Future\" when we are having this debate, albeit not much of one, on pay restoration.  What do we want to restore?  Are we going back to the Celtic tiger era?  That is certainly the direction in which we are headed.  There was such a scandal and outcry after the benchmarking experience, although not during it because, as many have commented, everyone wanted to be part of it.  Who is going to turn down a pay increase, particularly one that is not predicated on any particular performance but is given automatically?  That is what we are returning to.  We are saying that we want these blanket pay deals.  There is not even a pretence at benchmarking any longer; rather, we want to start spending what is not, unfortunately, anything other than borrowed money at this point.  We want to do it, coincidentally, just before an election.<\/p> <p> The FEMPI legislation was predicated on an emergency state in the national finances, and it is very convenient for the Government to announce that the emergency is over.  While we have growth in the economy and are on the road to recovery, it is premature to declare the emergency over when we still have a deficit and continue to borrow to pay for all of our public services.  The decision on the part of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, to suddenly declare the emergency over is very much a subjective one, and it does not stand up to scrutiny when the State is still borrowing to pay for its day-to-day current costs.  Social partnership was renounced by the larger coalition partner.  It was renounced because it was a ready-up.  I do not need to name the now-serving Ministers who attacked benchmarking and social partnership from the Opposition benches where I sat with them.  Now in government and in a position to hand out money to curry favour with the unions and the other organisations sitting around the table, it is suddenly convenient for them to forget that rhetoric and leave it behind.  Unfortunately, we have discovered that it was rhetoric rather than anything meaningful or substantive.  It certainly does not appear to have been driven by any conviction.  That is a real pity.<\/p> <p> We had, and still have, an opportunity to change our attitude and approach to expenditure and the budgetary process.  There is an opportunity to avoid the traps that previous Fianna F&aacute;il Governments fell into, but the Government is, unfortunately, falling into them anyway.  Last night, I was at a public meeting on the economy and the aftermath of the budget.  One person pointed out that Fianna F&aacute;il was really angry last week, kicking itself and put out by the budget because it wanted to have delivered it itself.  It was a Fianna F&aacute;il budget.  It was a little bit of this and a little bit of that for everybody.  That characterises the Lansdowne Road agreement, which is a little bit of something for everyone without any real strategic vision as to how the economy should be.  It is a missed opportunity.  We are back to election-driven spending patterns.  We saw increases in spending, piecemeal tax cuts across the board and the announcement of the capital spending plan a couple of weeks before the budget, all of which was targeted at particular constituencies.  It was designed to create a little offering, if not a whole lot, for everybody rather than to take tough or strategic decisions about what is best for our country.<\/p> <p> What we should have had was a fully engaged budgetary process involving all members of the Oireachtas.  We should have had a build-up to the budget and the capital programme over a period of months, with input from Ministers, of course, and their civil servants, naturally, as well as the other political parties and Opposition Deputies.  That input should have been scrutinised and different options should have been teased out.  Different priorities should have been suggested and there should have been a genuine and meaningful debate with expert input through the sectoral committees.  Instead, we had Ministers come to the House to announce that certain groups would benefit from the lucky-bag approach with which we became so familiar under Fianna F&aacute;il.  It is a real shame.<\/p> <p> We need to see real reform through this legislation, Government policy and the setting out of a new vision for the country.  Unfortunately, we have not seen that.  In fact, putting the Minister, Deputy Brendan Howlin, into a Department entitled \"Public Expenditure and Reform\" was something of an ironic step.  It is clear that the task of the Minister was to ensure that there would be no reform.  While there have been cuts, some of them swingeing, hugely regressive and damaging, there has been no real reform.  One need only look at the much-feted review of public service allowances and premium payments.  That process was an absolute disgrace and a waste of time.  Of 1,100 allowances across the public sector included in the review, virtually none was removed or abolished.  It is a significant indictment of the Minister and his Department.  It proves beyond any doubt that there was never any intention to reform public services.  We must remember in the House that public services are actually about delivering high-quality services to the public.<\/p><p>If we are serious about that, why are we intent on pumping our limited, borrowed resources into pay at the first glimmer of hope and recovery instead of into services that everyone claims he or she wants to improve?  This is extraordinary when queues of older people, sick people and, often, dying people are lying on hospital trolleys.  Those numbers will increase as the winter months pass, yet the Government has prioritised pumping &euro;1 billion into pay and pensions through the Lansdowne Road agreement.  That is wrong, and it divides workers in the public sector from those in the private sector.<\/p> <p> I agree that people are taxed too much and that they do not have enough autonomy over how they spend their wages and provide for their families, but driving up wages through secretive pay deals like the Lansdowne Road agreement is not the way to solve that, rather, the way to achieve better quality of life and greater access to disposable income is through reductions in the personal tax burden.  This would result in benefits for all workers, not merely public sector ones.  Many of the latter have taken large hits in the past seven years, but so have private sector workers.  People lost their jobs, took 40% or 50% pay cuts or had their weeks reduced to two days.  Even worse, some were forced to emigrate.  Increasing wages in the public sector will do nothing for these people.  It will drive up wages in the private sector, which will only return us to the uncompetitive position of the mid-2000s.  What sort of bananas economic agenda is that?  Why is the Government intent on dividing the workforce, pitching the public sector against the private sector, when the obvious approach is to take steps that would benefit all workers?<\/p> <p> Why has the Government refused to grasp the nettle of genuine reform of the public service?  Performance reviews were much feted under the Croke Park agreement.  After a few months, however, public servants pronounced that less than 1% of them needed to improve their performances.  I believe the figure was 0.85%.  What utter nonsense.  What Deputy could claim not to need to improve his or her performance?  In what workplace could one find that 99.15% of workers were performing fine?  These reviews are shambolic, meaningless and a cosmetic exercise designed, as per usual, to tick a box instead of driving the sort of reforms, efficiencies and performances that we need in our public services.  Why is the Government happy to go along with this charade?  In particular, why is Fine Gael prepared to do this?  Since the Labour Party is funded by the trade unions, we understand the incentive and the relationship on that side, but I am at a loss as to how the Fine Gael Party could go along with this.<\/p> <p> We need independent performance reviews within our public service.  We need to link pay to performance.  People have been discussing this for 25 years or more.  For the past seven years, the perfect opportunity has existed to do it, to recognise those outstanding public servants who do their best, come to work energised and want to contribute and see the best for their country.  We could cherish their work and reward them for it while the person next to them who did not work hard or make the same commitment to the job would not be rewarded in the same way.  This is the culture that we need to drive in our public service.  This is the culture that the majority of hard-working public servants want, as they would have nothing to fear from it.  Rather, they would be rewarded for their efforts.<\/p> <p> Instead, we have despicable box-ticking exercises that allow Ministers to squander taxpayers' money in attempts to buy votes at election time.  We saw it with Bertie, who has had a bit of a resurrection in the media in the past 24 hours.  We saw the destruction that such policies wreaked in our economy and society.  I am ashamed that the Government is essentially following the same course and seems to show no interest in learning from the mistakes of the past.  This is disgraceful.<\/p> <p> On a positive note, there are obvious and simple solutions that could transform our country, economy and society.  One is to get rid of our dysfunctional and deliberately Byzantine tax system.  Renua Ireland has proposed the most radical tax policy of any political party of the past 100 years.  We advocate a flat tax.  This would transform the country by encouraging and driving innovation and entrepreneurialism and, importantly, by rewarding work for all people who want to contribute and provide for their families.<\/p> <p> Currently, there are many anomalies, for example, the multiple USC and PRSI rates and the two income tax bands.  These anomalies create a complex system that disincentivises work.  We have a large range of tax breaks that are primarily availed of by the very wealthy.  Disincentives and traps in social welfare and the minimum wage prevent people from taking on additional hours and earning extra money.  In many cases, these are disincentives to people seeking pay rises.  If someone on the minimum wage gets a rise of &euro;10 per week, he or she will pay more tax and actually lose net pay.  What a bizarre situation for a country that claims that it wants to incentivise work.  It must change, and Renua Ireland has a clear plan as to how to do that.  Our way would be better than a return to the good old days of throwing money at problems, which is what Fianna F&aacute;il-led Administrations did.  They increased health spending threefold in a 15-year period, yet our health system is shambolic.  I have a great deal of direct experience of this, personally through family as well as through the many constituents who contact me seeking help.  Every other Deputy has had similar experiences.<\/p> <p> If we want to change this situation, we must change the culture, reform the delivery of public services, stop throwing money at problems, start innovating and treat all of our workers fairly and equally.  The best way to do this is through lower taxation that does not penalise work and that values all workers equally regardless of whether they are in the public or private sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102100052#ZZ00200","speaker":"1204","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1445446500,"counter":832,"content":"<p>Deputy Mattie McGrath has the next speaking slot.

If this were next week, it would be more appropriate, as it would be Hallowe'en.<\/p><p><i>7 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p>We could all come in wearing masks and have the phony war and phony games.  One would think we were out of recession.  Admittedly, the troika is gone &mdash; we banished it in time &mdash; but we are not out of recession, or anything like it.  We are sick and tired of hearing about economic focus and talk of the boom in Dublin, but the recovery has not extended far beyond Newlands Cross and has not been felt by many in rural areas.  The Minister of State, Deputy Joe McHugh, is keenly aware of that from his constituency in Donegal, just as the Taoiseach should be aware of it in Castlebar.  The economy is on its knees but the Taoiseach is in here in a cocoon believing that he is going to visit multinationals, schools or whatever he decides to visit.  He is running from pillar to post, but he will not engage with anyone or listen to any of the people who are suffering and have suffered because of the FEMPI legislation.  We have scampi one day and FEMPI the next.  It is just a mixed bag; it is hit and miss.  What is now going on now is farcical.<\/p> <p> The night before the budget, there were Supplementary Estimates worth &euro;1.5 million.  The health budget is to overrun by &euro;600 million this year.  The figures are totally contrived to give the impression that there is a rise in funding for health services.  I heard Sarah Burke going through those figures on my way home on Thursday evening and she implied there was less money in the kitty.  It is a trick-o-the-loop by spin doctors.  All these people are set to gain more from the FEMPI cuts reversal than anybody else because they are in the higher tax bracket.  For too long there has been a cosy cartel.  I have said throughout my eight years as a Member that the spin doctors and officials have their hands around the handlebars of power.  They will not let go to get their hands around them.  A hammer and chisel or jackhammer would not get their fingers off the handlebars such is their grip.  It causes such paralysis in the country.  Most of these officials could not run a shop, farm or any business.  I have said time and again that many of the public officials at senior level should be asked to run a shop or business and see how hard it is to open one, pay rates, generate turnover, pay for light and heat and pay rent, staff, taxes and everything else.  Self-employed people have little for themselves.<\/p> <p> There are hundreds of thousands of low-paid workers who did not gain all along, even though SIPTU is attached to and in unison with the Labour Party.  We know that, but the other unions are in cahoots also.  The higher one's wage, the greater one's increase every time because of collective bargaining and everything else.  We are told that what is occurring now must happen because of the Lansdowne Road agreement.  I wonder whether any staff from the troika are looking in now to see what is going on.  They were in a merry dance.  There was a merry dance, Hallowe'en tricks and a trick-o-the-loop, and those concerned got blindfolded.  I met the staff eight or nine times and I challenged them and it was a joke.  They told me two and a half or three years ago at a meeting that there would be a focus on and growth in the country.  I asked them who told them that but they looked at one another and would not answer.  There were language barriers and everything else.  I might not be the clearest always but I know what I want to say anyway and I know what is going down in the countryside because I listen to the people.  I am a Teachta D&aacute;la, a messenger boy for the people, in this House and I will not forget that while I have the honour and privilege of being here.  Eventually I had to get the facts out of the officials and I learned they were told what they were told by the senior civil servants.  I asked them why they did not go down to any rural town outside the Pale.  They did not go outside the Pale.  I refer to places such as D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  I hear on shows such as Joe Duffy's about the demise of villages and the heartlands of towns because of exorbitant rates and various schemes and because the authorities have been in bed with the big supermarkets and have allowed the latter to build outside all the town centres, thus killing off the towns.  This is because they fund the political parties.  The system stinks.  The people to whom I was talking said they were told what they were told by the senior officials.  These are the same senior officials who told Mr. Brian Lenihan &mdash; Lord have mercy on him &mdash; what he had to do.  He told us we had to come up and vote-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102100054#BBB00300","speaker":"1090","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1445447100,"counter":835,"content":"<p>The Deputy should speak to the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102100055#CCC00200","speaker":"1014"},{"type":"speech","time":1445447100,"counter":836,"content":"<p>I am speaking to the FEMPI legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102100055#CCC00300","speaker":"1090"},{"type":"speech","time":1445447100,"counter":837,"content":"<p>Not in my opinion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102100055#CCC00400","speaker":"1014"},{"type":"speech","time":1445447100,"counter":838,"content":"<p>That is funny.  That is the Acting Chairman's opinion but in my opinion I am speaking on the Bill.  I am talking about the FEMPI cuts being reversed.  One would think we were in a honeymoon period again, but we are not.  More important, the people do not believe we are either.  The Government is in a state of indecision over when to cut and run and have the election.  When people get their pay packets in January, they will know what they have and what they got.<\/p>  <p>  The troika did not deal with the massive, exorbitant waste at the top, the consultants, Uisce &Eacute;ireann and all the other bodies.  It is as if we did not have enough experience of the monstrosity of the HSE which was created by amalgamating the health boards through centralisation.  We set up Irish Water and a bonus culture was built into it.  We paid consultants &euro;90 million to design it.  It is a merry game of fat cats rubbing butter into fat cats' you-know-where to make them fatter and more prosperous.  Four kids from kindergarten would not have designed Irish Water any worse than what they have done.  The organisation has a bonus culture.  The Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly, said there would not be a penny paid in bonuses while he was in charge but he had to crawl away from this again.  This is another battle he lost because the machinery of State decided the staff would have to get their bonuses, even if they were not earned.<\/p>  <p>  I am not talking about ordinary public servants or front-line staff and their commitment over the years.  I am not referring to HSE front-line nurses, community nurses, doctors, caterers, county council workers and ordinary people who have to deliver the services with less and less resources.  Senior people get all the money.  Former Minister Brian Lenihan introduced a cut for the senior civil servants.  When I challenged him, he was told there were only 186 people affected.  I tabled a motion at the time &mdash; I was in the Fianna F&aacute;il Party &mdash; and the Minister thanked me for it.  When he went to research it, he found out there were almost 1,000 affected.  Is that not trickery and hoodwinking?  The cut was reversed and those concerned got out under the wire.  Everybody else had to take the medicine.  This was at the beginning of the FEMPI arrangement.  The staff in question got it reversed because they are in the cars and offices with the Ministers and have their hands on the handlebars of power and will not take them off them.  Successive Governments have backed off from dealing with this.<\/p>  <p>  I listened to Deputy Lucinda Creighton attentively.  She was correct that those in the current Government were railing against these issues when I sat on the other side of the House.  I was railing against them when I was a member of the Fianna F&aacute;il parliamentary party because I knew it could not last.  Now the Government is all for what is happening just to buy an election.  I am surprised by the backbenchers, especially the few self-employed ones, who should understand the madness of engaging in auction politics to get back into power, especially since we are still borrowing massively to run the show every day of the week and to meet the cost of current spending.<\/p>  <p>  The outdoor staff and front-line staff I mentioned, the ambulance drivers and members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na were reduced to enslavement because of the cuts to their wages.  Now we are recruiting garda&iacute;, which I am delighted to see, but we are not paying them half the money - they cannot live on it.  Where are we going to get the morale and the respect among low-level garda&iacute;, low-level teachers and those at other levels?  We have to have a level playing field and we must respect, honour and praise work.  Any man who goes to work must be rewarded always.  We must look after people who are genuinely unemployed and genuinely sick as well.<\/p>  <p>  The cuts imposed on the disabled and marginalised under FEMPI have been merciless.  Again, these are the people who will gain least from the budget.  The higher earners will benefit from the higher tax cuts and the lower earners and unemployed will get less.  The pensioners are to get &euro;3 a week; that is a lot of good to them.<\/p>  <p>  Take general practitioners: I am not a spokesperson for them but they are at the coalface.  They have a contract that is 40 years old but the Government refuses to renegotiate it so it will be relevant to the work they are expected to do.  The general practitioners swear the Hippocratic oath to help and save people and treat the sick.  Especially in rural areas but also in urban areas, the vast majority are self-employed.  They answer calls at all times of the night and day.  They employ other doctors, nurses and psychiatrists, the lot.  They are businesspeople and may have 20 people working for them.  They have been cut.  The figures, which are accurate, show general practitioners have been forced to let staff go.  A spokesperson for the National Association of General Practitioners has warned that the walls are caving in on family doctors, yet the Government engages in folly in respect of children under six.  It is another folly project of the last Minister.  Someone else got contaminated with it this time &mdash; I do not use that word in any bad way &mdash; with regard to the provision of free general practitioner care for children of 11 and under.  They are the healthiest people in our society.  Day in day out, Deputy Kelleher, the Minister of State, Deputy Joe McHugh, and I encounter people who are sick and in need, awaiting operations in pain and agony and on trolleys, yet their medical cards are removed unceremoniously from them.  The HSE system that I deal with is so bureaucratic.  Those people have experienced savage cuts.  A survey of 72% of general practitioners' practices, carried out by the National Association of General Practitioners, found that as many as 8% of general practitioners have to close up and go.<\/p><p>They will not even be negotiated with in terms of a decent contract.  It is not right.  Self-employed people will drive the economy.  They were driving it until the Construction Industry Federation and others got involved in collective bargaining and negotiated rates for themselves.  It was all about the big people.  We forgot about the little people and the small farmer, who is still struggling and who got less from the budget than anybody else.  We forgot about the small and medium enterprises, SMEs, which each employ between one and 20 people.  If all the SMEs employed one extra person, no one would be unemployed.  We know that but we have strangled them with quango after quango.  The mother of all quangos is Irish Water, whose employees cannot fix a washer in a tap.  They have no employees who are capable of doing anything.  It is all consultants and agents, who are good people, but anything that has to be done must be done by local authorities.  Now we cannot phone the local authorities.  If somebody has a problem, he or she must phone Irish Water first.  We have layers of red tape to reward retired county and city managers, senior officials and some Deputies here whose wives retired from other public service jobs and were pushed into Irish Water.  It is disgusting and disgraceful.<\/p> <p> We were led a merry dance by the troika.  Shame on the troika for not getting into the veins of rural Ireland - and urban Ireland also - to see what was really going on and how the people were being affected by the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest, FEMPI, Act.  We are now back to FEMPI.  It is like Hallowe'en, when children play trick-o-the-loop or trick or treat.  It is a case of \"Come out Enda and give us a treat\".  He will get some treat when he goes back to Castlebar, where the only business park in the town closed down.  The position is the same in every other town and village.  Business has become too costly because we have appointed quango after quango.<\/p> <p> The name of the National Employment Rights Authority, NERA, should be changed to the \"national employers' supports agency\".  People with briefcases are calling to self-employed people and harassing them by telling them their daughter or son should not be working in a premises after 9 p.m. on a Saturday or Sunday and so on.  I am all for workers' rights - I have been an employer for the past 32 years - but we do not need these people marching in and flashing their identification cards.

They should work with those to whom I refer and try to understand the problems and the issues they face and assist them in dealing with them.  They should not create bureaucratic messes.<\/p> <p> What cuts were introduced through FEMPI for senior officers in the courts and the sheriffs who act for the courts?

That is the most annoying aspect.  They are still waiting for hospital appointments for two or three years.  They are waiting for brain scans, knee operations and so on.  Government Members are living in a bubble if they do not realise that.<\/p>  <p>  We had the charade in terms of what the banks were allowed to do in the absence of banking legislation and we know that what caused the need for FEMPI to be introduced was the collapse of the banks.  The rhetoric from the Labour Party in opposition at the time was that they would burn the bondholders.  Hell's fire would not be as hot as the fire for the bondholders.  What did those in the Labour Party do, however?  They rubbed more of the butter into the fat bankers' \"you know where\".  It was Labour's way or Frankfurt's way.  Then the Fine Gael-led Government got in the mood to implement cut after cut.  However, most of those cuts affected ordinary people in the public service and their counterparts in the private sector also.<\/p>  <p>  If we are ever to have an equilibrium or fair play, we will have to treat the self-employed as entrepreneurs and support them.  We will have to make Enterprise Ireland help them.  We had the county enterprise boards but the Minister abolished them.  The Leader programmes, which were the models, were also abolished.  Europa recognised the Leader programme in Ireland as a flagship for the rest of Europe but what did the former Minister, Phil Hogan, do?  He attacked it and put it under the county councils.<\/p>  <p>  Under Better Local Government, the Government said it would amalgamate and banish local democracy.  The Government has abandoned the people.  It brought forward a document, Putting People First.  That was passed here but I stood up and opposed it.  I brought a challenge to it in the High Court and served a summons on the former Minister, Phil Hogan, in this premises.  We will go to Europe with that.<\/p>  <p>  In my county, and the Government bulldozed north Tipperary and south Tipperary together, the county manager and others put all this in place before the enabling legislation was passed in this House.  I have the day and dates on which it was passed.  All the work was done beforehand, including the amalgamations.  Processes were put in place before the legislation was passed.  That is an indication of the arrogance of very senior officials in county councils and in government.<\/p>  <p>  We are only rubber stamping measures in this House.  It is a case of getting this legislation and being expected to vote it through.  The Government has the numbers.  Its Deputies will vote for it and we are cannon fodder.  That is why I got speaking time tonight.  I was told I would have it but then told it would be tomorrow or whenever.  However, the Government speakers did not take up the slots tonight because they know they cannot talk about something that repulses them.  It repulsed them when they were in opposition.  They railed against what the former taoisigh, Brian Cowen and Bertie Ahern, and their Governments did at the time, particularly in the context of public spending.  However, those in this Administration have learned the tricks, as I have said many times in the past five years.  It almost seems that since they came to power, they have sought to punish the people for keeping them out of office for 14 years.  They have a gravy train for their friends and advisers.  The Government has stuffed the Judiciary with its own appointees.  Openness and transparency, how are you?  The Government has allowed the receivers get richer and fatter and allowed the sheriffs plunder people's homes and terrorise them.<\/p>  <p>  I said last week in the debate on the budget that all our people want to do is live.  They are proud people.  They go out and do an honest day's work for an honest day's pay, but they want fairness.  When they see what is happening with the front-line services and at the top of their own organisations, why would they not have low morale?  Why is morale so low in my own county council?  Why is morale so low in many parts of the public service?  It is because they see that if one is a nice boy and plays ball with the system, one might get promoted.  It should be about public service and productivity but it is not.  It is who one knows, what one knows and a case of \"Two bags full, Sir\".<\/p>  <p>  The Government has been a sad failure.  It got one of the finest mandates any Government ever received but it has abandoned that.  It is now afraid, and it cannot make a decision on when to face the people.  We had the spectacle for the past three or four weeks of the Taoiseach becoming a dummy.  He would not answer anybody but was finally forced to go on an RTE programme.  His handlers let him out but he said the wrong thing; he was not supposed to say what he said.  They meant him to say he would have the election but he does not know what he will do now.  It is a pitch-and-putt or a lucky-dip job.  When Joan allows it, the election will happen.<\/p>  <p>  When the Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly, came out tonight for the third time and announced that he is buying in prefab homes for the homeless, he said he will fast-track planning laws.  How does he intend to do that?  He never served on a county or local council.  If he had, he would understand that planning legislation cannot be fast-tracked unless the intention is to bring us in here and pass enabling legislation.  He cannot do it next week because the Houses are not sitting.  He will have to do it before the election, but he says he has bought 500 of these premises.  This is more blunder and bluster from a Government that is big on spin.  It is spinning so fast that it will spin off into the abyss one of these days.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102100056#DDD01600","speaker":"1090"},{"type":"speech","time":1445448300,"counter":855,"content":"<p>Please take your seat, Deputy.

We welcome the conclusion of the public sector pay talks known as the Lansdowne Road talks.  When we discuss the matter we should do so it the context of where we were when we initially introduced the financial emergency measures in the public interest legislation and where we find ourselves today as a people.  In that difficult journey extraordinarily difficult decisions had to be made in this House which had a direct and immediate impact on people's lives.  We have to acknowledge that a great many people shared serious burdens to ensure a readjustment of the public finances and to ensure the economy would be able to build itself back towards a sustainable funding model.  We still have a challenging situation.  This is evident from the budget last week and the fact we are still borrowing large sums of money to fund current expenditure.  All in all, major sacrifices were made by many people.  Obviously, the public service carried its fair burden with cuts to take-home pay, the imposition of the pension levy and increases in productivity and efficiencies.  There is no doubt this made a major contribution to addressing the damaged public finances and the situation we found ourselves in between 2007 and 2012.  All in all, they made a remarkable contribution.<\/p>  <p>  When we refer to damage to individuals in terms of take-home pay, we should acknowledge that at one stage we had unemployment levels of between 15% and 16% and probably higher.  However, due to changes in qualification criteria, particularly for the self-employed, many people found themselves without any support from the State.  This included self-employed people who found themselves without business any more.  In all that happened with the downturn in the economy, their plight was almost forgotten.  These self-employed people found themselves without a business or any form of work.  The State was miserable and underhand in dealing with them.  Many of these people had worked extraordinarily hard.  They had built up small businesses, made their contributions, paid their taxes and employed other people.  When they found themselves gone, as it were, they were forgotten.<\/p>  <p>  We often talk about the public service, the Civil Service in particular, in terms of bringing forward, defining, implementing and overseeing the development of policy.  Those involved may not always understand the serious pressures on self-employed people.  The self-employed must consider whether they will have enough money for themselves, enough cashflow to pay their employees' wages and all the continual pressures on self-employed people.  They were another group of people who made a major contribution to the development of the economy, but when the economy went south, they were hit the hardest.  Many of them still languish among the statistics without necessarily having good or reasonable supports or a floor on which they can tread when they find themselves in these difficulties.  This group certainly played and continues to play its part as well.<\/p>  <p>  Let us consider the stabilisation of the finances.  Pay increases will be awarded under the Lansdowne Road talks.  However, we need to be continually vigilant of the fact that at issue is public money.  We need to ensure continual efficiencies.  We need to ensure the progressive implementation of technology and new ideas.  We need to ensure new thought processes are consistently brought into the Civil Service and the public service.  I have found in opposition and in government that while we have the most professional and efficient Civil Service and people with remarkable integrity, at times we are reluctant and slow to embrace new ideas or look outside the capacity of the Civil Service for new ideas, innovation and technology.<\/p>  <p>  One thing sprang to mind when I was reading some notes earlier.  The Revenue Commissioners is definitely the most efficient organisation in this country in terms of embracing technology and doing what it is meant to do.  Of course, the reason is that the Revenue is collecting money for the State.  However, we are not as good in terms of efficiencies when we are trying to deliver services to citizens in areas that cost the State money.  Often, we are slow and ponderous with applications for people seeking medical cards or social welfare or in cases of people who are languishing on hospital waiting lists.  This also applies in general interaction between the State and the citizen.  When the State is obliged to give something to the citizen, those responsible can be slow and reluctant to embrace the best ideas to ensure the services are delivered.  Home care packages serve as an example.  All these languish in a lethargic system of assessment to see whether people qualify and then subsequently in the awarding of the qualification.  At times, we can be very efficient in one way but elsewhere we are not as good.<\/p>  <p>  Let us consider the example of crime in rural Ireland.  People get annoyed when they see no garda&iacute; available to protect citizens from criminality.  At the same time, they see what they believe to be considerable resources being used to collect debt for private companies, for example.  These things are important when we are discussing the FEMPI legislation, the sacrifice of the citizen, the obligation of the State and the interaction of the State and citizen through the various State agencies.<\/p>  <p>  I believe that as we progress as an economy, we must progress as a society as well.  One of the key obligations is to ensure the State upholds its side of the bargain.  We ask our citizens to carry the major difficulties and to pay taxes, but when the State has an obligation to ensure services are provided, it can be rather slow.  That system grinds slower as resources dwindle.  There is an intentional slowdown of assessment of people's rights and entitlements when they are looking for something from the State.  We need to be mindful of that as we progress.<\/p>  <p>  Overall, this legislation is welcome.  It signifies that the endurance of many people over many years has been steadfast and highlights the sacrifices they have made.  Some of these sacrifices had a major impact.  Some public servants on take-home pay of &euro;700 per week lost more than &euro;100 in take-home pay between the FEMPI cuts and tax increases.  That had an extraordinary impact on individuals, their quality of life, aspirations, dreams and their hopes for themselves and their children and families.  Many people have gone through serious upheaval.  This point must be a key acknowledgement in terms of celebrating and applauding ourselves from time to time in this Chamber for all the great work we have done.  It is the case that we did extraordinarily difficult things, but it was in the context of passing legislation to stabilise the finances.  However, the extraordinarily difficult things were carried by many citizens for long periods.  We owe it to those people to ensure that when we start to award pay increases, we consider those who were disproportionately affected, those who were asked to carry most and who, perhaps, were incapable of carrying most, including the low-paid, clerical officers in the public service and the Civil Service, garda&iacute;, teachers and nurses.  These groups had a major imposition on their take-home pay and quality of life.<\/p>  <p>  For all these reasons this legislation is welcome.  As we try to return to where we were, I hope we will return having learned the lessons of the past.  I trust we will reward those who carried most for the longest period.  Primarily, they include the lower-paid in the public sector and the Civil Service.  Certainly, those among the higher grades took pain as well, but there is no comparison between asking a public servant on &euro;120,000 or &euro;130,000 to take a cut of 10% and asking a clerical officer, a nurse or a garda to take a cut of 7% in pay.  The impact is disproportionate for the lower-paid.  We must acknowledge that in any further roll-out.  I would like to expand on the point at another time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102100057#EEE00400","speaker":"983"},{"type":"speech","time":1445448900,"counter":857,"content":"<p>I ask the Deputy to move the adjournment of the debate.

By treating the assets that way, it is very difficult to see how the benefit of the assets will be fully retrieved for the people who are carrying the can, namely, the citizens of the State.<\/p>  <p>  There has to be an inquiry.  The number of issues identified have caused a real loss of public confidence, even though there was not much confidence in the first place due to the controversies involved.

It handed them over to individuals who flipped them and profited from them at the expense of Irish taxpayers.  <\/p>  <p>  The Government might think it has dodged this issue and will vote the motion down, but it has to ask itself what is the rationale for the sale of Project Arrow.  The project has a book value of &euro;6.3 billion, but NAMA will not get &euro;1 billion for it although half of the portfolio comprises residential property in the South.  The Government has teed up a done deal.  The property portfolio will be sold to Cerberus, a US vulture fund, at less than &euro;100,000 per residential unit at a time when the State has a housing crisis.  It is treachery of the highest order and the Government has to join the dots.  There is no way it can dodge the issue. <\/p>  <p>  There will be a commission of investigation into NAMA.  I do not have the confidence that it will be done under this Government, but it will be done.  Project Arrow is not the subject of a competitive tender.  Project Eagle was not either.

It is for NAMA in Dublin to answer why it did not pick up on it.  Why did it not set alarm bells ringing in Dublin and the head office of NAMA that one group withdrew from the sale and along came another looking to buy, with the exact same advisers and fixers that put the process in place?<\/p>  <p>  NAMA said it was nothing to do with it and that it was not involved in the process.

There are a series of questions regarding the sale of 850 properties in Northern Ireland and other issues to be addressed.  That is why investigations are taking place by the US Department of Justice, the National Crime Agency in the UK, the PSNI and the Northern Ireland Law Society.  All of the jurisdictions involved are investigating the very serious issues raised with one exception, this jurisdiction. <\/p>  <p>  It is quite amazing and bizarre that this jurisdiction is not taking a much more investigative approach to Project Eagle.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, said there is no need for an investigation as there is no alleged wrongdoing by NAMA, which is a very broad statement to make.  We know there are serious questions about the role of Frank Cushnahan, who was appointed to the Northern Ireland advisory committee by the then Minister of Finance, Brian Lenihan.  It was a sub-committee of NAMA, its members were appointed by the then Minister for Finance and it was chaired by Frank Daly, head of NAMA. <\/p>  <p>  The Northern Ireland advisory committee, while it functioned, was part of NAMA and, therefore, questions over the role of a former member in the Project Eagle sale are a matter for NAMA and should be a matter of concern to the Government.  PIMCO, the US company which was interested in buying NAMA's Northern portfolio, claimed it was asked for a &pound;15 million fee to be shared by Brown Rudnick, Tughans and Frank Cushnahan.  The question is how much was Frank Cushnahan to receive from the &pound;15 million fee and for what.  Given his history with NAMA, was he being paid for insider knowledge?  What was his relationship, if any, with Tughans?  Who was to benefit from the &pound;7 million in the Isle of Man bank account and to what end?  They are very serious questions and they need to be answered and investigated. <\/p>  <p>  The fact that we now have Project Arrow, when, as the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government said, we are in the middle of one of the largest humanitarian crises ever and are selling off large residential property portfolios in Ireland to vulture capitalism is crazy.

The rents increased from &euro;1,100 to &euro;1,600 when it was bought by a vulture capital fund.  Families have contacted us to ask us what we can do because they cannot afford the rents and will be forced out of their accommodation.<\/p><p>They cannot look for money from the State because they are working on low wages which have been cut over the period of austerity.  We are allowing this to happen by fire-selling these properties to vulture capitalists.

Deputy Michael McGrath is fully aware of the reasons NAMA was established.  If NAMA had not been established there would have been a fire sale of the loan books of some of the major banks, particularly Anglo Irish Bank, and they would have been sold off for whatever, whether to vulture capitalists or to individuals.  We must look at where we started.  At the time, a Dublin wit said we should have the inquiry first before we get going on NAMA, and this is what Deputy McGrath has called for, specifically on a particular sale, but perhaps there should be an inquiry into all of the sales if this is what he is seeking.  The Dublin wit was quite correct.<\/p>  <p>  As part of this sale we must look at the type of market that existed.  We are always dealing with the periphery.  As Deputy McGrath indicated in his speech, 50% of the portfolio consisted of Northern-Ireland-based properties.  A report by PricewaterhouseCoopers in 2013 stated that property prices in Northern Ireland could take a decade to recover and a report in 2014 said the exact same thing.  Did this mean NAMA was to hold on to these properties for the next ten years, given that most of them were based in Northern Ireland?  What would the Irish people have said about NAMA?  What would have been the role of the Government, which would be looking for funds to provide housing in the South?  What would have happened?  The Opposition would have been clamouring up and down asking why we were not selling the properties in the North of Ireland.  As I have indicated, the market up there was in a disturbed state.  The forecast growth for the North of Ireland at that period was the lowest in the UK.  It had the second-highest level of unemployment in the UK, particularly long-term unemployment, and there was negative equity throughout the private property sector.  I will not comment on who was, or is, in charge of Northern Ireland.  These stark figures relate to the management of the economy there.  Around that time, property prices continued to fall.  The objective of NAMA is to make a return for the Irish taxpayer.  Should it have held on, hoping that a price rise would come, or should it have sold in a falling market?  Sometimes it is important to sell.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Daly mentioned that the portfolio should have been broken up and sold off individually.  I am sure Deputy Wallace, who is from Wexford, has been to Enniscorthy mart, where he would have seen pens of sheep.  Usually a pen of sheep is a mixed bag, with good sheep, bad sheep and middling sheep.  The whole lot are sold and if they average out at &euro;50 that is good.  If they had been sold individually the top sheep would have made a lot more than this, but one would have been bringing home those at the bottom end in the trailer because one would not have a market for them.  The objective of selling them all together is to gather up the good and the bad.<\/p>  <p>  As has been highlighted, I would much prefer to have seen some of the assets being sold off individually.  I would also like to see NAMA, in its wisdom, selling off some assets locally in certain areas, because I fear if they are sold to venture capitalists the bad sheep in the pack will be left there to rot, waiting until something happens.  As I have indicated, in the North of Ireland, according to two reports by PricewaterhouseCoopers, the market was not going to rise for ten years.  Perhaps NAMA got the best deal available at the time, irrespective of whom it was going to sell to.  There are additional benefits.  People have commented that some of the choice properties in the portfolio were bought and rolled over within a short period of time, but the State made money on this also because there was a capital gain and, as everyone knows, capital gains are taxed at 33% and bring revenue to the State.<\/p>  <p>  While I welcome the debate, we must have an overall look at NAMA.  Some of it is not good.  People say it has become a secretive organisation.  In fairness, the Government has opened up the freedom of information legislation, not as far as some of us would like, but it certainly has done this.  We must look at the conditions in which this group of assets was sold.  They were sold into a falling market in a dysfunctional economy in an area in which property prices were not going to rise for ten years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102100059#GGG00300","speaker":"1053"},{"type":"speech","time":1445449500,"counter":872,"content":"<p>I was one of those who was not all that enthused about NAMA when it was first set up, but the situation that prevailed at the time was an emergency.  The chips were falling on a daily basis, values were depreciating at a rapid rate and instability became endemic.  It was determined by the then Government, rightly or wrongly, that this was the answer.  Suggestions have been made on whether NAMA is being administered as it should be.  To be fair to the chairman and those who operate NAMA, they are entitled to their say.  One should not presume that just because there appears to be a problem it is the problem we suspect it to be.  I strongly suggest to those concerned about this, as has been said by the Taoiseach in the House, that they go through the committee with ultimate responsibility for dealing with such matters, which is the Committee of Public Accounts, and make the case there and have answers given on what is causing concern.  This is the obvious way to go.  The Chairman of the committee is in the House and I know he is fully capable of dealing with the situation in the course of the committee's considerations.<\/p>  <p>  Everybody wants an inquiry into everything that happens, usually in the year in the run-up to an election.  I remember saying in the House that there were good grounds for a permanent sitting of the High Court to ensure everything was done in accordance with the wishes of everybody in the House, and it would take a permanent sitting of the High Court to do so.  This was approximately 20 years ago, and things have not changed in the meantime.  With regard to the allegations of wrongdoing by NAMA - which are denied, I must emphasise - the place to start is in the Committee of Public Accounts, where it can be dealt with, the issues can be examined and there is an opportunity for both sides to make their case, and let the axe fall where it will at that stage.  This is the obvious way to do it.<\/p>  <p>  NAMA is seen as, and can be, an answer to some of the housing problems that exist in this country, but I warn people against the supposition that the housing issues that have developed in this country have done so overnight.  They are almost 20 years in the making.  Houses cannot be built overnight.  People get really emotionally upset when they see homelessness, and understandably so, but now is not resolution time.  To resolve the housing issue one must start on time, and if one does so and addresses the issues one will not have the type of housing situation that has developed and become obvious to us all in recent years.<\/p>  <p>  Incidentally, I am on record as having raised this issue consistently in the House for approximately ten years.  I told the heads of certain well-known charitable institutions 15 years ago that we were coming towards a housing crisis the like of which we had never seen before, but nobody wanted to hear about it.  We had changed the system and there was no worthwhile local authority building programme.  It was shifted away and major responsibility was given to voluntary organisations, which have expertise in particular types of housing.<\/p><p>The Members opposite will know well that with sheltered housing and special needs, voluntary organisations are way ahead of anything the local authority could do and are well capable of dealing with the issues.  Unfortunately, it was decided to move in a different direction and give responsibility for the entire system to voluntary agencies, to the detriment of local authorities.  That was a sad mistake and we paid the price for it.  That goes to explain the housing problem that now exists, which is undoubtedly an absolute emergency.<\/p> <p> NAMA can help in some, though not all, areas.  We should not forget that some housing estates throughout the country have not been built in accordance with regulations, for want of a better description.  One or two of the estates in particular made headlines but they are not the only problem estates.  There will be others, and some will undoubtedly be held by NAMA as well.  There is no use in having substandard houses and pretending to hand them out as the State would have to spend more money on them for improvements.  That is not something we can afford and we should not do it in any case.  We would be far better off buying system-built houses to meet the needs of those who currently require homes.  That can be done quickly and effectively in an urgent process.<\/p> <p> The solution to the housing crisis is not NAMA alone, although the agency be used to defuse part of the problem and address some of the issues.  There is no use in us pretending it will solve it all.  With respect to NAMA's administration, in my time in this House over the years, Members usually did not make allegations about malfeasance or misfeasance in the House against people who worked in administration in the public arena.  Deputies would have been very slow to do it in the past but it has now, sadly, become common practice.  That is why people in the public arena have become reluctant to do anything; there seems to be a constant danger of being accused of something.  The people in question may or may not be guilty but until there is incontrovertible evidence to this end, we should not presume that anybody is guilty.  I hope that arising from all the confusion we have seen, there will be a clear and lucid explanation of what is required by and from NAMA so we can get some benefit in tackling the housing issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102100059#GGG00400","speaker":"957","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1445450100,"counter":874,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the motion this evening.  As we all know, NAMA was set up under the NAMA Act 2009, which was an answer at the time to the failed boom and bust economics delivered by the previous Government.  It was set up to take loans in Irish banks under much stress.  We were all aware of that and we are still dealing with those effects.  NAMA paid &euro;32 billion for &euro;74 billion in loans, with the object being to sell the loans and get a return to the State over ten years.  The legislation laid down very strict codes of practice for how NAMA would behave and to whom it would answer.  At the time, the agency only answered to the Minister for Finance, but as Deputy Anthony Lawlor mentioned, it is now a little more transparent, although not as much as we would like.  We appreciate the sensitivity and complexity of the information it handles because of commercial reasons.  The agency responds to the Committee of Public Accounts, and the Chairman of the committee is sitting opposite this evening.  Representatives of NAMA were in recently to answer questions about various projects mentioned across the House.  Deputy Wallace did not attend the meeting, although he was invited to participate.<\/p>  <p>  From what NAMA has stated about Project Eagle, there was an open bidding process and all the data was available in a data room.  Anybody interested in bidding was given access to the data room.  There was a granular format and Lazard, a very well-known loan sale adviser, advised NAMA on the sale.  Based on the evidence given on the day and some information I read in the public domain, it seems that there have been issues around various \"fixers\" - I use the term lightly because it is not a term with which I am familiar - and people being paid different sums of money, although that is outside the NAMA remit.  NAMA's job was to sell different portfolios of assets, package them and sell them for the best price available on the market before returning the money to the State.  In doing so, the agency sometimes packaged assets and portfolios of assets so it would not sell all the good options and leave the weak options behind.<\/p>  <p>  There is evidence that the Project Eagle sale was only 25% of the market value.  We cannot look at this on an average value because some of the portfolio was at 50% of market value and some was as low as 5%.  We all know Cerberus went on to sell it to the original developer; under NAMA legislation, it was not allowed to sell a portfolio of assets to the original holder of the loan.  Cerberus operates outside that legislation and can do as it wishes in selling the assets.  I was very happy that representatives of NAMA came before the Committee of Public Accounts.  The Chairman is sitting opposite and I am sure he will speak on this later.  Those witnesses were very open and gave a very detailed description of how this was put up for sale, how people made bids, various due diligence and a final bid.  It was valued by Lazard at the time at &euro;1.24 billion and it was sold for &euro;1.241 billion, which is what the market suggested as its worth.<\/p>  <p>  I fail to see why we would go any further in setting up a commission of investigation when the Comptroller and Auditor General has stated that the sales were openly marketed.  For its third special report on NAMA, published in May 2014, the Comptroller and Auditor General examined 144 individual transactions, with gross proceeds of &euro;1.1 billion, finding evidence of open marketing in all but 26 of the 144 sales, with fully explained reasons for the other 26 cases.  Some of them were sold back to the State or state bodies in Great Britain.<\/p>  <p>  I am more concerned that when the NAMA representatives were before the Committee of Public Accounts a couple of weeks ago, they stated that the agency asked various local authorities in Dublin to buy back some houses in order to provide social housing.  They offered 2,500 of these to various local authorities and only approximately 800 were taken up.  There is a job to be done in investigating why some of the houses that NAMA wanted to give to local authorities in various parts of Ireland have not been taken up.  Part of the remit of local authorities is to ensure they can provide adequate social housing.  I know we are all very concerned about this, and we have been for a number of years.  The issue came about because at a time when we needed 25,000 houses per year, we built 90,000 houses per year, and now we still need 25,000 houses per year but we have only been building 7,000 per year for the past number of years.  We must examine the issue.<\/p>  <p>  In County Cork alone, there are 130 ghost estates.  They are not all owned by NAMA, as some are owned by various receivers, etc.  We should consider why councils are not looking to buy these ghost estates, fitting them out and trying to house people when we know there is such a great need.  I appreciate there is a greater need in Dublin and other urban areas but if we cannot provide for those immediately, perhaps we should look at reassigning people who might be interested in moving from urban areas to more rural areas.  As somebody who lives in rural Ireland, I can vouch that it is a very nice way to live; it is not \"beyond the Pale\", so to speak.  There are options that should be examined and I call on NAMA to make some housing available.  The local authorities should certainly look to work with the agency to the greater benefit of all of us.  Local authorities should look to finish ghost estates as quickly as possible, as it would benefit all of our communities.<\/p><p><i>8 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion but I do not agree with it.  We should not be looking at an investigation into Project Eagle.  Resources are available to people who have issues and they should be looked at first.  There is the Committee of Public Accounts.  In addition, the Minister for Finance has made his Department available for any questions from the Northern Ireland advisory committee and the Department has sent it a great deal of information.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102100060#HHH00200","speaker":"988","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1445450700,"counter":876,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Michael McGrath for moving the motion.

It is the legacy of Fianna F&aacute;il's period in office and of the financial and property crisis this country had to endure.  Many of us in this House wish we did not have NAMA at all.  It is a stark reminder of a country that was in turmoil and in the midst of uncertainty.  That dark period has changed, despite what some of the Opposition might say and are articulating.  Thankfully we have left that country behind us.  If one speaks to developers and people in the construction industry, there are signs of recovery and that things are beginning to look up.  Undoubtedly, and I made the point on local radio on Monday, we need a construction industry that is incentivised.  We need land to be made available to construct both private and social housing.  The example I will give is in my city of Cork where there is One Albert Quay, the development in Mahon Gate and there are people like Michael O'Flynn willing to invest, along with many others.  That is what we need: people willing to become part of the recovery of our country.  I am sure Deputy McGrath will join me in hoping that with the development of the events centre in Cork, we will see a vibrancy returning to Cork city.<\/p>  <p>  This is about our country in terms of economic growth and how we are working as a Government to create new jobs.  Equally, because of this changed economic climate, we now have NAMA selling off its loans and, one hopes, winding down.  In saying that, I believe NAMA must do its work in a transparent and open way and must continue to show us, the Members of the House, that it operates in the wider interests of society and not just on behalf of a chosen few.  Deputy McGuinness, the Chair of the Committee of Public Accounts is present and NAMA must come before his committee to demonstrate this.  In his contribution to the debate, the Minister for Finance confirmed that as part of the upcoming review of NAMA under section 226 of the NAMA Act, the Comptroller and Auditor General will perform a value for money review of NAMA sales.  All of us in this House recognise the independence of that office and its importance in carrying out this review.  It will involve an evaluation of the sale of the Northern Ireland loan portfolio as a matter of priority.  I agree that the Comptroller and Auditor General is best positioned to review this transaction independently from a value for money perspective.<\/p>  <p>  I have heard the contributions of others in this House on the issue before us.  If Members of the House have information, I do not see anything wrong with them going to the Committee of Public Accounts and making their case there.  It is the appropriate forum.  I may at times disagree with the model Deputy McGuinness operates in the committee in terms of issues that are not under its remit but I respect and value his stewardship and his chairmanship of the committee.  He is an independent Chair who performs his role to the highest of standards.  I have no difficulty with any Member of the House going before him.  We all look forward to the Comptroller and Auditor General's preliminary report and I hope this will be published as soon as possible.  I believe this will provide certainty and clarity to what has become a very confused issue.  If one speaks to people from all sides and all parts of life, it is an issue that confuses people.  It appears that allegations of wrongdoing on one side of a transaction are being blamed on another party.  It is in the interests of everyone involved that we get this cleared up as soon as possible, that certainty is brought to the matter and that we have an outcome that is in the best interests of wider society.  I am confident and believe that an independent office such as the Comptroller and Auditor General is best placed to do this.<\/p>  <p>  As a Member of Seanad &Eacute;ireann and of this House, I have raised questions about NAMA, how it was set up, how it operates and the oversight of its functions.  As a politician elected to this House to represent the people, I believe we have a duty, an obligation and a right to ask questions of NAMA, but we are not the ones who should be investigating wrongdoing.  There are appropriate authorities for this and allegations must be referred to these groups.  A number of years ago, I raised with the Minister my concerns about NAMA's guidelines regarding the sale of assets.  Back then, the Minister confirmed to me that NAMA issued guidelines to be followed by its debtors and receivers when disposing of assets.  As part of these guidelines it is required that, wherever feasible, their sale should be on the open market and should be publicly advertised.  Since then, NAMA and the Comptroller and Auditor General have confirmed that wherever feasible this has been the case.  It is very important that this reassurance about how NAMA operates is put on the public record.  However, it is also important that NAMA, through its chair or chief executive, answers the questions asked of it.<\/p>  <p>  There have been calls for future sales by NAMA to stop pending clarification of the issues being discussed.  Given that there have been no specific allegations of wrongdoing against NAMA, this would seem a strange approach.  Project Arrow has been mentioned in this House.  This is a portfolio of loans that comprise approximately 300 debtor connections with par debt loans of &euro;6.2 billion secured on a large number of regionally located assets.  Its sale could significantly contribute to NAMA's debt redemption targets and its obligation to achieve the maximum return to the State.  I understand from my own research that this portfolio has been openly marketed and that the NAMA board is now assessing final bids which are in line with NAMA's pricing expectations.<\/p>  <p>  For most people, what I have just said might seem abstract and stopping the sale might seem to be inconsequential.  Where I come from in Cork city, however, on Hawkes Road in Bishopstown just off the Curraheen Road, I have been in contact with the receivers about properties that have not been developed and are eyesores for local communities.  I am aware of one property at Hawkes Road in Bishopstown that forms part of the Project Arrow portfolio.  It is an absolute disgrace and an embarrassment that NAMA has not moved on the site and there has been no action on it.  Neighbours have been left to look at a site that is derelict and that is ripe for development.  It would enhance an area of the city that is populated with private housing and would make an ideal location for any type of activity, whether residential care or private housing development.  It beggars belief that this project in this location has not yet been developed.  I will use this Chamber to call on NAMA to expedite this project as a matter of urgency.  It can help in the alleviation of the housing needs in the city of Cork.  It can provide social or private housing.  It could be an ideal location for care of the elderly in a residential setting, something we spoke about last week in the Private Members' motion,.  As a result of what has happened, no plan or strategy has been put in place to deal with the property.  If we are not going to sell it or do anything with it, funding is required to erect new hoardings in order that neighbours do not have to endure the eyesore and in order that we can address the issue of vermin in the site.  I met neighbours and residents in that area who are unhappy, to put it mildly.  It is an example of a site, like many throughout the country, that we need to see developed.  We are all aware of unused projects and properties that can be put to use.<\/p><p>I call on NAMA to look critically at how it can, as the Minister stated in the budget last week, move on sites that can be developed and look towards solving issues of housing need, particularly with regard to the care of the elderly.<\/p> <p> The oversight by the Comptroller and Auditor General has shown that value was achieved.  I look forward to his report, but in the meantime, NAMA must continue to fulfil its duty to society.  Any allegations of wrongdoing should be investigated by the appropriate authority, but should not be used for political grandstanding, which is what is happening in some cases.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102100061#JJJ00400","speaker":"989","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1445451300,"counter":880,"content":"<p>I wish to share time with Deputies Calleary and Kelleher.<\/p>  <p>  In response to Deputy Buttimer, I do not determine the style of the Committee of Public Accounts.  The members of that committee work diligently and to their own style.  They raise their own set of questions and they have worked well together as a team with the Comptroller and Auditor General.  In this case, I have complete confidence in the Comptroller and Auditor General and in the members to question NAMA and get the necessary details to fill in the gaps of information that exist in the public domain regarding the sale of Project Eagle.  As I stated in this House previously - and I have spoken directly to Deputy Wallace - it would be helpful if he came forward and gave evidence to the committee so that all of what he has said here can then be investigated at the Committee of Public Accounts and, indeed, can be helpful to the Comptroller and Auditor General as he sets about creating a special report into NAMA and particularly Project Eagle.<\/p>  <p>  What concerns me about the work of the Committee of Public Accounts is that this issue involves another jurisdiction, and maybe the investigation being suggested tonight would lead us to a better understanding and better co-operation because of the fact that there are two different jurisdictions.  It is complicated, too, by the fact that NAMA, for some reason, has decided not to send representatives to attend the hearings in Northern Ireland.  That is regrettable.  It has been stated directly to NAMA by some members of the Committee of Public Accounts that it should attend.  There are questions to be answered and there is information it has that might be useful in co-operating with the inquiry in Northern Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  Let us look at the sale of Project Eagle.  Sixty-eight percent of that property was in Northern Ireland, 18% in southern Ireland, 12% in Great Britain and 2% elsewhere.  Our interest is in what the taxpayer has received at the end of all of this, and some of the information that Members have put on the public record this evening is simply incorrect.  The par value of those loans - that is, what the borrowers owed NAMA at one time - was &euro;5.7 billion.  NAMA paid the banks &euro;2.2 billion, and the remaining &euro;3.5 billion, 61% of the par value, was the discount on the price paid by NAMA.  When they went on through the process and sold the assets, the loss in general, as NAMA reported to the Committee of Public Accounts, was somewhere in the region of &euro;200 million to &euro;250 million.  In fact, the Comptroller and Auditor General has stated that the loss on the sale, even after all the haircuts on the way down to the final sale, was &euro;783 million.<\/p>  <p>  I have said to NAMA that one of its biggest problems is the arrogance that it displays when answering any question, and the fact that it appears to deliberately delay answering some of the questions until a particular date is past, at which time the answer is of no value to anyone because the horse has bolted.  That is the problem with NAMA.  In this particular case, the same thing happened.<\/p>  <p>  One of the questions that was raised was about the sale of the property.  I hold that NAMA should not have gone ahead with the sale of the property.  Once PIMCO gave it the information that questions had been raised, with NAMA's understanding of Northern Ireland politics and what was going on, it should have withdrawn from the process.<\/p>  <p>  There are issues such as the memorandum of understanding, whereby the personal guarantees were to be written off and forgotten about, and that was being suggested from the Northern Ireland Assembly offices.  Why was that going on?  Why was there such interference that someone would feel confident enough within the political system of Northern Ireland to say to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, that that was what should happen - freeing all those who had the loans of personal guarantees?  We all would like that.<\/p>  <p>  Earlier it was stated here that the property market in the North was more or less on the floor and was not going anywhere.  At a meeting of the Northern Ireland advisory committee held on 7 October 2013, which was attended by the chairman and other representatives from NAMA, NAMA was told that, as with Dublin, there was a demand for, and shortage of, grade A office space in Belfast city and the shortage presented a corollary need for landlords to refurbish existing stock.  It was also told that rent and yield forecasts across the commercial property sector were predominantly stabilising or strengthening.  That is what NAMA was told before the sale of Project Eagle.  That, alongside the fixer's fee and how this money ended up in another account, was notified to them, and there were questions about NAMA's representative in Northern Ireland, Frank Cushnahan.  At that stage, when all of these questions were being asked, and when it was dealing with a difficult market, politically and otherwise, NAMA should have withdrawn.<\/p>  <p>  We have a situation in which accusations and allegations are being made in Northern Ireland, but the problem is that we do not have access to that.  We have the Deputy First Minister, Martin McGuinness MLA, asking to attend the Committee of Public Accounts because he wants to clarify some issues that were raised by the Minister for Finance about his activities.  There is a need for a single overarching body to investigate thoroughly what happened in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to Project Jewel, the questions that have been raised about that particular property portfolio, dating back to a contract entered into by the local authority in Dublin in 2004, have not been answered.  In fact, some of the councillors will tell you that they know nothing about this contract.  If Members have any pride in our history, which they talk about in this House, and if the Members, including the Taoiseach, who have gone to visit that site in Moore Lane and Moore Street understand the case being made by the representatives of the families of those who fought in 1916, they would ensure that the site in its entirety, as a battlefield, was protected.  When we were visiting that site only yesterday, the number of people on guided tours was impressive, despite the fact that the area has not much to offer except dated plaques on walls.  The history they are hearing about, and in which they are interested, is turning into euros for the economy.  Therefore, in terms of its future development, there is an absolute need for that sale to be halted until such time as clarification is received for those who have asked questions in relation to the submission made at the last PAC meeting, which I gave to NAMA and which it has not yet answered.  These are simple questions.  Does NAMA agree with the National Museum's analysis of that battlefield?  Did NAMA itself have the site assessed?  What has been the expenditure to date in terms of the planning application by Chartered Land on the historic site?  Has the ownership of the national monument at Nos. 14 to 17 Moore Street been transferred to the State?  I understand that it has, but then there are the 1916 buildings that have been identified, and that are part of the development, which now need to be saved.  Lastly, there is the question of the &euro;5 million set aside by NAMA for that site and how it was to be spent.  What is the status of that?  When those simple questions are asked and when representatives of a project such as Project Jewel make a legitimate attempt to engage with NAMA and get nowhere, that is what causes suspicion.  It is that inaction that causes them to ask the questions that are being asked.<\/p>  <p>  The same is being applied in a much more commercial way to this property portfolio in Northern Ireland, and it is not good enough that we would just debate it here, sign it off and state that it is merely something that the Opposition is doing.<\/p><p>It is not.  These questions are being asked of all of us in the House and there is a concern and a suspicion that must be dealt with.  There are questions in the public domain that deserve to be answered and if this debate does anything, it should draw attention to Project Jewel and Project Eagle.  The Minister should intervene immediately, stop what is happening with Project Jewel and ensure the appropriate forum is put in place so all the questions being asked can be answered and dealt with comprehensively.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102100062#KKK00200","speaker":"965","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1445451900,"counter":882,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Michael McGrath for giving us the opportunity to raise this issue and pay tribute to Deputy Wallace for having the courage to stand up and throw the ball into play on the very first occasion.  The manner in which he, and anyone who raises questions around the issue, have been treated clearly demonstrates that something is afoot.  The manner in which people are running for cover and declining to answer questions also demonstrates that something is afoot.  All we are seeking is answers and a mechanism, a commission of inquiry, that will allow people to give evidence in a protected manner so we can find the answers.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy McGuinness has put the figure for the loss on this portion alone at &euro;783 million.  It is a huge amount of money.  It is the amount of money that will go into the health service between now and the end of the year.  It could do so much.  Even if one accepted the Government&rsquo;s figures, which are considerably less but still in the hundreds of millions of euro, it is taxpayers' money that the State could do with.  The Oireachtas has a duty to ask questions and get answers, which we are not getting.  The fact that another jurisdiction is involved is being used to muddy the process.  However, a Government agency with responsibility to raise capital for the State has questions to answer.  If we could establish cross-Border inquiries before, such as the Smithwick tribunal and others, surely we can do it in this case to get evidence from all sides.<\/p>  <p>  There are so many questions which Deputies have gone through.  Since Cerberus acquired the portfolio, it has collected &euro;100 million in developer loans and has used the structure for its Irish-registered companies.  On a combined turnover of all its various operations of &euro;224 million last year, it paid &euro;10,320 in tax.  This is why our corporation tax regime has a bad name.  Our corporate tax regime exists to support very good employment and very good employees; the best in the world.  However, when companies such as this use it in this manner, it explains why we must defend our regime all over the world and why the State is getting such a bad reputation.<\/p>  <p>  NAMA initially identified 6,500 properties in its portfolio that it believed would be suitable for social housing and it engaged with the various local authorities.  At the end of September, the figure of 6,500 had been reduced.  More than 4,000 were deemed to be no longer under consideration, 1,500 had been sold before they had the chance to be used for social housing and 2,469 were deemed unsuitable or no tenants were found for them.  NAMA has finalised only 1,600 residential properties for delivery to social housing, even though tonight 1,500 children are in emergency accommodation.  A body that once prided itself on being described as the biggest property developer in Europe has a social responsibility to provide housing, given that it has a stock available to it.  It has a responsibility to put roofs over the heads of people who are otherwise in hotels or who may not even have a roof over their heads but are sleeping on the streets of this city and elsewhere tonight.  A body that sees fit to treat the weakest in our community in this manner needs to answer questions.<\/p>  <p>  The difficulty in asking questions is the walls that go up when one tries to get information.  While NAMA has fulfilled its mandate in terms of profit and return to the State, there are questions to be asked as to how it did so and whether the profit is much lower than it could have been had other avenues been adopted.  This is all we need.  We just need questions to be answered and we need everybody involved to ask questions.  As late as last week, the other bidder, PIMCO, was still raising questions about its role and raising objections to NAMA's account that PIMCO withdrew its bid in Project Eagle.  Last week, its chief legal officer wrote to the Northern Ireland Assembly saying PIMCO voluntarily told NAMA of the fee deal and left the process.  He stated that the decision demonstrated, \"the emphasis we place on conduct of our business, the high standards we expect of counterparties and the importance we place on protecting our reputation\".  This is a statement of no confidence in the manner in which NAMA handled this portfolio sale.  Although it is from an underbidder, it must be dealt with.  This is a company of international spread and if this is the reputation NAMA has, what reputation does Ireland Inc. have?<\/p>  <p>  Many Deputies have raised local issues and concerns around NAMA.  Although when local concerns are brought to NAMA, it engages, it drops the bigger balls in terms of public perception of it.  I have raised an issue that is very live to us, namely, Westport House.  Westport House, a strategic tourism attraction and an economic part of County Mayo, is involved in a current portfolio sale.  Westport House is well known to the Acting Chairman, Deputy Durkan.  Some 162,000 people visited it in 2014 resulting in &euro;1.7 million in direct expenditure back to the Exchequer, which is funding NAMA.  It employs 47 full-time staff.  There is a case to be made for Westport House to be returned to the ownership of the State, acknowledging the major contribution the Browne family has made in its time.  If Killarney can have Muckross House, which is in the remit of the Minister of State, Deputy Harris, surely there is an economic argument to be made for similar treatment to be given to Westport House.  Mayo County Council has put forward a case for buying it out of the process.  There is no sense in this national asset being allowed to go to some unknown entity that sees itself as unanswerable to this Parliament in the same way that many NAMA properties have gone to other organisations.<\/p>  <p>  We cannot let this drag into the next D&aacute;il.  We must bring an end to the swirl of allegations that surround NAMA.  The Government can do this by establishing a commission of inquiry.  Why is the Government so reluctant to do it?  Why is the Government unwilling to deal with the allegations and provide a forum to deal with them?  We can only surmise that there must be something to hide and the Government does not want to shine a light on the truth.  If there is nothing to hide, the Government should proceed with the investigation, give it the all clear and move on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102100063#LLL00200","speaker":"1071"},{"type":"speech","time":1445451900,"counter":883,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the issue, which has been raised a number of times in the D&aacute;il.  I congratulate Deputy Michael McGrath on consistently pursuing it.  At stake here is the integrity of the State.  The integrity of the State is being called into question.  We have consistently been trying to highlight the need for an independent investigation established by the Houses of the Oireachtas, which established NAMA, to ensure the integrity of NAMA and the sales process but, more importantly, the integrity of the State, is vindicated.  The idea that we can sit on our hands and pretend that there is not, at least, concern regarding the disposal of Project Eagle assets in Northern Ireland is untenable.  The idea that &pound;7 million could be in a bank account in the Isle of Man as a fixer's fee and that the vendor is not overly concerned does not stack up.  It does not have credibility.<\/p>  <p>  If we are serious about insisting on the highest standards in the State and its agencies, a commission of investigation is essential to ensure there is a full investigation with sweeping powers of access to documentation which can ensure the sales process for Project Eagle was not compromised, to say the very least.  I know no other situation in which a fixer's fee is found in a bank account destined for people who were involved at the periphery in putting together organisations that were expressing an interest in assets owned by NAMA in Northern Ireland.<\/p><p>Some 850 properties from approximately 55 borrowers were bundled together.  This bundle would have had a face value of approximately &euro;5 billion.  By the time discounts and everything flowing from them were taken into account, NAMA was able to purchase the bundle for &euro;2 billion.  It ended up selling it for approximately &euro;1.6 billion.  By any stretch of the imagination, very few people, entities or organisations would have the capacity or capability to bid for such a large portfolio.  I am gravely concerned because in my view, leaving aside the discovery of &pound;7 million in a bank account in the Isle of Man, this certainly calls into question the integrity of the process.  It is not acceptable to me that we would lump the whole lot into a single portfolio and expect that bidders would come from all over to purchase it.  NAMA, which has a bit of form in this regard, would applaud itself.  Indeed, the Government parties would applaud it even though they initially opposed it.  When we were establishing NAMA, the current T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Burton, was apoplectic with rage.  She nearly fell over the barriers in here from time to time.  She said during the campaign that if she was elected and put in a position of responsibility, she would put manners on NAMA by disbanding it.  I suggest that the Minister of State and his colleagues have developed Stockholm syndrome.  They have been captured.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102100063#LLL00300","speaker":"983","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1445452500,"counter":885,"content":"<p>The Deputy's party set it up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102100064#MMM00200","speaker":"1106"},{"type":"speech","time":1445452500,"counter":886,"content":"<p>They are afraid to initiate an investigation for fear that something may be unearthed.  The corollary of the point I am making is that if there is no concern, why would the Government be afraid to initiate some form of independent investigation?  I ask the Minister of State to bear in mind that investigations are already going on.  The Stormont finance committee, the UK National Crime Agency and authorities in the United States are investigating these matters.  Even though NAMA was established by the D&aacute;il, no concern is being expressed by the Government here.  There is a pretence that everything is fine, but I assure the Minister of State that everything is not fine.  The Government needs to accept that it has a responsibility in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister for Finance is passing this off by saying that NAMA is independent.  While I accept that NAMA is independent in terms of how it conducts its affairs on a daily basis, I remind the House that section 14 of the legislation under which NAMA was established clearly and explicitly gives the Minister for Finance the power to direct NAMA in exceptional circumstances.  I thought the discovery of a fixers' fee of &pound;7 million in a bank account somewhere would qualify as an exceptional circumstance.  Equally, I would have thought that the bundling of 850 properties in Northern Ireland and elsewhere as a single portfolio would surely limit the capital value of those assets.  How many people or entities were capable of bidding for this portfolio?  We ended up with just three bidders.  PIMCO pulled out, or was instructed to pull out.  We then had two bidders and Cerberus ended up as the preferred bidder.  With all due respect, having three people expressing interest in something and ending up with one of them purchasing it does not constitute a very competitive tendering process, to say the least.  The bundling was too large.  It should have been subdivided to include more entities that would have had the capability of raising the number of millions of euro needed to purchase part of the portfolio.<\/p>  <p>  It is madness that NAMA is in such a hurry to commit hara-kiri and wind itself up in advance of the general election to show that it is creating profit.  Its motivation is to be seen to finish out as quickly as possible.  I am in no hurry for NAMA to wind up.  Equally, I do not want it to stay around forever.  I want it to capitalise the best value for taxpayers.  That does not simply involve NAMA showing a profit on the loans it is disposing of, especially given that it purchased them at a huge discount.  If it makes a profit, that does not mean the taxpayer is off the hook for the gaping holes that were left in balance sheets elsewhere.  NAMA, in its headlong rush to wind itself up, is applauding itself and saying it has made a profit.  It made a profit on something that was already discounted.  I suggest that if the Project Eagle assets had been subdivided into smaller groupings, more entities would have been interested in portions of it.  Any suggestion to the contrary is unacceptable to me.  When we talk about value for money for the taxpayer and about NAMA disposing of assets and realising their value, we must always ensure that integrity is at the heart of the decisions that are made.  Surely concern must be raised at some level on foot of the allegations made by Deputy Wallace and subsequently by others.<\/p>  <p>  It seems that NAMA, which was established in this House, is not co-operating with an investigation into its sales process that is taking place elsewhere - I refer to what is happening in Northern Ireland before the Stormont finance committee and the UK National Crime Agency - because the authorities here in the Republic have decided to wash their hands of the need to see whether the sales process or the purchasing process was compromised.  Either way, it is incumbent on us here to insist that we delve into the murky area that seems to have been exposed by the allegations that have been made.  If the Minister of State has time, he should tell the Minister for Finance to read section 14 of the NAMA Act, which gives the Minister the power to deal with this issue rather than washing his hands of it.  He can instruct NAMA to co-operate with the investigations in Northern Ireland.  Mr. Daly and Mr. McDonagh could get on a train heading north and co-operate, just as they have appeared before the Committee of Public Accounts.  We need to state honestly that a commission of investigation with substantial powers of inquiry and investigation is required to get to the heart of the matter.  That would deal with the idea that it is acceptable to hide behind commercial sensitivity.  I refer to the manner in which those who appear before the Committee of Public Accounts on behalf of NAMA start by saying they cannot discuss this issue because it is commercially sensitive.  A commission of investigation could hear evidence in private to overcome the issue of commercial sensitivity and could issue findings on the question of whether this purchasing process was compromised.<\/p>  <p>  The motion before the House should be taken on board and embraced.  The Government should not try to hide behind the falsehood that the Minister does not have the power to instruct NAMA to co-operate with investigations in the North.  More importantly from our perspective here, we should set up a commission of investigation to ensure NAMA has no option other than to co-operate with that commission and with other agencies inside and outside this State.  We should be upfront about this issue.  We cannot ignore the possibility that the taxpayer could be left on the hook at the end of the day because this process was not as robust as NAMA said it was, or as the Government thinks it may have been.  We simply do not know whether that is the case.  A proper commission of investigation may or may not find out, but at least we will know we did our duty in this Chamber to ensure the integrity of the process was upheld.  During the debate on the establishment of NAMA, those who told us that it was a bailout for builders and bankers said that if they were elected, they would put manners on NAMA.  Some of them stood next to posters saying that they would get rid of NAMA.  The T&aacute;naiste was photographed next to posters suggesting that NAMA would be disbanded.  What has happened subsequently?  Nothing.  Not one dot or comma has been removed from the NAMA Act.  No effort has been made by this Government to make NAMA more accountable.  It is pretending that section 14 of the NAMA Act, which is quite explicit, does not exist.  The Minister for Finance waltzed into this House and said he is unable to instruct NAMA, even though it is in the Act that he can.  More importantly, he should instruct NAMA.<\/p><p>If there is not a section already in the Act, the Minister should introduce an amendment to ensure that he can instruct NAMA because this deserves scrutiny.  We must ensure that when assets that are owned by the taxpayers of this country are sold, the integrity of that sales process cannot be called into question.  The Government must do the honest thing and set up a commission of investigation that has the power to investigate without being inhibited by commercial sensitivities and client confidentiality.  The people deserve to know that when assets are being disposed of on their behalf, the sales process is not compromised and that they are getting full value for money.  I commend the motion and urge Government Members to read the Act and accept that they have the power to investigate or if they do not, that they have the moral responsibility and duty to change the law and to insist that an investigation is carried out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102100064#MMM00300","speaker":"983","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1445453100,"counter":888,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputies for their contributions.  It has been helpful to have this debate because very serious allegations have been made about the activities on the purchaser side of this sale.  It is unfortunate that a number of Deputies have decided to conflate the purchaser side with the NAMA side.  A number of investigations are under way regarding these allegations as the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, outlined last night.<\/p><p>This debate has also provided an opportunity to set out the factual position in relation to the sales process conducted by NAMA.  Let me reiterate the comments made by the Minister, Deputy Noonan, last night regarding the role of NAMA and the oversight of the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Committee of Public Accounts.  In accordance with section 10 of the NAMA Act, NAMA is obliged to operate in a commercial manner and to achieve expeditiously the best financial return for the taxpayer.  It is a function of NAMA, pursuant to section 11 (1)(<i>d<\/i>)(i) to dispose of loans or portfolios of loans in the market for the best achievable price.  It is by design that NAMA is held accountable to these objectives by the Oireachtas through the Committee of Public Accounts and the Comptroller and Auditor General, which oversee the work of NAMA.<\/p><p>I welcome that as part of its upcoming third triennial review of NAMA under section 226 of the NAMA Act, the Comptroller and Auditor General will perform a value for money review of NAMA sales and will evaluate the sale of the Northern Ireland loan portfolio as a matter of priority.  The Comptroller and Auditor General is best positioned to independently review this transaction from a value for money perspective.  Deputies have spoken about independence and the Comptroller and Auditor General is an independent, constitutional office.  I would rather not play the role of Comptroller and Auditor General because I respect the independence of that office, which is a constitutional office, and I do not understand why others cannot do likewise.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102100065#NNN00200","speaker":"1106"},{"type":"speech","time":1445453100,"counter":889,"content":"<p>The Minister of State is being misleading.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102100065#NNN00300","speaker":"983"},{"type":"speech","time":1445453100,"counter":890,"content":"<p>Deputies should let the Comptroller and Auditor General carry out his review and show their trust and faith in the independence and the competence of his office.

I incorrectly said in various media that he had not done so but I acknowledge that he has and correct myself in that regard.

In Ireland today, many families and citizens are facing high mortgage arrears, negative equity and paying excessive interest on their variable rate mortgages.  Some struggle on while others face losing their homes, but many are looking at how NAMA disposes of land.  Recently in my constituency of Longford Westmeath, NAMA disposed of 400 acres of prime agricultural land but never once was this sale advertised locally or nationally.  Still, the sale managed to go through and we do not know how many people competed for that land.  Does that seem right and proper?  No, it certainly does not.  Many people are looking now, thanks to Deputy Wallace and my own party leader, who have pursed this in recent weeks, at how Project Eagle properties were disposed of and are absolutely amazed.  A portfolio of loans with a face value of &euro;5.4 billion, for which NAMA only paid &euro;2 billion, as the Minister of State rightly pointed out, was subsequently sold for &euro;1.6 billion, which is a savage write down by any stretch of the imagination.  We have learned about the legal advisers who were advising PIMCO, a company which was ruled out of order because of its fee structure under which large sums of money would be paid to former NAMA advisers.  We also learned that &pound;7 million sterling was found in an offshore account which was in some way related to NAMA and Project Eagle assets.  It has subsequently been revealed that commercial property prices across a large part of Project Eagle loans in Belfast soared by up to 20% since the NAMA deal was signed off.  Across the broader Northern commercial property market, growth has been recorded of somewhere in the region of 11% in 2014.<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach famously said in this Chamber that Paddy wants to know.<\/p><p>Paddy wants to know that NAMA, which was established to acquire distressed borrowings and release the assets underpinning them to a recovering market, is obtaining the best value for taxpayers' investment.  At the behest of the Minister, in excess of 800 properties are being lumped together in a single portfolio that is of such a high value that it restricts the number of potential bidders, thereby reducing competition and diminishing the value that can be achieved in the sale.<\/p> <p> The Fianna F&aacute;il Party has been criticised by many back bench Government party Deputies for raising this issue.  It seems we should have acted instead as cheerleaders for last week's budget.  Deputies have a duty and obligation to those who elected them to ensure taxpayers' money is well spent.  Large numbers of senior citizens have been waiting for more than two years for knee and hip replacement operations and cataract removal procedures while others must wait for months on end to secure personal home help hours.  Only this week, a woman chained herself to the gates outside the Department of Education and Skills in an effort to secure a home tuition grant for her autistic son that would enable him to avail of early education services.<\/p> <p> It is right and proper to remove all doubt and ambiguity surrounding the Project Eagle sale.  A full, independent commission of investigation that can investigate matters on both sides of the Border, North and South, is needed to determine whether everything was done above board and value for money was achieved on behalf of Paddy the taxpayer, the person who ultimately picks up the tab.  A commission of investigation is the only way to achieve this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102100065#NNN02000","speaker":"1065","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1445453700,"counter":908,"content":"<p>I join my colleagues in commending Deputy Michael McGrath on tabling the motion and shining a spotlight on this matter.  The allegations that have been made required a proper airing and debate in the House as they have not been adequately debated in the cold light of day since they were made.  Unfortunately, taxpayers have lost a great deal as a result of the recession and the wallop taken by the banks.  The State had to intervene to finance the banks and underwrite the hit that was taken when the National Asset Management Agency acquired loans from the banks.  It is exceptionally unfortunate that this was followed by another mistake in terms of the manner in which NAMA has been rolling out the sale of its loans.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State asked us all to stand back and have faith in the Comptroller and Auditor General who, according to the text of the Government amendment, has been asked to carry out a value for money review of the various NAMA sales transactions.  The Project Eagle sale is to be the first of these value for money reviews.  The Government has only now decided to request the Comptroller and Auditor General to perform this task.  The Minister for Finance has been pressing NAMA to proceed promptly with the sale of various tranches of its loan book with a view to completing its work.  The Minister of State asked the House to have confidence in the expertise of the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General to assess the Project Eagle portfolio and determine whether the sale constituted value for money.  While the Comptroller and Auditor General has an exceptional track record in assessing the way in which public money is spent, his office does not have expertise in the area in which it is being asked to work.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the scale of the work being done by the National Asset Management Agency, the loans transferred to NAMA had a face value of &euro;68 billion.  Including rolled up interest of &euro;9 billion, the overall figure amounted to &euro;77 billion or more than 1.5 times the annual budget of the State in recent years.  When one considers the degree of oversight, assessment and review applied to these loans of &euro;77 billion, even if NAMA paid much less than that figure for them, it bears no resemblance to the degree of oversight the Oireachtas exercises in respect of the annual budget which is teased out in committees, this Chamber and with various oversight bodies.  NAMA was established for a specific purpose and, as such, did not have a track record.  It was given a task, independent of significant Oireachtas oversight, of bundling up loans and selling them on to investors.  Many of these loans were sold in massive bundles, of which Project Eagle was the largest, which only very significant international investors were in a position to purchase.  Given that the only reason for buying these loans would be to sell them on subsequently, it is hardly a surprise that a number of agents engaged in negotiations to identify which parties might be interested in purchasing them.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Troy noted that the value of commercial property in the Belfast region alone has increased by 20% in the past year.  Despite selling on the loans in large bundles, the middle men, international investors and whoever else they may have engaged are making a killing while taxpayers here are having to pick up the tab by paying the difference between the face value and sale value of the loans.<\/p>  <p>  It is long past time the Government adopted a straightforward approach and established a thorough investigation into Project Eagle.  Too many question marks surround the project and the Government has been running and hiding and ducking and diving on the issue for too long.  I commend the motion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102100066#OOO00200","speaker":"999"},{"type":"speech","time":1445453700,"counter":909,"content":"<p>I thank all Deputies who spoke in this debate.  Having listened very carefully to all the contributions, I more convinced than ever that a full commission of investigation into Project Eagle is required.  The Minister of State and the Minister consistently made the point that no allegations of wrongdoing have been made against the National Asset Management Agency.  They also asked why my party is calling for an investigation into NAMA.  We are not calling for an investigation into NAMA but into a transaction to which NAMA was a key party, namely, Project Eagle.  That is the fundamental difference.<\/p>  <p>  I commend the Committee of Public Accounts on the work it is doing under the leadership of Deputy John McGuinness.  The committee cannot get to the bottom of this issue because it can only go so far.  A full statutory commission of investigation with extensive powers is required.  This issue will run and run because the underbidders in the Project Eagle sale may well take legal action.  Criminal investigations are under way in Northern Ireland.  If issues are identified that need to be dealt with, the House and the Government will regret not taking the opportunity to hold a full commission of investigation.  The Government is hiding behind the Comptroller and Auditor General's value for money review of Project Eagle, the purpose of which is to ascertain whether the transaction delivered value for money.  That is not the full picture, however, because the questions go far beyond value for money.  Questions also arise regarding the entire governance arrangements in place for the transaction, the integrity of the transaction, the appropriateness of the relationships between the people involved in it and the decision-making process.  It is not only about value for money or the sale of loans for a fraction of their book value of more than &euro;5 billion.  These are not the issues.  The issue is the way in which the transaction was conducted and the decision-making process involved.<\/p><p><i>9 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p>I listened to the Minister, Deputy Noonan, say last night that he was determined that politicians would not be involved in decisions around and the operations of NAMA.  Politicians were crawling all over this transaction and Project Eagle.  There were phone calls, meetings and letters, particularly in Northern Ireland.  That is very clear.  The suggestion that politicians had no involvement whatsoever is utter nonsense.  It is not supported by the facts.  In his evidence to the Stormont finance committee, the First Minister, Peter Robinson, said that he attended a meeting with PIMCO in May 2013 which he believes was organised by either Mr. Cushnahan or Mr. Coulter.  Certainly, Mr. Cushnahan attended that meeting in May 2013 while still a member of the Northern Ireland advisory board to NAMA.  He remained a member of the board for a further six months.  NAMA says it knew nothing about that meeting.  Subsequently, it emerged from PIMCO that Mr. Cushnahan was seeking a &pound;5 million success fee if that company was successful in purchasing Project Eagle.  Does that not set the alarm bells ringing in the minds of Government Deputies and Ministers that this issue warrants much greater investigation than currently has happened?  The PAC will not be able to deal with it and the remit of the Comptroller and Auditor General is too narrow in respect of the full breadth of the issue.<\/p> <p> NAMA should attend the inquiry in Stormont if it has nothing to hide.  It would be in a purely voluntary capacity and that is acknowledged.  Why will it not go, take questions from the MLAs there and answer them to the best of its ability?  We are talking about an all-island economy and co-operation between North and South.  There is a perfect opportunity for that to be demonstrated by NAMA co-operating with the inquiry.  We have a situation where we know the Stormont Executive was involved in drafting a memorandum of understanding, as Deputy John McGuinness said, which would involve releasing the debtors involved in Project Eagle from any personal guarantees.  The notion that the transaction was beyond politics, entirely independent and without inappropriate involvement is something I do not accept.  We will regret the day that we vote down the motion and fail to set up a commission of investigation into Project Eagle.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102100066#OOO00300","speaker":"993","continuing":true},{"type":"vote","time":1445454300,"counter":911,"content":"<p>Amendment put:<\/p><p>The D\u00e1il divided: T\u00e1, 60; N\u00edl, 39.<\/p><br\/><p>Tellers: T\u00e1, Deputies Joe Carey and Emmet Stagg; N\u00edl, Deputies Michael McGrath and Dara Calleary.<\/p><p>Amendment declared carried.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102100067#PPP00200","aye":["974","1016","1079","989","1029","1042","975","1092","988","1041","1093","1087","1099","986","994","1091","1046","968","1103","957","1078","1014","1009","1068","951","1051","1076","995","1106","1089","949","1012","1110","1053","990","982","1023","996","997","1082","1004","1070","1034","1056","1045","955","1060","1058","1069","1073","971","1081","966","1035","1013","1048","961","978","1010","1024"],"nay":["1066","1190","1071","1193","1057","1083","1101","1192","959","976","1022","1047","1198","1100","1050","1094","960","1188","983","962","998","999","1090","993","965","981","1183","987","1202","969","1028","984","1005","1001","1203","970","1102","1065","956"]},{"type":"vote","time":1445454300,"counter":912,"content":"<p>Question put: \"That the motion as amended be agreed to.\"<\/p><p>The D\u00e1il divided: T\u00e1, 60; N\u00edl, 40.<\/p><br\/><p>Tellers: T\u00e1, Deputies Joe Carey and Emmet Stagg; N\u00edl, Deputies Michael McGrath and Dara Calleary.<\/p><p>Question declared carried.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102100067#PPP00300","aye":["974","1016","1079","989","1029","1042","975","1092","988","1041","1093","1087","1099","1006","986","994","1091","1046","968","1103","957","1078","1014","1009","1068","951","1051","1076","995","1106","1089","949","1012","1110","1053","990","982","1023","996","997","1082","1004","1070","1034","1056","1045","955","1060","1058","1069","1073","971","1081","966","1013","1048","961","978","1010","1024"],"nay":["1066","1199","1190","1071","1193","1057","1083","1101","1192","959","976","1022","1047","1198","1100","1050","1094","960","1188","983","962","998","999","1090","993","965","981","1183","987","1202","969","1028","984","1005","1001","1203","970","1102","1065","956"]},{"type":"unspoken","time":1445454300,"counter":913,"content":"<p>The D&aacute;il adjourned at at 9.20 p.m. until 9.30 a.m. on Thursday, 22 October 2015.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
