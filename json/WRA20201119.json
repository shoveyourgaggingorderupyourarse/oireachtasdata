This additional funding is supporting a range of capital investments which will enhance the agency's capacity to further support the development of enterprise and is currently creating in the region of 40-50 new construction jobs throughout the Gaeltacht. It is expected that this additional \u00a0investment will ultimately support the creation of 320 new longer-term jobs in client-companies of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta. <\/p>  <p>It is important to note also that Gaeltacht enterprises also\u00a0have access to the broad range of targeted national and sectorial measures put in place by Government since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and in preparation for Brexit.

Local radio also plays an important role in bringing communities together, strengthening their bonds of solidarity and mutual support. I recognise the challenges faced by the sector due to COVID-19 and am pleased the supports in 2020 provided a valuable source of funding at this challenging time. <\/p>  <p>  During 2020, the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland (BAI)  held two closed rounds for radio, targeted at the independent commercial and community radio sectors respectively. <\/p>  <p>  In June 2020, the BAI awarded &euro;2.5m Sound and Vision funding to 32 independent commercial radio stations across the country supporting public awareness and understanding of COVID-19.  This was in addition to a waiver on the broadcasting levy for the independent radio sector for Q1 and Q2 2020 which saved the sector &euro;1m.  I secured &euro;0.839m in Budget 2021 to recoup the BAI for this levy waiver. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, the BAI distributed &euro;750,000 this year in a special round for the community radio sector.<\/p>  <p>  The purpose of the Sound and Vision Scheme is to support eligible content across the broadcasting sector as a whole, ensuring a balanced and fair approach. In light of the ongoing challenges faced by the sector, I secured an additional &euro;2m in exchequer funding for the Sound and Vision Scheme under the July Stimulus Package. This greatly enhanced the funding available for the final round of the Scheme this year (round 37), bringing its total value to &euro;4.5m.  This funding round is open to those elements of the radio sector that were not eligible for the rounds to commercial and community radio earlier in the year, namely independent audio producers and public service radio. In addition, the round is open to independent audio-visual producers, and commercial, community and public service television stations. <\/p>  <p>  I was pleased to note the impact the Government horizontal supports are continuing to have on substantially reducing the cost base for the commercial radio sector during the restrictions. A total of &euro;4.3m has been received across the industry from the Government&rsquo;s COVID-19 Wage Subsidy Support Scheme.   Local radio has also been included in the Government&rsquo;s current advertising campaign on resilience. <\/p>  <p>  The BAI continue to report to me quarterly on the Impact of COVID-19 on Commercial Radio Sector.  I recently received the quarter 3 report and I am pleased to note the small growth in advertising revenues in that  quarter.  However I recognise that the current lockdown has again had a severe impact on the sector, especially at local level. The BAI will continue to report to me on a quarterly basis and the Q4 report will help give a picture of the overall impact on the range of supports for the year.<\/p>  <p>  The BAI is currently finalising the most recent round and no decisions regarding 2021 rounds have been made as yet. However the BAI will be meeting with representatives of the independent radio sector  to discuss the approach to Sound and Vision in the New Year and I very much welcome that. I will continue to work closely with the BAI to see how we can best support the sector in the coming period.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111900066#WRC04400","answer":true,"speaker":"1471"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Sports Funding","counter":118,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111900066#WRC04500"},{"type":"question","counter":119,"qnumday":48,"qnumall":"[37337\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111900066#WRC04600","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"if specific financial supports are available for small voluntary sports clubs that are being charged business rates by utility companies; if her attention has been drawn to the financial impact of the issue for voluntary sports clubs which must fundraise to cover the higher costs; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1462","askee":"1471"},{"type":"speech","counter":120,"content":"<p>On 2 November, I announced details of an &euro;85 million funding package for the Irish sport sector, which has been significantly impacted by the various COVID-19 restrictions imposed since March 2020. <\/p>  <p>  The\u00a0funding, which is\u00a0being allocated by Sport Ireland, will address the existential threat to National Governing Bodies and their club networks, allowing sports organisations to offset significant losses incurred in recent months and add a semblance of certainty to planning for 2021.

However, professional and high performance sport and inter-county Gaelic games matches are permitted to take place behind closed doors.<\/p>  <p>  In the Government&rsquo;s Plan for living with Covid-19, it states that for very large purpose built event facilities (for example: stadia, auditoriums, conference or event centres) specific guidance will be developed with the relevant sectors to take account of size and different conditions for events such as large national and international sporting events. This applies in respect of sporting events taking place during Level 1 and 2 of the Plan.<\/p>  <p>  I would like to assure the Deputy that, notwithstanding the current Level 5 restrictions, the development of this guidance remains a high priority for both Minister Martin and\u00a0me.

It was comprised\u00a0representatives of the FAI, GAA, and IRFU as well as stadium operations and event managers, officials from my Department and Sport Ireland. The Group reviewed international guidance, considered learning from spectator events hosted elsewhere in Europe, and consulted independent health and safety experts.

My Department continues to work with the Department of Education and Skills to prioritise the remaining schools to be connected over the term of the NBP. <\/p><p>I understand that there can be instances where premises remain unconnected, although close to premises that are passed by eir&rsquo;s fibre network. Eir&rsquo;s rural deployment of high speed broadband is a commercial undertaking and, as such, decisions regarding the areas and premises served are made by eir. My Department has no role in the matter and has no statutory authority to intervene in decisions of commercial operators as to where they build infrastructure and provide services. Throughout rural Ireland, eir&rsquo;s fibre deployment is primarily focussed on towns and villages and the premises on their outskirts. Where that network ends is where the National Broadband Plan in effect commences to ensure that nobody is left behind. <\/p><p>I appreciate people's frustration when they are living so close to a fibre network but cannot get a connection to that network, particularly given the heightened importance of connectivity during the Covid-19 pandemic. The NBP will ensure that in all such cases a future proofed high speed broadband network will be built to serve these premises and work to deliver on this is underway.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111900068#WRE05100","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Projects","counter":238,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111900068#WRE05400"},{"type":"question","counter":239,"qnumday":94,"qnumall":"[37598\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111900068#WRE05500","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"when he plans to publish the completed review of the Digital Hub Development Agency.","asker":"1485","askee":"1465"},{"type":"question","counter":240,"qnumday":95,"qnumall":"[37599\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111900068#WRE05600","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"if a strategy for the land holdings of the Digital Development Agency in the Thomas Street area of Dublin 8 has been decided; if consideration was given to the use of the lands for urban regeneration for the benefit of the host community; if not, if the land will be retained for the future expansion of the Digital Hub; and if these issues were considered by the strategic review team tasked with examining whether to complete the transfer of same to Dublin City Council as planned.","asker":"1485","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":241,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 94 and 95 together.<\/p><p>Earlier this year, my Department undertook a\u00a0strategic review of the\u00a0Digital Hub Development Agency (DHDA) in order to inform policy as to its future, and as to whether the DHDA continues to be required to meet a socio-economic need.

It identified the spending objectives of the programme including existing arrangements and relevant business needs; it applied the Programme Logic Model to look at potential scope and key service requirements; and identified benefits, risks, constraints and dependencies. It also included a Service Specification Framework, including critical success factors, an Options Framework and a Service Specification. It also conducted a preliminary options filtering looking at potential Service Delivery Models and Service Providers. It made some recommendations in this regard. It also touched on issues relating to governance and procurement. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  As regards the preliminary filtering of options, this took account of considerations in relation to the risks, affordability and deliverability.

and<\/p>  <p>  - clear and timely information to the public about any restrictions.<\/p>  <p>  It is up to Member States to decide what measures to apply on people travelling from risk areas to their territories. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Government has developed a framework around the\u00a0&ldquo;traffic light&rdquo; system and\u00a0as part of this, people arriving into Ireland from EU green regions do not have to restrict their movement for 14 days. <\/p>  <p>  The default advice for all\u00a0passengers entering Ireland from orange, red and grey regions remains to restrict movements for 14 days (this advice does not apply to essential transport\u00a0supply chain workers). <\/p>  <p>  The Government has adopted a new list of exempted categories of traveller with essential function or need\u00a0from\u00a0the EU Recommendation. These travellers do not need to restrict their movements when performing the essential function related to their travel, for example attending a close family member's funeral, or conducting an important business meeting that cannot be held virtually. For the moment, following the outbreak of a new strain of COVID-19 in Denmark associated with mink farms, passengers travelling from Denmark are advised to self isolate for 14 days regardless of the essential nature of their journey. This requirement does not apply to international transport workers in the aviation, maritime and road haulage sectors.<\/p>  <p>  The advice for those arriving from EU orange regions is that if they have a negative COVID-19 test result from a test taken up to three days before departure, they are not expected to restrict movements on arrival. <\/p>  <p>  From\u00a0midnight 29th November, arrivals from an EU red\/grey region and third countries will\u00a0not be expected to restrict movements following receipt of a\u00a0negative\/not-detected result from a COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test taken a minimum\u00a0of five days after arrival in Ireland. This provision will also be\u00a0available to arrivals from orange regions who may not have availed of a\u00a0pre-departure test.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  There are a number of COVID-19 testing technologies currently available or emerging on the commercial market. However, subject to the ongoing review of testing by NPHET and Government, a negative result from a COVID-19\u00a0PCR test is the only test result that means the passenger is not expected to follow advice to restrict movements. Testing technology and delivery options for facilitating international travel will be kept under review.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Passenger Locator Form, administered by the Department of Health,\u00a0remains in place for all persons arriving into the State regardless of the \"colour\" of the\u00a0location they are arriving from.\u00a0 Essential transport workers continue to be exempt from completing the form.\u00a0 The introduction of an online form supports an enhanced system of engagements with arriving passengers.

New Regulations were also introduced making mandatory the wearing of face coverings on\u00a0public transport, with some limited exceptions.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  There is continued strong messaging that public transport capacity remains restricted and, therefore, should only be used for essential travel, with only those who\u00a0have to travel at peak times doing so.\u00a0 People are being encouraged to walk or cycle where practical, and organisations are encouraged to continue to facilitate working from home.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is also\u00a0spending\u00a0considerable additional Exchequer funds on the\u00a0public transport sector in order to support the continued operation of necessary services, despite the reduced demand and the restricted capacity owing to the\u00a0Covid-19 situation.\u00a0 The Exchequer is now funding the PSO (public service obligation) regime far in excess of the allocation that had been provided under Budget 2020.\u00a0 In addition, the Government introduced a new\u00a0temporary funding support for the non-PSO (licensed, commercial) bus sector in respect of its continuation of necessary scheduled bus services. The Government also provided additional funding for enhancements to certain PSO bus services announced under\u00a0the\u00a0Stimulus package.<\/p>  <p>  While most public transport in Ireland comprises\u00a0the\u00a0bus and rail services funded through\u00a0the\u00a0National Transport Authority's (NTA) public service obligation (PSO) programme, there is part of\u00a0the\u00a0national public transport system that comprises non-subvented bus services, which are run on a commercial and competitive basis by bus and coach businesses of varying sizes throughout\u00a0the\u00a0country.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  I want to reassure the Deputy that both the NTA and my Department have been engaging directly with commercial bus\u00a0operators\u00a0throughout the crisis to help inform policy decisions in relation to the public transport sector as we continue to deal with the impact of Covid-19. In this context, my Department has\u00a0been\u00a0liasing\u00a0with the Coach Tourism &amp;amp; Transport Council of Ireland (CTTC) since early May - ten meetings have taken place, the most recent being the 6th November 2020.<\/p>  <p>  I am aware of the very difficult business environment that the commercial\u00a0operators\u00a0have been facing. Indeed, across Government we are acutely aware that the Covid-19 situation presents huge challenges for many business sectors.<\/p>  <p>  Public transport is a key facilitator of interaction in the economy and society. It is an efficient and sustainable way of getting people to work, education, shopping and other social engagements. The essential nature of these services has been acknowledged a number of times by the Government in recent months, most notably in the decision to provide additional funding for\u00a0PSO services\u00a0and the introduction of temporary funding measures for the licensed bus sector as I have outlined.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  These temporary funding supports have been introduced to help ease the financial pressure on\u00a0operators\u00a0arising from the fall in passenger numbers and associated drop in fare revenue as a result of Covid-19. They are aimed at ensuring the continued\u00a0operation\u00a0of essential licensed bus services for a period of up to six months and are targeted at covering the gap between specified costs and the revenues generated on the services. The supports are targeted at those classes of bus services where a clear public interest justification supports such intervention, in line with relevant state aid considerations. The\u00a0NTA, as the public transport licensing agency, is responsible for administering\u00a0the funding support through contracts with\u00a0the relevant operators.<\/p>  <p>  These supports are in addition to the suite of other financial support measures that the Government has introduced to help mitigate the impact of Covid-19, including the pandemic unemployment payment which\u00a0operators\u00a0can avail of and which remains open to new applicants until the end of the year and a Covid-19 enterprise support grant which can be put towards the costs associated with reopening a business, including the purchase of cleaning materials and personal protective equipment. <\/p>  <p>  These measures are in addition to rates waivers, lending facilities, equity injection and business advisory supports, all of which will help to improve cash flow. The Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation has also set up on online tool to help support Irish start-ups and SMEs to navigate the range of Government supports and identify which support may be most relevant to their business.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111900069#WRF05900","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Airport Passenger Data","counter":308,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111900069#WRF06000"},{"type":"question","counter":309,"qnumday":122,"qnumall":"[37709\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111900069#WRF06100","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the number of commercial flights that arrived here by airport for each month to date in 2020; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1473","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":310,"content":"<p>I\u00a0would like to advise that Deputy that my Department does not collect this data.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p><p>The Department\u00a0publishes a Quarterly Aviation Statistics\u00a0Snapshot which gives headline statistics on passenger numbers at our airports for the previous quarter.

This includes the Arts and Culture Recovery Taskforce and the Night-time Economy Taskforce, involving a broad range of stakeholders with experience and insight to develop sustainable roadmaps for the recovery of these sectors.\u00a0The quality and depth of these\u00a0engagement led to favourable outcomes for the sectors in the July Stimulus and in Budget 2021.

Following discussion at\u00a0a recent meeting of this\u00a0Group, I have requested that Department provide an update report on\u00a0how COVID-19 has impacted on participation in physical activity and sport at school level at the next meeting of the Group, tentatively earmarked for mid-December. <\/p>  <p>  The timescale and manner of recommencement of inter-school sport in the context of the current pandemic is a matter to be considered by Government in the context of the Living with COVID-19 Framework for Restrictive Measures, published in mid-September. This Framework sets out the approach that the Government intends to take in the management of the pandemic over the period to mid-2021. <\/p>  <p>  Given the current epidemiological situation with high incidence of disease, widespread community transmission, and considerable numbers of hospitalisations and deaths, it has been necessary to put in place very significant restrictions to arrest the current trajectory of the disease and break transmission chains. This means asking people to stay at home and eliminating as much activity and contacts as is possible to ensure that opportunities for the virus to transmit are minimised, while allowing essential activities to continue. Unfortunately, this means minimising discretionary activities such as non-elite sporting competitions and matches which are not permitted to take place in Levels 3, 4 and 5 of the Framework. <\/p>  <p>  The current Level 5 restrictions will continue until 2 December. The suite of measures to be applied thereafter, including for the sport and education sectors, will be decided by Government on the basis of the prevailing public health situation and in the context of the Framework published in September.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111900071#WRH01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1471"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Olympic Games","counter":411,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111900071#WRH01800"},{"type":"question","counter":412,"qnumday":157,"qnumall":"[37690\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111900071#WRH01900","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the engagements her Department has had with an association (details supplied) as it relates to the preparation and exemptions that may be required by the Irish women's hockey team to prepare for the Tokyo Olympics; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1473","askee":"1471"},{"type":"speech","counter":413,"content":"<p>There has been, and will continue to be, a regular, ongoing engagement with the sports sector as a whole, including with the body referred to by the Deputy.

In reviewing rent limits, the Department worked closely with the DEASP and monitored data gathered from the Residential Tenancies Board and the HAP Shared Services Centre. The new rent limits set in the Regulations\u00a0reflected significant increases on previous limits, in the order of 60% in some areas.<\/p><p>Local authorities also have discretion, because of local rental market conditions, to exceed the maximum rent limit by up to 20%, or up to 50% in the Dublin region for those households either in, or at immediate risk of, homelessness. To qualify for specific additional supports available to homeless households, a household must have been determined by the relevant local authority to be homeless within the meaning of section 2 of the Housing Act 1988. <\/p><p>It is a matter for the local authority to determine if the application of the flexibility is warranted on a case by case basis and also the level of additional discretion applied in each case.<\/p><p>My Department closely monitors the level of discretion being used by local authorities, taking into account other sources of data, including Residential Tenancies Board rent data published on a quarterly basis. I am satisfied that the current maximum rent limits, together with the additional flexibility available to local authorities, are generally sufficient to support the effective operation of the HAP scheme.<\/p><p>It is worth noting that not all households receiving HAP for the first time are reliant on the availability of properties on the private market. Many tenancies arise from referrals and other forms of communication.\u00a0Some households receiving HAP for the first time transfer from Rent Supplement in an existing tenancy. Other households who were not in receipt of Rent Supplement and so are receiving financial support for the first time, can also enter the scheme in an existing tenancy.<\/p><p>Inter-authority movement is allowed under the Scheme to facilitate movement of HAP households from one local authority area to another in cases where a HAP tenant, currently on a local authority waiting list, wishes to access rented accommodation with HAP support in another local authority area. Inter authority movement is, however,\u00a0subject to certain conditions, such as the\u00a0Social Housing\u00a0Income Eligibility\u00a0Bands and confirmation that the applicant's income is below the threshold in the new local authority.\u00a0<\/p><p>Given that such flexibility facilitates better utilisation of all private rental stock for social housing purposes and\u00a0supports\u00a0the maximum activation potential of HAP households by removing geographical barriers to employment, all local authorities have been requested to give appropriate consideration to these requests. HAP tenants continue to be dealt with by their originating local authority. However, the rent and discretion limits will be those that apply in the local authority where the property is situated. <\/p><p>I am conscious that increasing the current HAP rent limits could have negative inflationary impacts, leading to a detrimental impact on the wider rental market, including for those households who are not receiving HAP support.<\/p><p>My Department continues to keep the operation of the HAP scheme under review and it is a key mechanism in meeting housing need across the Country. However, it should be noted that, at the end of Q2 2020, an average of 301 additional tenancies are supported by HAP each week, with over 56,500 households having their housing needs met under the scheme at that point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111900071#WRH03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Authority Funding","counter":428,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111900071#WRH03500"},{"type":"question","counter":429,"qnumday":162,"qnumall":"[37495\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111900071#WRH03600","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"when he plans to detail the review into funding of local authorities that was due in 2019 and deferred to 2020; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1489","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":430,"content":"<p>I refer to Question\u00a0number 341 of 6 October 2020, the response to\u00a0which sets out the position in relation to this matter. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111900071#WRH03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1595"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":431,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 163 and 164 answered with Question No. 161.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tenant Purchase Scheme","counter":432,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111900071#WRH04000"},{"type":"question","counter":433,"qnumday":165,"qnumall":"[37522\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111900071#WRH04100","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"when the new tenant purchase scheme will be introduced; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1492","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":434,"content":"<p>The Tenant (Incremental) Purchase Scheme came into operation on 1 January 2016.\u00a0 The Scheme is open to eligible tenants, including joint tenants, of local authority houses that are available for sale under the Scheme.

During the meeting, officials urged the Russian authorities to fully investigate the allegations, to ensure that any such persecution be ended immediately, to provide all affected persons with the assistance they require, and to ensure the safety of activists and journalists investigating the reports of abuse in Chechnya. <\/p>  <p>  In November 2018, Ireland, along with 15 other participating States of the OSCE, invoked the Moscow Mechanism to establish a mission of experts to investigate the reports.

The invoking participating States, including Ireland, welcomed the report and its comprehensive list of specific recommendations that could be used by both Russia, including the Chechen Republic, and other participating States moving forward. We further urged Russia to heed the recommendations and work with relevant international institutions &ndash; including with the OSCE - to constructively address the issues raised.<\/p>  <p>  During my visit to Moscow in July 2019, where I met with Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov, I conveyed Ireland&rsquo;s deep concern at the targeting of LGBTI+ individuals in Chechnya, urging that Russia engage constructively with the Moscow Mechanism report and recommendations.

Ireland remains a strong supporter of EU enlargement, viewing it as the most efficient foreign policy instrument the EU can deploy to\u00a0anchor long-term stability and peace in the region. In meetings and phone-calls with my Western Balkan counterparts, I have communicated Ireland&rsquo;s steadfast support for their respective EU reform agendas and our willingness to assist in any way. This was also communicated by the former Minister of State for Europe, Helen McEntee T.D., in her visits to the Western Balkans in 2018 and 2019.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s focus remains on ensuring that the EU&rsquo;s involvement in the region is fit for purpose, in particular the operation of the Instrument for Pre-Accession (IPA), which aims to prepare candidate countries for EU membership. IPA benefits all the countries of the Western Balkans and Turkey, with funding for the upcoming budget period 2021-2027 in the region of EUR 14 billion. In addition, through the Technical Assistance and Information Exchange instrument (TAIEX) of the European Commission, which facilitates the sharing of EU best practices, Irish experts have offered their expertise in a number of the Western Balkan countries in recent years.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland has also provided EUR 300,000 to the Regional co-operation Council (RCC) which focuses on boosting regional co-operation in the Western Balkans. The RCC is a regionally led framework for co-operation in south-east Europe, and serves as the operational arm of the South East European co-operation Process (SEECP) - a forum for diplomatic and political dialogue set up in the aftermath of the wars in the former Yugoslavia. Our contribution assists the RCC with their aim of promoting regional co-operation across social and economic initiatives, with a focus on employment, energy and transport.\u00a0 Ireland also sits on the Board of the RCC.<\/p>  <p>  While our focus remains on the EU approach to the region, we are also working to strengthen our co-operation and bilateral relations with each of the accession countries, although the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted these efforts.<\/p>  <p>  In Albania, we have made a number of efforts in recent years to boost co-operation. Ireland has hosted a number of study visits in recent years, designed to share our expertise with Albanian officials. This has attracted high level visitors, including the Deputy Minister of the Albanian Ministry of Finance and Economy in 2019, the Minister of State for the Diaspora in 2018, as well as separate delegations from the Deputy Prime Minister&rsquo;s Office and the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development. In addition, the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI), in conjunction with Sustainable Food Systems Ireland (SFSI), were selected to support a capacity building project in the areas of food safety, veterinary and phytosanitary standards in Albania. The project, which is funded by EuropeAID, is valued at EUR 5 million, will run until 2023, and be carried out in collaboration with the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine, Evira ( the food safety Agency of Finland) and a local partner, Creative Business Solutions (an Albanian NGO). It is the largest tender won by SFSI to date. A study tour to Ireland by Albanian officials was a key factor in Ireland being selected as the lead partner for this project.<\/p>  <p>  In Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Embassy of Ireland in Ljubljana (which has responsibility for Bosnia and Herzegovina) collaborates regularly with the National Museum of Bosnia and Herzegovina, notably for the &ldquo;greening&rdquo; of the Museum in March 2020, an International James Joyce exhibition in September 2019, and the restoration of objects with Celtic connections for a preview in March 2019. \u00a0A number of cultural activities in BiH have also recently been supported by the Embassy. It should also be noted that Ireland actively participates in the UN peacekeeping Operation ALTHEA, the mandate for which was extended in recent weeks for another 12 months. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland enjoys warm relations with North Macedonia and was pleased to offer our strong support on its EU accession path, leading to the official decision by the European Council in March 2020 to formally commence accession negotiations. In recent years there have been some official visits between our countries, including the visit of then Minister of State \u00a0for EU Affairs, Helen McEntee T.D. to Skopje last year for discussions on the opening of EU accession negotiations and assistance Ireland might provide with respect to attracting FDI and diaspora engagement. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In Serbia, we have stepped up our efforts to boost engagement in recent years. In an effort to enhance Irish-Serbian collaboration in the digital sector, our Embassy in Athens hosted a Digital Creativity Conference in Belgrade in March 2019. The event received very positive feedback in relation to the potential for Irish companies in certain sectors of the Serbian market. One of the outcomes will be the establishment of a Serbian-Irish Business Association, led by Irish business interests in Serbia. On the cultural front, the annual Belgrade-Irish Festival which is supported by Culture Ireland and the Embassy in Athens (accredited to Serbia), celebrated its seventh year in 2019 and is a very positive vehicle for promoting modern Irish culture in Serbia. In recent years, Irish Aid has also provided funding for demining work in Serbia and developing demilitarisation capacity of the Serbian authorities. <\/p>  <p>  In regards to Turkey, the situation is more complex given that the accession progress is essentially frozen. Ireland provides funding to the Democratic Progress Institute (DPI), an NGO established with international experts in conflict resolution and democratic advancement. DPI initiatives in Turkey aim to promote democracy through strengthened public dialogue and engagement with civic society. Through this work, Ireland hopes to contribute to knowledge-sharing and learning opportunities for co-operation on democratic advancement across all sectors of Turkish society. Ireland has provided funding to the value of EUR 25,000 in 2020 for projects in Turkey run by the Journalists Association, the Federation of Women Associations of Turkey and the SADA Women&rsquo;s Cooperative. Our Embassy in Ankara cooperates on many local cultural initiatives, including support for Irish films at annual Turkish film festivals and &ldquo;greenings&rdquo; for St Patrick&rsquo;s Day in 2019 and 2020. In the field of education, the Embassy cooperates with Hacettepe University in Ankara to support the annual Literary One Day Conference on Irish writers. Ireland welcomes Turkish graduate students every year under the EU Jean Monnet Scholarship Programme on research topics directly related to Turkey&rsquo;s EU harmonisation process and the EU acquis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111900072#WRJ02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"question","counter":494,"qnumday":186,"qnumall":"[37679\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111900072#WRJ03200","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the co-operation that exists between Ireland and Norway; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1473","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":495,"content":"<p>Ireland and Norway enjoy excellent bilateral political and economic relations.

Switzerland is Ireland&rsquo;s ninth largest services trading partner: Irish services exports amounted to &euro;3.3bn in 2016 and imports to &euro;3.2bn.

These hours have been in place since 2005 and form part of an SNA&rsquo;s contract of employment which was agreed with unions. This letter did not change the terms and conditions of SNAs or amend previous agreements.The letter was an important reminder to schools on the management, communication and recording of the 72 hours which are a part of the SNA contract.\u00a0 It was an aide to ensure that schools effectively plan for the optimum use of this time to support the care needs of pupils.\u00a0<\/p><p>Under the terms of the standard employment contract agreed in 2005, SNAs were required to be available for a number of days at the start and finish of each school term, not exceeding 12 in total. <\/p><p>Under the Croke Park Agreement, it was agreed to convert the previous requirement of SNAs to be available for 12 days outside of the school year to one of 72 hours (pro-rata for part-time SNAs). It was agreed at that time that the 72 hours would be used by schools as an additional bank of hours to be utilised and delivered outside of normal school opening hours and\/or the normal school year. These arrangements were notified to schools in 2011, in Department Circular 0071\/2011. \u00a0<\/p><p>Both the original 2005 agreement and the Croke Park provisions were negotiated and agreed nationally between management and trade unions. \u00a0<\/p><p>No additional hours were required of SNAs under the 2011 agreement.\u00a0<\/p><p>Some recent commentary has referred to the 72 hours as being &lsquo;unpaid&rsquo;.\u00a0 However, remuneration for the 12 days or 72 hours is included as part of the normal salary paid to an SNA under the terms of the 2005 agreed contract.\u00a0<\/p><p>As part of the 2011 agreement on reconfiguration, it was agreed that the scheduling of the hours is at the discretion of school management and schools were informed that they should ensure that accurate records are kept in relation to their use.<\/p><p>F&oacute;rsa, the trade union which represents SNAs, have formally sought abolition of the 72 hours contractual requirement through industrial relations channels. In addition, F&oacute;rsa have formally sought that the 72 hours are frozen and employers do not request their completion for the duration of the Covid pandemic.\u00a0 <\/p><p>Some confusion had arisen at school level on foot of communications issued by F&oacute;rsa to schools stating that there is no liability to complete all or any of the hours.\u00a0 As such schools and management bodies had asked the Department to clarify the position. During the course of discussions on the former claim, all parties were notified that the Department intended to issue a letter to school management bodies to remind schools of the provisions relating to the hours. <\/p><p>The agreed uses of the 72 hours include:<\/p><p>- SEN pupil-centred activity - such as assistance with care planning;<\/p><p>- Learning resource administration &ndash; such as preparing class rooms and materials;<\/p><p>- Class and school planning and development;<\/p><p>- Assistance with special exam centres for the State exams; and<\/p><p>- Training<\/p><p>The duties listed in Circular 71\/2011 form part of the normal range of SNA duties, and are therefore liable to be performed at any time during normal working hours, including during the 72 hours. \u00a0<\/p><p>The 72 hours allow for very important support work such as assistance with care planning, learning resource administration and training to be carried out without reducing the SNA&rsquo;s time with the pupil in need of their care. Accordingly, the suspension of the requirement to complete the 72 hours would have a direct, negative impact on pupils with special educational needs as it would impede on normal class time.\u00a0<\/p><p>F&oacute;rsa has previously claimed that SNAs are being asked to carry out duties inappropriate to the grade as part of the 72 hours. The Department&rsquo;s recent letter reminded schools of the agreed list of uses for the 72 hours under Circular 71\/2011 and stated that the grievance procedures should be used where allegations of inappropriate use arise.

These supports have a fundamental role in assisting students and families who are putting their children through further and higher education. <\/p><p>The main support available to students is the statutory based SUSI grant scheme. Under the terms of the Student Grant Scheme, grant assistance is awarded to students attending an approved course in an approved institution who meet the prescribed conditions of funding, including those relating to nationality, residency, previous academic attainment and means. <\/p><p>The decision on eligibility for a student grant is a matter, in the first instance, for the centralised student grant awarding authority SUSI (Student Universal Support Ireland) to determine. <\/p><p>Postgraduate students who meet all of the qualifying conditions for the special rate of grant under the Student Grant Scheme are eligible for a maintenance grant of up to &euro;5,915; the income threshold for this grant for the 2020\/21 academic year is &euro;24,500. Qualifying postgraduate students may also be eligible to have their tuition fees paid up to a maximum fee limit of &euro;6,270. <\/p><p>Alternatively a postgraduate student may qualify to have a &euro;2,000 contribution made towards the cost of his\/her fees. The income threshold for this payment is &euro;31,500 for the 2020\/21 academic year, increasing relative to the number of family dependents. <\/p><p>Further information in relation to student grant assistance is available from SUSI&rsquo;s website: <i>www.susi.ie<\/i>. The telephone number for SUSI&rsquo;s Helpdesk is 0761 087 874.  <\/p><p>In line with the Programme for Government commitment to address the gap in postgraduate grants and as part of Budget 2021, the postgraduate fee grant will increase to &euro;3,500 from &euro;2,000. This increase will allay some of the costs for postgraduate study and would give greater certainty for students in terms of supports. In addition, the fee income threshold will increase to &euro;54,240 from &euro;31,500. These measures come into effect for the 2021\/22 academic year.<\/p><p>Apart from the Student Grant Scheme, the Deputy will be aware of the recently announced &euro;168m funding package for the return to education. This package includes a &euro;10m access support package for higher education students. I have approved the allocation of &euro;8.1m of this funding to top up the Student Assistance Fund (SAF). The SAF assists students in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances. Institutions have the autonomy to maximise the flexibility in the Student Assistance Fund to enable HEIs to support students during the COVID-19 situation. Details of this fund are available from the Access Office in the third level institution attended. <\/p><p>The &euro;168m funding package also includes &euro;15m in IT equipment grants for disadvantaged students in further and higher education and a &euro;10m access support package for higher education students. An additional &euro;3m has also been provided for investment in supports for mental health services and well-being initiatives. These supports are being distributed through the colleges and further education providers.<\/p><p>Also as announced as part of Budget 2021 we will provide financial assistance through a once off &euro;50 million fund for students to mitigate against the impacts of the changed learning environment. My officials and I are developing the process on how this once-off fund will operate for submission to Government prior to commencement. Further details will be available for students shortly.<\/p><p>Tax relief at the standard rate of tax may be claimed in respect of tuition fees paid for approved courses at approved colleges of higher education including approved undergraduate and postgraduate courses in EU Member States and in non-EU countries. Further information on this tax relief is available from a student's local Tax office or from the Revenue Commissioners website <i>www.revenue.ie<\/i><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111900075#WRM05200","answer":true,"speaker":"1624"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Functions","counter":730,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111900075#WRM05300"},{"type":"question","counter":731,"qnumday":268,"qnumall":"[37459\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111900075#WRM05400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the status of the transfer of research and innovation components from Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment; when the transfer will be complete; if the units as they currently exist in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment will be transferred in their entirety; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1501","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","counter":732,"content":"<p>In June 2020, it was announced by the Taoiseach that certain science and research functions would transfer from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment to the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The two Departments have been working closely to agree the details and arrangements for the transfer of functions, and it is anticipated that this process will be concluded in the coming weeks and Government will be asked to agree the proposal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111900075#WRM05500","answer":true,"speaker":"1624"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Qualifications Recognition","counter":733,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111900075#WRM05600"},{"type":"question","counter":734,"qnumday":269,"qnumall":"[37464\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111900075#WRM05700","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if a person who already has an MA in education following a BA in arts can be offered some credits for this period of study when they undertake a pivot in their career and now want to study a MA in primary education.","asker":"1566","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","counter":735,"content":"<p>Via the process of the Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL), a person may gain admission to a programme of study or may gain exemptions\/credits from some parts of a programme based on demonstrated learning.

The Act is currently under review and the Programme for Government commits to introducing, within 12 months, legislation to address those who target victims because of their association with a particular identity characteristic, and to revise and update the Incitement to Hatred Act. My Department is working to prepare this legislation on hate crime and hate speech as a priority. <\/p>  <p>  As part of this work a comprehensive public consultation has been carried out which included a public survey and an opportunity for stakeholders to make formal submissions. This consultation was conducted to ensure that the Department fully understands the lived experience of those impacted by hate speech and hate crime as well as the views of professionals and other stakeholders in the field. This is necessary to ensure the laws developed are robust, clearly understood and effective in dealing with unacceptable incidents. <\/p>  <p>  I am pleased with the high level of engagement by the public with this important topic and can inform the Deputy that my Department received in the region of 3,800 written responses to the consultation, including approximately 175 detailed written submissions.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to this comprehensive consultation and in order to ensure that the final legislation will be effective, my Department also carried out comparative research on international best practice on hate crime legislation.\u00a0 This research is currently being finalised and I expect to publish it very shortly. <\/p>  <p>  The purpose of this work is to ensure that the legislative proposals presented are evidence-based, proportionate and effective, while respecting important rights to freedom of expression and association. There will be a further opportunity for stakeholders to share their views when the legislative proposals on this important issue are published for discussion. <\/p>  <p>  I would reassure the Deputy that all legislative proposals are developed and put forward bearing in mind the provisions of the Constitution and our human rights obligations. <\/p>  <p>  The right to freedom of expression is a fundamental\u00a0human right, which is\u00a0provided for in the Irish Constitution and in both the European Convention on Human Rights and in the European Charter of Fundamental Rights.

The two police services operate a joint Cross-Border Policing Strategy which has as its aims to improve public safety throughout Ireland, to disrupt criminal activity and to enhance the policing capability of both police services in both jurisdictions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111900076#WRN04800","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Health","counter":801,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111900076#WRN05100"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic","counter":800,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111900076#WRN05000"},{"type":"question","counter":801,"qnumday":293,"qnumall":"[37516\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111900076#WRN05100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if, arising from the recommendation on a co-ordinated approach to the restriction of free movement in response to the Covid-19 pandemic arising from the European Council meeting of 13 October 2020, Ireland will provide data to the European Centre for Disease Control on specific areas or regions on the State in respect of the extent to which they are affected by Covid-19, rather than only in respect of the entire territory of the State.","asker":"1518","askee":"1623"},{"type":"question","counter":802,"qnumday":294,"qnumall":"[37517\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111900076#WRN05200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the specific areas or regions of the State in respect Ireland will provide data to the European Centre for Disease Control to give effect to the recommendation on a co-ordinated approach to the restriction of free movement in response to the Covid-19 pandemic arising from the European Council meeting of 13 October 2020 that member states apply those restrictions to persons coming from specific areas or regions of the State particularly affected rather than to the entire territory of Ireland.","asker":"1518","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":803,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 293 and 294 together.<\/p><p>Ireland provides data to the ECDC based on NUTS regions.

This Plan sets out Ireland's approach to managing and living with COVID-19 in a range of areas over the next 6 - 9 months.<\/p>  <p>  The Plan sets out a framework of 5 Levels which outline the broad measures which will apply depending on the level of the virus at any given time. It is designed to help everyone &ndash; individuals, families, organisations and sectors &ndash; to better understand, anticipate and prepare for the measures that might be introduced to contain transmission of the virus. The Plan is framed to account for periods during which there is low incidence of the disease, with isolated clusters and low community transmission, through to situations where there is a high or rapidly increasing incidence, widespread community transmission and the pandemic is escalating rapidly in Ireland and globally. <\/p>  <p>  Any measures introduced at any level of the Plan are aimed at limiting the spread and damage of COVID-19, and are necessary to protect what we know are our key priorities of supporting and maintaining health and social care services, keeping education and childcare services open and protecting the most vulnerable members of our community.<\/p>  <p>  Budget 2021 has provided &euro;150m in new development money plus a further &euro;30m in Sl&aacute;intecare funding to implement a model of Enhanced Community Care. This funding will allow for the development of new pathways of care for primary health services and will enable delivery of enhanced care services across the country for those that need them.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Investment in primary care will underpin a move toward population-based delivery of services through Community Health Networks serving local populations of approximately 50,000 and will facilitate the development of specialist community teams catering to older persons and those with chronic disease, as well as the national expansion of Community Intervention Teams.\u00a0 The rollout of the Enhanced Community Care model will build capacity through recruitment of more than 2,000 staff, with a particular focus on nursing and community therapists such as Physiotherapists, Occupational Therapists and Speech and Language Therapists. <\/p>  <p>  Alongside this investment, the primary care sector will continue to utilise alternative modes of service delivery, including remote consultations using simple telephone services or more sophisticated online and video consultations.\u00a0 The rollout of a network of Community Assessment Hubs and expanded GP access to diagnostics will also be important elements of the Covid-19 response and development of primary care.<\/p>  <p>  Budget 2021 also sees a significant investment into the health workforce with an increase of 16,000 permanent whole-time equivalents into the health workforce, above 2020 funded levels.

This Framework sets out Ireland's approach to managing and living with COVID-19 in a range of areas over the next 6 - 9 months.<\/p><p>The Plan sets out five levels of response, each with a number of measures designed to help us all lower COVID-19 transmission and setting out what is permitted at that moment in time. It aims to allow society and businesses to be able to operate as normally as possible, while continuing to suppress the virus.\u00a0The Plan is framed to account for periods during\u00a0which there is a low incidence of the disease, with isolated clusters and low community transmission, through to situations where there is a\u00a0high or rapidly increasing incidence, widespread community transmission and the pandemic is escalating rapidly in Ireland and globally. It recognises the need for society and business to be allowed to continue as normally as possible and is designed so that either national or county level restrictions can be applied.\u00a0Each level outlines what is permitted for social or family gatherings, work and public transport, bars, hotels and restaurants, exercise activities and religious services. <\/p><p>As I am sure the Deputy can appreciate, COVID-19 spreads when individuals and groups come into close contact with one another, enabling the virus to move from one person to another. COVID-19 is infectious in a person with no symptoms, or for the period of time before they develop symptoms. For this reason, we are all asked to be extra careful when socialising and working with others. For now, we must act like we have the virus to protect those around us from infection.<\/p><p>The number of people allowed to gather in different scenarios in the Government Framework are based on a review of international practice and the judgment of public health experts. It seeks to balance the risks of different types of gatherings against the desire to allow normal activities to proceed in so far as possible.<\/p><p>It is advised to socialise safely and within the capacity limits. These various limits in the Levels are all designed to reduce the number of households mixing with each other and cut down the virus&rsquo;s chances of spreading into more homes.\u00a0<\/p><p>The Deputy should note, that the numbers should not be considered a target - they are the maximum recommended number. It&rsquo;s always safer to meet less people, less often, for less time. If we do this, we have a better chance of keeping to the lower Levels in the Framework, and continuing to keep businesses, schools, and healthcare services open, while also protecting the most vulnerable.\u00a0<\/p><p>The &lsquo;Framework for Restrictive Measures in Response to COVID-19&rsquo; in the Living with Covid Plan provides for restrictions on gatherings of people indoors given the higher risk associated with these types of activities and sets out when it is considered that\u00a0religious services can take place with protective measures (Levels 1 and 2) and when they must move online (Levels 3,4 and 5). Weddings and funerals are exceptions and can continue at every level with limited numbers. <\/p><p>Churches and other places of worship can remain open for private prayer. It is also important to note that at all levels, Ministers of Religion are permitted to travel to perform a service on-line, to minister to the sick, and conduct a funeral or wedding ceremony.\u00a0 The relevant regulations relating to Level 5 restrictions are S.I. 448 of 2020 (Health Act 1947 (Section 31A - Temporary Restrictions) (COVID-19) (NO. 8) Regulations 2020).<\/p><p>Throughout the pandemic, the Government has sought to implement these measures on the basis of guidance as opposed to regulations wherever possible. It should be noted that\u00a0holding a religious gathering is not a penal offence. <\/p><p>I and my Cabinet colleagues recognise the immense sacrifices that are being made be people across the country at this difficult time. I know that includes many people who are\u00a0affected\u00a0by their inability\u00a0to attend church in the way they have been used to. However, there has been significant engagement and solidarity from the Catholic Church and other Faiths at all stages throughout this pandemic to ensure the protection of individuals and communities from COVID-19. Indeed,\u00a0 the Taoiseach has recently met with the leaders of the Catholic Church\u00a0 to consider the range of issues relating this matter. <\/p><p>Finally, the Deputy will wish to note that comprehensive guidelines are in place to ensure that religious services can take place safely when<b><\/b>they recommence: <i>www.hpsc.ie\/a-z\/respiratory\/coronavirus\/novelcoronavirus\/guidance\/religioussettingsguidance\/COVID_religious%20settings.pdf.<\/i><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111900077#WRO05900","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Vaccination Programme","counter":883,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111900077#WRO06300"},{"type":"question","counter":884,"qnumday":321,"qnumall":"[37610\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111900077#WRO06400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the current capacity in the State to store vaccines below 80 degrees.","asker":"1514","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":885,"content":"<p>Ireland is currently involved in an EU Procurement Exercise being operated by the European Commission on behalf of member states to procure a portfolio of suitable, safe and effective vaccines, in sufficient quantities, to combat COVID-19.<\/p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy of the Government's commitment to the timely implementation of a COVID-19 immunisation programme, as soon as one or more vaccines in the portfolio are approved for use. <\/p>  <p>  In this regard, a cross-Government High-Level Taskforce has been established to support and oversee the development and implementation of the programme.\u00a0 Logistics arrangements are amongst the range of matters which will be addressed in the context of the work of the Taskforce and the State agencies and other stakeholders with which it will work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111900077#WRO06500","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Staff","counter":886,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111900077#WRO06600"},{"type":"question","counter":887,"qnumday":322,"qnumall":"[37612\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111900077#WRO06700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the position regarding an issue raised in correspondence (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1493","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":888,"content":"<p>With regard to pay restoration for section 39 organisations, a\u00a0Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) agreement reached in October 2018 provided for pay restoration in relation to 50 pilot organisations in the first instance.\u00a0 Pay restoration for these bodies commenced in April 2019 with further payments due in October 2020 and October 2021 as appropriate.\u00a0 St Josephs Foundation was one of the organisations included in the pilot exercise.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the broader issue raised, the Deputy will be aware that individuals employed by Section 39 organisations are not HSE employees, therefore neither the HSE nor the Department of Health has a role in determining the salaries or other terms and conditions applying to these staff.\u00a0 It is, therefore, a matter for Section 39 organisations to negotiate salaries with their staff as part of their employment relationship and within the overall funding available for the delivery of agreed services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111900077#WRO06800","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Vaccination Programme","counter":889,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111900077#WRO06900"},{"type":"question","counter":890,"qnumday":323,"qnumall":"[37656\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111900077#WRO07000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 1191 of 30 July 2020, the number of adult and child vaccines respectively that have been administered to date; his plans to source additional vaccines; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1603","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":891,"content":"<p>This season, 1.95 million doses of influenza vaccine have been purchased, which is double the amount administered last season.

The issue of granting medical cards based on having a particular disease or illness was previously examined in 2014 by the HSE Expert Panel on Medical Need and Medical Card Eligibility. The Group concluded that it was not feasible, desirable, nor ethically justifiable to list medical conditions in priority order for medical card eligibility.\u00a0 In following the Expert Group&rsquo;s advice, a person&rsquo;s means remains the main qualifier for a medical card.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE does have a compassionate system in place for the provision of medical cards when it is informed that a patient is receiving end of life treatment &ndash; that is when patients&rsquo; unfortunately have a prognosis of less than 12 months. These applications do not require a means assessment nor are they reassessed. There are currently almost 1,800 such medical cards awarded. Separately, terminally ill patients who do not meet the end of life criteria may also qualify for a medical card under the general assessment processes. Every effort is made by the HSE, within the framework of the Health Act 1970, to support applicants in applying for a medical card and to take full account of the difficult circumstances, such as extra costs arising from an illness.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, since 2015 medical cards are awarded without the need of a financial assessment to all children under 18 years of age with a diagnosis of cancer.<\/p>  <p>  It should also be noted that the Programme for Government &lsquo;Our Shared Future&rsquo; contains a commitment to extend discretionary medical cards to those with a terminal illness. A HSE Clinical Advisory Group (CAG) was established in December 2019 to review eligibility for medical cards in cases of terminal illness. The final Report of the CAG was recently submitted to my Department\u00a0and has been published.

Ros an Mh&iacute;l is one of six Fishery Harbour Centres, the others are located at Castletownbere, Dingle, Dunmore East, Howth and\u00a0Killybegs. <\/p>  <p>  The FHCs were established to act as dedicated centres and focal points for the promotion and development of the Irish seafood industry which comes under the remit of this Department. <\/p>  <p>  Overall policies and strategies for delivering on climate change and renewable energies are not primarily a matter for the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, these primarily fall under the remit of the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications. <\/p>  <p>  Should any proposals be brought forward either centrally or from private enterprises to\u00a0develop the infrastructure in Ros an Mh&iacute;l or any of the Fishery Harbour Centres, to support the sustainable development of territorial waters,\u00a0they will be considered as appropriate.<\/p>  <p>  Funding is made available on an annual basis by my Department to the FHCs, including Ros an Mh&iacute;l, via the Fishery Harbour and Coastal Infrastructure Development Programme.
