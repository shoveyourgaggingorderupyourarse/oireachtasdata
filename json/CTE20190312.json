I was attracted to the role because I believe that Coillte&rsquo;s core activities in forestry, forest products and renewable energy have never been more relevant or important and I admired its capacity to transform itself in the past five years under the excellent leadership of the board, the CEO and the senior management team.  It conducts its business in a wholly professional manner.  The organisation, which celebrates its 30th year in existence in 2019, has its brightest years ahead.  Before I elaborate on this, I wish to provide members with some background on my track record.<\/p> <p>  I am an accountant with extensive experience in HR and governance as well as significant executive and non-executive experience in the telecommunications, energy, financial and education sectors.  In addition, I have broad consulting experience in the commercial sector.  I understand the commercial semi-State sector through my roles as worker director and, subsequently, HR director in Eircom at a time of great change, and as chair of EirGrid from its inception in 2005 for a period of eight years.  I have also served on a number of other boards in the State sector and am a current member of the governing authority of DCU.  <\/p> <p>  As a Longford person, I understand the importance of rural development and fully appreciate the role Coillte plays in that context.  I am committed to creating a better Ireland for all of our citizens and believe that semi-State organisations have a particular responsibility in this regard.  Consequently, I served as a member of the board of Business in the Community Ireland and have held several other voluntary positions in the not-for-profit and sport sectors, including my current role as a member of the GAA audit and risk committee.  <\/p> <p>  In Coillte, I see an organisation that is aligned with my interests and values.  I believe it is a place where I could make a real impact and help to steer the right course on the next phase of its development.  That next phase needs to focus on consolidation of the changes effected to date and build on this momentum to contribute further to Ireland&rsquo;s approach to forestry, climate change and use of our natural resources for the greater good of Irish citizens.  My experience of the State sector, and the energy sector in particular, together with my experience of change and governance leave me well placed to lead Coillte in this phase.  <\/p> <p>  Coillte was established in 1989 as a commercial State company.  It has been on a journey of change and transition from being embedded in the Civil Service to becoming a profitable, innovative and customer-focused State-owned commercial company.  At the core of the business is an estate of 7% of the land area of Ireland, comprising approximately 450,000 ha or in excess of 1 million acres.  This estate comprises approximately 6,000 individual properties, which are spread across the country.  This dispersal of properties means that in addition to being the largest landowner in Ireland, Coillte has a substantial public interface and a deeply rooted relationship with the communities in which it is embedded.  I will return to this social dimension of the company and its unique role within rural Ireland.  <\/p> <p>  The core activity on Coillte's lands is, of course, commercial forestry operations.  However, the estate features extensive upland areas which have some of the best wind resources in Europe.  In the past ten years Coillte has, through its land solutions business, established itself as one of the State's largest developers of onshore wind farms.  Forestry and land solutions form two of the company&rsquo;s three divisions, with the third being Medite Smartply, which is focused on the manufacture of sustainable building products for the construction sector at its plants in Clonmel, south Tipperary and Belview, south Kilkenny.  <\/p> <p>  The company is in strong financial shape.  Last year it had excellent results across all key financial metrics, with record revenues of &euro;330 million and record earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization of &euro;115 million.  This strong financial performance, combined with the sale of Coillte's interests in a number of operating wind farm assets, allowed the company to reduce net debt to just &euro;15 million, reinvest almost &euro;40 million in its forests for future generations and pay its shareholder a substantial dividend of &euro;15 million.  <\/p> <p>  This strong performance is the culmination of a transformation that has been taking place in the business over the past number of years and which has seen the group go from cash neutral from recurring operations in 2014 to &euro;30 million cash positive in 2017, doubling this to &euro;60 million in 2018.  The company is now generating a cash yield of approximately 4.6%, which puts it in the top tier of State-owned forestry companies across Europe.  <\/p> <p>  While it is clearly important that our State-owned companies perform well financially, it is not the only reason for the State to own a forestry company.  Forests serve multiple and interrelated social, economic and environmental functions.  As well as providing a reliable supply of sustainably produced wood fibre to a thriving timber industry which provides jobs and incomes in rural Ireland, forests continuously sequester carbon as they grow and products made from harvested wood safely lock-up carbon and provide an environmentally friendly substitute for carbon-intense products such as plastic, concrete and steel.  <\/p> <p>  The imperative to decarbonise our energy and production systems in the coming years means that forestry, forest products and renewable energy have never been more relevant.  Coillte is ideally placed to thrive in this environment.  For example, last month it announced that it is engaged in bilateral discussions with ESB which, if successful, would lead to the establishment of a new joint venture development company to deliver 1,000 MW of renewable energy by 2030.  This joint venture could provide enough green energy to power significantly more than 500,000 households annually, thus making a significant contribution to Ireland's energy transition.  <\/p> <p>  Although our forest sector is small by European standards, it is young and dynamic and recognised by its peers internationally as being innovative, progressive and technologically very advanced.  Last year, the Department of the Taoiseach published a national policy statement on the bioeconomy, which outlined a vision for Ireland as a world leader in the emerging bioeconomy.  As the backbone of the Irish forest sector, Coillte is well positioned to drive the development of forestry and forest products as a central pillar in that emerging bioeconomy.  <\/p> <p>  Forests also provide important non-commercial or public good benefits.  They purify water supplies and regulate water flow, mitigating the risk of flood.  They are a low-intervention land use which help preserve soil stability and fertility.  The life cycle of forests is relatively long and, between planting and harvesting, forests provide an important habitat for wildlife and a place to recreate and experience nature.<\/p> <p>  The Coillte estate has 12 forest parks, almost 300 recreation sites and more than 3,000 km of hiking trails.  It is estimated that there are 18 million visits to our forests each year.  Working with other stakeholders such as F&aacute;ilte Ireland and the Department of Rural and Community Development, Coillte is investing in the rural economy through the advancement of exciting projects such as the redevelopment of Avondale and four world-class mountain bike trails situated across the country.  In addition, more than one fifth or 90,000 ha of the estate is dedicated to biodiversity, which the company is intent on protecting and enhancing.  Coillte participated in the recent seeds for nature initiative promoted by the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Madigan, at which it announced the investment of &euro;500,000 in the restoration of a magnificent alluvial forest at Hazelwood, County Sligo.  Coillte's substantial contribution to these social and environmental benefits are funded by its commercial activities.  The company recognises the increasing demand for these social and environmental services from our forests and is exploring how this important aspect of its work can be developed further in partnership with others.  <\/p> <p>  Of course, as is particularly evident today given recent events, the greatest uncertainty facing Coillte is Brexit.  The UK is a vital market for the Irish forest products sector.  A hard Brexit on WTO terms would have serious implications for the company through the imposition of non-tariff barriers to trade and tariffs on panel products.  It would be likely to result in significant delays for exporters and increased compliance costs.<\/p><p>In this scenario, it is also likely that a significant slowdown in UK construction activity will occur with a consequent worsening in the trading environment for our products.  Great Britain also has a relatively low level of forest cover and, therefore, a limited indigenous supply of wood.  It is currently the second largest importer of timber in the world and we believe that the impact of a hard Brexit if it comes to pass, while serious in the short term, will be overcome by larger macro-economic forces in the medium and longer term.  <\/p><p> In addition, the Irish construction sector continues to thrive with housing completion up over a quarter from 2017 to 2018 and signs of buoyancy continuing - at least in the foreseeable future.  It is right and proper that the State expects a business performance from Coillte that is on a par with the best in the private sector and that it expects the State assets vested with it with to deliver sustainable returns over time.  The net asset value of Coillte's balance sheet is approximately &euro;1.3 million.<\/p><p>  I would like to take this opportunity to commend the former Chair, John Moloney, the outgoing CEO, Fergal Leamy, and the board, management and staff of Coillte on their achievements in transforming the company over the past five years.  I am committed to building on the sound platform they have created and to making a contribution in supporting and challenging the management to drive the business even further forward.  I firmly believe we can continue to drive a strong commercial performance and, at the same time, provide a valuable environmental and social dividend to society at large.  I thank the committee and look forward to members' questions. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2019031200002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Bernie Gray","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1552404600,"counter":15,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Gray for her comprehensive opening statement.

I have a number of questions.  In the past, Coillte appeared before the committee regarding concerns landowners have raised regarding partnership, the different types of partnership and how people feel they were sold a pig in a poke and did not get value for what they had given to Coillte.  They also complained that they were not being communicated with.  We were told that these issues were in the process of being addressed.  Could Ms Gray give us an update on that?<\/p> <p>  Regarding the rural economy, afforestation and the impact on rural communities have been discussed a number of times at this committee.  We receive many complaints from counties such as Leitrim.  People feel that the land is overwhelmed by these forests.  Some of it is laid at the door of the particular species of tree that is being planted.  How can this be better managed with regard to local communities?  An issue I have raised, including when the Minister of State, Deputy Doyle, was in the Seanad last week, concerns adding value to forestry.  I believe Mayo is above its planting targets but the reality is that twice a week, wood is cut and is transported on a freight train from Ballina free of charge to Waterford.  While there may be dividends for some because work is being provided, there is no sawmill and perhaps no place where woodchip could be created.  To make forestry acceptable and to plant more, which is the ambition, we need to show local communities and pointing to something in another county that is quite a distance away does not cut the mustard with people.  <\/p> <p>  Ms Gray mentioned a joint venture to create deliver 1,000 MW of renewable energy by 2030.  Am I correct in my understanding that Coillte's focus on renewables has been on land-based wind energy to date?  What about biomass and combined heat and power electricity generation?  I am curious to find out whether Coillte has entered into any joint ventures and Ms Gray's views on such an energy plant as a prospect where Coillte has the raw material, which is the wood to feed, sustain and generate electricity.  Other promoters may not and may have to enter into agreements with Coillte for biomass supply.  <\/p> <p>  What about district heating systems?  If we had woodchip or a satisfactory biomass supply, hospitals or villages could have a more sustainable source of electricity and heat.  I am trying to understand what steps could be taken to use Coillte's expertise because it did not start out developing amenity forests, for example.  It would be remiss of me not to mention Beleek Forest Park in the area where I am from.  Ballycroy National Park is another amenity.  The staff and management there do a very good job for which I compliment them.  Coillte's remit goes beyond just managing forests.  It is now moving into renewables and the area of leisure and amenity.  Could Coillte work with communities and do something along the lines of what I have suggested because there seems to be a gap?  This gap might be filled by co-operatives but generally landowners and communities do not have the wherewithal or finances to resource it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2019031200002#C00300","speaker":"1425"},{"type":"speech","time":1552404600,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Gray for her presentation.  How much of current profitability is made up of wind farms and wind farm assets within the overall Coillte book?  I would be interested in finding that out because it is a move away from Coillte's core business.  I wonder what the driver for that is.  Much of Coillte's land seems to be set aside for wind farms rather than for forestry.  What will the future development of that look like?<\/p> <p>  As Senator Mulherin mentioned, the type of forestry used involves more industrial use.  It does not serve a purpose in offsetting carbon.  While it does serve such a purpose when it is growing, when it is being cut down, it releases carbon.  How will that be developed in the future?  Coillte has a responsibility to keep its two sawmills going but there are additional requirements.  <\/p> <p>  I understand that Coillte is subject to the Forestry Act 1988.  Is this Act up to date and fit for purpose?  Would it be beneficial if it was amended to facilitate climate change and public responsibilities the company will have in the future?  Ms Gray may not be familiar with this yet but I would like to hear about continuous cover forestry.  How will that be developed?  Is it something in which Coillte could become involved to ensure continuous forestry growth rather than the clear felling that happens at the moment where one plants, waits for 20 years, clear fells the area and plants again?  With continuous cover, one would pick and choose so that there would be a canopy all the time, which would be more sustainable.  Does Ms Gray have any views on that?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2019031200002#C00400","speaker":"1366"},{"type":"speech","time":1552404600,"counter":18,"content":"<p>I welcome Ms Gray.<\/p><p>As portfolios go, she has the most unique one in the State.  I always thought the Office of Public Works, OPW, was one of the biggest landlords, but Coillte has 1 million ha of property, which is an amazing portfolio.  Of the Deputies and Senators in attendance, five of us, including the Chairman, also sit on the special Committee on Climate Action.  I have just copped on to that now.  It is probably a unique circumstance.  Coillte's role in the context of climate change is something Ms Gray might clarify with regard to its huge portfolio, where it is going with the property and what the agency's policy in that space will be going forward.  Coillte was not involved in the hearings over recent weeks in the Oireachtas Committee on Climate Action.  The five members here were very much involved and will report in two weeks.  How does Coillte feel about that new space into which it is moving?  How can Coillte be a real leader in that space as an organisation whether it is on carbon or managing the landholding itself?  Where does Coillte see the landholding going with regard to hectares of forestry?  Will Coillte start another purchasing campaign?  Will Coillte seek to increase its acreage nationally?  If so, what is the target for the next decade on the amount of land or the acreage it expects will be under forestry as its core enterprise?  I realise that Coillte has diversified into other enterprises, but it is amazing to have a landowner here with approximately 7% of the land area of the State in its ownership.  It is a unique holding and it brings unique responsibilities.  Where does Coillte fit in, therefore, with climate action?  What are Ms Gray's personal views on it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2019031200002#C00500","speaker":"1386","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1552404600,"counter":20,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman.  I am not a member of the committee but I am very glad to be able to come here to put a couple of questions to Ms Gray.  I know her from previous work as chair of EirGrid.  I cannot think of a better person to take on the role at Coillte.  Her record and the work I have seen her do for the State are exemplary.  The way she managed EirGrid and other companies, her ongoing work with the GAA and other bodies and her roots in Longford suggest we are very lucky to have someone of her calibre who is willing and able to take on the role in Coillte.  We are at a point of complete and utter change for the company.  It is important that five of us here are on the climate action committee, which has done some very good work, in particular on land use.  The narrative of pestilence is out there and that the climate will be a disaster for Irish agriculture and land use, whereas it is the exact opposite.  It is opening up a new opportunity in how we manage our land.  We have to be strategic by having a land use plan and by working out what type of forestry is needed and where, what type of wetlands are needed and where, what type of biodiversity protection we need and where, and what type of farming we need and where.  That is not to be prescriptive at farm level but about optimising our carbon storage, the protection of biodiversity, the creation of rural amenities, the management of water quality and the management of flood protection, all of which were referred to in Ms Gray's opening address.  What I would love Ms Gray to do with Coillte, however, is to transform it completely and to redirect the company.  That is what is needed.<\/p><p>It is true, as Ms Gray said, that Coillte is now in a very good financial position, having emerged from a difficult period.  Matters have been rectified.  A great deal of consolidation has taken place and the company has shrunk in many ways.  Since it was established, Coillte has had a history of engaging in a certain type of commercial forestry and a certain type of commercial use of products.  All of that has to change because of climate change.  It must be change for the better.  It is not a negative or to disrespect what has gone before.  That had a real role and was beneficial for the country in many ways.  However, we need Coillte to do a hell of a lot more now.  As colleagues have said, it is around a completely different vision of forestry, in particular in different parts of the country.  I understand that the characteristics of the north and west of the country are very different from those of the south and east.  We may well need different forestry policies for different climate reasons.  We face drought in the east and excessive storms and rain in the north and west.  On the forests we are looking for, the opposition in Leitrim and Roscommon is genuine, real and reasonable.  We cannot achieve the level of afforestation we will need with the current forestry model.  We cannot black out large parts of Ireland with dense, single species, clear-felled forestry.  We must move to continuous cover and create what are almost parklands rather than forestry plantations <i>per se<\/i>.  In doing that, we can achieve all of those objectives around having a forest that is a joy to walk in.  These are forests that promote rich biodiversity, maintain water quality and do not, in the clear-felling process, create water problems such as those we have had.<\/p><p>The first key message is that Coillte will get support in the Oireachtas for a complete change in the company's mandate to recognise this reality.  Certainly, that exists in our cross-party report.  We will support a complete redefinition of what we are searching for in our national forestry plantation system.  We will have to match that with new incentives and new financing mechanisms.  While I am confident we will be able to do so, Coillte must step up to the plate urgently and at huge scale.  We need to go to something like 20,000 ha per annum.  We need long-term thinking because forestry like this is an 80 to 100-year project.  That is the way we need to go and Coillte will get political support if it agrees.  It will match what is happening and best practice in European forestry and it will require a school of new foresters who are superb in their management.  It is very employment-dense in the most rural parts of Ireland, which is one of the real prizes.  There is a huge opportunity also for our two State companies with large landbanks, Coillte and Bord na M&oacute;na, to be involved centrally in rural transformation.  We want community energy.  I see Coillte as a publicly owned company in that wider community sense.<\/p><p>Coillte should hold on to its assets.  I welcome very much the development of the large wind farm in Galway recently, but I regret that it was sold on.  I do not see why Coillte should not build up an asset base of renewable energy projects.  Ms Gray mentioned the potential to develop 1,000 MW which would, on its own, bring us a long way towards meeting our 2030 renewable targets as part of a wider strategic plan.  It should not be a develop and sell on approach, however.  It should be to develop and hold in treasure in the ownership of the Irish people as vested in a State company, Coillte.  How we do that without breaking European rules is a matter of being clever but Coillte has the landbank and that is the real asset.  The State should be willing to support that and to look at a range of funding mechanisms to make it happen.  First and foremost, Coillte is and must remain a forestry company.  However, it is a new forestry company.  What we need is living, breathing, high-quality, biodiverse, rich, community enhancing forestry everywhere at scale.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2019031200002#D00200","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1552404600,"counter":21,"content":"<p>The theme of climate action occurs in all of the questions members have posed.

It recognises that its responsibility is to optimise the use of a natural asset and resource for Ireland in a way that underpins Ireland's overall policies, not just in the climate action context, but in a whole range of areas.  It is very conscious of that.  What Deputy Ryan identifies as the need for an ever-changing approach to forestry and how it is used is clearly recognised and felt by the management team and board in Coillte.  I should preface any response, however, by noting that I am two weeks in this role and have not yet had a meeting with my board.

It was quite clear that the public perceive forestry to have assumed a predominance which it did not have previously.  People view it as a vocational issue in terms of the necessity for Ireland to utilise the asset extremely carefully.  It was part of Coillte's understanding of that which underpinned the request for the survey in the first place.  Coillte is very conscious of its responsibilities and the issue of climate action and the various manifestations of it, which I will go through in due course.<\/p> <p>  To respond to Senator Mulherin's questions, there is no doubt but there were areas of poor communication regarding the farm partnership scheme.  There is also no doubt that the number and complexity of those schemes made it difficult to communicate in terms of the benefits.

The vast bulk of the participants in the partnership scheme are satisfied.<\/p> <p>  The second issue the Senator raised related to the rural economy, in particular, the desirability of adding value in each county of Ireland, particularly given the level of afforestation in Mayo and the processing of the outputs from that afforestation elsewhere in the country.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Pringle mentioned that the Forestry Act is the core legislation for Coillte, which undoubtedly it is.  It places a major responsibility on Coillte to operate in an efficient and effective way in the interests of the Irish State to optimise the return for Ireland.  There is a trade off in achieving that level of optimisation in terms of efficiency and effectiveness.  Ideally, it would be great to have regional centres for pulp processing close to where the forests lie.  Unfortunately, the economies of scale currently do not support that.  One of the key issues that arises currently with Medite Smartply in our two processing centres is the renewed possible level of capital investment in those plants to maintain their current levels of efficiency.  Coillte has to make a judgment as to where those resources are best deployed and make very careful investment decisions, which of themselves will yield a proper return.  Currently, while I can identify with the desirability of having the processing of wood closer to the location of afforestation, unfortunately the economies of scale do not support it.<\/p> <p>  Regarding joint venture development and the status of the current joint venture discussions with the ESB on renewable energy, those discussions are ongoing and the next milestone in those discussions will be around May as to where they might go or whether we can reach an acceptable path forward.  One of the key issues in utilising Coillte's resources is that approximately 20% of the land in Coillte is not optimal for afforestation but it has height and access to wind.  The point at issue is what should Coillte's role be in making use of that portion of the asset.  The conclusion Coillte reached in its last strategic review is that it is best deployed in the development of a renewable energy source but not as an operator of it.  It is not the core business of Coillte to run renewable energy areas but it certainly has an expertise in developing them because it knows its resource and where the best potential lies.  That is why Coillte disposed of its shareholding in three wind farms last year.  It recognised it should use its expertise within its core business and where opportunities present themselves, to use those assets in a optimal way to bring them to a stage of development where it can partner with somebody else who has greater expertise in renewable wind farms.  The ESB is one of those potential partners.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2019031200002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Bernie Gray"},{"type":"speech","time":1552404600,"counter":26,"content":"<p>Coillte has held on to the land.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2019031200002#E00400","speaker":"1366"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1552404600,"counter":27,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2019031200002#E00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Bernie Gray"},{"type":"speech","time":1552404600,"counter":28,"content":"<p>It owns that land asset.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2019031200002#E00600","speaker":"1366"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1552404600,"counter":29,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2019031200002#E00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Bernie Gray"},{"type":"speech","time":1552404600,"counter":30,"content":"<p>Regarding Coillte plans to develop 1,000 MW of renewable energy by 2030, I am familiar with Coillte's involvement with wind energy.

Some of the climate action activities will be commercial and some non-commercial, or not-for-profit.  The challenge is to generate enough profit and cash from the commercial activities to give options in respect of the not-for-profit activities.  Coillte is very conscious of this.  As part of its strategic review, it is considering grouping its not-for-profit activities, some of which will fall into the area of climate action, into a cohesive unit in order that it can focus on and generate momentum in those efforts.<\/p> <p>  As outlined in my statement, there are a number of things Coillte does through its core forestry function that deal with climate mitigation, including the use of forestry for the sequestration of carbon and the processing of wood for non-carbon-related products.  It is continuously exploring new technologies and product bases, which will be associated with non-carbon usage and add to Coillte's role in that respect.  It is not the creator of climate action policy but can certainly facilitate it.

It is an excellent example of how partnership can work and it was great to hear additional funding is being provided for it and others across the country in a recent funding announcement.  I see the use of the forest for recreational purposes as being of great advantage and it is marvellous that Coillte is not in any way preventing people from going into the forests for insurance reasons or whatever.  People feel they have access to these woods and that they belong to us to an extent, even though Coillte is managing them.  Another example is Scohaboy Bog, in Cloughjordan beside Sopwell Wood.

We will not go into the reasons but there were a lot of objections.<\/p><p>Many of these objections and much of the climate denial were born from a lack of communication on the reasons we needed renewable energy.  Will Ms Gray elaborate on how Coillte will engage with communities on this?  Community engagement is very important.  Bord na M&oacute;na is a model of how this can works well.  It is a trusted State agency which engages really well with communities.  Detailed engagement is crucial to get these types of projects over the line.  Has Ms Gray explored this issue?  <\/p><p> On the bioeconomy and woodland diversity, I note that one fifth of Coillte's planting is biodiverse.  I do not know for how long it will be possible to sustain the current monoculture.  Sitka spruce forest is very silent because there is not much life in it compared with what one would find in a broadleaf forest, for example, where a variety of different plants have self-seeded.  Is Ms Gray considering increasing the percentage of broadleaf woodland to increase biodiversity?  As previous speakers noted, the committee on climate action has given a great deal of consideration to what we need to do.  Some of the committee's members are concerned about high levels of certain types of monoculture in certain parts of the country.  County Leitrim was mentioned.  We want to avoid that but at the same time we have responsibilities around the amount of planting we must do.<\/p><p> How much bogland is held by Coillte?  I referred to Scohaboy bog but there must be other bogs.  Does Coillte envisage a role for the company in rewetting some of those bogs as part of our efforts to manage carbon reduction?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2019031200002#G01800","speaker":"1339","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1552404600,"counter":68,"content":"<p>Senator Conway-Walsh asked about a hard Brexit.  The implications for Coillte of a hard Brexit are stark and probably unique among semi-State companies.  This is because one of the key divisions in Coillte is wood processing which derives 40% of its revenue from the UK.  The UK is the second largest importer of wood and wood products in the world and we have built up a large market there for our products.  Coillte has taken extensive steps to prepare for what it knows about what a hard Brexit will mean.  It is likely to mean the imposition of tariffs of up to 7%, thereby reducing margins.  It is likely to result in delays in processing and transport.  To counter that we should first look at Coillte's financial health.  The company has a much stronger balance sheet now than it has ever had.  Its capacity to sustain a reduction in margins is now much greater than it was previously as a consequence of all the work that has been done on the financial health of the company.  Moreover, Coillte has stockpiled to some extent in the UK to give it a transition phase in the event that a hard Brexit occurs and to allow the market to adjust itself.<\/p> <p>  Given that the UK's need for forestry products, from Ireland and elsewhere, is so great, it is likely that there will be more macroeconomic initiatives taken by the UK to deal with the issue.  Any imperfections or inefficiencies that occur in the market as a consequence of a hard Brexit should be mitigated over time because of necessity.  Otherwise, there will be serious implications for the UK, not to speak of Ireland.  In summary, Coillte is in a much better position than it has ever been in to deal with any reduction in margin occurring as the result of the imposition of tariffs.  While has significant exposure to the UK market, it has taken and plans a number of measures to mitigate that, at least in the early phases.  In common with many others, we will have to wait and see what happens, but we are flexible enough to deal with whatever emerges.<\/p> <p>  On community and consultation, one of Coillte's key advantages, similar to Bord na M&oacute;na to which Deputy Corcoran Kennedy referred, is its staff.  The company has a nationwide staff of foresters who are respected by local communities and understand and live in local communities.  This gives Coillte a very good base to understand what is important to communities and how it should consult them.  Coillte is also one of the primary companies involved in providing community gain funds.  Where initiatives are taken which have implications locally, the company is prepared to invest through community gain and moneys into local activities to recognise the implications for local communities of any changes it may make.<\/p> <p>  On what Coillte will do in the future, as the company's range of activities increases and its diversification into using forestry for recreation and climate change purposes intensifies, it clearly recognises the need for ongoing consultation.  The key issue will be the extent to which we can use our own staff on the ground who understand the issue from a community base to inform Coillte's approaches.  This is something Eirgrid did not have when it was rolling out its transmission development.  As the former chairperson of Eirgrid, I know what risks it ran as a consequence.  Having a national resource through one's team is a major benefit and Coillte is committed to this.<\/p> <p>  I do not have specific details on flooding plans but I will revert to the committee on the matter.  As part of the forestry management system, a flood plan is developed for each site where such a need occurs, and this is done on a dedicated basis.  If members need any further detail beyond that, I will be happy to come back to them.<\/p> <p>  I thank Deputy Corcoran Kennedy for her remarks on the initiatives we have taken.  These are part of an ongoing approach of strategic partnerships which Coillte wants to use for the future development of resources.<\/p> <p>  On bogs, I referred to the use of cutaway bogs and consultation with Bord na M&oacute;na where the opportunity exists and it is optimal to use this land for afforestation rather than turf production.  We are in ongoing discussions with Bord na M&oacute;na in that respect.<\/p> <p>  On monoculture and diversity, it takes between 15 and 20 years for forests to mature.  The science and technology behind forestry, no more than any other technologies, were in a different place 15 or 20 years ago.  Coillte at that time made the best judgments it could in terms of its species diversity and its pattern of planting.  As the science of forestry has improved, Coillte is constantly trying to incorporate new and emerging best practices into it current stock.  However, that takes time.  One cannot simply cut the trees down at a less than optimal place because it is clear that the mix or style of planting is wrong.  However Coillte is very conscious, as part of its forestry management plan, how it will do that over time as the new science emerges.  I was heartened to see the level of investment in technology to help Coillte use the asset.<\/p><p>One of the challenges with having such a large asset base is knowing what one has and where one has it.  To optimise the asset, one must start from that premise and make the best use of fines to go beyond the monoculture.  Coillte has invested strongly in its forestry management system and it is heartening to see it combined with the local knowledge and expertise of the forestry staff who operate it.  <\/p><p> On the question about bogland, I do not know how many bogs there are but I will revert to the Deputy in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2019031200002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Bernie Gray","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1552404600,"counter":70,"content":"<p>I apologise for being late but I had to deal with another important issue.  Mrs Gray is very welcome.  She has much experience and given that she comes from a rural area of County Longford, I anticipate that her sympathies may be more consistent with the importance of the industry in places such as rural County Longford or rural County Westmeath, where I come from.  She will know the importance of Glennon Brothers and what it has done there.  It is a tremendous international company which will watch Brexit closely in respect of exports and so on, although at least it has a presence in Scotland and, therefore, the impact of a hard Brexit, which grows ever more likely, may be mitigated for it.  My uncle worked in forestry for 40 years and worked in the former Department with responsibility for forestry, which predated Coillte.  I greatly regret that while Ms Gray's predecessor may well have turned forestry around, a role which she will continue, it has been at a considerable sacrifice.  There is much forestry around my home.  County Westmeath has good land with large tracts of forestry in Barrettstown, where I live.  I remember three or four men used to carry out thinning all year and do all that type of work.  They worked in Moranstown, in the red bog, across the way into the forest at Ballinafid and up to Loughnavalley.  One would find a snipe, which is a dying breed, more quickly than one would find a human being.<\/p> <p>  I love the bottom-line scenario that is always outlined by people such as Ms Gray, who is an accountant, although I cannot condemn accountants because my daughter is a chartered accountant and, therefore, I am not into that.  Accountants always look at the bottom line, however, and all they go after are the EBITA, and so on.  I supported the Government in 2011 and 2012 when the issue arose and when Coillte was being begged for &euro;3 million or &euro;4 million in dividends, but the dividends are now at &euro;15 million or &euro;16 million over a period.  While that is a great return, and while I am all in favour of getting a return for the State, we were very poor at that time.  I recall the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, would scrape a pot together for a couple of million euros but we are now a little better off than that and, therefore, some of the money must be reinvested.<\/p> <p>  We should not discard the human input in what can achieved in forestry.  The mechanisation is all right.  I understand that Coillte manages approximately 1 million acres, which is large, but few labourers are working in the maintenance of forests and very few people are employed.  At one time, the aim was to plant approximately 10,000 ha.  We fiddled around with 5,000 ha and 6,000 ha, and there was almost a cheer from the sidelines when we achieved 7,000 ha.  For a business with State input - I note Deputy Eamon Ryan's presence - it is a disgrace.  How can we encourage ordinary people to invest in forestry when the very vehicle that was brought into being by the State has failed to achieve its own targets.  Will Ms Gray, as chairperson, ensure that we set about achieving those targets?  I will not lecture anyone on the importance of forestry.  Forests are a large reservoir for the protection and preservation of wildlife and they play an important role in the preservation of flora and fauna.  Young people can be brought to the forest.  There are many recreational, environmental, sustainable benefits, including for holiday and leisure, an area in which Coillte has recently begun work.  At one time, I thought Coillte was going to enter the nursing home sector but wise heads prevailed.  Even I, as a non-accountant, would say Coillte would have pulled the plug on that if it had been plugged before Coillte reached it.<\/p> <p>  Such benefits are why I became angry when I heard talk of the forest plantation objectives not being achieved.  I am strongly in favour of carbon sequestration and we have seen the vital role it has.  I hope that Coillte will work with farmers because there are great opportunities for those with small tracts of marginal land, and even those with not so marginal land, to engage and work on 5 ha or 10 ha.  I hope that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine will eventually incentivise them to do that.  While I acknowledge that it is not Ms Gray's remit, she is a person of figures.  Farmers cannot go on forever producing products before they are decimated, such as in the suckler cow area.  They will need something to supplement their income, and forestry represents significant potential for them in that regard.  There must be a role for the farming community.  Coillte should be prepared to work with the farming community on a collaborative basis, not as a competition.<\/p> <p>  Coillte has extended its commercial remit, which I understand.  I attended all the openings, although I cannot recall the name of the company.  It is shocking the way one's mind slips.  Coillte sold an area of land at Newcastle Wood, County Longford, with which the committee will be familiar.  It is a large holiday home site that will open in the summer ahead of schedule.  I cannot think of the company even though I met its representatives on 100 occasions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2019031200002#J00200","speaker":"1370"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1552404600,"counter":71,"content":"<p>Center Parcs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2019031200002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Bernie Gray"},{"type":"speech","time":1552404600,"counter":72,"content":"<p>It will be huge and I commend Coillte in that regard.

I will not be unfair to her in that regard.  There is much potential for Coillte to continue its work and there are targets to be achieved.  Coillte should set out to ensure that we become even more self-sufficient in our hardwood products and so on, which are important not only for achieving the carbon reduction targets but also for the industry.  We often must import much of our roofing materials, for example, but much of that can be made in Ireland and it would also contribute to the construction industry.<\/p> <p>  I wish Ms Gray well in her tenure as chairperson and acknowledge her wide and varied expertise.

It is making those preparations in the context of a group which has been established with IBEC and will continue to do so.<\/p> <p>  On the staffing and human element of Coillte, part of the consequences of efficiencies is the production of cash and an increased delivery in the return on forestry, which gives Coillte and the State options that they did not have before.

Without further incentivisation, the cost of land makes that prohibitive for Coillte.  The company is conscious of the afforestation targets but the issue is at what cost that is done.  Part of our previous discussion focused on adopting a different economic model nationwide for the next phase of afforestation.

The purpose of this part of the meeting is to have an engagement in respect of the delivery of services for students with Down's syndrome.  On behalf of the committee, I wish to welcome Ms Fidelma Brady, national education officer with Down Syndrome Ireland, Ms Moira Leydon, assistant general secretary of the Association of Secondary Teachers in Ireland, ASTI, who has been before this committee on a number of occasions, Mr. Colm Kelly, from the Teachers Union of Ireland, TUI, Ms Maeve McCafferty, from the Irish National Teachers Organisation, INTO, and Mr. Eddie Ward, principal officer with the Department of Education and Skills, who has also been with us before.  <\/p> <p>  The committee is eager to examine the challenges and opportunities for students with Down's syndrome as they access educational services.  We have spoken about this topic often in the past.  Research has shown that the vast majority of children with Down's syndrome enrol in their mainstream local primary school and are progressing to mainstream post-primary education, if there is a place locally providing that opportunity.<\/p><p>However, quite often we find there are not doing that.  All students and teachers need our support.  The success of inclusive education in Ireland is testament to the professionalism and commitment shown by teachers and school staff to students with special educational needs.  Special needs assistants, SNAs, also play an important role.  One of the main reasons for this meeting is to discuss individualised education plans and inequality of access to an extended school year, which is the July provision, for students with Down's syndrome.  We look forward to examining all those issues in key detail.<br\/><br\/>The format of the meeting is that I will invite all the witnesses to make a brief opening statement of a maximum of three minutes, which will be followed by an engagement with members of the committee.

Students with Down's syndrome have the right to be educated in their local mainstream school under the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD, but currently schools are encouraged rather than obligated to provide an individual education plan.  The answer to a recent parliamentary question about the implementation and resourcing of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs, EPSEN, Act 2004 makes it clear that the Minister accepts that the funds needed for its full implementation have not, and will not, be provided.  The current Department of Education and Skill's position seems to be that schools are encouraged to implement large parts of the EPSEN Act without having the necessary resources.  Down Syndrome Ireland has long campaigned for the EPSEN Act to be fully enacted so that the rights of students with additional educational needs are enshrined in law, rather than depending on encouragement from the Department and the goodwill of schools and teachers.<\/p> <p>  However, in Down Syndrome Ireland we cannot stand by while teachers&rsquo; unions advise members to take action which discriminates against students who have intellectual disabilities.  We believe that students with Down's syndrome will suffer and will struggle to be successful in education if they do not have a structured individualised education plan in place.  Planning for this needs to be co-ordinated by teachers who are given the training, resources and non-contact time necessary to carry out this duty effectively.  In this regard, we need an acknowledgement that fully inclusive education is a right, not a privilege, and for a plan to be initiated immediately to ensure that teachers are resourced and trained to meet the needs of all their students. <\/p> <p>  Regarding the July provision, it provides funding for an extended school year for children with a severe to profound general learning disability, GLD, or children with autism spectrum disorder, ASD.  We recognise that there are faults with the July provision scheme.  In its current form, it is discriminatory because it excludes most students with Down's syndrome.  Like ADS, students with Down's syndrome have complex educational needs and they are likely to regress educationally unless they have some support in place for a portion of the summer break.<\/p><p>Like students with ASD those with Down's syndrome have complex educational needs and are likely to regress educationally unless they have some level of support in place for a portion of the summer break.  We have been told many times by teachers and parents that the long summer break is detrimental to the learning and retention of skills.  We have questioned the Department of Education and Skills and various members on this matter and the response we receive is that the provision scheme is under review and no revisions will happen until the review is complete.  In the meantime, students continue to progress through the educational system without the supports they need in order to reach their potential.  It is not acceptable to Down's syndrome Ireland that such discrimination continues while a review of the scheme is carried out.  Our experience of previous departmental reviews is that they take a considerable length of time to lead to action, sometimes many years.  We are calling for an interim agreement to be put in place to meet the needs of our members with July provision to be made immediately available to all students with Down's syndrome regardless of their intellectual ability. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2019031200002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Fidelma Brady","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1552404600,"counter":89,"content":"<p>It is nice to be back here discussing a really serious issue.  Ms Brady started us off on the right note when she prefaced her contribution with the phrase \"right to education\".  That is an absolutely core element of our engagement with students with special and additional needs.  I looked at the Down's syndrome Ireland website this morning and read the very pertinent point that we were one of the last countries to ratify the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  We have considerable ground to make up.  We can all, however, justifiably say that inclusion is one of the success stories in Irish education.  Over 90% of young people with special educational needs are in mainstream schools.  That is phenomenal and is a testament to teachers, parents, legislators and Ministers for Education over the decades.<\/p> <p>  One of the challenging aspects of special educational needs in our system is that the definition in our legislation means that there is a very high prevalence, estimated between 20% and 25%.  This is a systemic challenge.  How does a school system provide additional resources and supports for almost a quarter of the student cohort at any given time?  <\/p> <p>  Second, the system change to support this inclusion process has been significant.  The recent school admissions legislation will make sure that every school and every sector of education play by the same rules.  There has been curriculum change for level 1 and 2 programmes, which are a huge development on what we have had in the past.  It is really significant that, with departmental recommendations and system research, we have seen that the withdrawal method, taking students out of mainstream classes, is not the best way forward.  The best way is for students to be in the mainstream with the additional supports, with teacher differentiation, etc.  <\/p> <p>  We are here because we have a problem.  As Ms Brady said, the second level teacher unions have reached an almost critical point in what our members tell us about our capacity to implement the new model whereby classroom teachers are required to engage in extensive planning for individual pupils.  I must put on record that there is absolutely no objection to planning for students with special educational needs.  Students have a right to education and schools and teachers must make sure that right is vindicated.  However, the teacher unions at second level are saying that they do not have the training or the dedicated time and at the moment they do not have clear enough guidance.  One of the challenging issues for second level schools, which are very complex institutions, is that there is no dedicated co-ordination time to co-ordinate not just the liaison between teachers around planning but more significantly the liaison between teachers and the external agencies, particularly for students who have more profound needs.  These are the classics of investment in education.<\/p><p>Teachers need time, which means less teaching time, more time for planning.  That requires investment.  We need training and we also need better communication strategies from the Department with the school system.  The co-ordination time is problematic for us.  The Department issued a circular which states that to make sure that resources are used for teaching purposes, co-ordination time should be kept to a minimum.  We find that particularly challenging because in complex institutions such as schools with between 700 and 1,000 pupils, dedicated planning time is needed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2019031200002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Moira Leydon","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1552404600,"counter":91,"content":"<p>The TUI represents more than 17,000 teachers and lecturers employed by education and training boards, ETBs, voluntary secondary schools, community and comprehensive, C&amp;C, schools and the institutes of technology.

The TUI welcomes this opportunity to make a submission to the committee on the delivery of services for students with Down's syndrome.  Some 0.18% of all children are diagnosed with Down's syndrome, which equates to approximately 1,600 students in primary and post-primary schools.  We are not aware of any specific data for the post-primary sector alone.<\/p> <p>  Data clearly show that students with special educational needs, SEN, such as those with Down's syndrome, are far more likely to attend ETB and C&amp;C schools than voluntary secondary schools.  The TUI believes that all students should be able to access mainstream schools unless the needs of the students are so serious that they could not cope in a mainstream school.  For this to happen, it must be supported by the resourcing of both schools and support services.<\/p> <p>  Staff who pursue additional qualifications in the area of SEN must be recompensed.  It is important to note that the role of the teacher is to support the education of the child while the SNA, if applicable, can cater to the care needs of the child.  All schools should accept students with SEN.<\/p> <p>  A commitment to implementing the EPSEN Act 2004 is essential if provision for students with SEN is to be adequately and appropriately addressed.  However, full implementation will only be possible when sufficient resources are allocated.  More than ten years ago, the TUI emphasised that schools were not sufficiently resourced to implement individual education plans for SEN students.  The TUI has been calling for the full implementation, and resourcing, of the EPSEN Act for almost 15 years.  We have reiterated that call four times in the past year alone.  However, we have been told by successive Governments that the funding is not available to enact the remaining provisions of the legislation.  In the absence of appropriate resourcing, TUI members cannot be required to implement individual education plans.  To do so would create the false impression for parents and guardians that a school has a developed capacity to deliver the level of service promised in the EPSEN Act.  It is the moral and legal responsibility of the State, acting through the Department, to provide the necessary resources.  The TUI cannot, and will not, countenance an opportunistic transfer of that responsibility, or of any associated culpability, from the State to teachers.  We have informed members that our objection to a medicalised, administratively heavy individual education plan process does not apply to normal, professionally appropriate and sustainable classroom planning by teachers for differentiated teaching and learning that takes due account of the strengths and needs of the students they serve and of the contexts in which they teach.<\/p> <p>  We would like to make the following recommendations to the committee: recent changes in guidance provision, Circular 12-2017, and middle management posts, Circular 3-2018, are not enough to support fully students with SEN.  A much larger move in terms of restoration of both is also needed.  Teachers should be able to access continuing professional development, CPD, to best support students with SEN; schools should be able to access support from the significantly under-pressure support services.  Education, at all levels, should be available to every child, the deciding factor being what is in the best interests of the child.<\/p> <p>  The Department of Education and Skills must make clear, once and for all, if it ever intends to fully implement and resource the EPSEN Act.  If it cannot implement and resource EPSEN as originally intended, then will it join us in examining a more appropriate method of supporting students with Down's syndrome to achieve a better outcome for the students? <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2019031200002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Colm Kelly"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1552404600,"counter":92,"content":"<p>The INTO thanks the Oireachtas for the opportunity to be here as representatives for more than 35,000 primary teachers in the South of Ireland.  Currently, children with Down's syndrome attend both special and mainstream schools.  Their educational placement is determined by their needs and by the choice of their parents.  The learning ability of children with Down's syndrome varies from severe and profound general learning disability to mild general learning disability.<\/p><p>Therefore, the learning needs of children with Down's syndrome also vary.  Children with Down's syndrome who attend special schools are in classes of approximately six to eight pupils.  Children with Down's syndrome in mainstream schools could be in classes of 30 pupils or more and usually receive additional support from the special education team.  The INTO is of the view that educational provision for children with Down's Syndrome should be in a continuum, depending on their unique needs.  The greatest lacuna in providing support for children with special educational needs, including children with Down's syndrome, is the lack of therapies.  Children with special educational needs often require speech and language therapy, occupational therapy or other therapies such as behavioural therapy and counselling.  The INTO welcomes the piloting of a model to provide school based therapy services.  Not all children with Down's syndrome require therapies, but when they do, they should be available, regardless of whether the children attend special or mainstream schools.<\/p><p> The Special Education Support Service, SESS, which is now part of the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, provides professional development opportunities for teachers.  While the SESS provides valuable and high quality professional development opportunities, they are insufficient.  In addition to courses and seminars, there is a need to develop in-school sustained support services.  All newly qualified teachers have studied special and inclusive education as part of their initial teacher education courses, but it is important that teachers have opportunities throughout their career to continue their learning and development in the area of special education.  The certificate and diploma courses provided by colleges of education are highly regarded, but they are only accessible to teachers in special education posts.  Given the policy focus on inclusion, all teachers - mainstream and special education - should have access to certificate and diploma courses in special education.  <\/p><p> The July provision scheme is very valuable for children with severe and profound learning disabilities and ASD as it allows for continuity and as little interruption as possible in the education of children who require stability and consistency.  However, the fact that the July provision scheme is confined to children with severe and profound learning disabilities and ASD is seen as excluding other children with learning disabilities such as children with Down's syndrome.  In its policy advice on the education of children with ASD the NCSE recommended that the July provision scheme be reviewed.  There are many practical issues to be addressed such as who should be entitled to additional educational provision during the summer, what the nature of summer educational programmes supported by the State should be and the practical arrangements to be made pertaining to the curriculum, employment and location.  The INTO welcomes the proposal to review the operation and purpose of the July provision scheme.  <\/p><p> Children with Down's syndrome thrive in schools, be they special or mainstream, where teachers have been afforded the opportunity to avail of appropriate professional development courses on the education of children with Down's syndrome and suitable supports are in place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2019031200002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Maeve McCafferty","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1552404600,"counter":94,"content":"<p>I invite Mr. Ward to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2019031200002#J00200","speaker":"1257"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1552404600,"counter":95,"content":"<p>I thank the joint committee for the invitation to present to it.  Government policy on supporting children with special educational needs aims to ensure all children with special needs, including children with Down's syndrome, have access to an education appropriate to their needs.  The policy is to provide for inclusive education to ensure the maximum possible integration of children with special needs into ordinary mainstream schools.  Where pupils require more targeted interventions, special class or special school placements are also provided.  Significant financial provision is made to ensure all children with special educational needs can access education.  The Department of Education and Skills spends approximately &euro;1.75 billion, or almost 19% of its total educational budget, annually in making additional provision for children with special educational needs.  The main supports provided with this funding are over 13,400 special education teachers in mainstream schools who provide additional teaching support for pupils with special needs, 15,000 special needs assistants, 125 special schools and over 1,450 special classes in mainstream schools.   Other supports include a funding scheme to provide assistive technology and fund special school transport arrangements.  A significant amount of time is put into the development of a new curriculum and innovation in that regard.  Professional development opportunities are provided for teachers, as well as teacher training.  Support for schools, including the July provision scheme, is also provided.  The Department's national educational psychological service provides support and advice for schools.  <\/p> <p>  The Department has established the NCSE to advise it on policy in meeting special educational needs and to develop and deliver a variety of support services for children and their families.  For example, schools and teachers can apply to the NCSE for help from its support service, including specialist support and guidance in all areas of special education, including children with Down's syndrome.<\/p><p>Support can take the form of workshops tailored to the needs of a school and the teachers in particular communities.  Approximately 2,500 applications were received for school supports in the 2017-18 school year.  <\/p><p> The NCSE also develops courses.  There is a particular course dedicated to dealing with children with Down's syndrome.  The NCSE has collaborated with Down Syndrome Ireland in the development of a number of differentiated lessons that are available to teachers and parents.  As part of its policy-making remit, from time to time the NCSE develops policy papers and advises the Department.  In so doing it conducts a lot of consultations with the various stakeholders.  Down Syndrome Ireland is one of the key organisations it consults.  Examples include the policy paper on the provision of education for children with autism spectrum disorder, the 2018 comprehensive review of the special needs assistant scheme and, more recently, the policy being developed on special schools and classes. <\/p><p> The Department aims to improve educational outcomes for all children, including those with special educational needs, and significant investment has been made.  I agree that providing for inclusion in schools has been one of the major successes in recent times.  As policies evolve and services develop, the Department and the NCSE will consult and work with all stakeholders, including Down Syndrome Ireland, to achieve the best possible educational outcomes for all children.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2019031200002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eddie Ward","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1552404600,"counter":97,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Ward for his presentation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2019031200002#K00200","speaker":"1257"},{"type":"speech","time":1552404600,"counter":98,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis na finn&eacute;ithe as ucht a gcur i l&aacute;thair inniu.  I thank the delegates for their presentations.  I have a couple of questions, most of which are for the Department.  <\/p> <p>  The Department describes a plan to record the support schools provide for pupils with special educational needs as beneficial both for schools and children and best practice.  However, as the Education for Persons with Special Needs, EPSEN, Act 2004 has not been fully implemented, it is not yet a statutory requirement for schools to have individual educational plans, IEPs, in place.  How many students with special educational needs do not have an individual learning plan?  We know that there is a need to put structured IEPs in place as such plans are essential for students with Down's syndrome.  All of the stakeholders are in agreement that IEPs must be co-ordinated by teachers who should be given non-contact time and provided with training and, critically, resources.  How does the Department plan to ensure all of this will happen?  Let us remember that we are talking about a fundamental human right.  When, if ever, does the Department intend to fully implement the EPSEN Act?  If it does not do so, the legislation is not worth the paper on which it is written.  It is appalling that it still has not been fully implemented in 2019.<\/p> <p>  The NCSE has recommended that an equitable day activity scheme be developed for all students with complex and special educational needs.  I understand an implementation group has been convened.  What is the timeframe for completion of the review?  What are possible solutions in the interim?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2019031200002#K00300","speaker":"1242"},{"type":"speech","time":1552404600,"counter":99,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to have all of the main stakeholders present.  Instinctively I always support trade unions.  I worked in one and come from a very strong trade union household.  However, I do not agree with the union's position on withdrawing IEPs, although I totally support its call for the provision of extra training, resources and anything else that is needed.  I am always an advocate for workers' rights, but the stance taken singles out a group of vulnerable students who probably have had to battle through a lot in their lives.  Their parents have also had to battle on their behalf.  Therefore, I do not think the stance taken is fair.  I would support the union fully if it were to take action, but in doing so it should not single out the students in question.  The position should be the same for every student.  I would be more supportive if workers sought to go on strike, work to rule or take other forms of industrial action if they did not completely withdraw that option, although the system is not perfect.  The stakeholders are the ones that deal with this matter on a daily basis and, therefore, know a lot more about it.  Obviously, there is a need for a lot more investment and more work to be done.  That is my question for the Department.  As I said, I strongly disagree with the stance taken because it was not the right thing to do.<\/p><p>I want to put that on the record because I feel strongly about it.  The Department is standing over a situation where these children are being left behind completely.  One of the most significant queries we deal with, regardless of whether it involves children with Down's syndrome or children with additional needs, is the constant battle they face to get anything to which they are supposed to be entitled.  We cannot talk about education being a right and about being inclusive if children are being left behind, which is what is happening.  It is not good enough.  This needs to be addressed right now and a timeframe regarding when it will be sorted out needs to be provided.  It should not be something that will drag on so that we will be sitting here in two years talking about the same thing with all those children having been failed.  We are constantly talking at this committee about different systems where children are falling through the cracks and we cannot allow it to keep happening.  I would stress this to the Department.  <\/p><p> I was going to ask about the EPSEN Act but Deputy Catherine Martin asked about that in terms of the timeframe for its full implementation.  We asked a question about it last week and one part of the answer stated that the Department believed level of investment required could be significantly greater than that envisaged in the NCSE report.  Is the Department saying that it will just cost too much money and that it will not bother with it?  It should at least be honest about that if that is the answer.  We need action on all of these issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2019031200002#K00400","speaker":"1266","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1552404600,"counter":101,"content":"<p>I thank the five contributors.

While my question is principally for the Department, could all the witnesses outline alternatives they would come up with?  Why do children's with Down's syndrome not qualify for July provision?  It is so important because they have so much to learn from it.  Many skills are taught during those couple of weeks.  Children with Down's syndrome can find summer very long whereas if they are coming to training courses such as baking, they are learning a skill.  They enjoy learning life skills during that period.

Our advice to our members, and it is advice rather than a directive or action, has been the same since 2004, which is that until Government through the Department properly resources the style of IEPs that are set out in sections 8 and 9 of the Act, our members are not properly resourced to implement that particular style of planning.

I sense the frustration and possibly anger in her comments, which is very legitimate.  What has precipitated this issue is that we now have a new allocation of teachers to schools, which as the Department has pointed out is a significant investment by the State.  Unfortunately, unlike other initiatives, such as the junior cycle or Project Maths, that new model has not been underpinned by a training roll-out.  It has not been underpinned by clarity of instruction as to where the roles fall.  To be fair to the Department, it provided some clarification to us some weeks ago on who was expected to do the educational planning and how it might best be co-ordinated within the school context.<\/p> <p>  We now have a new model and a new inspection regime introduced in January 2019 to see how the new model is working.  It will look at deployment of resources but more significantly it will look at learning outcomes for students with special needs.  I think teachers got worried that we now have an evaluation model, which is a very serious process, but they are not sure how it works and, more significantly, they do not feel they have been trained sufficiently to be able to do the type of complex planning required.  The planning is not just a sheet of paper.  We are talking about a continuum-of-support model with a continual iterative process of review of the students' progress etc.<\/p> <p>  Those are the factors behind the advice issued to members.  It is critical for all the stakeholders to sit down and work out a solution to the very clear-cut problems we have identified of time, training and co-ordination.  Teachers need incentives to engage in this further learning.  Because of its complex nature most of the training provided for special educational needs is at graduate diploma or postgraduate level and very costly to engage in.  We really need to underpin this type of complex learning by teachers by enabling them to access these programmes of learning at little or no cost.  I think there are very practical solutions to the impasse we are in, but we need to move on rather quickly.  The word the Deputy used is appropriate.

Rather than getting wrapped up in the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs, EPSEN, Act, which is a big issue of course, we need to remember that the right to inclusion has been enshrined in the convention regardless of whether the EPSEN Act is enacted.  The convention lists the barriers to inclusion.  As Deputy Catherine Martin has pointed out, we need the appropriate funding and the correct approaches.  There is a list of approximately ten barriers to inclusion.  If these barriers are not removed, not only will the convention not be enacted, but we would certainly in trouble with the EPSEN Act.  Inadequate funding mechanisms are listed.  Without the incentives for the training to be provided, it will not be.<\/p> <p>  We talked a bit about the training provided for teachers.  My background is as a primary teacher.  I carry out a lot of training in schools as part of my job.  I go to primary and post-primary schools giving teachers a bit of training and information to give them some kind of foothold as they have children with Down's syndrome in their mainstream schools.  Very often that is the only option for schools.  My colleague from the Department referred to the special education support services, SESS, quotas.<\/p><p>As they would say in the country, they are like hens' teeth.  People cannot get on a course.  There could be a two-year waiting list to try to get somebody to come in and do a little bit of training on L&aacute;mh.  We need to be realistic.  We need adequate funding.   Even before my time in the organisation, Down Syndrome Ireland has been calling for a roll-out of training and not just continuous professional development where teachers can do certain courses.  We need to look at initial teacher training.  What is going on in training college?<\/p><p> On my behalf and on behalf of Down Syndrome Ireland, I emphasise I am not coming down hard on teachers in this.  I want to make that clear to all the unions.  I find that teachers bend over backwards to work with these children, but in very difficult situations.  It is impossible to find enough time in the day.  For many years I was a teaching principal in a primary school and I found it impossible.  If I was not given extra time I do not know where I would even start to do IEPs.  We are looking at the training time, the non-contact time and the resources to be put in place.  I would call for a national roll-out of training for teachers before setting unrealistic expectations for what they can produce.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2019031200002#M00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Fidelma Brady","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1552404600,"counter":109,"content":"<p>I wish to address the issue of planning in schools.  Since the enactment of the Education Act 1998, schools have been obliged to plan and ensure an appropriate education is provided to all children attending the school.  In that way teachers know their children's needs and provide for them in accordance with the resources available to them.  Reference has been made to the individual education plan provided for in the 2004 EPSEN Act.  That section of the Act was not commenced at the time.  It reflected the thinking at the time that a student's needs were assessed and then resources were allocated to the child on the basis of the assessment.  It is fair to say that policy has evolved and practice has changed considerably since then.  I again emphasise the level of investment that has taken place in schools with additional teachers and SNAs since that time.  In particular, since 2011 the number of special education teachers has increased by more than 40%.  Likewise the number of SNAs has increased.<\/p> <p>  Reference was made to how we allocate teaching resources to schools.  A new model has now meant that additional teachers are preloaded into the system in accordance with the school profile.  It is then left to the school to use its professional judgment with the guidance and support available to it in allocating those resources to the children most in need.  The research done by the NCSE to support this model found this to be by far the best way of doing it.  The resources are allocated to the school and when the child comes to the school the resources are in place along with the supports for the teachers and the schools in making decisions on allocating the resources available to them.<\/p> <p>  Planning is a normal part of school life.  Schools must ensure that every child receives an appropriate education.  Considering the resources given to schools since 2011, it would be ridiculous if the school did not have planning in place to ensure the best possible allocation of those resources, resulting in the best possible education given to the children who are most in need.  Planning is essential and is also good professional practice.<\/p> <p>  One of my colleagues raised the issue of planning time.  All the Department's circulars about giving the additional resources to schools provide for additional planning time, but schools need to make a judgment as to what is appropriate to their needs.  Clearly the amount of time needed will vary from school to school.  The people on the ground are in the best position to decide how much co-ordination time is required.<\/p> <p>  The Department, the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, and the NCSE provide a range of supports, guidance and professional developments for teachers and schools.<\/p><p>The view of the Department's inspectorate which inspects schools up and down the country on a regular basis is that planning is taking place and that resources are being used well.  While we continually need to tweak and enhance the guidance we give and the professional development training we provide, we are on an upward trajectory in what we want to do in providing for children with special needs.  Reference has been made to therapeutic supports.  The Department has taken a very innovative approach in that regard.  Reference has been made to a project under way in the Kildare and Wicklow area.  In-school therapies are being used to good advantage to secure better outcomes for children.  <\/p><p> On the July provision, we take on board the point made by members.  The NCSE flagged that there was an issue of equity in that regard.  The provision is confined to two categories of special needs - children with severe and profound intellectual disabilities and students with autism spectrum disorder.  We have a group looking at the issue.  More than 9,000 students avail of the provision each year and our view is that it should be broadened to make it more equitable.  Somebody summed it up very neatly when they asked who should avail of it, what the content should be and how it should be rolled out.  They are very good questions and considering them will put us on a good path.  When we develop proposals, something we expect to do in the coming months, we will consult on them.  There will not be changes this year, but we can faithfully say we will move on the issue and that there will be some change in the next 12 months.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2019031200002#N00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eddie Ward","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1552404600,"counter":111,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Ward for the clarification.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2019031200002#O00200","speaker":"1257"},{"type":"speech","time":1552404600,"counter":112,"content":"<p>Mr. Ward has mentioned that planning is essential and that it is part of good professional practice.

I had reached circular overload by 2016, by which time I had been involved in teaching for 20 years.  Overload seems to have been reached since 2011.  Teachers were reaching initiative and circular overload because the resources needed were not being put in place.  Teachers are being told to implement these initiatives; they are being told about the drive-bys and that they face inspection after inspection.  They know, however, that it is just a case of filling in a sheet or a form, but they cannot give children the proper education they deserve and should experience because they do not have the resources to do so.  They need that non-contact time and funding.  Essentially, they need training.<\/p> <p>  I worked in a DEIS school with many fantastic children who enriched my teaching experience because of their vast array of special educational needs.  That is why I loved where I was teaching.  However, it was frustrating as we only received a certain level of continuing professional development training.  Someone would come in the afternoon, or when a specific need had presented in the school, rather than training being provided at the very beginning, as Ms Brady suggested.  Teachers do not need to be trained when a specific need presents, rather they need to be armed with all of the training they need in order that when an issue presents, they will be ready to hit the ground running.  That is what every teacher in a primary and secondary school wants and what every parent of a child with special educational needs wants.  It is also what the parents of a child who does not have special educational needs wants.  For children to receive their fundamental human right to a proper, inclusive and thorough education, teachers must be resourced.  They must have the non-contact time they need and it is essential that they be trained properly.  I know that this is not Mr. Ward's decision to make but the Minister's.<\/p><p>He must prioritise our children with special educational needs.  That means not passing the buck and saying it is down to the school to allocate the resources when they present themselves.  We have had enough of that approach in our schools and it is not working.  I ask Mr. Ward, as a result of this meeting, to pass the buck to the Minister and put the proper resources in place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2019031200002#O00300","speaker":"1242","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1552404600,"counter":114,"content":"<p>The answers have clarified what page we should all be on and shown that, while it seemed as if there were differences, we are all agreed that we need to provide resources, planning, teachers and teacher time to achieve the rights of children with a variety of disabilities, including Down's syndrome, in our schools.  Ms Brady placed importance on the ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  The Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act is also relevant but, as has been said, elements of that legislation have still not been implemented.  The ratification of the UN convention has placed this issue in a rights based context.  From the point of view of the committee's report, we need to focus on how we put in place the resources, time, etc., that are required in order for children to vindicate that right.  It is about funding, teacher time, initial teacher training and education and continuous professional development for teachers in the system.<\/p> <p>  Most of my questions are for Mr. Ward or anybody else who has information on quantifying what resources are available.  It has been said that some of the planning happens in the schools but I agree with other members who say that, for teachers to do that, they need time to plan.  Is there any assessment on the actual resources required in terms of extra planning hours for teachers, training hours and the funding for all of this?  Such an assessment will be required if we are to implement this properly.<\/p> <p>  It is obviously correct to say that significant resources have been put into special education since 2011 but we are in a new place now in the sense that we have the new model and the UN convention has been ratified.  We also have a recovering economy and should be able to put the necessary resources in place.<\/p> <p>  I want to ask more about July provision because it has not received as much attention as the individual education plan.  It is really important for young people to have the opportunity to access July provision where it would be helpful to them.  Access is highly restricted at the moment, however.  Mr. Ward told us that a review is under way and would be concluded in the coming months.  Could he give an idea as to when he expects recommendations to be forthcoming?  The benefits of July provision are evident from anybody who accesses it.  It gives continuity through the summer months that is particularly needed for children with learning difficulties of one kind or another.  I would like to see progress on that.  Has there been an assessment on the kinds of resources that would be needed in terms of funding, training and teachers?  There is, or was, a list of people who give July provision.  Is that still the case?  Is there a shortage of teachers for July provision?  It is not a scheme that many people know about but it is extremely beneficial to many children.  I would not like to think we have put very little focus on July provision today because it is an important scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2019031200002#P00200","speaker":"1325"},{"type":"speech","time":1552404600,"counter":115,"content":"<p>I thank all the witnesses for their attendance.

There care clearly significant gaps in the system 15 years after the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act came into being.  I struggle to see how one can reconcile that statement, however well intentioned, with the reality of what we have heard here.<\/p><p> There seems to be a consistent message from everybody that there are real issues in terms of training.  A couple of key points were made in that regard, one of which was that there are barriers to continuous professional development.  It would be helpful if Mr. Kelly would expand on that.  Ms Leydon said that we should have a continuum of support model in place for training and that sounds absolutely right.  What plans does the Department have to address the training deficit?  It is clear that there is a training deficit that we have to address if we are to resolve this issue.<\/p><p> Ms Brady mentioned that schools are encouraged, rather than obligated, to provide an individual educational plan.  That is not good enough as a model.  If we are serious about implementing rights, surely encouragement is not enough.  We still have to address the key resource issues that have been validly outlined by all of the teacher unions today but if we are to truly implement a rights based programme, it is not enough to encourage schools.  There needs to be a level of obligation.<\/p><p> I have a couple of simple questions about July provision.  When did the review begin?  Was there an end date in mind when it began?  Any work I have ever done has had a start date and an end date.  What is the end date?  Mr. Ward should be able to tell us that now.  Like everyone, I want to know when the valuable July provision scheme will be expanded.  I met representatives from Down Syndrome Ireland last week and there is a fear that this review will take too long and not provide the very real and necessary additional supports quickly.  We all recognise there is a problem that needs to be fixed and I cannot understand why it would take so long.  Will Mr. Ward tell us when the review began and what is the finish date for it?  Surely that date is already in place so that at least the people leaving this meeting today will have a clear idea of when we can expect recommendations and action.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2019031200002#P00300","speaker":"1389","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1552404600,"counter":117,"content":"<p>I thank the representatives from Down Syndrome Ireland and three trade unions, officials from the Department of Education and my colleagues for their serious engagement on this issue.<\/p><p>It was not until just before 4.30 p.m. today that the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities was first mentioned.  We had gone through a full round of questions and were back on supplementary questions.  I want to come to the convention.  There is no beating around the bush in Article 24 under the simple heading, Education.  It starts with a reference to &quot;States Parties&quot;, which can be substituted with &quot;Ireland&quot; now that we have ratified the convention, so that the article reads:<\/p><blockquote>[Ireland] recognizes the right of persons with disabilities to education.  With a view to realizing this right without discrimination and on the basis of equal opportunity, [Ireland] shall ensure an inclusive education system at all levels and lifelong learning directed to:a. The full development of human potential and sense of dignity and self-worth, and the strengthening of respect for human rights, fundamental freedoms and human diversity;<br \/><br \/>b. The development by persons with disabilities of their personality, talents and creativity, as well as their mental and physical abilities, to their fullest potential;<br \/><br \/>c. Enabling persons with disabilities to participate effectively in a free society.<\/blockquote> <p>I will not read the whole article but it continues: &quot;In realizing this right, [Ireland] shall ensure that ...&quot;.  I am inserting &quot;Ireland&quot; where the convention uses the term &quot;States Parties&quot; because we have ratified the convention.<\/p><p>We need to remind ourselves of that.  It states: <\/p><blockquote>a) Persons with disabilities are not excluded from the general education system on the basis of disability, and that children with disabilities are not excluded from free and compulsory primary education, or from secondary education, on the basis of disability;<br \/><br \/>b) Persons with disabilities can access an inclusive, quality and free primary education and secondary education on an equal basis with others in the communities in which they live;<br \/><br \/>c) Reasonable accommodation of the individual&rsquo;s requirements is provided;<br \/><br \/>d) Persons with disabilities receive the support required, within the general education system, to facilitate their effective education;<br \/><br \/>e) Effective individualized support measures are provided in environments that maximize academic and social development, consistent with the goal of full inclusion.<\/blockquote><p>I have laboured that a little.  It is interesting that the Department could participate in this without a mention of the fact that a year ago this week the D&aacute;il passed a motion unanimously to ratify the convention, and, 13 months from now, in April of next year, each Department will make its first report on implementation saying what has changed.  We need to be clear that there are standards and that it took us 11 years to get to the point of saying we would have them, and that brings us to the phrase &quot;encourage and not obliged&quot;.  This is giving the lie to the idea that our standard would be that we encourage.  Our standard is that we are obliged.  Of course there are steps to the stairs but we have to go beyond encouragement.  Teachers encourage children to do things but Ireland has said it is doing it and is on the road to it. <br\/><br\/>Putting my head in the place of a parent of a child with Down's syndrome or another disability, this is like a nil-all draw in sporting parlance.  The Department has a position; the teachers have a position.  I see this too in the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment which will not provide a house that is accessible until the Health Service Executive, HSE, tells it that it has all the personal supports ready.  The HSE will not provide all the personal supports until the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment tells it that the house is ready.  Everyone is committed but no one has moved.  Ms Leydon said some practical things need to be done.  I ask the two key parties - the Department and the trade unions - what are those practical things?  They need to start talking about them now.  What gets us going out of this room without the two parties feeling happy that they have held up their sides?  We need to move them.  The movement may not be ideal in the short term but something has to give, sooner rather than later, because right now the kids and their families are losing out.  <br\/><br\/>Mr. Kelly referred to teachers being professionals.  That is a given.  Are the trade unions being professional at this stage?  It sounds to me like the approach of last in, first out.  Supports for people with disabilities are relatively recent and we get the response, &quot;We cannot do this until...&quot;.  Why cannot something else begin to give a bit in the system?<br\/><br\/>Thirty years ago the Department was arguing in the courts that certain people were ineducable in the Sinnott case.  We have moved on from that.  From the Department's point of view that means getting to essential rather than mandated, rather than it would be nice if it could be done.  The Department is under the cosh of what the Houses of the Oireachtas have agreed to.  I do not get a sense a year later that any urgency has been put into that.<\/p><p>This might seem stinging but for people with disabilities to hear the litany of how much money is being put into disability - we hear it from the Department of Health - can sound as if they need to be grateful.  It is not intended that way but people need to see services improving.  How will the Department start doing something to shift this, to give that little impetus to move it on and to give people hope?  Right now, dare I say it, it seems we are smug.  We are doing this, the other side is saying it is doing that but it is not going any place for people.  Perhaps that is a plea as much as a question.<\/p><p> The Minister needs to visit this committee, sooner rather than later, because, as the Chairman said, the unlocking of the EPSEN Act has waited a decade and a half and there is still loads of the Disability Act 2005 locked up.  These things need to shift at a political level.  I put that request to the committee for its consideration. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2019031200002#Q00200","speaker":"1419","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1552404600,"counter":120,"content":"<p>The Senator has put his finger on the pulse for all of us in everything that he has said.  This is something that I feel very deeply and passionately about.  I have personal and professional experience in the area.  I have a much-loved brother with Down's syndrome.  I was a primary school teacher and will always remember a situation that arose before anyone had heard of July provision, individual education plans or SNAs.  There was a little girl with Down's syndrome in second class, along with 35 other students, who had no resources or supports.  I honestly believed at that time, and still believe, that I failed that child.  I still think about everything that she needed and deserved but did not have.  One could well ask why did she arrive in second class without those supports but she had been in a special school up to that point, when her parents decided they would like to place her in a mainstream school because her twin brother was in it.  We can all understand that she did not want to feel different from her brother.  I remember the bus coming from the special school to bring her back for the Christmas party and she did not want to go.  She did not necessarily want to stay but she was completely caught between the two education worlds.  It is something that I think about regularly, although it was many years ago.  Then I worked with the Special Olympics and athletes with intellectual disability, many of whom had Down's syndrome.  That is they type of experience that informs me in respect of special educational needs.  I am on the Oireachtas Disability Group, which Senator Dolan chairs well.  Anytime we have the opportunity to consider different areas we do so and today we are considering education for those with Down's syndrome, bearing in mind that much of what we are saying is for the benefit of all students with intellectual disability, particularly in regard to the July provision and the IEPs.<\/p> <p>  While members of the committee have outlined eloquently where we as a society are failing these children, when I look back to when my brother was born and to when I was teaching that child or even ten or 15 years ago, we have come a long way and we have to acknowledge that.<\/p><p>It is about continuing to improve and ensuring all children with Down's syndrome and intellectual disabilities have the chance to shine.  It is within all of them to shine.  Educators and legislators must ensure everything is in place to ensure that will happen, as well as ensuring teachers will have a positive educational experience in teaching children with Down&rsquo;s syndrome.<\/p><p> I accept that there is a review under way of the July provision scheme.  What is the rationale for not allowing children with Down&rsquo;s syndrome to avail of the scheme?  It makes no sense that, at one point, a decision was made that children with Down&rsquo;s syndrome would not be able to avail of it.<\/p><p> Every child in the education system should have an individual education plan.  What resources are needed to specifically provide for this?  I agree that there has to be planning in every school and classroom.  To a certain extent, there is also a need for planning for every single child.  How else does the teacher relate to a child's progress, or the lack of it, at a teacher-parent meeting?  Some plan has to be in place to assess and support a child in his or her progress.  I cannot understand why a plan cannot be put in place for children with Down&rsquo;s syndrome.  Like my colleague Deputy Funchion, I cannot understand why the teacher unions would, more or less, not recommend this.  I also agree with my colleague Deputy Catherine Martin on the terminology used, that a plan such as this is recommended but not mandatory.  I accept that up to 86 circulars were issued last year to teachers.  However, we have to close the circle.  We need to look at the resources and training teachers need to ensure plans will be put in place.<\/p><p> Mr. Ward outlined some of the courses available.  When are teachers able to avail of them?  For example, can they avail of them during working hours?  If so, are they eligible for the provision of substitute cover?  An issue which has been raised at the committee is that while provision is made for training for teachers, no substitute cover is supplied.  That is wrong.  I accept that it is difficult to find substitutes, but that is another issue.  In principle, substitute cover has to be provided for teachers to support them and give them the resources they need.  If individual education plans are not put in place, what alternatives do the TUI and the ASTI suggest?<\/p><p> The Minister has replied to several parliamentary questions by stating the EPSEN Act will not be commenced for some time.  Has a cost been put on the necessary measures which need to be put in place to implement it?  If so, we need to know what they are.  We need to engage with the Minister on this issue.  As Senator Dolan said, it is 15 years since the Act was passed.  It is more than regrettable that it is not in place.  It is completely wrong that it is not.<\/p><p>If individual education plans are not put in place, what alternatives do the TUI and the ASTI suggest?  Generally speaking, a child with Down&rsquo;s syndrome or an intellectual disability will not be able to follow the full curriculum in a classroom.  Extra thought has to put into the type of curriculum for some &ndash; not all -subjects which a child with Down&rsquo;s syndrome or an intellectual disability would be able to follow.  Some planning has to be done to ensure a child with Down&rsquo;s syndrome or an intellectual disability has the opportunity to fulfil his or her potential.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2019031200002#S00200","speaker":"1257","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1552404600,"counter":123,"content":"<p>On the resources teachers need, last Saturday the INTO held its special education conference in Cork with over 300 teachers in attendance.

It was the one workshop for which we probably needed security on the door to control the stampede, such is the appetite among teachers for continuing professional development, CPD, in this area.<\/p> <p>  We should be clear that teachers are dedicated to this.  We have heard much about planning.  We do not want to lose focus either on high-quality teaching, however.  Planning is critical and a central part of teaching and learning.

My wife is a special educational needs co-ordinator and a teacher in a greenfield site in Dublin.  As a matter of course in her role, she engages in individual planning for students.  The individual planning in which she engages for her students is not consistent, however, with the individual education plans set out in the EPSEN Act, yet she does it and her colleagues do it.  Our members in schools all over the country plan for individual students.<\/p> <p>  The TUI represents members delivering in Youthreach centres.  Up to 20 Youthreach centres receive supplementary funding from the special educational needs initiative to implement individual learning plans, ILPs.  We are used to acronyms in the TUI, which itself is an acronym.  The individual learning plan tracks a student&rsquo;s progress and sets out a plan of education for a student through second chance education.  Our members engage in that in 20 Youthreach centres because they are resourced for it but not in the others, which are not.<\/p> <p>  The concept of the individual education plan, as set out in the EPSEN Act, is 15 years old.  Educational theory, philosophy and practices have come a long way since the EPSEN Act was drafted.<\/p><p>Senator Byrne asked what we would suggest instead.  Right now we do not know.  Our members, however, are already working on this.  Our members are in schools tracking students and supporting them.  They are coming up with innovative ways of differentiating for those students.  Our members have a wealth of knowledge that we can offer to the National Council for Special Education, NCSE.  It is to our regret that the Minister did not see fit to put any of our representatives on to the NCSE in the last round of invitations for seats on the NCSE.  Nonetheless, we are available to the Department, to the NCSE and to the other stakeholders to discuss alternatives to the EPSEN Act that would be more forward thinking than simply implementing a 15 year old Act.<\/p><p> Senator Gavan asked about continuing professional development, CPD.  I will relate my wife's experience and what she utilises when planning for these students.  Teachers are by their nature life-long learners and my wife has amended her practice over the past five years as she has continued to learn as a teacher.  My wife has a basis on which to build, namely, a postgraduate diploma in special education that she received from the Church of Ireland College of Education, which is now in DCU.  As my colleague from the ASTI mentioned, these are postgraduate diploma level 9 courses.  They are intense courses.  Deputy Funchion and I did a level 9 course together some years ago in employment law.  It took up a vast amount of our time that year.  These courses are intense with regard to time and costs.<\/p><p> After completing one's free education and getting an undergraduate degree, to become a teacher a person now has to engage in a two-year postgraduate diploma in education.  This costs our members in excess of &euro;10,000 and two years of their lives.  Following that, when they start teaching, and in order to undertake the post graduate diploma in special education, it is another added cost of at least &euro;5,000 per year.  It is also a cost with regard to their time, at a time in their lives when they are trying to save for houses and settle down and start families.  Something needs to be done to address the availability of that training, the funding for it and the time made available.<\/p><p> At the point at which my wife received that particular allowance some ten years ago, there was a financial benefit to her, which was recognised as a qualification allowance by the Department of Education and Skills in its business case to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in 2012.  This fundamentally was a misnomer of what that special educational needs allowance was for.  While it was only available to persons who had undertaken the qualification in special educational needs, in order to retain the allowance there was a requirement on the person to be engaged in the delivery of education to students with special educational needs directly within his or her school for a minimum of five years and to participate in the planning and delivery of that education.  It was a complete misnomer on the part of the Departments of Education and Skills and Public Expenditure and Reform to see it solely as a qualification allowance.  That allowance was available to people to do the kind of work we are talking about today, and it was withdrawn in 2012.  The Department and the committee must give this point some serious consideration.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2019031200002#U00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Colm Kelly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1552404600,"counter":126,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Kelly.

That is where they are instinctively and professionally doing the differentiating and their plans.  Teachers must have term plans and annual plans for each class group and each year.  Planning is being done but I believe the expectation of the model of planning now required of schools has precipitated these concerns.  This is what trade unions do.  We must listen to our members' concerns and must be able to seek to advance them. Giving the advice was the first step.  What is the next step?  This has been a very productive meeting.  We have all listened to one another.  I put it to Senator Dolan that the worst-case scenario is nil nil.  That would be a cop out on both sides.  We now need to work together.

I am sure Mr. Ward will take this back to his colleagues in the Department of Education and Skills.  We need to get this sorted out this year.  I refer to the school year.

It would be regrettable if we left here today without feeling that we had moved forward in any shape or form.  I agree that the Minister needs to be here to meet with us and discuss the matters with the committee.<\/p> <p>  I wish to make a comparison about how Down Syndrome Ireland feels about this.  Allowing a student to struggle academically or socially when all that is needed for success are appropriate accommodation and explicit instruction is no different from failing to provide a ramp for a person with a wheelchair.  Down Syndrome Ireland feels very strongly about this.  We take very seriously the issues our parents raise.<\/p> <p>  There are two things that angered us to a degree, which were the two directives before Christmas.  I am now aware they were advice but at the time in the media and in the public domain they were identified as directives issued by the teacher unions.  We were very distressed about these.  Reference was made to this already, but a reply to a parliamentary question, No. 95 on 6 March 2019, reads: \"The Circulars note that educational planning is an essential element of a whole-school approach to meeting pupils&rsquo; needs.\" Two lines later the reply goes on to read: \"All schools are therefore encouraged to use Education Plans\".  Where is the tie between \"essential\" and \"encouraged\"?  We should not have to \"encourage\" anybody to do something that is essential.  To ensure the essential needs are met, I go back again to the need for training, resources and time.  I should hope that this meeting will provide an impetus and be a starting point for moving forward with this as we all work together.<\/p> <p>  I agree with Mr. Kelly that it is regrettable about the seats on the National Council for Special Education, NCSE.

I was particularly interested in Senator Dolan's input, which was inspirational.  Sometimes people think that because we are in policymaking or whatever we are insulated from the realities of life, but we all have our own story around these matters.  The Senator's input was informative.  I am only new to this brief but I have visited a number of schools since I took it over and what I saw were very dedicated people doing a job and an air of calmness in schools dealing with children with special needs.  I was totally convinced that those children were in the best place possible and that good things were happening in the schools.<\/p> <p>  I believe it is all about quality, teaching and learning and, as a Department, we have to have a way of ensuring that is happening.  Our inspectorate gives us positive feedback that good things are happening in our schools in an objective way.  Planning is happening.  There is a formula in the legislation that goes back a bit, and Mr. Kelly said that formula needs to be looked at, but, internationally, practice might have moved on from that formula that was enshrined in that particular legislation.<\/p> <p>  The issue of July provision was raised.  To address it briefly, the review was done by the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, a number of years ago as part of its autism review and it said the July provision scheme was inequitable.  A working group is looking at how to come up with a scheme that might be more equitable.  The NCSE recommendation was that the scheme should be for children with complex needs.  It did not say who those children might be or identify the categories.  Currently, the scheme is provided for two categories: children with severe and profound learning disabilities and students with autism spectrum disorder.  Deputy Jan O'Sullivan asked who delivers it currently.  There is a school strand and a parents strand.  It costs &euro;14 million, not that that money should necessarily be a big part of it but it certainly comes into the mathematics in terms of dividing a pie.  A working group is looking at it.  The NCSE hinted in its advice that the programme might be broader than just school curriculum issues and might be more activity based.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the work done so far, there has been consultation with a number of other Departments and State agencies as to the direction in which we might be going.  I would hope that the group will have recommendations internally in the coming months.  We should be able to talk to stakeholders later in the year, perhaps in September or October, with a view to making sure that we have a revamped programme to offer for July of next year.  That is the tentative plan but there has been some work done on it in terms of devising a programme.  An estimate is that something short of 2,000 children are in receipt of sports in our schools.  We have to ask how we will prioritise the investment and whether we will cover everybody.  If we are covering 9,500 students at a cost of &euro;14 million, the Deputy can do the sums.  Some decisions will have to be made and some priorities struck but I am anxious to move it on and I have taken on board what the committee is saying.  We need to give it more urgency and we will do that.<\/p> <p>  On the bright side, we started off talking about the success of inclusion.  I have children and they are now adults but things have changed inexorably from the time they were in primary and post-primary school.  The number of supports and the amount of training and development, even if it is still inadequate, have increased proportionately.  The level of commitment and information given to parents and engagement with parents has also improved.<\/p> <p>  We are going through a spot of innovation in the Department.  That is assisted hugely by the development of the NCSE.  If any member wants to know the membership of the NCSE, it is available on its website, including the backgrounds of the members.  I can assure the members that they all have a background in and experience and knowledge of special education and related matters.<\/p><p>The in-school therapy project will innovate and test a model for in-school, occupational and speech and language therapies, and how agencies collaborate and work in schools.  It is a test which we will probably enhance later in the year.  There will be further announcements and engagement on that.  We are trying to test a model that we can ultimately make mainstream, which will be evidence-based and will have the confidence of all stakeholders including parents and teachers.  That is a very positive development.  The National Council for Special Education, NCSE, and its establishment have been crucial to this new evidence-based focus on how we make policy and develop services.<\/p><p> The second matter to bring to the attention of the committee is that the NCSE is currently looking at the role of special schools and special classes, and how that is taking shape.  There have been consultations about that policy review already.  We expect that it will be delivered towards the middle of next year.  Policy makers and practitioners will be looking at the impact of that in the years ahead.  It is a good place to be because at least now we have the people with the expertise to look at these kinds of developments and to look at what we are doing locally and what international trends are, taking into account our local legislation, UN conventions and such, to make sure that we are in a good place in future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2019031200002#X00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eddie Ward","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1552404600,"counter":138,"content":"<p>I think that was a very informative engagement.

I would like to introduce my colleagues.  I am accompanied by Mr. Felix O'Regan, the federation's director of public affairs, and Ms Bernice Evoy, head of its legal and regulatory division.  <\/p> <p>  We very much appreciate the opportunity to address the joint committee on the issue of a future framework for accountability in the banking sector.  We recognise clearly the importance and value of the work conducted by the Central Bank of Ireland last year in undertaking behaviour and culture assessments of each of the five main retail banks.<\/p><p>As a federation and a trade association, we are committed to working with our member banks and with the Central Bank in helping to drive further improvement in a consumer-focused culture for banking in Ireland.  As the committee knows, the Central Bank&rsquo;s report recommended the enhancement of the current fitness and probity regime by way of implementation of a new framework of individual accountability, to be known as the senior executive accountability regime, SEAR.  We have advised both the Central Bank and the Minister of Finance of our support for this direction of travel.  We see the opportunities to learn from similar developments elsewhere, not least in the UK, and we have also made it our business to draw from the experience of various parties to this end.<\/p><p> We were pleased to contribute to identifying the broad architecture of a new independent body on banking culture.  We have since seen the establishment of the Irish Banking Culture Board and the appointment of its chairman, former Mr. Justice John Hedigan.  We remain committed to working, as appropriate, with the board in the development of the highest standards of culture and conduct across the banking sector.  We are also very active in facilitating consideration with member banks on how a customer-centric culture can best be embedded in banks here.  This has involved our drawing on experiences in other countries, such as the UK, the Netherlands and elsewhere, engaging with relevant participants there and providing a platform for those experiences and learnings to be shared with our members.<\/p><p> In fully supporting the development of SEAR as envisaged by the Minister for Finance and the Central Bank, and particularly in the interests of delivering a fully effective SEAR, we would like to note some issues with the committee which we believe are worthy of further consideration.  In particular, it will be important, as we work through the development of SEAR, to get the balance correct between a clear focus on driving a customer-centric culture and a potentially over-bureaucratic process and structure that might ensue.  We also consider it important to ensure that SEAR is not introduced in a manner that hinders the attraction of talent to the sector but, equally, that it is no deterrent to mobility or diversity within member banks.  We also think it will be important to clarify the distinction between the collective fiduciary responsibility of a bank's board and board members and the all-important individual accountability of board directors and senior executives.  Finally, one of the requirements of SEAR would suggest the expectations around senior managers taking \"all reasonable steps\" - I emphasise that phrase - to mitigate risks, which is a contrast to the position in the UK, which requires just \"reasonable steps\" to be taken.  We feel that interpretation, definition and guidance on this issue as SEAR is introduced will be critical for bank executives as they adjust to the new regime.<\/p><p> To conclude, I am grateful for the opportunity to discuss these issues with the committee and I look forward to hearing its views on this very important issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019031200002#E00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Maurice Crowley","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1552399200,"counter":151,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Crowley.

The statement he submitted stated:<\/p><blockquote>The primary focus should be on improving culture and there is a real risk that the focus on accountability could manifest in a culture of protection rather than of improvement.  This could drive an unintended consequence including a focus on avoiding decisions to avoid accountability.<\/blockquote> <p>It concluded: &quot;[W]e view the introduction of an individual accountability regime as part of a wider goal to develop the highest possible standards of conduct and culture across the banking sector.&quot;<\/p><p>These two quotes sum up what is a very disappointing approach, which I can only say, with regret, proves that bankers just do not get it.  I do not think they get it that accountability for actions taken by individuals is the way forward.  We have to remember that bankers cost the Irish people billions of euro and hundreds of thousands of people emigrated, whereas we can count on one hand the number of bankers who have faced any sort of a penalty, albeit they were pathetically weak penalties.  Yet, ten years on, Mr. Crowley can come in and warn about too much accountability.<\/p><p>This surely is the key issue, not a side issue.  Individual accountability must surely be implemented as a key reform.  We cannot let the bankers away with blaming culture or collective responsibility.  When everybody is responsible, nobody is responsible.  I urge the Banking and Payments Federation of Ireland to rethink its approach and to engage in this process.  The first thing the federation should do is stop resisting individual accountability and accept that this is the only acceptable way forward.<\/p><p>When we look at it, God knows, senior bankers are paid enough.  A full-time worker on the minimum wage earns around &euro;19,000 a year.  A banker on a salary of &euro;500,000 earns 257 times that figure, or the earnings in many lifetimes for a worker on the minimum wage.  It is only fair that accountability would come with such obscene pay levels.  Does Mr. Crowley agree, given that people are being paid enormous amounts of money?  What I get in reading his statement is the sense that \"We have to be careful we do not have too much accountability.\"  Mr. Crowley might tease out that issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019031200002#F00300","speaker":"1378","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1552399200,"counter":154,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for her questions.

We fully accept the requirement for an individual accountability regime and fully intend to work positively with the Central Bank and the Department of Finance on the introduction of such a regime.  There will not, as the Senator might suggest, be blanket resistance to the introduction of an individual accountability regime.  What we are cautioning is that there is a need to tease through the manner in which will be introduced.  There are two things we all want to achieve, namely, individuals taking responsibility and being accountable for their performance and, at the same time, embedding a customer-centric culture in the banks.  The two are not mutually exclusive.  Depending on how the individual accountability regime is introduced, the individual responsible may focus narrowly on the responsibilities defined for him or her and, in a sense, be held accountable for what has been assigned to him or her, but we also want him or her to do so in a way that he or she will take the wider interests of the institution into account.  It is about getting the balance right.  I do not accept that there is anything in the submission that suggests we are against having an individual accountability regime.

I understand everything feeds into everything else, into the ethos of the bank, with everybody making a contribution.  It is amazing in the way financial institutions have been run &ndash; perhaps that is why they have been run into the ground &ndash; that it has not been the practice for job descriptions to match each person's accountability, with everything fitting together.  How can any organisation be run if it does not have very basic mechanics?  We need to be careful.  Mr. Crowley cites the experience in the United Kingdom in terms of how long it took to implement the regime.  If there was the will to implement it, it should be implemented in an expedient and faster way.  I understand it takes longer to change the culture, but on too many occasions we hide behind that word.  Whether it be in the insurance industry, the financial industry or elsewhere, we say, \"It is the culture,\" and tend to excuse things in that way.  This is a real opportunity for us to have accountability front and centre in order that people can have trust in the institutions.<\/p> <p>  There is something else that concerns me.  We have a bank-funded Irish Banking Culture Board.  It reminds me a little of the old trick where, if something was found out, we put practices in place.  When the pressure is suddenly on, we are great believers in oversight, as long as it is on our terms.  Can Mr. Crowley reassure me in that regard?

It is the right way to do it and is critical in its own right.

The board will have a majority of non-bank people involved in it and that is right.<\/p> <p>  Reference was made to expedited timelines in the context of SEAR but the banking culture board has not been standing idly by.  It has, with help from the UK's banking standards board, conducted a survey of staff in the five main banks, to which it received 14,000 replies, seeking their views of the culture within their organisations and within the sector.  Separately from that, it had extensive consultations with all forms of stakeholders, public and private, across the economy over the second half of last year.  My understanding is that during the second quarter of this year, it will publish the outcomes, in aggregate terms, of the staff surveys and the engagement it has had with the various stakeholders.  Ultimately, my understanding is that a number of the non-bank stakeholders with which it engaged will actually sit on the board of the banking culture board.  Thereafter one would expect, although this is a decision for the board, that it would publish an annual report reflecting the findings of various engagements each year, just like the banking standards board in the UK.  The findings of the banking culture board will not be a secret at the end of the day and the board will also make recommendations for action at an industry level.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019031200002#H00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Maurice Crowley"},{"type":"speech","time":1552399200,"counter":157,"content":"<p>Accountability is my main concern and until we see how this unfolds, we cannot know whether it is working or whether there are impediments or opposition to it within the banking sector.

The industry's own initiative with the banking culture board also stemmed from that scandal.<\/p> <p>  The reality is that tens of thousands of customers were wronged and while the industry and individual banks will argue that certain instances were down to interpretation of the contracts and so on, there were very clear, black and white instances of customers being wronged.

That was a very costly experience for many of the people we represent.  It will end up being very costly in financial terms for the banks, with estimates now at more than &euro;1 billion.  We have dealt with many individual cases where lives have been turned upside down, where people have lost their homes and families have had to go through negative life changing experiences because of it.  We look at these reports and they can seem to be very abstract and have little relevance to people but they all stem from the tracker episode.  In itself, that was not the first episode in the history of Irish banking, by any means, where consumer interests were not protected.  It was a very bruising affair and its effects continue today.  We will have the banks in before us again in the next month or so to discuss it and other issues.<\/p> <p>  The Central Bank's report on behaviour and culture was completed in July 2018.  It involved each bank being issued with a risk mitigation programme.  I do not expect the witnesses to be aware of what each individual bank has done because the Central Bank issued institution-specific findings from its behaviour and culture reviews.  To Mr. Crowley's knowledge, has the work on bringing forward a risk mitigation programme progressed since the publication of the Central Bank's report?

Notwithstanding the fact that it is funded by the industry, it is intended to be completely independent of it, which is very important.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy raised a challenging question.  On one level he is not wrong - a bank is answerable to a set of shareholders and subject to all of the commercial imperatives this imposes on any organisation, not just a bank.  However, the world has moved on, for banks and others.  There is recognition of a much broader set of stakeholders.  Having said that, there is a need for more proof of the pudding that it is moving on in our own sector and I believe a banking culture board would be a single manifestation of it.  Work is being done by individual banks to demonstrate how they are changing their stripes in the context of having a consumer focused culture.  They each have different programmes in their own right.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked who advocated for the consumer and referred to boards, senior executives, strategies and plans.  Fundamentally, advocacy on behalf of the consumer has to start with the senior leadership in a bank.  If it is not shown by it, the best efforts of people throughout the business will be diminished, but it does not mean that there are no people throughout the business advocating for the consumer.  In our view, if one talks to any of the banks, it has to come from the top down.  There has to be clear leadership, not just statements.  There must be actions, rather than words.  There has to be a consumer-centric culture, but it is not easy.  The Senator referred to the length of time it took to change and embed a new culture.  Unfortunately, as a sector, we are not unique in trying to change and improve the culture.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019031200002#K00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Maurice Crowley"},{"type":"speech","time":1552399200,"counter":174,"content":"<p>I hear what Mr. Crowley is saying and understand why he is giving that response, but when it comes down to brass tacks and the reality of being a member of the executive leadership team within one of the main banks or on the board, a person's sole objective is to secure the best performance of the bank in maximising returns and profits.  I am not sure there is anyone who is putting up his or her hand to say, \"Actually, I think our consumers would be better served if we allowed more flexibility in the way they could move from one product to another, or, as certain life circumstances arise, we were to allow them to move from a fixed rate.\"  I do not get the sense that that is the function of any particular person.

Because it would be only one voice, I am not convinced that providing for such representation is the answer, but banks have to be held to account for their behaviour.  That goes back to the Senator's earlier questions.  Clearly, the senior executive accountability regime, SEAR, will be an important avenue.  From our conversations with the Central Bank, Bank of Ireland and the Department of Finance, they have been clear, rightly so, that they want to see accountability on the part of individuals.  Part of the issue in the past was that many decisions were taken on a collective and participatory basis.  In those circumstances how does one focus on the accountability of individuals?

The Senator's point is that it is at a fairly general level.  The control functions would reach quite far down into the organisation and while they would not necessarily be caught, for want of a better word, by the SEAR they would be caught and captured by the fitness and probity regime.  There will be a continuing annual assessment, in effect, of people's fitness to act in those roles.

They had a bonus culture at the time of rewarding people for the money that left an institution as opposed to the money that came back into it as a result of wise investments and so on.  Much of that has changed but a breakdown in one of questionnaires completed by AIB indicated that 9% or 10% of AIB staff earn more than &euro;100,000.  That is not a huge percentage but nearly 1,000 people are still earning more than a &euro;100,000 a year which, by any measure of the Irish workforce, is a reasonably significant amount of money.  People see that many people working in the banks are still in good jobs and doing well and the banks are now back making money yet they are chasing people for their money.  I know they have to do that but we have heard at this committee that sometimes people were being hounded and chased in an unfair manner.<\/p><p>They were being rung at certain hours of the day and between ten and 12 times a day.  All that feeds into the culture of the banks.  As Deputy Michael McGrath outlined, the banks have a culture.  Ultimately they are accountable.  Corporate governance requires them to be accountable to their shareholders.  They are working on behalf of their shareholders who want them to maximise returns subject to the laws of the land.  Ultimately, their bonuses, assessments of performance and so on are based on how well the bottom line is performing.  This culture board wants to make sure that the banks are consumer focused.  It represents the banking institutions and, in theory, it is more likely to deal with the senior executives in all the banks than with the people on the ground at the counters.  How do we get to a stage where banks never mis-sell a product?  There is an incentive to sell people products.  They may not need all the products they are being sold.  There has been a culture in the banks, as we have seen with tracker mortgages and other issues, of not treating customers well.

Some of my comments may relate to how I answered Deputy Michael McGrath's points.  It is not just down to the banking culture board, to be fair.  It will help in the setting of standards and in highlighting the issues that exist from a sectoral perspective.  It comes back to what happens within each individual bank.  I disagree with the notion that a bank's sole objective is to earn profits and maximise revenues.  Having said that, I do not dispute there is an ongoing need for a change in culture to having a more customer-centric culture.  That is why I drew a distinction in my response to the previous Senator between the individual accountability framework, which clearly and genuinely has a role to play in driving out and taking a greater level of responsibility regarding the customer and treating the customer fairly, and changing the culture, which is slightly different because the framework is a framework but we also want a mindset and a set of behaviours that thinks in favour of the customer.  The banking culture board has an important role to play in that.  Regulation to date is playing a role in that under the Central Bank's consumer protection codes.  It has strict standards now on the introduction of new products, which is called product oversight and governance, so regulation has a role to play, but in the middle there is that kind of leadership and drive to change people's behaviour.  Some of that, and it was there when I worked in one of the institutions, is down to how one reviews people's performance.  If one is solely reviewing people's performance on the number of widgets they sell or the profit they make, one is not going to change the culture.  Certainly in the institution in which I worked at the time, one's qualitative behaviour was as important as one's quantitative behaviour.  There will have to be much more focus and emphasis on that to balance the quantitative emphasis at the end of the day.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019031200002#N00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Maurice Crowley"},{"type":"speech","time":1552399200,"counter":198,"content":"<p>There were people in jobs and high-profile cases where people were suing RT&Eacute; for what it said about them.

Obviously, as the Senator said, there is responsibility to the senior executives.  Coming out of SEAR, there will also be accountability for non-executive directors.  Nobody is resisting that at the end of the day.  Notwithstanding the efforts one has to put into preparing for a board meeting, it is very clear now that the responsibilities of non-executive directors of a bank board without SEAR are much more significant than they used to be.  The expectations of those non-executive directors from the Central Bank of Ireland, the European Central Bank, and the joint supervisory teams that come to Ireland to inspect these banks has significantly increased over what it would have been a number of years ago.  They are expecting a level of expertise.  They expect evidence of review and challenge of individual decisions made at board level.  My point was slightly more technical.  That clear and present requirement needs to be married with the legal collective fiduciary responsibility a board of directors has for the running of a company.  They are not incompatible; it just needs to be managed and resolved.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019031200002#O00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Maurice Crowley"},{"type":"speech","time":1552399200,"counter":203,"content":"<p>Mr. Crowley talked about improvement and being protective.

It will be incumbent on the main retail banks here to respond to that competition.  The Senator asked about today's accountability regime versus what is proposed.  I do not know if the word \"regime\" is the right one.  There is a level of accountability within each bank, as there should be, and each bank operates that in its own fashion.  However, there are advantages to SEAR because it makes clear each individual senior executive's function, role and responsibilities.  The point was made earlier that it is about mapping across an organisation to ensure there are no gaps in the responsibility map.  Everything is covered at the end of the day.  It will bring a welcome level of formality and framework to the whole process but if one talks to an individual bank, there are performance review and assessment processes involving senior executives all the way up to the board.  However, this gives us a lot more visibility within a bank and more visibility to the supervisor, namely the Central Bank or Ireland or the ECB.  That is important and that is why we welcome it.  Given what has happened in the past, we need to be able to demonstrate more clearly as a sector and as individual banks that we are taking responsibility for a wide range of issues, not just for the return of equity and profitability in the institution.  The Senator referred to pressure to sell products and meet targets.  There has been a great deal of change in the regulation in that regard over the past number of years, and rightly so, largely through the good work of the Central Bank of Ireland.  I mentioned the consumer protection code.  Between the Central Bank and Europe, a great deal of work has been done on product oversight and governance as to the initial design of a product, its performance, who buys it, who does not and what the outcomes are.  That is all necessary change given what happened.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019031200002#Q01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Maurice Crowley"},{"type":"speech","time":1552399200,"counter":222,"content":"<p>Is it correct that the federation's role is to represent the banks?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019031200002#Q01100","speaker":"1374"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1552399200,"counter":223,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019031200002#Q01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Maurice Crowley"},{"type":"speech","time":1552399200,"counter":224,"content":"<p>Let us call a spade a spade.

Given the way banking is going, they are competing for talent as much with the technology companies.  If one looks at the vast body of a bank's IT staff, quantitative analysts, risk and compliance people, they are in demand across the sector and not just within the retail banks.  Remuneration in whatever form is part of the retention process and part of the attraction process.  I am not sure exactly what is appropriate in banking terms given what has happened, but one must recognise at the same time that one is competing with companies with share schemes, bonus schemes and variable pay schemes, however constructed.

We are talking about changing the banking culture to centre attention on the customer.  My background is very small business.  My customer was king.  I think it is incredible that we have Mr. Crowley's organisation, the Central Bank and this new body under a judge to tell a business that it should think of its customers and to change the culture of how it treats its customers.  That tells me that the behaviour of businesses up to now was obnoxious in many cases.  Maybe, as a representative body, the Banking and Payments Federation might say to the banks that they had a good shot at it, are getting good profits and are not being taxed, and as part of this changing culture, they should not wait for two years.

It was recognised by the Central Bank and the banks themselves that there was more to do.  I think the individual accountability framework is an important aid or catalyst to all of that, but just as important is the work that the banks will do in responding to those risk mitigation plans, RMPs, that the Central Bank has demanded of them, and what they do as an entity over the next couple of years.

Dogs resemble their masters, as they say.  In any business, the master should be telling the next person down that this has to change.  That seeps out to their legal representatives and so on in the attitudes that they express on behalf of their banks.  It is time to call out the banks again and to say that enough is enough, since they are continuing in the same vein that they were in.<\/p><p>As far as Mr. Crowley's organisation is concerned, he might disagree with some of the comments I have made, but he should take on board that some of them are true and borne out in the media daily.  I wish him well in changing the culture in the banks.  It is extraordinary that so many organisations have to be put in place to tell a business that the customer is king.  It would frighten me to think they would ever get back to normality, given what they did in or previous to 2008.  That is all I am saying and I would love to hear a voice from Mr. Crowley's organisation ticking off its members when it deems them to be out of line and far away from a basic moral compass that one would expect a business of that size to have, while understanding what has to be done in the marketplace to retain staff.<\/p><p> I will only say this in the context of corporate social responsibility and Mr. Crowley can pass on my comments.  Banks do all sorts of things in local communities, on which they are to be congratulated, as well as on the manner in which they bring information to small and medium enterprises, SMEs.  I would love to see all of it being made clear.  They need to emphasise the downside in taking out a loan, as well as the upside, in order that the enthusiastic entrepreneur knows fully what the issues are and that the person seeking a loan understands what all of the small print means.  The tracker mortgage issue exposed the fact that, in many cases, people did not understand what they were signing, did not have an opportunity to test it with a solicitor and were encouraged along the way.  That happened during the crash.  Banks understand banking language and, as much as Mr. Crowley translates legislation for bankers, they should translate their language for the basic consumer or customer.<\/p><p> Now that the banks will not be paying taxes for a long time, they might have a unit to look at their corporate social responsibilities and be a lot more generous in funding initiatives related to health and dealing with marginalised individuals and families.  That would tell me that they were thinking about society and their effect on it.  They have had a very negative effect on society, families and individuals.  There are many cases in which people died by suicide and so on and their stories have been told.  The banks should respond in a positive way by acknowledging all of this.

We very much see today as a useful listening opportunity and look forward to hearing the views of the committee on this matter so that they can be considered as part of the forthcoming Central Bank (amendment) Bill.<\/p> <p>  There has been a complete transformation in the regulatory environment since the financial crisis.  The approach to banking supervision now is more assertive, risk-based, and challenging, and one which is underpinned by new legislation, including the Central Bank Reform Act 2010; the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013; and the creation of the European Single Supervisory Mechanism in 2014.  These have changed regulation and supervision of the banking sector almost beyond recognition. <\/p> <p>  The European banking union, EBU, provides for a single prudential supervisor through the Single Supervisory Mechanism, a single regulatory rulebook, and a Single Resolution Mechanism for resolving failing institutions.  This aims to improve co-ordination and militate against negative spillover in the future.  However, even the best systems in the world cannot guarantee that there will never be issues.  We acknowledge the work of the committee in bringing to light the seriousness of the tracker mortgage scandal in late 2017.  On foot of that, the Minister for Finance, wrote to the Governor of the Central Bank, under section 6A of the Central Bank Act 1942, requesting a review of the culture and behaviour within the retail banking sector in Ireland.  At the same time, officials in the Department submitted to the Minister proposals for responding to the tracker mortgage examination.  This work included considering the introduction of a regime similar to the UK senior manager regime.  The section 6A consultation was completed when the Central Bank published the report, entitled Behaviour and Culture of the Irish Retail Banks, in July of last year.  The report outlined possible remedies for some of the cultural failings in the banking sector.  The proposals independently brought forward by the Central Bank were very much in line with the proposals developed by the Department at the instruction of the Minister, as both institutions were looking at international best practice.  <\/p> <p>  The Central Bank co-operated extensively with the Dutch Central Bank on its report as it is one of the leaders in the field of financial services culture.  The Department focused on the implementation and lessons from the UK's senior managers' regime and conduct standards given the close relationship between the two financial sectors, which will see significant institutions move from the UK to Ireland post Brexit; and their similar common law legal system, although our constitutional protections create more complex challenges.  The international evidence, as set out in the Central Bank's report, illustrates that improvements in banking culture, through increased individual accountability, lead to better consumer protection and financial stability outcomes.<\/p> <p>  These are the two core objectives of our Central Bank and therefore, the Minister for Finance has committed to increasing individual accountability in the financial sector.  To implement this, the Department has been working with the Central Bank to bring forward these proposals to legislative change.  These proposals encompass conduct standards for all regulated financial services providers and the individuals working within them; a senior executive accountability regime, SEAR; and enhancements to the current fitness and probity and enforcement regimes.  The proposals will also encompass key aspects of Deputy Pearse Doherty's Private Member's Bill.<\/p> <p>  We all know that the new legislation must be robust enough to withstand challenge, because we have no doubt that it will be challenged, as the existing administrative sanctions regime has been.  Ireland will be among the vanguard of a number of other countries now advancing national legislative change to improve banking culture.  We intend to bring the heads of a Bill to Government for approval in the near future, and once agreed, we will be engaging with the committee.  We welcome today as an opportunity to hear the ideas and expectations of the committee for the forthcoming legislative changes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019031200002#X00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gary Tobin"},{"type":"speech","time":1552399200,"counter":282,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses.  I cannot quite grasp what Mr. Tobin means by \"culture\".  It sounds very nice but my experience is that a financial institution is usually a very powerful one and individual customers, whether a single person taking out his or her first mortgage or a couple buying a house, are very much at a disadvantage.<\/p><p>Years ago, the culture was such that a person could barely get an application form from institutions.  It is still very difficult.  I would like to see a customer champion in banks, somebody who is on the customer's side, in respect of communication and ease of comprehension.  People are making the biggest investment of their lives for a significant part of their adult life, that is, for 25 to 35 years or more.  When I meet people for whom things have gone wrong, I often wonder whether somebody in the bank at the time should perhaps have advised the person that the burden they were taking on was going to be significant for them and their family.  That does not seem to happen.  Back in the 2000s I argued that people with a consumer debt background should be appointed to the panels in the regulatory structure.  Have the officials formed a view on how to address this?<\/p><p> A culture of financial numeracy could be brought into schools to give children some knowledge of the framework.  Some schools do it but many do not.  As banking moves increasingly online, the visible presence of familiar banking institutions is on the wane in towns or suburbs as most banking is done remotely.  Have the officials thought about how that might be addressed to try to balance the scale between the bank and the customer?  This would be very much in the interests of the financial institution because it wants successful borrowers who enter into a loan arrangement they are likely to be able to maintain and will want to maintain because they understand what the relationship is about.  It is a commercial relationship.  There is a significant return to the bank if the lenders are successful, if it has chosen its lenders properly.  <\/p><p> I was very involved in promoting the Rebuilding Ireland home loans initiative.  I do not know if the Department was involved in that.  My local council, Fingal County Council, has stopped taking any more loans.  There is enormous population growth in its area, that is, the north of Dublin county and Dublin 15, and house prices there have rocketed.  <\/p><p> I worry that the drift to professional landlords buying the bulk of available properties off the drawing board affects the supply of feasible mortgages for the traditional mortgagees who could be two civil servants, at executive officer or assistant principal officer level, committing to 25 years.  Has the Department considered the long-term implications of that in terms of culture, given the inflation in houses and how banks may be funding big commercial landlords rather than individuals?<\/p><p>Has the Department considered what the long-term cultural implications of that are?  Does it still see banks as being likely to provide mortgage lending to individual customers on middle and lower incomes?  I have in mind two civil servants who have been the public service for between eight and ten years, who have earned a few increments and may have been promoted once or twice.  The way everything is going, it will be increasingly difficult for such people to buy as they are being squeezed out by the banks' other customers.  In cultural terms, these matters have profound implications for people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019031200002#X00200","speaker":"1253","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1552399200,"counter":285,"content":"<p>The Deputy raised a lot of interesting issues.

I am reminded of what the head of the International Monetary Fund, Ms Christine Lagarde, said recently to the effect that those working in the financial sector must be as serious about values as they are about valuations, and just as passionate about culture as they are about capital.  A lot of this derives from the fact that an unacceptable culture operated during the financial crisis.  In 2011, the Commission of Investigation into the Banking Sector in Ireland stated that cultural failings within the banking sector were a significant contributory factor to the financial crisis.<\/p> <p>  Mr. David Needle, an academic at King's College London, has focused on banking culture.  He says banking culture represents the collective values, beliefs and principles of its members and is a product of management style and the organisation's vision, norms, environment and habits.

There is an asymmetric information relationship because the bank representative has all the information and knowledge, which the customer does not have.  It is a somewhat unequal relationship, which is why it is important to have the right regulatory framework in place and culture is part of that.  She also hit the nail on the head by referring to financial literacy, which is increasingly referred to as \"financial capability\".  There is an issue in many countries, arguably including Ireland, in that our populations may not be as financial literate or capable as they need to be.  This is going to be a real challenge going forward and the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission has recently done a study on the issue of financial capability.  It has put forward some interesting suggestions for how financial literacy in Ireland could be improved.<\/p><p>It is a bit like health promotion.  Rather than addressing an issue when somebody falls ill, we want to get people to act in a healthy way so that they do not get ill in the first place.

It is a programme of the Departments of Housing, Planning and Local Government and Public Expenditure and Reform, and the Department of Finance is not involved.<\/p><p> On the question of appointing consumer champions to banks, the Minister for Finance has recently made two significant appointments to the Central Bank Commission.  One is Mr. John Trethowan, who is the credit reviewer and who deals with small and medium-sized businesses, SMEs, on a weekly and daily basis which are having difficulties with banks.  He has a wealth of experience in understanding the difficulties that SMEs have with banks.  The other is Niamh Moloney, a renowned academic who is head of law at the London School of Economics and was the head of the consumer panel on the Central Bank.<\/p><p> There was a suggestion that large corporate landlords were buying up properties.  The economic research team in the Department of Finance has recently published an interesting analysis on this issue.  I do not claim to be an expert but the research is available on our website and we can make it available to the committee.  Its general conclusion is that, to date, such investment is relatively modest in the overall scheme of things.  It tends to be quite high profile because it is often in high-profile areas, particularly in Dublin.  It is small in scale relative to all the new building that is going on.<\/p><p> Deputy Burton also made an interesting point about the move to digitalisation and online banking.  As consumers decide to move to online and phone banking, leaving fewer and fewer bricks-and-mortar bank branches, we need to avoid creating a new set of consumers who are left behind in the process of digitalisation.  There are particular concerns for older citizens, who should be able to access digital banking in a convenient way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019031200002#Z00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gary Tobin","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1552399200,"counter":289,"content":"<p>I do not know if the Department has done any research into this, but professional landlords are driving rents very high and this is a significant economic factor.  While the numbers in this market are small compared to more traditional investors, such as mortgage holders who buy residential property for a family, they are driving rents up to much higher levels, which means a three-bedroomed house which was available two years ago for between &euro;1,600 and &euro;1,800 is now heading for &euro;3,000 or more.  The banks are agents of this because they fund such investment.<\/p><p>This is causing many problems, especially in Dublin, where it is at of its most extreme.  The pressure on wages is enormous because unless one is earning a high salary, people such as those employed in the public sector and others will not be able to afford either to rent or buy.  The properties are being bought up by investors who are reaching out into all the Dublin suburbs.  If the Department is following markets, has that trend come to the attention and crossed the radar of the officials?  I am sure everybody is talking about it at the water cooler, because those entering the labour market as a graduate or postgraduate and earning &euro;30,000 plus are finding it difficult to compete for accommodation with these other entrants.

The housing market is incredibly complex.  What we saw in the run up to the crash was unsustainable lending to the construction sector, in large measure driven by the banks.  We do not want to repeat that overlending.  The Deputy referred to the commercial landlords, and essentially a new model - build to rent, is becoming apparent.  What has tended to happen is that the banks are far more reluctant to lend to the construction sector for obvious reasons in that they have had their fingers badly burned and the construction sector is looking increasingly to non-bank finance to fund apartment construction.  The build to rent model tends to be used for apartment blocks.  Some of the investment funds were financing the construction of these apartment buildings.  Now, not only are they financing the construction of the apartments, they have also in certain instances decided to buy the apartment blocks themselves and rent them out as they see that as a stream of income.  Ultimately it is a policy decision whether the Government of the day thinks this is good or a bad.  These investors are supplying additional supply into the market and obviously the market is not homogenous and there are different types of submarket segments and they tend to be supplying the upper end of the market.<\/p> <p>  The ultimate solution is supply, supply, supply.  Supply will be the solution to the rental situation.  The Department of Finance is following the housing market closely.  We have a particular subgroup of our executive board which meets regularly and only looks at the housing market and we have published a number of recent papers on the housing market, including quite detailed statistics, which are all available on our website.

I know plenty of people who are using post offices more than they use the banks, in spite of the fact that the money might end up in the banks anyway.  People feel that the banks do not want walk-in customers.  That may be true.  There are plenty of bank customers who never want to go near a bank, and I accept that but now bank queues are particularly long, they have different days for coin services and there are branches that do not have human interaction for cash where customers must use a machine.  Many people feel that the banks have not learned many of the lessons that the public would like them to have learned, in terms of how they should regard the customer as their main focus.  For the banks, it is about return.  There will always be a challenge between looking for return for shareholders and so on.<\/p><p> Mr. Tobin said that the outcome he wants is better consumer protection and financial stability and that will be achieved through individual accountability through SEAR, and enhancement to the current fitness and probity and enforcement regimes.

When we talk to the main banks, they tell us - and he may well say that they would tell us this but we are certainly not uncritical of what the banks tell us - that in certain instances they may have fewer than ten people walking into a branch every day and, in some cases, every week.  People have voted with their feet or their fingertips and they are now doing 99% of their banking online or on their phone.  That is a reality.  The banking landscape in five or ten years will be fascinating because increasingly what we are seeing is the emergence of digital challengers, be it Revolut or N26.

I will take that.  I do acknowledge that the world is moving on in terms of going cashless, tapping and all the rest.  I know of owners of pubs and restaurants who are talking about going fully cashless and a lot of places are similar.  The banks need to bring some customers on a journey in terms of technology because these people are less comfortable with debit or credit cards, still like the feel of notes and view the technology as a black hole.  In ten or 20 years time those people will not exist in the same way that most people do not write cheques very often anymore and use other ways of paying such as electronic funds transfer, EFT, or whatever.  I know of a school that opened a post office account because its bank did not deal with cash except on a Friday.  The school took such action because when it got cash between Monday and Wednesday it had nowhere to go with the money.  The banks may say that customers have voted with their feet but customers have felt compelled to vote with their feet because banks have made accessing banking services fairly difficult.  If one finds that there are 40 or 50 people queuing in a bank when one wants to make a transaction then one will not queue too often and will find other ways to bank.  There is a bit of a carrot and stick approach.  Many of the people that I have met, who are perfectly reasonable and ordinary, do not feel welcome in their branch but that is probably the way it is going to go.  In terms of what we did for the banks as a State and nation, and the hit we are still taking in terms of paying out, sometimes people are surprised to realise, as I mentioned in the earlier session, that there are almost 1,000 people working in AIB who earn over &euro;100,000 each.  We got those figures.  They may only be 9% of 10,000 people or whatever but it is still a lot of people earning a lot of money for a bank that cost the State a fair bit of money.  Maybe in the end it will not cost too much but certainly we took a lot of hit for it at the time, and certainly other banks did too.<\/p> <p>  The Department of Finance still has a stake in a number of the banks.  It has a very significant stake in PTSB and AIB, and a smaller stake in the Bank of Ireland.  In terms of the relationship between the valuation of the banks, which ultimately is to all of our benefit as a nation, and the culture, the Department has a role to make sure that the banks do what they do.  The Department probably has a role to protect the shareholding on behalf of the Minister, who is the shareholder, on behalf of all of us who benefit if the bank shareholding increases in value and will have lesser resources if it does not.  What relationship does Mr. Tobin see between the valuation of the banks and their culture?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019031200002#DD00600","speaker":"1412"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1552399200,"counter":301,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for his questions.  In terms of cash, I would not want to give the impression that we, as in the Department, necessarily want to move to a completely cashless society.  We recently published a study entitled Benchmarking Payments in Ireland that assessed where Ireland is in terms of moving towards a cashless society.  The main finding is that we are moving there relatively quickly.  A lot of that is positive but one of the potential negatives is that we are going to become ever more reliant on technology.  The one thing one can be sure about technology is that it is great when it works but it is not so great when it does not work.  One of the takeaways for us in terms of the review is that we still feel that cash needs to remain as an option for people to use.  We are also very conscious that there may be certain members of society, for a variety of reasons, who may want to use cash and not go completely digital.<\/p><p> In terms of the question about the role of the Department as shareholder versus legislating for regulation, we are mindful that it is really important that we, as a Department, do not become captured by the sector.  That is why we have very deliberately split responsibility for the shareholder function away from the banking policy function.  My colleagues and I work on banking policy.  We have responsibility for working on the regulatory framework for the banks and working on issues such as the banking culture.  We have a completely separate unit led by my colleague, Mr. Des Carville, who looks after the shareholding function.  We have Chinese walls because there are different divisions within the Department with different responsibilities.

As Mr. Tobin mentioned, our colleagues in the shareholding advisory division meet the banks, and we will expect them to be saying that.  The banks get it from both sides because when they meet our division we emphasise what we want, which is a competitive banking environment that supports customers, because that is in the long-term interest of the wider economy.  It is also in the longer-term interests of the banks themselves in that they are competing in competitive environments.

Part of the problem in the financial crisis was that there was not enough diversity of thought in our banks and there tended to be an element of groupthink.  We also tended to have overconfidence within our banks in the run-up to the financial crisis.

Could ability to pay be factored into a relaxation of the rules in the case of, say, a person approximately 30 years old who has a well paid and secure job but is finding it difficult to save a particular amount because of the high cost of rent?

Rugadh agus t&oacute;gadh i gCorca Dhuibhne m&eacute;, f&eacute;achaim ar aghaidheanna Chorca Dhuibhne anseo c&eacute; nach n-aithn&iacute;m iad go l&eacute;ir.  Bh&iacute; mo chuid scola&iacute;ochta go l&eacute;ir tr&iacute; mhe&aacute;n na Gaeilge agus bh&iacute; an t-&aacute;dh liom an deis sin a fh&aacute;il chomh luath i mo shaol.  T&oacute;gadh mar chainteoir d&uacute;chais m&eacute;.  Nuair a bh&iacute; me ag cr&iacute;ochn&uacute; na scoile - b'fh&eacute;idir go bhfuil cuid de na daoine at&aacute; anseo mar an gc&eacute;anna - n&iacute; raibh clue d&aacute; laghad agam cad a dh&eacute;anfainn sa saol.  Bheartaigh m&eacute; imeacht go dt&iacute; Ollscoil na h&Eacute;ireann i nGaillimh agus p&eacute; rud a thaitin liom ar scoil chlo&iacute;gh m&eacute; leis na h&aacute;bhair sin a thaitin liom.  Is &eacute; an rud a rinne m&eacute; i nGaillimh n&aacute; go raibh deis agam roinnt de na h&aacute;bhair a roghnaigh m&eacute; a dh&eacute;anamh tr&iacute; mhe&aacute;n na Gaeilge.  Bhain m&eacute; amach c&eacute;im sa Bh&eacute;arla agus sa Fhraincis ach bh&iacute; m&eacute; &aacute;balta mo ranganna Fraincise a dh&eacute;anamh tr&iacute; mhe&aacute;n na Gaeilge, faoi mar a rinne m&eacute; ar scoil.  Aon ranganna teanga a bh&iacute; againn &oacute; thaobh aistri&uacute;ch&aacute;in de agus ruda&iacute; mar sin, is &oacute; Ghaeilge go Fraincis a bh&iacute; m&eacute; ag obair.  C&eacute; nach bhfuil c&eacute;im agam sa Ghaeilge, bh&iacute; m&eacute; f&oacute;s ag fanacht leis an nGaeilge go hind&iacute;reach.  Chabhraigh s&eacute; sin liom nuair a bh&iacute; m&eacute; ag lorg post, tar &eacute;is na hollscoile.  Rinne m&eacute; diopl&oacute;ma sa Ghaeilge, de r&eacute;ir mar a bh&iacute; m&eacute; ag d&eacute;anamh mo ch&eacute;im i nGaillimh agus bh&iacute; s&eacute; sin ar a laghad mar ch&aacute;il&iacute;ocht agam nuair a chr&iacute;ochnaigh m&eacute; san ollscoil.

Chabhraigh s&eacute; sin go m&oacute;r liom.  C&eacute; nach raibh m&eacute; ag smaoineamh air ag an am, tuigim anois gur rud maith a bh&iacute; &aacute; dh&eacute;anamh agam clo&iacute; leis an nGaeilge.<\/p> <p>  Bh&iacute; c&uacute;pla post agam ansin i dtionscal an aistri&uacute;ch&aacute;in.

Bh&iacute; go leor teangacha i gceist ansin agus fuair m&eacute; taith&iacute; lasmuigh de ch&uacute;rsa&iacute; Gaeilge ar thionscadail an aistri&uacute;ch&aacute;in go ginear&aacute;lta.<\/p> <p>  Bheartaigh m&eacute; ansin ar scol&aacute;ireacht a dh&eacute;anamh i Meirice&aacute;.  Deis iontach a bh&iacute; ansin chun taistil agus an Ghaeilge a &uacute;s&aacute;id mar chuid den taisteal sin.  Chuaigh m&eacute; go Meirice&aacute; agus chuir m&eacute; faoi ar feadh bliana in Idaho chun Gaeilge a mh&uacute;ineadh Gaeilge.  N&iacute; fheadar an bhfuil a fhios ag aon duine c&aacute; bhfuil Idaho mar n&iacute; raibh a fhios agam f&eacute;in sular ghabh m&eacute; sall.  B'shin ceann de na deiseanna ab fhearr a bh&iacute; agam &oacute; thaobh c&uacute;rsa&iacute; Gaeilge, is &eacute; sin gur thug s&eacute; deis dom taisteal thar lear.  Bh&iacute; m&eacute; ag m&uacute;ineadh ar feadh bliana in ollscoil amuigh ansin.  Bh&iacute; an Ghaeilge &aacute; m&uacute;ineadh in an-chuid ollscoileanna i Meirice&aacute; agus b&iacute;onn go leor deiseanna i gceist leis sin agus b&iacute;onn &iacute; &aacute; m&uacute;ineadh i gCeanada chomh maith.  C&eacute; go bhfuil deiseanna sa Bhruis&eacute;il, t&aacute; deiseanna in &aacute;iteanna eile timpeall an domhain chomh maith.  Mar chuid den phost ansin bh&iacute; deis agam imeachta&iacute; a chur ar f&aacute;il do mhic l&eacute;inn, do bhaill foirne, do mhuintir an phobail agus fuair m&eacute; tuiscint go bhfuil l&eacute;argas difri&uacute;il ar an teanga.

Is sa tsl&iacute; sin a th&aacute;inig m&eacute; go dt&iacute; Col&aacute;iste na Tr&iacute;on&oacute;ide mar oifigeach Gaeilge.  Is post an-&eacute;ags&uacute;il agus an-suimi&uacute;il at&aacute; ann.  B&iacute;onn go leor ar si&uacute;l sa chol&aacute;iste agus is rud iontach &eacute; go mb&iacute;onn na mic l&eacute;inn laistiar d'an-chuid de.

Is seans iontach &eacute; sin a bheith mar chuid den sc&eacute;im c&oacute;naithe.  N&iacute; hamh&aacute;in go mb&iacute;onn siad ag maireacht&aacute;il le ch&eacute;ile ach b&iacute;onn siad ag caint Gaeilge le ch&eacute;ile gach l&aacute;, agus baint acu le tionscadail dhifri&uacute;la a bh&iacute;onn ar si&uacute;l againn sa chol&aacute;iste agus b'fh&eacute;idir ag tac&uacute; liomsa.  Go minic, t&eacute;ann siad ar aghaidh ansin agus b&iacute;onn siad an-ghn&iacute;omhach sa Chumann Gaelach agus t&aacute; roinnt mic l&eacute;inn san am a d'imigh tharainn agus bh&iacute; siad mar uachtar&aacute;in ar aontas na mac l&eacute;inn at&aacute; sa chol&aacute;iste chomh maith.  Is &eacute; sin cuid den obair a bh&iacute;onn ar si&uacute;l agam.  Cuirim imeachta&iacute; ar si&uacute;l do bhaill foirne agus do mhic l&eacute;inn.  B&iacute;onn ranganna Gaeilge saor in aisce ar si&uacute;l sa chol&aacute;iste agus b&iacute;m &aacute; n-eagr&uacute; sin agus b&iacute;onn deis ag gach duine sa chol&aacute;iste an Ghaeilge a fhoghlaim.  T&aacute; an-chuid mac l&eacute;inn agus ball foirne idirn&aacute;isi&uacute;nta againn i gCol&aacute;iste na Tr&iacute;on&oacute;ide.  B&iacute;mid mar sin ag iarraidh freastal orthu mar b'fh&eacute;idir go mbeadh sp&eacute;is acu sin c&uacute;pla focal Gaeilge a fhoghlaim fad is a bh&iacute;onn siad ann chomh maith.<\/p> <p>  Mar chuid den phost tagaim ar ais go dt&iacute; an c&uacute;lra at&aacute; agam san aistri&uacute;ch&aacute;n sa chaoi is go gcuirim aistri&uacute;ch&aacute;n ar f&aacute;il don chol&aacute;iste chomh maith.  Mar chuid de sin, is ceann de na pr&iacute;omhchodanna de mo r&oacute;l n&aacute; go mb&iacute;m ag cabhr&uacute; leis an ollscoil f&eacute;in clo&iacute; leis na dualgais reacht&uacute;la at&aacute; aici.

T&aacute; tionchar ag an bhfeirmeoireacht ar an timpeallacht ach n&iacute; g&aacute; gur droch-thionchar at&aacute; i gceist.  T&aacute; bunt&aacute;ist&iacute; faoi leith ag feirmeoir&iacute; na h&Eacute;ireann agus creid &eacute; n&oacute; n&aacute; creid is ar an aimsir at&aacute; m&eacute; ag caint.

B&iacute;onn aiste bia den scoth ag ba na h&Eacute;ireann agus tugtar togha na haire d&oacute;ibh.  Is de bharr na bunt&aacute;ist&iacute; n&aacute;d&uacute;rtha seo go bhfuil cl&uacute;, c&aacute;il agus ardmheas ar fheoil agus ar th&aacute;irg&iacute; d&eacute;ir&iacute;ochta na h&Eacute;ireann ar fud an domhan.  T&aacute;im an-mh&oacute;r&aacute;lach as seo agus n&iacute;or mhaith liom d&aacute; gcuirfeadh aon dl&iacute; n&oacute; riail isteach air.  Tuigeann go leor, leor feirmeoir&iacute; t&aacute;bhacht na timpeallachta agus tugann siad aire don talamh agus don uisce d&aacute; r&eacute;ir.

N&iacute; thagann ach 7% de &oacute; na ba c&eacute; go gceapfadh duine &oacute; na me&aacute;in gurb iad na ba is c&uacute;is le formh&oacute;r de.  Cad faoin 93% eile?<\/p><p> T&aacute; dea-sc&eacute;ala ann maidir le crainn.  T&aacute; 312 milli&uacute;n tonna d&rsquo;ocsa&iacute;d carb&oacute;in st&oacute;r&aacute;ilte i bhforaoiseacha na h&Eacute;ireann.  Cuirtear 3.6 milli&uacute;n tonna leis gach bliain.  T&oacute;gann na crainn de-ocs&aacute;id carb&oacute;in as an aer agus cuireann siad ocsaigin ina &aacute;it.  An teachtaireacht at&aacute; anseo d&uacute;inn n&aacute; gur f&eacute;idir leis na crainn feabhas m&oacute;r a chur ar an sc&eacute;al, go h&aacute;irithe &oacute;s rud &eacute; go bhf&aacute;sann crainn dh&aacute; oiread n&iacute;os tap&uacute;la in &Eacute;irinn n&aacute; mar a dh&eacute;anann sna cr&iacute;ocha Lochlannacha.  Mar sin, is f&eacute;idir fadhb an charb&oacute;in a fheabhs&uacute; tr&iacute; fhorbairt a dh&eacute;anamh ar an bhforaoiseacht.  T&aacute; an fheirmeoireacht go m&oacute;r i mbaol.

I M&iacute; Ean&aacute;ir athra&iacute;onn daoine a n-aiste bia feola go aiste bia veige&aacute;n ar mhaithe lena sl&aacute;inte agus ar mhaithe leis an timpeallacht.

Is feirmeoir&iacute; p&aacute;irtaimseartha go leor de na daoine at&aacute; gabh&aacute;ilte sna feirme sin.  T&aacute; feirmeoir&iacute; mairteola na t&iacute;re seo faoi bhr&uacute; le an-tamall agus puinn ioncam &aacute; fh&aacute;il a dtuilleamh acu as a gc&uacute;ram.

Bh&iacute; cad &eacute; fuadar agus fotha imn&iacute; faoi fheirmeoir&iacute; na leithinse i ndeireadh Feabhra agus iad ag tabhairt faoi na cnoic agus na portacha le las&aacute;in.

Dh&oacute;igh na feirmeoir&iacute;<b><\/b>an t-aiteann uair le haghaidh gach seacht&uacute; bliain chun athnuachan a dh&eacute;anamh ar na cnoic.  Faoi mar at&aacute; r&aacute;ite agam cheana, t&aacute; an t-&aacute;dh dearg linne sa t&iacute;r seo go bhfuil an fheirmeoireacht chomh n&aacute;d&uacute;rtha sin.  Maireann na ba anseo amuigh sna p&aacute;irceanna agus n&iacute; tugtar d&oacute;ibh ach d&aacute;ileoige chun iad a chosaint &oacute; ghalair.

Chomh maith leis sin, is &eacute; an innilt nialais n&oacute; zero grazing at&aacute; rian ansin thall, rud a chialla&iacute;onn nach mb&iacute;onn na ba ag in&iacute;or riamh agus is minic go dtugann siad an bliain ar fad istigh faoi dhian.<br\/><br\/>F&eacute;ach ar na caoirigh chomh maith.

Murach na caoirigh sin, bheadh an iomarca f&eacute;ar, rud a mhar&oacute;idh bl&aacute;thanna agus fauna eile an oile&aacute;in.  Is amhlaidh a tharla sa Bhoireann i gContae an Chl&aacute;ir tamall de bhlianta &oacute; shin nuair nach ligeadh do na ba an geimhreadh a thabhairt ag in&iacute;or sa Bhoireann.
