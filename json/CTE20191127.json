I also welcome the representatives of the Association of Irish Local Government AILG, the Local Authority Members Association, LAMA and anyone else who is tuning in.<\/p> <p>  I read the Minister of State's statement last night and there was nothing new in it.  I have a few questions.<\/p> <p>  The Moorhead report was commissioned in June 2018.  We are now heading into Christmas 2019.  It has been a long time and people are frustrated.  The Minister of State will be aware of this because I have seen the correspondence that has gone to him.  I passed correspondence on to the Minister of State from people of all parties and none in the matter.<\/p> <p>  To set the context straight here in this public meeting, councillors are on &euro;17,359; it is a pittance for the work they do.  The Minister of State himself started in the General Council of County Councils with me in 1999.  I know he is committed to local government.  This is not a dispute with the Minister of State, Deputy Phelan, whose hands are perhaps a little more tied than he wants to say.  The reality is the Government made a commitment in advance of the local elections, in which in excess of 900 councillors were elected, that we would address it.  I suppose I am asking the Minister of State what is the delay.  Has he seen additional drafts of this report in the past two or three months?  Can the Minister of State tell this committee whether he has seen any drafts of this recommendation?  Is there a reticence or reluctance on the part of Government to acknowledge the important work that county councillors do?<\/p> <p>  As I say, it is frustrating.  Members of all parties, including the Minister of State's own, are frustrated by the lack of progress.  I am trying to get confirmation.  What is the Minister of State's plan?<\/p> <p>  I have stated previously I believe city and county councillors should earn approximately &euro;30,000 - 50% of what Senators earn.  I believe their earnings should be linked to Senators and have said so previously.  I do not support decoupling county councillors from other politicians.  We are all politicians.  We are all elected.  We are all serving our communities and our constituents.<\/p> <p>  I will not dwell on it.  As I say, I do not doubt the Minister of State's commitment but it is time that we had clarification.  At this stage, where is this report?  When will it be published?  What is the process for publishing it?  I would also like the Minister of State to give a commitment that he will continue to engage with this committee, as he is doing today, on how we will progress it and to say what is happening.<\/p> <p>  Finally, I did not have an opportunity, because I left early to come here, to hear what was said on \"Morning Ireland\".  The Minister of State might enlighten us as to what he is talking about in relation to \"Morning Ireland\" and his commitment for additional or interim funding.  I simply do not know.  I came down the stairs today to be told that there was an announcement on \"Morning Ireland\".  The Minister of State might share that with the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019112700002#B00300","speaker":"1379"},{"type":"speech","time":1574812800,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I will take Deputy Cassells next.

Given that we were due to have this report at the end of the summer recess, if we could have clarity this morning that this process will be put to bed it would be welcome.<\/p> <p>  I welcome the clarification on \"Morning Ireland\" this morning.  As with all major announcements of significance in this country, such as the budget, the national development and all internal Committee of Public Accounts documents, it went on that programme first.  I welcome the \"Morning Ireland\" clarification.  If, perhaps, as Senator Boyhan said, we could get official clarification for the record of the Houses as to the standing, I would appreciate that.<\/p> <p>  I have a couple of questions.  Can the Minister of State confirm that the increase would cost &euro;7.5 million per annum?  Has the Minister discussed the cumulative amount with the Minister for Finance and has he committed to the process?  Has the Minister of State discussed it with the Taoiseach and has he committed to the process?<\/p> <p>  I refer to the discussions and the position of the AILG, representatives of which are in the Public Gallery and whom I welcome.  Has the Minister of State discussed it in terms of the indicative figure with the County and City Managers Association and local authority directors of finance in the context of future budgets?<\/p><p>Is it going to be a situation where this will be funded in the interim by the Exchequer or by internal financing?  Can the Minister confirm, in respect of his statement on committing to the back pay, that the increment that would be put forward would be backdated to the point of the election in 2019?  If the Minister's position is still the same, can he enlighten us on where that funding will come from on the basis that county council budgets for the current year, 2019, would have been put together in November 2018?  Councils which currently pay local representatives would not have adjudicated for such expenditure in the 2019 period.  Is it the case that such moneys due to councillors in 2019 would be met from central Exchequer funds?  How is that going to be accommodated going forward into 2020?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019112700002#B00700","speaker":"1218","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1574812800,"counter":15,"content":"<p>Could Deputy Cassells be a little more precise, because we are very tight on time and I am trying to keep it-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019112700002#C00200","speaker":"1357"},{"type":"speech","time":1574812800,"counter":16,"content":"<p>That is perfect, Vice Chairman.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019112700002#C00300","speaker":"1218"},{"type":"speech","time":1574812800,"counter":17,"content":"<p>We have about 20 minutes, Vice Chairman.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019112700002#C00400","speaker":"1416"},{"type":"speech","time":1574812800,"counter":18,"content":"<p>If Senator Conway could just pipe down-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019112700002#C00500","speaker":"1218"},{"type":"speech","time":1574812800,"counter":19,"content":"<p>I am at this committee all the time.

This committee has a really good working relationship and we work in a very collegiate way.  I think we should continue that in all of our discussions, notwithstanding people's different points of view.<\/p><p>I thank the Minister of State for coming in.  Particularly for anybody watching this, it is important we put this discussion into some context.  We have been having conversations over the last year or so, both in this committee and with the Minister, in respect of some forthcoming legislation, about strengthening the powers of local government and increasing the responsibility of our local elected representatives, not just in terms of the directly elected mayors but in terms of some of the other structural reforms the Minister has been proposing.  At the same time, we all acknowledge that it is becoming increasingly difficult to attract as broad a spectrum of people into local politics as all of us would like.  One of the reasons, although it is not the only one, is the very limited financial remuneration for city and county councillors.  People from low-income families, mothers with children and people from a variety of backgrounds find it very difficult to take on the ever-growing responsibilities.  We have to acknowledge that and it is important the public knows that.<\/p><p>It is also important that we state again that city and county councillors do not get a full-time wage.  There are lots of people out there who think city and county councillors get a wage commensurate to some who work in the Houses, but that is not the case.  In fact, there are many local authority representatives who either make very little money or who lose money because of the cost they incur in doing the work.  That is particularly the case for county councillors from larger rural communities, and I say that as a Dublin Deputy and a former full-time councillor.  Our conversation here is about trying to look at ways of improving the throughput of talented and capable people into local government, particularly at a time when their responsibilities are growing, and we are looking to give them more power and responsibility.<\/p><p>The Minister of State is probably not going to be able to answer a lot of the questions because he is going to tell us that the report is being finalised and we will have to await the outcome of that.  In respect of the report by the journalist from the <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>on &quot;Morning Ireland&quot;, is it the case that the Minister of State is considering rolling this issue into broader public sector pay negotiations?  If that is the case, or if that is one of the options, can he talk us through what that would mean, what that could look like, who would be responsible for negotiating that and what the kind of timelines would be, because it is the first time I have heard that publicly and that is certainly a very significant bit of information?<\/p><p>Can the Minister of State give us a commitment in terms of the timeline of the publication of the report his Department has commissioned and a timeline for the period within which he is going to come back with formal recommendations?  One of the difficulties this committee has is that when the Government commissions a report, it takes a very long time to produce it.  It then sits with the Minister - I am sure the Minister and the officials work very hard on it - and there is a long period of time before any action is outlined.  I am looking for some timelines in respect of that.  As the Minister knows from my submission to the Moorehead review, we strongly favour a shift to full-time, paid city and county councillors.  We have made an interim proposal where there should be a kind of a two-grade payment for part-time and full-time councillors.<\/p><p>We are strongly of the view that all unvouched expenses should be abolished and replaced with a basic rate of pay for full-time and part-time councillors and a fully vouched system of expenses for additional cost of work, and we argued for that in the Oireachtas also.  I am hopeful the Minister of State will move somewhere in that direction.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019112700002#C01700","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1574812800,"counter":31,"content":"<p>I call Senator Conway.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019112700002#C01800","speaker":"1357"},{"type":"speech","time":1574812800,"counter":32,"content":"<p>The Minister of State is most welcome to the committee this morning.  This whole debate on councillors' remuneration has been going on for quite a long time, and I respect the fact an independent body has been set up which has already given an interim report, but not a final one.  As colleagues said, what we need here are clear timelines.  Obviously, the Minister of State is privy to an awful lot more information in terms of what may be contained in the final report than we are, but the whole narrative before the 2019 local elections was that there was an expectation in respect of councillors that this whole issue would be addressed, because the system that pertained between 2014 and 2019 was quite unsatisfactory.<\/p> <p>  There were electoral areas but particularly in rural Ireland that had ballooned.  The workload of councillors had, in some cases, quadrupled because town councils had been eliminated and the redrawing of boundaries had moved some electoral areas from being four-seaters or five-seaters to eight-seaters or nine-seaters.  There has been a recalibration there in recent times, and those areas have been reduced, but the workload has not been reduced.<\/p> <p>  The idea of a fair day's wages for a fair day's work is something we all want to see.  There is cross-party support for dealing with this issue.  While it is not popular in the media to increase the pay of politicians, whoever they are, most fair-minded people would accept that county councillors who are at the coalface dealing with issues on a daily basis are not earning a fair day's pay for a fair day's work.<\/p> <p>  In my nine years in this House, I have never been told by anyone from any side to pipe down.  It happened under the Vice Chairman's stewardship.  Usually when people say things off-the-cuff that they do not mean, they withdraw the remark.  It comes as a very great disappointment to me that that remark was not withdrawn.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019112700002#C01900","speaker":"1416"},{"type":"speech","time":1574812800,"counter":33,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Conway.

The Moorhead report has been in process for almost two years.  The Minister of State wrote to me on 6 November and said that he had not received the report and hoped to receive it shortly.  Following receipt of the report, he said he would liaise with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform before submitting the report to the Government for consideration and that it was his objective to publish it thereafter.  That could take a substantial amount of time.  What is the timeline involved?  Can the Minister of State give an indication about the pay, including what was mentioned in \"Morning Ireland\" this morning?  I believe councillors deserve a salary that is at least 50% of a Senator's salary, as was mentioned earlier.  The work they do is comparable to the work of a D&aacute;il Deputy albeit they might have smaller constituencies than Deputies.

In addition, they must attend 80% of the meetings to receive payment and expenses.  The obstacles to women are obvious and have affected all political parties and others.

I am told that it is being finalised and that I will have it in the next ten days or so.  It is now my intention to publish it when I receive it.  When I receive it I will have to engage with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, but at this stage the least I should do for the councillors is ensure that it is published once it is received.  I acknowledge what Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill said, which is that the process outlined a month ago could be very long.

Senator Boyhan also said that he does not support decoupling from Senators.  I do.  I believe all public servants, including councillors, should be treated the same and that, as Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill said, we should not be returning to councillors as a stand-alone item at any stage in the future.  They should be treated like every other public servant.  I have no problem giving a commitment that I will continue to engage.<\/p> <p>  I did not hear the radio programme this morning, but I received a report on it.  What was contained therein was a fair synopsis of all the speculation I have heard in the last few weeks.

That may well be the figure from this morning's programme, but having not received the final report I cannot confirm or deny that figure.<\/p> <p>  I have discussed this with the Taoiseach.  In fact, it was the Taoiseach and I who decided that we need to do something in this area and that is why Ms Moorhead was appointed.  I have also discussed it with the Minister for Finance.  Both of them are committed and share my view that councillors should not be the worst paid people in the room among local authority staff, which is the current position.  Essentially, councillors work for the minimum wage and even slightly less in some cases.  That is why this group was established.  The proof of the pudding in respect of my colleagues and the Minister for Finance will come in the next stage of this process, but he has been very committed up to this point to ensuring that councillors are paid better than they are at present.<\/p> <p>  On the initial payment, having discussed it with the County and City Management Association my view is that the Government will have to provide the initial funding, particularly in light of the fact that many budgets are already finalised, but it will have to be built into local government funding thereafter.  Several members of the committee asked about that, including Deputy Cassells.<\/p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Broin is right that we have given extra powers not just to directly elected mayors, which is starting in Limerick, but also in respect of the rates alleviation measures.  I am not sure whether councils acted on them in the most recent budgets, but that power for them to reduce rates is now in place.  It is a new role that councillors did not have previously in terms of a targeted scheme built around their local area plans or county or city development plans.<\/p> <p>  One of the reasons it is difficult to attract people is certainly low pay.  I am aware of the Sinn F&eacute;in submission with regard to full-time and part-time councillors.  I do not agree with it.  I do not believe there should be two types of councillor.  We had that previously with regard to town councillors and county councillors and the issue of some areas having two ballot papers and others having one.  There is value in having a mix of people who are members of local authorities - people who are not just other public servants or people who are retired or who are students but also people who are in full-time employment and who wish to serve their local community.  They should be accommodated without being a second class.  I realise that is not the intention, but it might be the result of having a differentiation between full-time and part-time.<\/p> <p>  As regards publication, I will do it immediately upon receipt of the report, which should be in the next couple of weeks and well in advance of the new year.  Then there will be discussions with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  After that the people in the Department will decide on where the money comes from, what the rate will be and what the path will be.  There is a strong possibility that it will be part of the public sector pay talks which are due to commence next year.  However, that decision has not yet been made so I cannot comment further on it.  It will be part of the discussions I will have with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.<\/p> <p>  On Senator Conway's contribution, I commented on the timelines.  He is correct that the matter was discussed a great deal before the last local elections.  I gave commitments that it would be addressed and I am still determined that it will be.  I acknowledge that councillors are underpaid at present for the work they do and the amount of time that goes into the job.  I am committed to ensuring that whatever is in the report is implemented, but that will be a process of negotiation with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.<\/p><p>I know that I have the support of members here, and other members, in terms of those discussions that will take place in the near future.  Reference was made to a reduction in the size of the local electoral areas, which has helped councillors to be able to better serve their local communities.  I have always believed that local councillors should be local and that we would not have the monster electoral areas that were created in 2014.  It is correct to say that the issue is not popular but I too share the view that it should be a fair day's pay for a fair day's work.  It is my position, as I have stated previously and I will restate it here, that the expenses councillors generate in the pursuit of their work in terms of mileage, which are on the same rates as Oireachtas Members and other public and civil servants, should be retained.  That element of the job is not going to change.  Equally, there is an inherent value in the education and training budgets councillors get because they allow for an exchange of information and an opportunity for councillors to network and to learn from one another, and those funds facilitate that.<\/p><p> I assure Senator Mark Daly that I have not diverted from my view that this should be dated from the last local election.  It is a bit like boundaries when it comes to elections; there should be natural boundaries and elections are natural boundaries politically.  I have not moved from that.  Again, as I said at the outset, central government will have to pick up any increases or a substantial amount of them, but after that it will have to be built into the budgets of local authorities.  From my point of view, as I stated it from the start, the aim is very clearly to link it to public sector pay so that this never happens again and that there will not be politicians in the future deciding the pay of other politicians.  That should not happen.  It is the last vestige of that.  It should have been done when Oireachtas Members were linked to the public service.  A similar arrangement should have been introduced at that time rather than to Senators.<\/p><p> In response to Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill's question, I addressed the timeline.  He said that pay should be 50% of the pay of Senators.  I do not agree with that, but it should be substantially more than it is at present.  I have not received the report.  I expect to receive it very shortly and I will publish it immediately.<\/p><p> The change Senator Warfield referred to in relation to pensions is the reckonability of councillors' PRSI contributions towards their State pension.  As I understand it, and this is the position I will enter into in negotiations with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the pension gratuity system that existed up until the most recent election should remain.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019112700002#D00400","speaker":"1265","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1574812800,"counter":40,"content":"<p>We are very tight on time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019112700002#E00200","speaker":"1357"},{"type":"speech","time":1574812800,"counter":41,"content":"<p>I am almost finished.

As we initially noted when the committee issued its invitation, we are not yet in a position, as requested, to discuss the specifics of proposed legislation to deal with the emergence of personal powered transporters, PPTs, as no such legislation is proposed at this time.  However, insofar as we can assist the committee to develop its understanding and appreciation of the issues which developments in this area raise, we welcome the opportunity to engage with the members.  It is, I may say, an important and positive development to see the committee take such a forward-looking approach to its work.<\/p> <p>  The use of devices such as e-scooters, Segways, electric skateboards, powered mini-scooters, electric unicycles and non-pedal assisted electric bicycles on the streets and roads of cities has become more common across the world in the past few years.  These various devices are often collectively classified as powered personal transporters.  Because many such vehicles are not easily defined in law, their regulation, particularly in terms of safe usage on public roads and other public places where they interact with other modes of transport, varies considerably from country to country and indeed, in federal jurisdictions, within countries.  The notable upsurge in the number of e-scooters used in many of the main cities in Europe and the US has focused recent discussions regarding their numbers, collisions, how and where they can be used and by whom, and the criteria in respect of the vehicles themselves.  There have been particular concerns where private operators have started to offer these items for hire on the side of the street by means of mobile phone apps, without having any regard to the regulatory or physical environment in which they are doing so, but not only in such circumstances.  This upsurge has been driven by new private firms, typically owned by venture capital and other private equity funds, and by a rapid increase in the production of the items by manufacturers primarily based in China.  A number of main cities have moved to introduced controls to restrict their numbers and to control and even license their use.  In some cases, cities have moved to ban their use, either for hire or more generally, because of the adverse impact experienced and risks associated.<\/p> <p>  In this country, section 3 of the Road Traffic Act 1961 classifies such vehicles as mechanically propelled vehicles, MPVs.  Mechanically propelled vehicles cannot be driven on public roads or in public places without the appropriate driving licence, tax and insurance.  Due to the multiplicity of forms of PPTs and lack of established standards, they do not fall within the categories which we currently use for such purposes.  It is therefore not permissible to tax or insure them and no category of our EU-based driving licence covers their use.  Therefore, despite some opinions expressed to the contrary, there is no legal grey area and they are not considered eligible for use on a public road or in a public place.  Such an approach is also that of a number of other countries, including our neighbours in the United Kingdom.<\/p> <p>  E-scooters and other forms of PPTs are treated differently in other countries.  In the UK, they fall under the definition of a motor vehicle, similar to our MPV, and their use is still illegal on all UK roads, cycle lanes and pavements, although they may be used on private property.  Riders found using them in a public place are subject to a &pound;300 fine and six points on their driving licence should they hold one.  Germany has recently taken a different approach.  There they are classified as personal light electric vehicles.  I am afraid I do not know the German for that.  These have recently been provided for by the personal light electric vehicles regulations, introduced on 6 June 2019, which legalised their use.  Users must be aged 14 or over and vehicles must be registered and insured.  There are stringent testing procedures and conditions regarding their use.  Much of this reflects the broad civil law environment where, as a lecturer told me many years ago, anything that is not specifically permitted is forbidden.  Everything is very tightly regulated in these environments.  <\/p> <p>  Arising from public discussion on the question of providing for legislation to deal with the emergence of PPTs on our roads and footpaths, the Minister, Deputy Ross, requested the Road Safety Authority, RSA, to conduct research into the use of e-scooters in other countries, taking account of the implications for the interaction of such vehicles with other vulnerable road users along with other normal vehicular traffic.  The RSA commissioned Transport Research Laboratories, TRL, of the UK to carry out this research on its behalf.  TRL recommended that if the Minister were minded to provide for their use, the use of such vehicles could be allowed in certain circumstances, with controlled and considered roll-out to mitigate against potential negative safety implications.  The RSA also recommends that a restrictive approach be taken when regulating the use of such vehicles.  I will not recap the details because the RSA will be touching on them in its opening statement.  The RSA also stressed that the suitability of our infrastructure is a critical factor in considering whether to allow the use of these vehicles.<\/p> <p>  A number of the recommendations in the RSA report raise fairly fundamental legislative and other legal and indeed practical issues.  Clearly, the additional administration required for licensing and so on would have to be funded, presumably by those who wish to avail of these vehicles.  The question then arises as to where such regulation properly should lie - the report refers to both local and national regulation - and of course as to whether any such regulation can be effectively enforced, if at all.  There are other key resource questions to be considered.  These include the implications in terms of additional infrastructure and its cost, and most of all there are a number of opportunity costs to be considered.  These include the potential loss of road space for other sustainable modes, such as public transport, walking and cycling, which are already highly competitive modes in urban areas.  Some Deputies from the Dublin area would, I imagine, note how contentious issues around road space have proved in regard to recent plans for public transport.  Other opportunity costs are the potential diversion of Garda resources to enforce these vehicles from wider enforcement of the law; and of course the general question of which sectors would lose out if additional funding is required.<\/p> <p>  These issues are to some extent reflected in the views of the National Transport Authority, NTA, which had a look at the issue of e-scooters some time back and took the view that they should not be allowed on our roads.  That view was reached following consideration of a number of key issues, including the question of how the top speed is to be enforced as there are a number of options available to upgrade the vehicle&rsquo;s software that will increase the top speed to nearly 80 km\/h or 50 miles per hour for those of us who were taught in what one of my teachers called Christian units.  Other key issues include the suitability of their operation after dark, as the position of lights, particularly the rear lights, on existing models can be too low to be effectively seen by other vehicles sharing the road space; as well as the question of whether the onus will shift to road authorities to provide road surfaces suitable for tiny wheels as such an engineering requirement does not exist at present.  The NTA national cycle manual gives advice for road and street design based on the normal and expected road behaviour of existing road users and does not take account of e-scooters and so on.  This goes back to the issue of conflicting modes.<\/p><p>Our understanding is that these first came to be used by adults in the context of private firm and university campus environments in the west of the US where, very often, the standard of road surface is very high.  How will claims for compensation following accidents due to road surfaces, not to mind incidents involving other road users, be dealt with?  Given the size of the wheels on these vehicles, the speed at which they can travel and how prone they can be to imperfections in the road surface, including drains, their use could increase the number of claims taken against local authorities, which ultimately will reduce the resources available for road maintenance and improvement.  This is significant given the challenging budgetary situations faced by many local authorities.  These are valid concerns and must be taken into consideration when making decisions about legislating for or regulating these vehicles.  It is not a simple or straightforward matter of just legislating for them.  There are many factors to be considered and road safety is of paramount importance.  <\/p><p> At an EU level, anecdotal evidence on the high number of accidents is hardening, with many member states calling for technical harmonisation to improve the quality of the vehicles themselves.  As a consequence and recognising that the RSA and TRL, along with most researchers in this area, encountered significant difficulties in carrying out research due to a lack of robust evidence being available at this time, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport initiated a public consultation process which asked whether their use should be legalised.  The consultation process sought to investigate from a purely Irish perspective the conditions under which e-scooters and their like might be legislated for in this country, as well as the fundamental question as to whether the public interest, in terms of resources, public safety and sustainability would be served by legalising them.  The consultation concluded on 1 November and in excess of 500 submissions have been received.

I am accompanied by Ms Sharon Heffernan, senior researcher and Mr. Aidan McGinty, the RSA's vehicle standards engineer who is fast becoming the subject matter expert in the area of micromobility and e-scooters.<\/p> <p>  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport requested the RSA to research how e-scooters and other such vehicles are regulated in other countries, particularly in other EU member states.  A report was submitted by the RSA to the Department for the Minister's consideration.  I will summarise that report including the recommendations made by the RSA at that time.  I have also included some information on recent studies, events and publications for the committee's information. <\/p> <p>  In January 2019, the RSA commissioned the Transport Research Laboratory, TRL, a world leader in transport innovation and research, to review current practice and the safety implications of powered transporters.  Powered transporters were defined as a variety of novel personal transport devices which are mechanically propelled, that is, propelled by a motor, as well as or instead of being manually propelled.  These include devices such as electric scooters, commonly known as e-scooters, segways, hoverboards and powered unicycles.  The aim of this work was to inform considerations for future policy and regulatory framework updates by the RSA regarding the operation of powered transporters in Ireland.  To achieve this, TRL adopted a two-pronged approach, first completing a literature review and then a series of international case studies. <\/p> <p>  Following a stringent search and selection process, 45 items of literature relating to powered transporters were reviewed.  Although there was a noted lack of robust evidence available for review, the findings of the literature review indicated that policy and legislation should be developed to encourage the use of personal protective equipment such as helmets, when using powered transporters.  This could be completed via a targeted public awareness campaign and by placing responsibility with the powered transporter providers to promote safety.  It also indicated that training be undertaken by operators of powered transporters prior to their use in public, the specification of safety standards for powered transporters, for example, weight or size restrictions, minimum lighting and conspicuity standards, which could possibly be enforced through a type-approval system or certification process, as well as the specification of user requirements such as age limits, licence conditions and how and where the different devices can be used, for example footpaths, cycle paths or roads, and the rules for each of these. <\/p> <p>  It is important to note, however, that there is currently little evidence on which to base these proposed standards and requirements.  Although direct evidence is lacking, it was clear from the literature reviewed that these devices have potential benefits for active transport, reducing traffic congestion and improving air quality.  However, anecdotal evidence suggests that e-scooter-related injuries increase with greater e-scooter use.  It was also noted that regardless of legislation and enforcement in relation to powered transporters, in most countries there has been increased uptake by users and as such, an outright ban would not be practical to enforce. <\/p> <p>  Eleven countries were investigated for the case study portion of this report, including Ireland, the UK, the US, Germany, France, Switzerland, Spain, Belgium, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Australia and Israel.  Summaries were produced for each country in terms of current powered transporter-related legislation, if any, safety standards and policy recommendations, restrictions on usage including minimum age requirements, restrictions to certain roads and the next steps in those jurisdictions.  The findings of these case studies highlighted the difficulties being faced by regulators, policy makers and the public in respect of these devices.  In particular, there is a lack of consistency in how different types of powered transporters are being defined and named.  The same make and model of a device can have different names in different countries.<\/p><p>This kind of technology is developing at a rapid pace, such that some countries have had to take a reactive approach when developing and revising policy and legislation as usage and the legislative context changes.<br\/><br\/>On the Road Safety Authority's recommendations, in light of the findings of the report, recommendations were made to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport to guide the Minister if he was of a mind to legislate for the introduction of such devices.  The overall recommendation is that a restrictive approach be taken in terms of regulating for these devices in Ireland in the interest of road safety. Specifically, this means applying restrictions to the devices themselves, the operators who provide these, such as the names with which we are familiar already in other jurisdictions, the roads on which they can be used and the age of user.<br\/><br\/>Specifically, we recommended that consideration be given to the following items.  Electric personal mobility devices, including e-scooters, should be defined in legislation and, as such, any such definition should be sufficiently broad to be future-proof and to take account of legislation and the pace of development in this area of technology.  Consideration could be given to revising the classification of a mechanically propelled vehicle, MPV, or the creation of a new category of electric MPV, an eMPV.  Devices permitted on Irish roads should adhere to minimum safety standards, for example, a maximum speed of 20 km\/h.  In addition, design features for devices permitted on Irish roads should prioritise safety features such as brakes, lighting and audible warning mechanisms.  A review of the draft EU standard, CEN, could be considered in this context.  Some jurisdictions allow such devices on footpaths provided they do not exceed a speed of 6 km\/h.  However, from a practical perspective this would be very difficult to enforce, therefore, because of the risk these devices would pose to pedestrians if travelling at higher speeds, the recommendation is that they should not be used on footpaths.<br\/><br\/>There is merit also on safety grounds to limit their use to roads with a speed limit of 50 km\/h or less.  Ideally, they should not be allowed travel outside 30 km\/h zones.  They could be used in cycle lanes, where available.  A system should be put in place whereby device operators must seek a permit for leasing these devices, either from a national authority or a local authority.  They must adhere to certain guidelines, for example, the safety features of devices and the parking of devices while not in use.  These proposals need to consider congestion and street littering for the granting of a permit.  Each local authority should oversee compliance with these guidelines and mandate training as part of the permit approval process.  They could also limit the number of permits to ensure an over-proliferation of these devices does not occur because we cannot underestimate the volume of them in cities that have permitted them.<br\/><br\/>In some countries an age restriction applies to the user, depending on the power of the device.  This is a pragmatic approach that should be considered, for example, a minimum age of 16 for use of a device with a maximum speed of 20 km\/h.  This does not include, however, making personal protection equipment, PPE, mandatory.  Users should be encouraged to wear helmets and high visibility clothing, as per our recommendation for cyclists.<br\/><br\/>Rather than regulating for the use of these devices at national level, it may be appropriate for local authorities to pass by-laws to regulate for these as they also have powers to introduce by-laws in terms of speed zones, depending on the suitability of local infrastructure.  Local authorities will need to give consideration to the future-proofing of infrastructure to account for the growth in popularity of these devices.  <br\/><br\/>Overall, from a safety perspective, it is critical that Ireland&rsquo;s infrastructure is fit for purpose to accommodate the safe use of these devices and that dedicated parking spaces are provided or adequate collection measures are implemented, such as the city bikes systems, to avoid a proliferation of hazards on pavements or roads and cycle lanes.  The Transport Strategy for the Greater Dublin Area 2016 - 2035 calls out the inadequacy of the current infrastructure in section 3.2.  Consideration must be given by transport planners to ensure the current infrastructure is enhanced for all vulnerable road users and capable of accommodating electronic personal mobility devices.<br\/><br\/>Finally, legislation will need to be considered to give An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na the necessary powers to enforce the safe and legal use of electric personal mobility devices, and any legislation will have to be enforceable.<br\/><br\/><b><\/b>With regard to personal transporters and casualties, from a safety perspective it is widely acknowledged, both nationally and internationally, that there is a lack of data in this area on collisions and injuries resulting from the use of powered transporters.  This is typically due to the difficulties in classifying the various powered transporter devices when they are captured in national collision data.  Definitive statistical information on safety and also mobility patterns, for example, modal shift and the proportion of modes that are being displaced by powered transporter trips, are needed to further inform policy and legislation regarding powered transporter use.  A series of studies referenced in the Transport Research Laboratory, TRL, report on electric personal mobility devices provides snapshots of injury rates from powered transporters.  For example, Kim <i>et al.<\/i>in 2018 reported that 65 patients were admitted to hospital in Korea between January 2016 to December 2017, while Do <i>et al<\/i>. in 2016 reported on 35 cases in the Canadian hospitals injury reporting system.  That was between 2015 and 2016.<br\/><br\/><b><\/b>There are other recent publications and events.  There was a micromobility conference in Ljubljana, in October.  A recent European Commission conference highlighted the need for renewed planning to ensure road safety as the popularity of these devices continues to grow.  Among the topics the conference participants discussed was the need to integrate micromobility solutions into public transport, such that they can be complementary to one another rather than replacing or displacing it.  Tailored infrastructure to accommodate this will likely be needed, which may be city or jurisdiction-specific.<br\/><br\/>The need for a minimum technical standard for powered transporters was also discussed, as was the recommendation that different modes of transport be kept separate to minimise potentially dangerous interactions with other road users.  It was suggested that over-regulation be avoided but that a common regulatory framework must be drafted which addresses safety aspects such as speed limitations, guidance for parking, minimum age requirements and technical requirements.<br\/><br\/><b><i><\/i><\/b>The European Transport Safety Council, ETSC, PIN Flash report 37, Safer Roads, Safer Cities: how to improve urban road safety in the EU, was published in June 2019.  It examined how best to reduce road traffic collisions that occur on urban roads, the majority of which involve vulnerable road users.  It focuses in part on the safety challenges facing cities and towns across Europe in light of the rapidly changing means that people are using to travel in urban environments.  The need for tailored infrastructure, education and awareness campaigns, and national legislation and city-level regulations to accommodate growing use of shared and personal powered transporters, is highlighted, as is the unfortunate lack of data to further inform policy and legislation regarding their usage.  Given the often restricted space in urban areas for travel, this must be used efficiently to ensure road users are not put at increased risk.<br\/><br\/>Key recommendations regarding the use of powered transporters, particularly e-scooters, included that traffic regulations on space sharing be defined, for example, whether e-scooters should travel on the pavement, cycle paths or on the roads with motorised traffic, that e-scooter collision data are collected, and that further research on the road safety implications of powered transporters be conducted.<\/p><p>A report by the International Transport Forum, ITF, in August 2019 considers how new, app-based mobility services, including car-sharing, bike-sharing and e-scooter sharing services, can be effectively regulated to ensure innovative forms of urban mobility deliver their full benefits for society while ensuring the safety of road users.  Based on an ITF round table discussion, this report discusses the various benefits, including cheaper, more comfortable and timely transport options and risks, including safety and security concerns and cluttering public spaces with bicycles, e-scooters and associated vehicles with app-based mobility services.  Among a series of recommendations, the authors propose that the broader urban policy environment is taken into account when designing regulations for app-based mobility services.  Mitigating greenhouse gas emissions, reducing congestion, improving air quality and enhancing mobility particularly through the promotion of active travel are of substantial societal benefit and regulatory design for mobility services should account for such factors.  In line with this, it is recommended that suitable infrastructure is invested in to ensure these benefits are maximised while reducing road user risk.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019112700002#E01300","nonspeaker":"Ms Moyagh Murdock","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1574812800,"counter":134,"content":"<p>I will now move to members' questions.

The National Oversight and Audit Commission has highlighted this in respect of local authorities and we do not pretend other than that we are making our way back to a stage where we can maintain the existing infrastructure.  This is our great challenge.  What some of my colleagues call \"steady state\" or what I would call \"asset protection\" is one of our great challenges.  In doing that we have a standard already if we are to try to maintain an asset for a much more delicate instrument that has further resource implications.  Often what seems a simple question can lead to other challenging ones if it is thought of in the round.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019112700002#H00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ray O'Leary"},{"type":"speech","time":1574812800,"counter":153,"content":"<p>I agree with Mr. O'Leary to an extent.

We should bear in mind the transmission of views from the RSA's consultants, who are drawing on international experience.  I am referring to the question of what legislation would be entailed.  The Deputy will have had this experience with his.  It would be a matter of creating an environment for regulating the items and then a matter of regulating their use.  One could have a system whereby the items come under some sort of regulation, with or without a recognised standard.  Their use, and particularly where they can be used, could then be provided for, subject to a permissive by-law regime.  We would have to sit down, scope this out, work with our colleagues in the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel and consult our colleagues in the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  As the Deputy knows, the road traffic law code pertains to a mix of areas that are regulated nationally and at by-law level.  By-laws cover parking and one-way streets, for example.  Certainly, it is possible to have a mix of national and local regulations.  The other option would not be a common manoeuvre in the Irish context.  It would involve some kind of private legislation for a particular area.  In a sense, it would still end up with the same generic questions in terms of the vehicles themselves and so on.  I would not rule it out.  I am always slow to rule out an option until I have had a chance to draw out how it could work and its implications.  That is as much as I can say at this stage.  The aspect under discussion was a more surprising aspect of the conclusions but I believe it would be seen in the context of either the scope for a pilot or another context.  It relates to an earlier point we were making.  Not only is there the matter of how the user uses the vehicle but also the matters of the basic mechanical standards that need to be met and the safety fittings required.  Then the question arises as to what constitutes the best use of the road space that the vehicle might occupy.  Generally, the regulation of road space is led by local authorities.  There is, in a sense, a road-space aspect to this that might best be addressed at local authority level.  Equally, however, we do not want to put an excessive burden on local authorities.  It is a matter of striking a balance.  As ever, we are always trying to strike balances, accepting that we never come up with the perfect answer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019112700002#K02700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ray O'Leary"},{"type":"speech","time":1574812800,"counter":227,"content":"<p>As Ms Murdock said, it could not be done now anyway as it would require a change to primary legislation.

This has totally to do with the Department of Justice and Equality and the Committee of Public Accounts and it is not relevant here but there is a link with enforcement given that many fines are road traffic fines.  The service is down by 38%, according its own figures.  Approximately &euro;27 million is outstanding.  There are in the region of 90,000 related court cases backed up.  We were trying to get our head around this at a meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts and we were asking how it could be.  It is not the fault of the Garda.  It is doing its job and the GoSafe vans are engaging in enforcement at the required level.  The issue, however, is with the Fines Act.  The Act was to ensure somebody who could not pay a &euro;50 fine because he or she did not have the means would not go to jail and would instead be able to do community service.  The Department of Justice and Equality was advised the measures could not be implemented.  In the meantime, there is the unintended consequence of a huge drop in enforcement.  Can the delegates help this committee in any way in this regard?  Clearly, we know we need to take the matter up with the Department of Justice and Equality and its Minister.

The hardest part is trying to manage the conflicts between different classes of users.  In a sense e-scooter users are somewhat in the same bracket as cyclists but they are also different.  On the one hand, they are vulnerable road users with respect to somebody in a larger mechanically propelled vehicle such as a motorbike, car, van, truck or bus in terms of the spaces those vehicles use but, on the other, they are potentially hazardous vehicles, whether stationary or moving in respect to particularly what one might call - this is not a technical term - the highly vulnerable user, including the person with a disability or mobility issues.  We need to be incredibly conscious of those users.<\/p> <p>  We were recently preparing a response to a parliamentary question from a Deputy and we did not have the detailed information to provide on how many people with disabilities are among those killed.

The sample was small comprising 192 people who were injured in collisions while they were using an e-scooter.  However, there are findings on the types of injuries.  For instance, 48% of these people received head injuries, 35% sustained a bone fracture and almost half had some kind of severe injury.  They were interviewed and were asked for their view of what happened at the time of the collision.  Some 37% said that excessive scooter speed, for instance, may have contributed to the collision and 19% said they believed the scooter malfunctioned.

Clearly, it makes the lives of professionals dealing with the law much easier if the law code concerned is consolidated.  That might reflect the views of certain organisations.  We are not aware of any specific cases where the lack of consolidation caused prosecutions to fall.  We have looked at a few instances where similarly lengthy and complex law codes have been consolidated.  There are only two proper examples to date, namely the Companies Act and the Finance Act, both of which have limited criminal elements.  I forget the technical term for that kind of comprehensive consolidation.  Whoever lectured me in law more years ago than I care to remember would give me a slap.<\/p> <p>  There are two kinds of consolidation.  One involves putting the words together and the other involves tightening up legislation without changing the substance.  Both the cases I mentioned used comprehensive consolidation, where the code was put together and some amendments were made to pull it together wherever there were existing inconsistencies or imperfections.  Given the scale of the road traffic law code and the investment of time required for any consolidation, that would be the best option in this case.  Based on those two examples - and this is where the challenges come in - it is probably a job for a dedicated team of half a dozen people with appropriate expertise who would almost have to be locked in a room for four or five years.

It is one of the things we would like to do, but we are also dealing with emerging technologies such as personal powered transport, issues around autonomous vehicles and unexpected international events such as Brexit.  Our legislative efforts are focused on responding to the fact that we are not meeting our road death targets, and we are, therefore, trying to strengthen the code on killing behaviours like intoxicants and speeding.  Given the resources we have, our legislative efforts have prioritised those areas.  I recently had a very informal discussion with some colleagues about this matter.  I am not making a commitment to the committee, but trying to show that this is something we think about.  We have been considering what do in the short term, not just tomorrow.  To start, we will probably need to think about getting somebody in to do some kind of project plan on this, if Deputy MacSharry will permit that.  It is worth noting that we have consolidated in previous iterations of the road traffic law.  For example, the drink driving code is consolidated, bar the most recent amendments.  There are elements where that has happened.  If one were to do a project plan for this, one would first take a part of the code and consolidate that.  There are models where it might be consolidated in phases as well as one big block.  There is a political bullet to bite in terms of the Oireachtas, Ministers and our own capacity to divert our resources to manage that.

The authorities in that country have, following some tragic incidents, a very clear stance that safety must never be put at risk for the sake of innovation.
