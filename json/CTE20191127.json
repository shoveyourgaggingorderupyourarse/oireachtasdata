Ethanol Europe is an Irish organisation which produces climate-friendly ethanol for cutting greenhouse gas emissions.  It is a substitute for petrol.  IrBEA is the Irish Bioenergy Association, of which we are proud members.<\/p> <p>  We believe Ireland should be doing much more in the transport sector to address climate change, both where electromobility is concerned and where our huge and growing diesel and petrol fleet is concerned.  It is now part of routine conversation among academic and industry leaders to express surprise and concern at the meagre consideration given the matter.  In the midst of a climate emergency of immense proportions, those leaders expected to be convened to urgent consultations for achieving early progress but instead, there is mostly a vacuum.  Today&rsquo;s hearing is clearly very welcome. <\/p> <p>  Despite the size and growth rate of Ireland&rsquo;s diesel and petrol fleet, Ireland has done less than virtually any other country in Europe to cut the carbon emissions of its fleet.  Little encouragement is given to the oil sector to do more, a blind eye is turned to palm oil being falsely labelled as used cooking oil in our biodiesel and we see needless delaying of the simple and cost-free measure of introducing E10, the European standard for modern petrol today.<\/p> <p>  As the committee knows, fossil energy is our biggest source of climate-harming greenhouse gas emissions.  In Ireland, which has a large population of transport users, 40% of our energy-related emissions come from diesel and petrol vehicles, and this is increasing both in relative and absolute terms.<\/p> <p>  Ireland has a fleet of over 2.7 million diesel and petrol vehicles.  Last year, there were 280,000 new registrations, of which half were brand new and half were imported used vehicles, and the total grew by 45,000 net of de-registrations.  Just one in 70 new registrations was electric or hybrid and the diesel and petrol fleet actually grew by an amount ten times greater than total sales of electrics, to give a sense of the size of the challenge we are facing.  It will be several years before the diesel and petrol fleet reaches peak size and a couple of decades more before electrics match diesel and petrol, by which time the total fleet will be close to double the size it is today.<\/p> <p>  As a nation, we are guilty on two fronts: we need to do more to build the electric fleet that we would want in an ideal scenario and we need to take serious action to reduce the carbon footprint of the fleet we have and in which the Irish people continue to invest.<\/p> <p>  The latest UN report on climate change - the Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5 &deg;C - recognising the scale and longevity of fossil fuel in transport, states that biofuels will need to reach 15% of transport energy if global warming is to be brought under control.  Ireland has less than a quarter of this today and aims for the same or less by 2030, according to its recent proposal for the future of the biofuels obligation scheme, which is the country&rsquo;s regulatory instrument for implementing transport bioenergy policy.<\/p> <p>  Under the Paris Agreement, the EU has passed legislation which demands at least 40% cuts in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030.  I note the European Commission President, Dr. Ursula von der Leyen, is now aiming for 50%.  The agreement also demands 32% renewable energy across the entire economy.  Ireland has signed up to the agreement and its implications and will have to match those figures.  How can it be reasonable that our country&rsquo;s new proposal for the biofuels obligation scheme, instead of aspiring to alignment with the Paris Agreement ambitions, essentially goes in the opposite direction?  What is currently proposed is alignment of the scheme with a now redundant item of EU regulation called the renewable energy directive for transport, which, if it were to achieve its maximum imaginable ambition, would bring 10% renewables in transport by 2030 but which allows, by way of loopholes and options, unambitious countries to settle for as little as 3 or 4%.  Ireland is aiming for the lowest end of the scale under the biofuels obligation scheme, both in volume and quality, with us treating climate action in the diesel and petrol fleet as just an irksome piece of Brussels bureaucracy.<\/p> <p>  It is frequently noted that Ireland has achieved 7.2% renewable energy in transport to date under the reporting schema of the renewables directive.  What does not clearly emerge is that nearly half of this figure is actually regular fossil diesel counted as renewable according to the multiplier loophole of the directive, and that much of the other half is comprised of used cooking oil biodiesel which comes from regions where fraud is carried out on a huge scale, with virgin palm oil being falsely labelled as used cooking oil.  Only one third of the 7.2% figure is reliable and true, coming from genuine European used cooking oil and tallow and from sustainable, traceable, climate-friendly ethanol produced by the European farm sector.<\/p> <p>  Climate progress in the diesel and petrol fleet is a challenge, but it is possible, and there are some measures which can be taken immediately.  Ireland could have introduced E10 petrol fuel by now, which means petrol containing 10% ethanol.  France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, Finland, the USA and many other countries have done it already because E10 cuts greenhouse gas emissions, cuts particulates emissions from exhaust pipes, is considerably better for cars than petrol with no ethanol in it, and comes from the sugar and starch of sustainably grown European crops, with no risk of adverse environmental impacts.<\/p> <p>  To get an idea of how valuable this measure is, just consider that E10 in Ireland will bring the same climate benefits as 100,000 electric cars, can be done overnight, and comes at no cost to the consumer or Exchequer.  In contrast, encouraging 100,000 Irish drivers to buy electric will cost the State &euro;1.1 billion in grants and forgone tax revenue.  The money on electric cars would be well spent, but why not also take the free option and adopt E10?  However, instead of jumping at the opportunity of cutting carbon emissions immediately, we currently plan to delay the measure until as far out as 2030. <\/p> <p>  What could we do as a country to become more proactive and resourceful?  We could start by redesigning from scratch the biofuels obligation scheme, which is an extremely valuable regulatory instrument, and use it as a means for progressing our ambitions under the Paris Agreement.  We could introduce E10 petrol right away.  We could set a target for bioenergy in transport commensurate with the UN science report figure of 15% and seek ways of reaching it while maintaining proper qualitative criteria for determining which forms of renewables to allow and which not.  The renewables directive allowed for low volume and low quality with loopholes through which one could drive a bus. The Paris Agreement is different.  Brussels is not prescribing the regulations under it, so Ireland needs to own the problem from now on in order to do it right. <\/p> <p>  Sustainable, crop-based biofuels such as European ethanol will be central as they are the most scalable and economical forms of bioenergy available for transport.  There are substantial untapped reserves of them in Europe, they are economical and easy to produce without risk of adverse impacts, and they are compatible with today&rsquo;s fleets of diesel and petrol vehicles.<\/p><p>In France, Sweden, Austria, Belgium, Luxembourg and many other countries, crop biofuels already contribute 5% or more to transport energy.  As an agricultural nation, Ireland should also aim for that level, which would be an increase on its current rate of 0.7%.<\/p><p> Biomethane should play a significant role in this area, as it is an extremely flexible form of bioenergy, both in how it is produced and how it is used.  A well-designed policy support scheme for biomethane could scale to as much as 3% of Ireland&rsquo;s transport energy needs in little more than a decade.<\/p><p> We should examine the current mix of biofuels in Ireland&rsquo;s diesel and petrol fleet, and weed out the bad from the good.  Traceable, genuine European used cooking oil and tallow biofuels should continue to enjoy special status based on their extremely high greenhouse gas savings and contribution to reducing landfill waste, while restrictions should be imposed on imports from countries where the raw materials are not legally classed as waste and where the governance systems are ineffective in preventing palm oil leaking into the supply chain.  Ireland should not be worrying about whether it can achieve exemptions from a Brussels anti-fraud cap in the new version of the renewables directive.  Instead, it should be working to ensure that only genuine used cooking oil that is legally considered as waste in its country of origin is allowed under our climate programme.<\/p><p> It will be necessary to set up a results-oriented programme development team for transport climate action, with deep technical and regulatory skills.  This should be initiated at the earliest possible opportunity.  It should establish from the outset the costs for each option for cutting carbon emissions in transport, as well as what the total costs will be when applied at the scale required for meeting our Paris Agreement goals.  Ireland is in the process of finalising its national energy and climate plan, as required under Europe&rsquo;s strategy for meeting its Paris Agreement goals, and the lack of clarity and costings in the current plan should be a cause for concern.<\/p><p> I thank the committee for hearing these arguments today.  We hope they are of service and would be interested in contributing to any future Government work on climate action in transport.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019112700002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. James Cogan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1574812800,"counter":9,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Cogan.

I will talk about a slightly different topic, namely, sustainable transport systems and the impacts of transport infrastructure on regional development in particular.  I will outline some of the key findings from my research over recent years.  This topic is complicated and doing it justice in a short opening statement is difficult.  In order to keep my contribution brief, I will confine my remarks to the research I conducted on behalf of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport some years ago; my research on the national planning framework, NPF; and a recently published study that considered the effects of different infrastructures on firm start-ups and foreign direct investment, FDI.<br\/><br\/>Transport issues, particularly in the context of regional development, are often portrayed as a trade-off between environmental sustainability and accessibility and economic development.  Many assertions are made in this respect, such as the common claim that transport investment is concentrated in and around Dublin.  However, data up to 2009 show that our total investment in roads was not overly concentrated in Dublin.  Almost all parts of the country have benefitted from major roads projects and the midlands region has benefitted most from such projects, given its central location.  It is also not true that many places are far from rail infrastructure.  Overall accessibility to rail stations is high but what differs significantly is the level of service between stations, which means that having a rail station close by is often of little use as few trains are stopping there.  It is also often asserted that rural areas would be harder hit by carbon taxes or other fuel taxes because they do not have good public transport.  This, again, is not quite correct.  Farmers, for example, have essentially no commute and those commuting to nearby towns face little or no congestion, drive relatively short distances and thus drive at optimal engine operating conditions, with consequent low fuel consumption.  However, one group of rural dwellers would be harder hit by additional taxes, namely, long-distance commuters who have few economic connections to rural Ireland.<br\/><br\/>Importantly, peripherality is difficult to eliminate.  Roads improve the drive time for all intermediate points such that relative peripherality is unchanged even with investment.  This implies that a singular focus on transport infrastructure investment for regional development is likely to fail.  Rather, the focus should be on identifying the key constraints that can be removed and the potential comparative advantage that can be exploited in particular regions.<br\/><br\/><i>A priori, <\/i>transport infrastructure is expected to have a positive effect on regional development but that effect can be reduced by high taxes, low demand, good initial stock of infrastructure, incomplete networks, and increased competition.  It is therefore not surprising that the empirical literature shows some mixed results.  While on average, studies find a positive return on transport infrastructure investment, the return is often smaller than assumed and spillovers are important at the regional level.  Some studies suggest that investment in neighbouring regions can often have a more positive effect on peripheral regions than investment in the region itself.  By facilitating greater densities in urban areas, transport infrastructure has been found to generate significant productivity gains.<br\/><br\/>A recent paper I published investigated the importance of different infrastructures in driving firm start-ups and FDI attraction, which are key in driving economic growth, outside Dublin.  The paper shows that broadband infrastructure is more important than any other infrastructure.  The effect of broadband on such areas is at least twice that of motorways.  Proximity to airports only appears to matter for high-tech foreign firms.  Importantly, the analysis shows that the educational attainment of the local labour force is far more important than any infrastructure and that areas with low third level attainment are unlikely to benefit from broadband infrastructure when it comes to new firm formation.<br\/><br\/>Without significant policy changes, the spatial pattern of economic development in Ireland is likely to involve an increasing concentration of the population and economic activity in the east of the country, but with significant sprawl.  The only feasible alternative involves building the scale of second-tier cities such as Cork, Limerick and Galway.  It is important to note that scale means a larger population but also increased densities.  Simply changing city boundaries achieves nothing.  These larger second-tier cities would generate increased levels of economic activity for their wider hinterlands.  This is the approach adopted in the national planning framework, which I strongly support.  In order to achieve this strategy, significant policy change will be needed in both planning and investment.<br\/><br\/>Increased scale will only be achieved if housing is built to accommodate that increase, and the urban environment needs to be sufficiently attractive for people to want to live in a higher density environment.  High-quality public transport plays an important role in this respect.  While people appear to have a preference for residing close to urban areas, individuals do not necessarily prefer central locations.  Evidence also indicates that high-skilled workers may be more footloose and willing to tolerate longer commutes and to choose their residential location on the basis of amenities and the quality of housing.<br\/><br\/>Developing scale and density requires stopping sprawl and one-off housing.  While economic activity - that is, where jobs locate - is concentrating, there is increasing sprawl in residential locations, which implies longer commutes.  The share of Irish commuters driving to work increased from 45% to 62% between 1981 and 2016, which has put additional pressure on roads infrastructure and contributes to increasing emissions from transport.  Putting infrastructure between cities has facilitated that sprawl.  Without policy change, the projected patterns imply a significant increase in commuting across regions, particularly to Dublin.  Projections I produced suggest an additional 100,000 long-distance commuters into Dublin by 2040 if we do not do something fairly radical.<br\/><br\/>The strategy of the national planning framework to pursue increased scale will help achieve more balanced regional development.  If it is pursued properly - though the national development plan's emphasis on motorways suggests that is not the case - the NPF would also achieve reduced emissions from transport.<\/p><p>However, that requires infrastructure, and particularly public transport infrastructure, to be put in place in the cities, and not between the cities, where it would just facilitate more sprawl.  City locations are also those where the congestion takes place, and thus, investment will also benefit the hinterland around the cities by facilitating faster travel to the cities.<\/p><p> I thank the committee and I am happy to take any questions members may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019112700002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Edgar Morgenroth","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1574812800,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I thank Professor Morgenroth.

First, I would like to say that I am not an academic.  I spent all my life prior to coming to Ireland working in industry.  I would like to thank the committee for giving me the opportunity to talk about how crucial composites are in Ireland's sustainable transport system and how they will play a key role in enabling the Government to deliver on the climate action plan.  Ireland is internationally recognised as being good at composites, with a strong science and technology presence and a good spread of manufacturing companies across the whole of the island.  Irish industry across different sectors believes that it is necessary for the Government to provide dedicated funding to sustain a composites centre that will give industry the world-class support in the way that IComp, the Irish Composites Centre, does.<\/p> <p>  What is a composite?  I will show the committee these are carbon fibres, which have been braided by a company in Tallaght to form a tube.  This is combined with a liquid resin, and when that is heated up, one gets a material like this, which is a composite material 70% lighter than what the equivalent metal part would be.  That is the simplest composite.  There are quite a lot more complicated ones than that.  The fibres are usually carbon, but they can make glass, or they can also be natural fibres such as wax, which is obviously a fibre traditionally grown in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  Why use composites?  As I said, composites can give a 70% reduction in weight compared to metals.  Why is this important to transport?  It is important simply because reducing vehicle weight by 10% reduces fuel consumption by 7%, and this is illustrated by aircraft such as the Boeing 787 Dreamliner and the Airbus A350 XWB, which are now built out of 50% composite by weight, resulting in significant fuel saving and also giving them much extended range without stopping.<\/p> <p>  Composites have been used to reduce emissions in other forms of transport as well.  Electric cars, trains and lorries are using larger and larger amounts of composites.  A really good example of this is in China.  This is a very difficult statistic to believe, but every week, 1,900 new electric buses are coming onto roads in China, and all these are built using 50% composite material.  An SME in Mayo is making zero-emission composite boats, which are half the weight and have twice the range of standard boats.<\/p> <p>  Additional to the weight savings in the material, composite manufacturers use less energy than used in metals and cement.  Another advantage is that composites do not rust, so composite vehicles last longer and are much more sustainable than metal vehicles.  As they are rust-free and light-weight, composite structures are essential for making use of Ireland's natural resources, which include wind and water for wind and water turbines to generate renewable energy and also for biogas from anaerobic digestion of agricultural waste.  The plants to manufacture this require three 20,000 l tanks for each plant, and composite is the ideal material out of which to make these.  In Germany, almost every village or farm is now being equipped with these anaerobic digesters to make what is essentially carbon-neutral biogas.<\/p> <p>  In keeping with the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Richard Bruton's recent statement regarding the need to create a circular economy, IComp has developed an innovative technology to recycle post-consumer plastic bottles.  Across the world, 20 million tonnes of this polymer are going to making plastic bottles every year.  That is 3 kg for every man, woman and child on the planet going into plastic bottles.  That is a very good high-performance engineering polymer, and we have developed a way to convert it into fibres like this.  These fibres can be put into a microwave oven and converted into plastic parts like this, which is what is called self-reinforcing composites.  One has fibres made out of this plastic within the matrix made out of the plastic, so these are very strong, very stiff, and at the end of the day, they are 100% recyclable, so one has the ideal, complete, circular economy based on this.  We have patented this technology, and it is available for development across Irish industry.<\/p> <p>  Some people may have seen this development when it was featured on RT&Eacute; news earlier this year.  Ireland can be a front-runner in saving the planet from irresponsible disposable plastic if we can exploit this technology here.  It does not have to be completely exploited in Ireland.  It can ideally be exploited in countries, for example, in Cuba where the water is unfit to drink.  Millions and millions of these plastic bottles are used across Cuba, India and Africa and are saving lives.  They are saving lives by bringing clean water to people.  It then becomes a useful resource for them to recycle into making parts for off-the-road vehicles, if they manufacture cars or whatever.  They can make parts for these things.  <\/p> <p>  Two of Ireland's most important industries are agriculture and construction, and composites are key to their longevity.  In both industries, transportation of goods is a major cost.  Was the committee aware that tractors, combines, combine harvesters and the all-terrain vehicles account for 7% of Ireland's annual fuel consumption?  That is a huge amount of fuel being used by these vehicles.  Weight reduction in agricultural vehicles and in trailers will not only reduce this fuel consumption but will also reduce land compaction, which is a major issue across the world, not just in Ireland.  The yield from agricultural land in Ireland is dropping dramatically because these very heavy vehicles that are used on it are compacting the soil and the fertility is dropping.  Also, road damage is a major problem in Ireland, and the Taoiseach talked about this recently and said millions of potholes and things are caused by heavy vehicles on the roads.<\/p> <p>  In the construction industry, composites are very important.  We have developed a composite access cover.  This is a part of an access cover, which a lot of people may know under a different name, but it is used on roads and footpaths and garage forecourts, etc.  This is 70% lighter than the equivalent metal, so therefore when it is transported across the country, one is using that much less fuel to transport it.  It is not just being transported across the country but it is being exported all over Europe.  The ergonomics of this much better because one person can lift this, put it into place, lift it up again, instead of needing a JCB or some other mechanical device for lifting it  This is something that we have developed for a company in Offaly.<\/p> <p>  Similar technologies can be applied to things like lintels, pre-stressed concrete sections and building claddings, which can be reduced in weight, resulting in major fuel reductions in transporting these across the country and also in handling them when they get to the sites where they are going.<\/p><p>Composites in construction and agriculture are very important.  Composites are also important for updating the transport infrastructure, including bridges, station platforms, signage, utility poles, and so on.  For example, a fantastic amount of updating is required on degrading concrete bridges.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019112700002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Terry McGrail","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1574812800,"counter":15,"content":"<p>I ask Dr. McGrail to conclude as I am conscious of the time.

Enterprise Ireland established the Irish Composite Centre in 2010.  Since then, IComp has successfully supported many SMEs across the island of Ireland.  Such support is proving to be a crucial enabler for rural development and for establishing manufacturing in small towns and villages.  A recent independent review of IComp's performance highlighted its many national and international successes, for example, 198 jobs have been created and retained since 2015 and it is predicted many more will be created or retained in the next three years.  In spite of this, due to the predominance of small companies in the composites sector in Ireland, IComp has not been able to meet the Enterprise Ireland criterion of attracting matching funding from industry.  The current situation is that Enterprise Ireland will cease funding from the end of May 2020.  However, Irish composites industries have expressed support for having a dedicated to composites centre.  We call on the committee to recognise the crucial importance of composites to Ireland's sustainable transport system.<\/p> <p>  I thank the committee for listening.

His contribution was very interesting, although he does not cite evidence for it.  While I do not want to take up the time of the committee, there are a number of assertions in his presentation in respect of which I would ask him to forward the evidence to back them up.<\/p> <p>  It is a very sobering point.  I know palm oil is a big issue with schoolchildren because of the manner in which it is extracted and the labour that is used.  Mr. Cogan has illustrated very well the poor response of the country in meeting the challenges facing us.  Most of the incentives for changes in transport, for example, electric vehicles, are for people who have quite a lot of disposable income.  I drive a diesel car and I cannot afford an electric car, like hundreds of thousands of people, because the incentive kicks in after the car is bought as opposed to before.  I would love to take up the idea of ethanol, mix my fuel and contribute my part in that sense.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Cogan's figures are staggering.  Some 280,000 new vehicles came into the country in 2018 and just one in 70 of those was electric.  In addition, we have the whole issue with the roll-out of charging points, and I believe we need to hang our heads in shame in this regard.  Nonetheless, there is the issue of affordability and, despite what is said in some of the contributions that will come later, namely, that electric vehicles are becoming cheaper, they are far out of the reach of most ordinary people.  I believe a real variety of offerings need to be put before people.  I know electric is the way we are going but companies like Toyota are making huge advances with hydrogen.  I picture a country in 2027 or 2028 with e-charging points every mile and where hydrogen has become the norm.

I often say that if I worked for Tesla, I would get more invites to speak at committee meetings, not just here but everywhere else.  I am an advocate and an evangeliser for electric cars, first and foremost, but I work for the ethanol industry and I believe passionately that, with such a large fleet of vehicles running around the world that are still burning liquid, we need to do something about that.  We have a phenomenon called peak ICE, with ICE being the internal combustion engine, which is the name for a conventional vehicle.  The question is when we reach peak ICE.  It is similar to the question of reaching peak oil given, years ago, we thought we were going to reach peak oil but we still have not.  We thought we were going to reach peak ICE but we still have not.  I believe Ireland is going to reach peak ICE sooner than many countries but, globally, we are not going to reach it until 2040 on current trends, and there are certainly no indications to show we are going to reach peak ICE earlier than 2040.  I would love to have this incredible hockey stick effect where, suddenly, everybody switched to electric vehicles but there are no indicators that will happen, unfortunately.<\/p> <p>  We. therefore, have this fleet.  It may well be that we will reach the peak size of the diesel and petrol fleet in Ireland in three to six years.  Last year, we added 45,000 units to the fleet and 4,000 were electric and plug-in hybrid.  This year, we will probably add that number again to fleet and more - perhaps 10,000 - will be plug-in hybrid and electric.  We are then looking at what stage we get to the point where we have used up all of our early adopters or all the kind of people who are prepared to buy electric and plug-in.  I am optimistic that will be a good number.  However, people in climate policy have a tendency to imagine electric vehicles have done a lot more than they have, whereas, for the most part, the impact of electric vehicles has been essentially minimal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019112700002#M00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. James Cogan"},{"type":"speech","time":1574812800,"counter":23,"content":"<p>I am conscious of the time if Deputy Lahart is sharing equally with Deputy Dooley.

We, like all other European countries, submitted ours to the European Commission early on this year and we are finalising the final versions of the first generation of these plans, because they will be renewed every two years.  December is the date for finalising those.  Ireland is in bad company in that many of the plans submitted by countries to date are highly non-specific.  It is difficult to grasp how things will be done.  They have not been costed, so it is difficult to grasp how much a particular measure will cost, whether it is heating, cooling, transport or power generation, per unit of carbon saved, and therefore how much it would cost if scaled up to the amount of carbon that we will have to save in the economy overall.  Admittedly it is the first generation of plans and hopefully the next generation will be more clear.  If one is looking to these plans for guidance on what we are actually going to do, those documents are not very helpful in the specificity of what they tell us they will do, how the plans will be done and how much they will cost.  That will be one of the next things that the major news agencies in the world will report.

To have a high-speed network, one would typically require large distances between stops because a lot of time is lost at the stops.  We have a network that would be able to serve us better if we put more services on the network.  I was a rail commuter until not too long ago.  Many rail commuters would say that, especially at peak times, there is no space on the trains and there are not enough trains.

I was busy voting elsewhere.  I wish to ask Mr. Cogan about ethanol.  I have read through this and done some research.  In northern Europe, Sweden in particular has gone down the route of flex-fuel cars, running E85, involving the use of biofuel, petrol and diesel at different mixes.  It has not invested in electric vehicles.  Are we being dazzled by electric vehicle in this country?  The Minister asked for 1 million such vehicles even though that was not called for in our report.  Sweden as a northern European country is choosing flex-fuel cars and not really touching electric vehicles.  Brazil is also on E100.<\/p> <p>  Our 5% up to 10% does not sound too ambitious.  Should the emphasis change from our apparent love affair with expensive electric vehicles and more towards ethanol, the cost of which would not be overbearing for people using vehicles with the same mechanics?  If we go to that, what would be the impact?  Will the fossil fuel companies be unhappy?  Obviously, their profits and production will be impacted upon.  Where is our 5% ethanol produced?  Is any of it produced in Ireland?  If it is and if we want to expand and want to expand operations or if we it is not and if we want to get involved, is there any potential for the areas where peat production has now been shut down?<\/p> <p>  Do we need to take a breather and reconsider electric vehicles?  We have thrown all our eggs in one basket and that is what we are telling the public.  Ethanol is not well known and we may need to push it and make it more popular.  Despite having an enormous electric vehicle fleet, Norway's emissions increased and did not reduce.  Sweden is using the flexi-fuel car and its emissions are reducing, and those cars are quite cost effective.  Mr. Cogan stated that the cost of ethanol per litre is slightly more than that of diesel or petrol.  Those are my questions for him.<\/p> <p>  Professor Morgenroth carried out the research into rural dwelling and farming activity.  What percentage of rural dwellers are farmers?  What type of pattern did he study?  Did he take into account that they may travel very far?  A small holder in Leitrim might be leasing land in Mullingar, Sligo, etc., resulting in considerable transport.  Most farmers have another job and need to travel to that.  In addition, there is transport for farming families for children to go to school and all that.  What that included in his calculations for commutes mentioned in his research?<\/p> <p>  Professor Morgenroth co-authored a paper with Professor Richard Tol of the University of Sussex.  Professor Tol is the adviser to the Global Warming Policy Foundation.  His position seems to be that the science of global warming or climate change is not yet settled and that we may have negligible impacts or possible benefits at least up to end of the 21st century, which the Taoiseach seemed to endorse some time ago.  Does Professor Morgenroth still stand by that?  Is there a sense that we are not catching everything?  We have got into climate action, the user-at-the-gates approach and we are responding.  Professor Tol is trying to say that we should not be so hysterical about the matter.  Would Professor Morgenroth stand by that analysis?<\/p> <p>  Does Professor Morgenroth believe that we need to stop building roads and motorways?  With the emphasis on the private car regardless of its capacity to run on biofuel or the use of electric vehicles - even if they are clean - people still get stuck in traffic jams and cannot get to where we want to go.  Despite what we are doing public transport infrastructure, trains, buses, electric scooters and all that sort of stuff, is it the case that we will just have a different form of congestion from that to which cars give rise - albeit a cleaner form of congestion - and that we will continue to have congestion?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019112700002#P00200","speaker":"1388"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1574812800,"counter":68,"content":"<p>The Senator spoke about northern European countries that are experimenting with different blends of biofuels and different levels of support for electric fleets.  I will come out: I am a complete electric car enthusiast.  If Ireland could get to 1 million, I would be the first to sign on the dotted line for doing that.  I have difficulty imagining how we can get there or even to half that number given the cost it takes to incentivise them, the requirements for extra power, infrastructure and so on.  However, even if we reached 1 million electric vehicles by 2030, we would still need the extra vehicles running on biofuels because that number of electric vehicles would constitute one third of the fleet.  At least half of them will be hybrid between diesel or petrol and electric.  Therefore, people will continue to put diesel or petrol into them.  At least half of the electricity they use will still be fossil based.  We will need other measures as well as the electric vehicles even if we get to 1 million.  Those other measures are clearly modal shift, more efficient use of traffic and less use of people sitting in cars on their own - I am all for that.  However, we will still need to improve the performance of the fuels we are putting into the engines that burn diesel and petrol, including electric vehicles that partially burn diesel and petrol.  That is where we get to the E5, E10 and the diesel blends.<\/p> <p>  France is putting 85% ethanol into its normal petrol cars now and is not waiting for new technologies or some special car to come out.  People install a tuner device that costs &euro;110.  It makes the electronics of the engine recognise that there is a slightly different blend of petrol in it and it is able to run fine on it.  It is pretty easy to go to higher than E10 ethanol for countries that want to do it.  The cost of E10 is not even a tiny bit more than that of petrol.  It is the same or less than regular petrol because the overall blend of the petrol stays the same or less when it is put in.<\/p> <p>  The Senator asked where it is made.  It can be made all over Europe.  There are two big plants in the UK.  There are many plants in France, the Netherlands and Germany.

It is slightly difficult because they relate to three very different areas.  Each of them in their own right deserve detailed attention.<\/p> <p>  I will begin with Professor Morgenroth because he spoke about a subject close to my heart.  It is interesting that today the Government has published its public consultation on the long-term strategy on greenhouse gas emissions to influence our national energy climate action plan, which has to be agreed in four weeks' time.  This document will determine our economic future because, under European governance rules, it will determine what we do in the next 30 or 50 years.  There are 15 lines of content on transport and four questions within it.  One of them asks what should transport in cities and rural areas look like in 2050.  Listening to Professor Morgenroth, I was thinking of a making a submission that by 2050 we would have a scheme whereby we would all have self-driving cars so we could sleep in them on our commute because we will be spending so long commuting backwards and forwards.  We could have our children in our cars all of the time as they come and go from school for hours every day as we could see them via Facebook live in our cars.  That is where we are going.  I agree 100% with what Professor Morgenroth said about the abandonment of the national planning framework and the national development plan.  Does he think it makes transport sense to spend however many hundreds of millions of euro widening the M11 between Ashford and Bray, for example?  What does that achieve?  Would that be one of the roads projects that might be scaled back?  Is it just serving the additional 100,000 long-distance commuters who will be stuck in their pyjamas in their cars in 2050?  I will throw out another example.  We are spending &euro;250,000 widening the road between Westport and Castlebar.  How does this fit with the national planning framework?

Approximately one third of it is palm oil.  That amounts to about a litre of palm oil per fill every time somebody puts diesel in their car.  That was a problem caused by Brussels and its poor regulation.  It created a directive and gave special privileges to used cooking oil.  It was a niche thing but as we needed to encourage the sector, this would be fantastic.

That is worse for the environment.<\/p> <p>  To be constructive, Mr. Cogan referred to qualitative criteria for the sourcing of our biofuels.  Will he elaborate on that?

It is up to them whether to pick biodiesel or ethanol.  If they can do it more cheaply and more easily with biodiesel, they will, and that is what they are doing.  The Government does not say they must have so much in petrol and so much in biodiesel; it is up to the fuel companies to decide.  Because it is cheaper and easier to use used cooking oil in their diesel than any other form, that is what they do.  It is based on cost.<\/p><p> The Senator Higgins is quite correct about apocalyptic scenarios.  I take her point and apologise for using the word.  It is true that very awful adverse side effects can arise with policy and legislation on such things as this.  The mistake we have had in Europe for the past ten years is that we have used a system of legislation based on numbers, caps and multipliers without the intelligence behind them to say, \"You cannot do this\", or, \"You cannot do that\".  We have allowed a series of unwanted effects to happen.  I am not even referring to used cooking oil, but palm oil, for instance, is dominant in diesel in Europe, although not in Ireland, fortunately.  If we look at this intelligently and if we were just to decide to use the maximum volume of ethanol we can use within the technical limitations of cars and infrastructure, as long as it comes from Europe, we would be rock-solid safe.  There are no scenarios in which that could run away into an adverse side effect we do not want.  I agree that the policy officers should grasp this and be comfortable with it.  They should design the policy to do it.  It is a question of doing it right, which is where the thrust should be.  Whether it is electricity, biofuels or anything else, we have an awful lot of learning how to do things right over the next ten years if we are to reach our climate goals.<\/p><p> Regarding the proportion that can come from crop waste, crops themselves and plant culture, we have lots of crop waste and plant culture opportunity.  We have an awful lot more opportunity from crops themselves because the whole system has been optimised to produce crops.  Grain and beet are energy crops.  There is no purer form of energy crop, and the energy is in a form that can be easily processed, whereas with waste and plants we do not have any of those processes yet.  We are big into these things.  We have little investment projects in them.  We tried a couple of years ago to set up a &euro;400 million waste-based project.  It fell down because the economics did not stand up.  We could not sell the fuel we were going to make.  There was no way fuel companies would ever have bought ethanol from us at the cost it was going to take for us to produce it.  We, therefore, need rather more compelling policy systems to be put in place to drive through much bigger waste-based and aqua-based solutions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019112700002#R00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. James Cogan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1574812800,"counter":95,"content":"<p>Can we get palm oil out of the diesel over the next year or two?

Three themes were identified by the committee on which we hope to help it: decarbonisation of the transport system; developing an integrated sustainable transport system; and empowering a modal shift in transport.  We are joined by colleagues from three other Departments with whom we work closely in addressing the climate challenge, the lead on which falls within our various areas.<\/p> <p>  To look at the broad policy framework, the committee is well aware of the Government&rsquo;s climate action plan that was published in May.  That builds on the commitments in Project Ireland 2040, which the Government published a couple of years ago.  The plan articulates the scale of challenge and the Government&rsquo;s ambitions on climate action across all sectors.  This is what sets the framework within which Departments are now working to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to meet the Ireland&rsquo;s international commitments on this front.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the transport sector, the Government&rsquo;s policy can be described in terms of a model known as avoid, shift, improve.  It is recognised internationally as a best practice approach in this area.  The model gives us the focus and structure for the work we are doing.  The first strand of our work is avoiding unnecessary distances in travel trips.  What does this mean in practical terms?  It is largely about making sure that both land use and transport are planned in a way that is mutually supportive.  The aim over time is to bring better cohesion to the planning of where people live, their places of work and education, where they can shop, the location of public services they use and their places of entertainment and social interaction.  Over time, this can influence the type of transport needs that will arise and help shape the ways in which those needs can be addressed effectively.  We work closely with our colleagues in the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government on connecting the policies we have in the areas of transport and land use planning.  We recognise the need for collaborating on and strengthening those policy links.<\/p> <p>  The second part of the paradigm is shifting more journeys for more people on to more sustainable forms of travel.  To support this the Government is investing heavily, under Project Ireland 2040, to increase passenger carrying capacity in the public transport system and in the active travel system to support walking and cycling through the development of new infrastructure.  The target is to make public transport and active travel options a viable alternative for more people, for more of their journeys.<\/p><p>The work we are doing aims to create the modal shift we have been talking about.  It is about changing the mode of transport people use for journeys.  This is supported by substantial funding from the Government&rsquo;s ten-year capital investment plan and a number of targeted tax incentives developed by our colleagues in the Department of Finance.<\/p><p> There are still a large number of trips undertaken by people or to move goods for which active travel or public transport are not realistic options.  This is where the third pillar of our model comes in.  This is about seeking improvements to reduce the harmful climate impact of journeys through vehicle technology, improved fuel efficiency or the use of lower-emission fuels, which we call alternative fuels.  Our colleagues on the energy side of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment take a lead role in this area.<\/p><p> Data on travel patterns show us that to radically reduce transport emissions, we must look to decarbonise private transport.  The Government&rsquo;s aim is to develop a set of policies that will support citizens in making the environmentally friendly choices to select greener vehicles and greener fuels now and into the future.  To advance the transition to green motoring, the Department and our colleagues in the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment jointly led the low-emissions vehicle task force to find a whole-of-Government approach to these issues.  The work of the group was structured over two phases.  The first phase looks exclusively at electric vehicles.  The group analysed what type of interventions would be appropriate and necessary to create a positive policy environment to assist in the transition to electric vehicles.  These recommendations to Government were taken on board in the budgets for 2018 and 2019.  Their implementation has been followed by an increase in the sale of electric vehicles.  There are now approximately 14,500 electric vehicles, EVs, on Irish roads.  This is a sharp increase from the low level of approximately 3,500 to 4,000 at the beginning of last year.  The technology is getting better, driving ranges are improving, more vehicle models are becoming available and, very importantly, the cars are becoming cheaper over time.  All of those developments and improvements are expected to continue in the coming decade and beyond.<\/p><p> As the committee will know, the climate action plan sets very ambitious targets for the move to electric vehicles by 2030.  Now that the Government has adopted a target and policy, we are setting out to develop a roadmap of policy initiatives, which we call the policy pathway, that we need to implement to allow Ireland to achieve this ambition.  Just as we did previously with the low-emissions vehicles task force, we are working in collaboration with other relevant Departments, including the Departments of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Finance, and Public Expenditure and Reform.  The approach to achieving the EV target the Government eventually adopts, through the initiatives it introduces to support achieving that target, will require broad input and support to be effective.  There will be public consultation in the course of identifying and deciding on the appropriate pathway.<\/p><p> The Government, Minister and Department are strongly committed to supporting and encouraging more sustainable forms of travel.  This is central to our approach to decarbonising transport and to helping achieve a better quality of life and more liveable cities and areas.  The climate action plan sets a target for more than 500,000 extra journeys per day to be taken either on public transport or by walking and cycling.  This ambition is supported by the &euro;8.6 billion investment in sustainable mobility secured under Project Ireland 2040.  On this point, it is notable and will probably interest the committee that the Exchequer investment for new projects in public transport and active travel over the coming years not only equals, but well exceeds what is available for investment in new roads.  This is a reversal of the situation that had pertained a number of years ago.  In the past, investment in new road projects greatly exceeded investment in public transport.  That is a considerable rebalancing for the period ahead.<\/p><p> As a final point, the committee may be interested in a new public consultation process the Minister launched a couple of weeks ago.  It relates to a review of sustainable mobility policy, which refers to public transport, active travel and climate in transport.  As part of this consultation, which runs until late January, we published extensive documentation, including papers and data analysis, the Department had prepared on the areas of public transport, active travel and climate action for transport.  The aim is to help inform the public and to inform the discussion of these topics.  In the course of this public consultation, we seek the views of transport stakeholders, public representatives and people across the country on these topics.  We want to know what they think we have got right and what we need to improve.<\/p><p> It is now a full decade on from the previous policy document in this area, Smarter Travel, which was published in 2009.  Our purpose is to reflect on what has happened thus far and to concentrate on shaping the path ahead.  Do we need to refresh our priorities?  How can our past experience inform our future approach?  What can we learn from other places?  That is important.  We expect that today's discussion will help us in our consideration of those matters.  We hope our opening statement is a helpful scene-setter for today&rsquo;s discussion and we hope we can be of assistance to the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019112700002#T00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Deirdre Hanlon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1574812800,"counter":118,"content":"<p>I am conscious of the time.

The Department supports the transition to a sustainable transport system primarily through energy policy.  This includes promoting the use of renewable fuels and supporting the move to low-emission vehicles.  The transport sector is responsible for approximately 36% of Ireland&rsquo;s total primary energy requirement and its emissions constitute 20% of total emissions and 27% of non-emissions trading system, ETS, emissions.  It is a large sector.<\/p> <p>  Our target is for 10% of energy used in the transport sector to come from renewable sources by 2020.  We are currently above 7% and on our way to meeting this target.  This is calculated in line with the renewable energy directive which was discussed earlier and includes the use of multipliers for biofuels that are produced from wastes and residues and for renewable energy used in electric vehicles.  The level of renewable energy used in the transport system in 2020 is expected to be between 9% and 10%.  It is therefore expected that Ireland will achieve 90% compliance with this target.<\/p> <p>  It was discussed in the previous session but the primary driver of renewable energy use in the transport sector is the biofuels obligation scheme.  This was introduced in 2010 and is administered by the National Oil Reserves Agency.  The scheme obliges each fuel supplier in the road transport sector, including all the household names we know, to ensure a certain proportion of all fuel supplied is from renewable sources.  Under the scheme, biofuels placed on the market must adhere to sustainability criteria.  The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, estimates that the biofuels obligation scheme avoided 340,000 tonnes of emissions in 2017, which is the latest year for which data are available.  The obligation increased at the start of this year and it will increase again from the start of 2020.  We believe this increase will lead to approximately 6% biofuel in diesel and 5% in petrol.  This mix is known as E5 and is already widely available, as was discussed earlier.  A public consultation was recently carried out.  It actually closed yesterday.  We received approximately 40 submissions, which we will be publishing on our website.  This consultation related to the development of the scheme for the period from 2021 to 2030.  It examines the implementation of the elements of the renewable energy directive that pertain to renewable fuels in transport.<\/p><p>It also considers how best to achieve the ambition set out in the climate action plan of 12% biofuel in diesel and 10% in petrol by 2030, a doubling of the levels expected in 2020.  I recognise that during the previous session it was set out that there are absolutely no issues in regard to E10 but there are some issues that we need to explore in this consultation, including compatibility issues for older cars.  The responses received to this public consultation will inform the future development of the biofuels obligation scheme.<\/p><p> Ms Hanlon has covered the low emission vehicle task force.  Briefly, the Department also supports the transition to low emission vehicles and works closely with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport in this regard with the two Departments co-chairing the low emission vehicle task force which brought together Departments, agencies, State bodies and stakeholders to consider a range of measures and options available to Government to accelerate the take-up of low emission vehicles.  <\/p><p>The first phase of the task force&rsquo;s work focused on electric vehicles with the second phase primarily focused on other low emission vehicles, such as compressed natural gas and hydrogen.  One report was published last year and the other was published more recently, which cover its work and set out the considerations by Government.  <\/p><p> In addition to supports from the Departments of Finance and Transport, Tourism and Sport, the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment provides a number of supports which include purchase grants for electric vehicles, grants to support the installation of home chargers and, most recently, grants to support local authorities installing on-street chargers.<\/p><p> Budget 2020 provided the Department with a total of &euro;36 million in funding for electric vehicle supports, with &euro;30 million allocated to the purchase grant and &euro;6 million to support the development of charging infrastructure.<\/p><p> The climate action fund is administered by the Department.  One of the successful projects under the first call for applications from the fund include &euro;10 million to support the ESB developing a state-of-the-art fast-charging network for Ireland.  This project will provide 90 new high-speed chargers with a power of 150 kW which is three times the current fast chargers.  These can each charge two electric vehicles at once and are three times the power or speed of the current fast chargers in Ireland.  It will upgrade 50 existing standard chargers to fast chargers; and replace more than 250 standard chargers, each which consists of two charging points, totalling more than 500 charge points, so that the vast majority of charging points across Ireland will be replaced with next generation high-reliability models.<\/p><p> The Government, as part of the climate action plan, has set a target of achieving 936,000 electric vehicles in Ireland by 2030.  In order to support the achievement of this target, the plan has set out a number of actions which include: developing the charging network necessary to support the growth of electric vehicles and to stay sufficiently ahead of demand; developing the compressed natural gas, CNG, fuelling network to support the uptake of CNG vehicles, particularly in the road freight sector; increasing the use of biofuels, as I discussed; developing a roadmap on the optimum mix of regulatory, taxation and subsidy policies to drive a significant ramp-up in electric vehicles; and introducing legislation to ban the sale of new fossil fuel cars from 2030.<\/p><p> The Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment is working with our colleagues in other Departments, agencies and State bodies to implement these actions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019112700002#U00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kevin Brady","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1574812800,"counter":121,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the invitation to come here today along with colleagues from the Departments of Transport Tourism and Sport, Communications, Climate Action and Environment and Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform to discuss the development of Ireland&rsquo;s sustainable transport system under the related headings of decarbonisation, integration and modal shift.  I am the principal adviser of the planning side of the Department and I am joined today by my colleague, Ms Laura Courtney, planning adviser.<\/p> <p>  On the spatial pattern and development structure, we are all aware that the places where homes, workplaces, education, service and leisure activities are located, and the form of development that they may take, that is high or low density, concentrated or dispersed, mixed use or single use, when considered together, have a determining impact on mobility and travel behaviour.   <\/p> <p>  The resultant pattern of movement in the frequency, length, location and duration of trips, consequently influences choice regarding the availability of different modes of transport and, ultimately, the quality and sustainability of our urban and rural places.<\/p> <p>  The Department is working with colleagues in the other Departments represented here and agencies, such as the National Transport Authority, NTA, and Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, in particular, to address decarbonisation through land use and transport integration and to encourage a greater sustainable mode share.<\/p> <p>  As part of Ireland 2040, the NPF sets out long-term policy, operating horizontally across Government and cascading vertically down through the three regional spatial and economic strategies, RSESs, to directly influence the operation of the planning system through the 31 local authority county or city development plans.  To support this, we are currently updating statutory planning guidelines for the preparation of development plans, which will include provision for sustainable patterns and forms of development, that may be related to indicators that can be used for monitoring, such as commuting patterns and transport mode share.<\/p> <p>  Since the NPF was finalised in 2018, there have been a series of complementary supporting measures from the publication of new apartment and building height guidelines, to the launch of the urban and rural regeneration and development funds, URDF and RRDF, together worth &euro;3 billion to 2027.<\/p> <p>  Sustainable mobility, where successfully achieved, is self-reinforcing.  For example, a higher density of homes and workplaces generally, but especially around public transport nodes, combined with a greater mix of land-uses and investment in public transport and amenities such as public spaces, including parks and greenways, will facilitate: greater proximity of homes to employment and services; reduced travel distances for trips of every kind; more sustainable mode share, that is, walking, cycling and public transport; which means a greater proportion of zero emission trips by bike or on foot; shorter, more frequent and more reliable public transport trips; more viable public transport; the possibility of forms of development not dependent on road capacity or determined by car parking requirements; less urban land for road space and car parking; better used and safer public spaces and walking and cycling routes; and more footfall and greater business viability in our settlements.<\/p> <p>  Recognising that much of the change will have to take place within existing settlements, an updated version of the design manual for urban roads and streets, also known as DMURs, has recently been published by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  This is a collaborative document with significant planning, architectural and urban design input, that ensures a design toolkit that better reflects the needs of all road users, especially in built-up urban areas.<\/p> <p>  In addition, technological change, particularly in the form of electric vehicles, EVs, although at an early stage, will be significant.  The targeted increase in the electric vehicle fleet will be in part facilitated by measures to ensure the availability of more electric charging points in new developments, arising from the work of the EV task force.<\/p> <p>  Spatial pattern, the form of development and sustainable mobility when combined, have an impact on levels of activity, footfall and viability in settlements, which influence their attractiveness and quality.  In broad terms, the more convenient and safer it is for more people to get around by a range of modes, the greater the likelihood there is that streets and cycleways, public transport stops and routes will be frequently used.<\/p> <p>  The greater the catchment population served and available footfall, the easier it is for a range of shops, services and commercial outlets to operate.  Ultimately, high levels of mobility combined with amenities and services will create desirable places in which to live, work, invest and visit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019112700002#V00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Hogan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1574812800,"counter":122,"content":"<p>I am a principal officer with responsibility for indirect tax policy in the Department of Finance.  I am joined this afternoon by my colleague, Mr. Niall O&rsquo;Sullivan.  The main focus of taxation in the transport sector is in respect of private passenger vehicles, which are subject to a once-off vehicle registration tax, VRT, and an annual motor tax.  The tax policy in recent years has been geared towards incentivising a move towards lower CO2 emitting vehicles.  Since 1 July 2008, both VRT and motor tax on private motor cars have been calculated on the basis of emissions, so that motor cars with higher emissions attracted a higher tax liability.  From January 2013, a revised banding structure was introduced in recognition that more fuel-efficient cars were becoming available and allowing for the further differentiation of the environmental incentive.  A zero-emissions band for electric vehicles was also introduced at that time.  In addition, VRT reliefs are available for battery electric vehicles, plug-in hybrids and conventional hybrids up to a maximum of &euro;5,000, &euro;2,500 and &euro;1,500, respectively, to support the transition to a cleaner national fleet for passenger cars.  Members will be aware that the &euro;1,500 relief for hybrids, which was due to expire at the end of 2019, has been extended for a further year.  However, CO2 ceilings have been introduced to ensure that only low-emission vehicles are benefiting from this tax incentive.  This is based on clear evidence that certain hybrid models emit average and even high levels of CO2.  This relief will expire at the end of 2020.<\/p> <p>  Budget 2019 introduced a 1% VRT surcharge to diesel passenger cars registering for the first time in the State from 1 January 2019.<\/p><p>This measure was introduced in light of public health and environmental concerns about pollutants such as NOx, sulphur oxides and particulate matter which impact air quality, particularly in high population density urban areas.  This surcharge will be replaced by a new NOx charge introduced in the recent budget and due to come into effect from 1 January 2020.<\/p><p> Tax incentives to get people out of cars and onto public transport and bicycles include the TaxSaver commuter ticket scheme to reduce traffic congestion by helping reduce the cost for workers using public transport, and the bike to work scheme to encourage employees to cycle to work.<\/p><p> There has been some discussion of late on the taxation of the aviation sector and, in particular, on the current tax exemptions for aviation fuels in the context of broader efforts to address climate change as well as to level the playing field with other forms of transport fuels that are subject to tax.  In this regard, Ireland is subject to energy taxation rules set out in the EU energy taxation directive.  Under this directive, member states are obliged to exempt certain fuels used for commercial aviation purposes from excise duty.  A member state may waive this exemption where it has entered into a bilateral agreement with another member state to tax fuel for intra-community flights.  With regard to fuel for international transport, the scope for a member state to take a unilateral approach to taxation is limited by international law and a range of bilateral and multilateral agreements that operate under the 1944 Convention on International Civil Aviation, known as the Chicago Convention.  In recognition of the environmental and fiscal merits of the case being made for the application of aviation taxes, Ireland will engage with the EU Commission in regard to the possible revision of the energy taxation directive to take greater account of environmental concerns in the taxation of energy products.  Finally, the committee will be aware that the Department presents a series of papers to the tax strategy group each summer setting out options across the various tax heads for consideration in the annual budget.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019112700002#V00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerry Kenny","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1574812800,"counter":124,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Kenny.

Regarding the Department's interactions with local authorities that ultimately take many of the planning decisions, and in respect of much of the work with developers and setting out the agenda that will meet the demands or policy objectives that exist, what is his general sense of preparedness and understanding among local authorities?  What is the general sense of a commitment to addressing future needs from a climate change perspective in terms of the land use policy?  Where public transport is concerned, there is a requirement not just from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport but also very much from the actors or operators that they are buying into.  That is important.<\/p> <p>  My next question is for Mr. Brady of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  The Government is setting out a long-term strategy to be submitted to the Commission about the decarbonisation of Ireland beyond 2030, which works towards our commitment to a 2050 net zero emissions target.  That long-term strategy, to the best of my information, is seeking submissions from the public but only 15 days have been given to them to make their views known.  That seems a very short timeframe.  The final report has to be submitted to the Commission by the end of the year so it will all have to be prepared within approximately nine working days, recognising where we are at in the year now.  <\/p> <p>  The Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport has looked at BusConnects and increasing rail capacity.  That is medium to long term.  That is important and ties in with the strategy Mr. Hogan mentioned.  Have the officials any other ideas that they can deliver within the next two years that would begin the process?  In trying to encourage people to change their behaviour, there is the carrot and the stick.  The taxation is the stick.  It is a soft enough stick at the moment because of the necessity to take people on that journey and the trajectory of the implementation of the carbon tax.  To get people to move to public transport in the kind of numbers that we want and that we will need, we have to incentivise them.  The quality of public transport has improved in urban areas but we need to see more in some of our peripheral towns.  I get that there is a cost issue but we have to front-load it.  We have been very good in this country through successive Governments at responding to infrastructure whether it is water and sewerage, roads, or public transport, usually long after it was needed, to the extent that we see strikes and demonstrations of people wanting their bypass, public transport or sewerage scheme.  I get the 2040 plan but we are going to have to front-load projects that show consumers upfront that public transport infrastructure is in place.  It is necessary if they are going to change their behaviour, live in a more densely populated area on the edge of a town, and accept that they may not have the same space around the house as they had in the past.  Perhaps Ms Hanlon could speak to that a little bit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019112700002#W00300","speaker":"1274"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1574812800,"counter":126,"content":"<p>We have an &euro;8.6 billion capital investment programme, which is happening over the short, medium and long term.  The Deputy specifically asked about the shorter term initiatives for what we call expanding capacity.  That means being able to carry more people and have more services.  Next year alone there will be an expansion of the bus fleet by 60 vehicles in addition to the replacement of 175 buses.  There is expansion of services in buses and, importantly, in the rural transport scheme.  In 2016, we were spending &euro;12.5 million a year and we are now spending &euro;21 million a year supporting that.  There are 1,000 different routes and 2.2 million passengers.  That is increasing.  I think there have been 76 different service improvements across that network in recent times with late-night services and other expansions of service.  There are more regular services, including at weekends and off-peak times, not just in the traditional times.  That is a rural initiative.<\/p> <p>  On the rail network, the Government announced recently the investment in new rail fleet, which is going to come on-track two years from now.  The Deputy asked about a two-year trajectory.  The first carriages in that fleet will come in in two years.  It is costing &euro;150 million and is going to double the capacity of the rail network in the greater Dublin area.  It is massive.  The greater Dublin area is the part of the rail network that carries approximately 70% of the patronage on the network nationally.  Following the extension of the Luas line with the cross-city Luas, there has been investment in fleet.  Seven new trams came in as part of that.  They were the longer trams.  They have bedded in well now and are running well.  Some 26 of the existing trams are being extended, whereby what was a 42 m tram is being taken out of service and having a new chunk put in to become a 55 m tram.  The first couple of extended trams have entered service and they will come in steadily over the coming months.

Many villages dotted throughout rural Ireland are, effectively, derelict.  Villages close to my area have between 15 and 25 derelict properties because of the nature of the ownership where the owner is deceased and the property has not been passed on, there is no title and so forth.  It would be much more sensible for the Department to put money into bringing those homes back into effective use.  The Government has pursued the village renewal scheme under the Minister for Rural and Community Development, Deputy Ring, and moneys have been invested in some projects that will not have a great capacity to enhance a village.  A sure way of doing it is if money is provided to compulsorily purchase these buildings and bring them back into use.  I know of a village where the Department has sanctioned money to build 22 local authority houses on its outskirts, yet there are 25 derelict properties in it.<\/p> <p>  Until somebody in the Department gets his or head around addressing that issue, there will be no joined-up thinking.  It would achieve two objectives: it would keep people in the village, reducing the number commuting from outside, and strengthen the fabric of the village by making it more attractive for people to live there.  People have started to drift out to one-off houses, even though the policy is moving away from that as climate change suggests that it is not the best way to proceed.  Frankly, people are leaving villages because they are seeing buildings crumbling around them.  Addressing that issue will not solve the problem, but it is an area where the Department could play a major role.  First, it would address an important facet of climate change by encouraging people to live in a more built-up environment.

Can Ms Hanlon outline progress on the rural transport strategy referred to in the climate action plan and what it will cover?  I am familiar with the Local Link transport system, particularly the scheme in counties Offaly and Laois.  It is an excellent system.  There was good take-up of the additional routes provided under the pilot scheme.  It is about getting the word out about it.  What else is the Department considering in regard to rural transport?<\/p> <p>  There was reference to the cycling project office and the park-and-ride office.  What is the timeline for getting that up and running?<\/p> <p>  Cloughjordan railway station is near where I live.  In fact, that part of north Tipperary is in my electoral area.  Every now and again, there appears to be a crisis due to a rumour that it will be closed.  It is very important in that area not only for the village but also for the eco-village there, which is leading the way in showing us how to live in a low impact way.  How is that to be managed?  We do not want any more negative views on what is happening there in terms of potentially closing it.<\/p> <p>  With regard to electric buses, has the evaluation been completed on how quickly we can transition to them?  How will electric buses be funded?<\/p><p>I wondered about the renewable energy directive that was mentioned in the presentation of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, and why we do not aim for the more ambitious Paris Agreement targets.  Mr. Brady mentioned the biofuels obligations scheme and E10 fuel, and outlined his concerns about older cars.  I am on the road a great deal, however, and do not see many old cars any more.  What does \"old\" mean and what problems does Mr. Brady see in such cars?<\/p><p> The target for biofuels in petrol is 10% by 2030.

Will heating be considered as part of the scheme?  I have a vested interest given that a company in my area, Grant Engineering, produces efficient oil boilers.

The types of changes and improvements made in recent times are indicative of the trajectory of change that is hoped for over time, as funds allow.<\/p> <p>  As for the policy for public transport in rural areas, we decided to fold in that work with the wider work I mentioned earlier on a general review of public transport.  Among the set of papers the Department published a couple of weeks ago at the launch of the strategy by the Minister, there is a specific one on transport in rural areas.  It examines the nature of how and why people travel and the types of facilities that are available and of challenges that are emerging.  It is one of the issues on which we are out to public consultation.  We ran a stakeholder event last week, attended by a number of stakeholders in the transport sector, that included a workshop specifically on the question of rural transport.  We expect to receive a great deal of feedback on the issue in the course of the public consultation, which will inform the policy stance in the years ahead.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked about two offices the NTA is establishing, namely, a cycle office and a park-and-ride office, two initiatives identified as actions under the climate action plan.  The cycle office was required to be in place by the end of the first quarter, which finished at the end of September, and it has been set up by the NTA.  It has helped to engender some momentum, overcome some blockages and bring some coherence and cohesiveness to the area of active travel and the cycling component thereof.  The park-and-ride office is required to be set up in this quarter, which the NTA has undertaken.  We expect that when we report on this quarter at some point in January, that aim will have been achieved.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy also asked about rail stations.  The policy for the rail network is that the first priority in rail is maintenance of the existing network, and ensuring that the existing network is at a standard and quality that will allow it to continue to work properly.

Accordingly, we committed in the national development plan to not buying any more diesel-only buses from July this year.<\/p> <p>  The next phase will be the low-emission part, namely, the transition to hybrid vehicles we are undertaking.

While nine hybrid buses are already on the streets of Dublin, the larger-scale contract, which will provide for the next few years of bus buying, will be signed soon and we will see the buses on the streets of Dublin not long afterwards.<\/p> <p>  The technology to move to full zero emissions is a more interesting question, and there is much to take into consideration when making a final determination about which technology we will use when we move to full zero emissions.  Our two main options in that regard will most likely be full battery electric vehicles for buses or hydrogen.  We have to take into account the cost of the buses and how soon we expect it to fall as the technology and manufacturing improve.  There are also service considerations, given that it is difficult to introduce fully electric buses on especially long routes, which we have, and in the case of double-deck technology, which is not yet widely available.  Currently, there is limited production of full zero-emission double-deck buses, not least in right-hand drive vehicles.<\/p> <p>  We have assembled a range of evidence on the issue over the past year.  We have run a bus trial, commissioned a full-scale assessment of all the various technologies in both a Dublin and Cork context to understand how they work on those cities' streets and routes.  We also have a paper on alternative fuels in the bus fleets out for public consultation, as part of the wider public transport and sustainable mobility consultation.  That is under way and we expect to get some evidence back from that.  We are anxious to ensure that the medium-term pathway will be determined as quickly as possible in order that we can move from this phase of hybrid buying to the zero-emission technology.  We will seek to publish a pathway early in the new year and will then be better able to give a timeline of when the full zero-emission technology might be available in Dublin.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019112700002#Y00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Laura Behan"},{"type":"speech","time":1574812800,"counter":141,"content":"<p>What about funding the buses?

We are doing that.  The biofuels obligations scheme to date has been aimed at complying with the renewable energy directive and meeting that target but in our recent consultation we set out new objectives for the scheme.  The first objective is lowering emissions.  The second is contributing to overall renewable energy and the third is complying with the renewable energy directive.  We are now putting front and centre that this is no longer just about compliance with the renewable energy directive but about emissions reduction and contributing to what is required under the Paris Agreement.<\/p> <p>  The second question was on car compatability.  In a previous session the Deputy mentioned that pumps have E5 fuel displayed on them such that people know now what it is and that it is safe to put it in their car.  When E10 is introduced on some pumps an E10 fuel label will have to be clearly displayed in order that people will be aware it.  In regard to compatibility of cars, we are confident that all cars registered from 2011 onwards are compatible with E10 fuel.  The vast majority of cars registered prior to 2011 are likely to be compatible but we do not have assurance from the manufacturers, etc.  There may well be a need for a type of protection grade.  In other words, E5 fuel might be maintained at a designated number of filling stations in order that people who have older vehicles, in respect of which the manufacturer will not give an assurance in regard to E10 fuel, will be able to access it.  This barrier is what is known as \"a blend wall\".  The reason many of the fuel manufacturers have not moved to E10 fuel, despite the price being relatively low-increase, is they cannot give their customers the assurance that it is safe to use in all cars.  In 90% or more of cars it will be fine but there is a communication piece here, similar to leaded and unleaded fuel.  We are teasing this out in the consultation.  We can be confident about cars registered from 2011 onwards but there are many cars in the fleet that are registered prior to 2011.  <\/p> <p>  In regard to achieving the 10% target by 2030 and if we should do it earlier, the climate action set that target at 2030, but it can be achieved before then.  In terms of moving from 6% biofuels in diesel to 12% in diesel, it can be a graduated increase whereas in regard to E5 and E10 in petrol there is no E7 or E8.  In many ways, the increase will be a big one but the ethanol increase will probably happen in the first half of the next decade, with some of the higher level diesels - 7% is the blend wall for diesel - happening in the back end of the next decade.  Again, part of this consultation is gathering the evidence from stakeholders, including the oil industry and so on, to better understand it.<\/p> <p>  On the final question regarding the heating sector and the company mentioned by the Deputy, we met the company recently on this issue.  In the biofuels consultation, we included a specific question on the heat sector.  Biofuels, when used outside of transport, are known as bioliquids.  The question was around if there should be an obligation on the heat sector.  Article 23 of the renewable energy directive provides for such an obligation.  We do not have one to date but it is an issue we are examining, having posed it in the consultation.  In a recent public consultation on the energy efficiency obligation scheme we included a similar question because there are different stakeholders in this sector which deals more with home heating oil than biofuels.  We are told that a certain level of blending is possible in home heating oil.  With minor adjustments existing boilers can utilise bioliquids.  The concerns are around what will happen when what is known as fatty acid methyl ester or biodiesel is held in a tank over a long period.  When a tank is half full at the end of winter the contents remain in it, largely unused for an entire summer.  There is a problem with separation in that a more viscous or gloopier biodiesel can block up the boiler.  There is need for some adjustments.  It is not a simple process but we are examining it as one we think could contribute, not just in terms of oil but potentially in gas.  Biomethane was mentioned earlier.  It is a potential means of supporting gas as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019112700002#Z00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kevin Brady"},{"type":"speech","time":1574812800,"counter":145,"content":"<p>My first question is to the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  I was recently contacted by a man who had purchased an electric vehicle.  As I understand it, the standard is not the same for all models.  Perhaps the officials would educate me on that point.  This man had to go to a particular station which had a Tesla charging point.  The Applegreen stations have their own brand chargers.  This appears to be similar to the iPhone and the Android phone situation, which is extremely frustrating.  It is confusing and it leads to people being less confident about being able to find a charging point when they need one.  Also, the access card does not always work and people have to contact the ESB, often having to wait 15 minutes for a response, to have it reboot the charging point.  I know these are teething problems, that it takes time for the negatives and positives to become known and that we will get there eventually but in the meantime the aforementioned issues need to be addressed.<\/p> <p>  On electric vehicle home charging units, I note these can be purchased for &euro;350 to &euro;400 but according to recent reports, electricians and builders are cashing in on this area and asking for &euro;3,000 for home installation.  There is no way retrofit or new build installation to a single electricity socket would cost that much.  How does the Department propose to regulate this exploitation?  On transport, has an analysis been undertaken of the viability of inland waterways for freight transport?  This would be a return a previous mode of transport but with a twist.  Has the feasibility of reintroducing this mode of transport been examined?  The Shannon Foynes waterway in particular would have the capacity and infrastructure to enable it.  <\/p> <p>  On tourism, I welcome the plan and the &euro;8.6 billion for extension of the rail network and additional capacity on it.  It was mentioned in the opening statement that investment in public transport and active travel over the coming years not only equals but well exceeds what will be invested in new roads.  Would it be bold and brave to take the decision not to invest in new roads and instead protect and maintain current infrastructure?  Is that feasible?  As we all know, congestion, regardless of emissions, be they diesel, petrol or other fumes, is blocking ease of transport and commerce.  The ethanol increase to 10% is not ambitious enough in light of the fact that Sweden has moved to 85% and Brazil to 100%.  I accept that there are problems with older cars but their number will dwindle fairly quickly.<\/p> <p>  On the park-and-ride facilities, I live in the shadow of the national children's hospital construction site.  When the hospital is completed in 2023, there will be 4,000 staff on that campus.  Current staff and construction workers on the site have been told to use the park-and-ride facility at the Red Cow and the Luas, which they do not adhere to.  However, this park-and-ride facility is already operating in excess of capacity.  What is the proposed location of the new park-and-ride facility?  Will the site for it be bought under compulsory purchase order and, if so, what is the estimated cost and how long will that process take?    <\/p> <p>  My final question is on the aviation fuel tax.  I understand the current exemption is to cease in the future but the wheels are turning slowly in making that happen because it is weighted against profit-making and passengers taking on the burden of the tax, which will cause an uproar as well.  Perhaps, people will travel less even though they love their sun holidays.  How do the witnesses foresee that happening?  I note that the new European Commission only commenced in December.<\/p><p>The wheels turn slowly.  Aviation is massive.  I am very aware when I go to the airport of the smell of the fuel that lingers in my lungs.  It is a public health issue, never mind the extra burden of tax and what it does to our environment and our own people in the public health area.  I thank the witnesses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019112700002#Z00300","speaker":"1388","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1574812800,"counter":147,"content":"<p>I will start with Mr. Brady.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019112700002#AA00200","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1574812800,"counter":148,"content":"<p>The Senator's first question was about the compatibility of connectors.  The Tesla chargers are a private network for Tesla owners only.  One unfortunately has to buy a Tesla vehicle to use them.  The ESB has upgraded all of their network fast chargers and all of the new fast chargers under the climate action plan will have both fittings, the first of which is called CHAdeMO - the Nissan Leaf is probably the most popular car which uses that, which is the Japanese standard -  and second of which is the combined charging system, CCS, the new European standard that the majority of cars use.  All of the new ESB chargers and the vast majority of the existing ones have been upgraded to this standard.<\/p> <p>  The second point that the Senator made related to the access card, ringing up and resetting, is an issue around the old infrastructure that is out there.  I mentioned in my opening statement that the climate action plan funding of &euro;10 million is not just about new fast chargers.  The 250 existing standard green chargers that can be seen across the street are being replaced with blue ones with Project Ireland 2040 written on them.  They are the high reliability models.  We accept that the existing standard chargers have reliability issues, which is why they are all being replaced.  The ESB has replaced approximately 50 of them and is proceeding quite well.  Both an upgrade to make the network more reliable, and an expansion are taking place.  It is happening now and it is getting better each and every day.  I hope that those experiences will get much better.  <\/p> <p>  The home charger costs between &euro;350 and &euro;400.  The Government gives a grant of &euro;600, which covers not only the purchase but the installation cost.  We require a certified electrician to do it.  The vast majority of grants are claiming the full &euro;600.  The prices we are seeing are in the order of &euro;1,000, so on average we are giving over half of that.  On the higher costs, without naming any electricity supply companies, some offer a service.  Even though one may not trust or know someone who may do the installation, I suggest looking at the electricity supply companies, which are trusted, regulated entities, to see their offers.  One applies for the grant but one should definitely not pay &euro;3,000.  There are options there to look at.<\/p> <p>  On ethanol volume increasing to 10%,there is an issue around indirect land use change.  Ethanol, by a large, comes from feed or food-based crops.  The issue is that if we take corn or wheat and make it into ethanol, if they are planted on land that is currently used for some other food production, that food or animal feed needs to be produced somewhere else.  That might involve cutting down a forest to plant it or whatever it might be.  If we take over more land for biofuels, the issue is whether this will have an indirect land use change that is bad for the environment.  Based upon what we are at, Ireland will probably be limited from 2021 onwards to only allowing food or feed-based biofuels to account for 2% of our energy use.  E10 would be close enough to that 2%.  Going beyond that, it would have to be ethanol that is not produced from food or feed-based crops, which would be much more expensive option.<\/p> <p>  As someone said earlier, these issues are very much intertwined.  Even though it sounds like a great idea to go beyond that, the other environmental impacts need to taken into account too.  I caution against indirect land use change impacts and the potential higher increases.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019112700002#AA00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kevin Brady"},{"type":"speech","time":1574812800,"counter":149,"content":"<p>We have peatlands that will not be in use and we could barter them to enable a growth in this fuel option.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019112700002#AA00400","speaker":"1388"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1574812800,"counter":150,"content":"<p>I am not an expert in peatland but I do not think it makes great tillage land so growing corn or wheat on it may not be realistic option.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019112700002#AA00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kevin Brady"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1574812800,"counter":151,"content":"<p>The Senator asked if work that had been done on the scope of inland waterways for freight movement.

There are 1,000 km of inland waterways but these are largely oriented towards recreational use, which has been the focus of their use to date.<\/p> <p>  Internationally, the bulk of inland waterway usage is concentrated in the Rhine and Danube countries.  The former have 85% of this usage within the EU on inland waterways with the latter around 15%.  There is practically nothing happening in the other member states.  <\/p> <p>  On the question of investment in new roads, it is important to clear up what might be a misapprehension that are massive plans for the expansion of many more motorways; there are not.  The motorway network has been largely completed.  This involved considerable investment and was developed largely in the earlier years of this century.  The network is there.  Together with the national road network, which is far more extensive, it is absorbing the bulk of the investment that there will be in roads in the coming time.  The largest proportion of the roads budget is directed at maintaining and keeping in good service what has been built, and being used by people around the country.  Some investment is available for new roads, but it is of a much smaller scale compared to what is being invested in keeping the existing network going.  This is of a much smaller scale than the investment that will occur in new public transport.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019112700002#AA00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Deirdre Hanlon"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1574812800,"counter":152,"content":"<p>On the park-and-ride issue, the  NTA which was mentioned earlier, is on the cusp of setting up its new offices.

We hear about active travel.  I met her at a meeting of a different sectoral committee a week ago.  Can we start separating public transport, walking and cycling?  I want to talk about each of those because this committee has specific targets for cycling.  Public transport needs its own conversation.  We talk about one kind of vehicle - electric vehicles - at great length but I am concerned that the other areas get bundled together.  I ask that we separate the ambition and standards in terms of each of them.<\/p> <p>  Will the national cycling planning framework be renewed next year?  Will it be more ambitious than in the past?<\/p> <p>  Regarding rail freight, Ms Hanlon mentioned the doubling of the capacity of the rail fleet in Dublin, which is a positive development.  We went through a process recently where everybody had to fight to maintain the stop at the station in their town, and we are considering streamlining those stops.  How did we reverse from a position whereby people are having to justify the existence of a railway station, and a service to that railway station?  The Department is not seeing which commuters make a better case but it is actively seeking and promoting new rail users.  It is a reversal of the conversation we have had where people have had to fight for a service.  How do we flip that narrative?<\/p> <p>  The issue of schools was mentioned at great length in terms of walking, cycling and school safety.  Has anything happened since the meeting of the other committee last week?  I have been thinking about it since then and have ideas on it.  What strategies specifically relate to younger people, older people and women cycling?  Those are the major inequalities.  Ireland has seen a situation develop whereby we are becoming less diverse in terms of cycling.  There has been a 90% reduction in the number of girls cycling to school.  That question is also for the Department of Finance.  We are talking about tax relief, which is fine for commuters and people in particular work, but what initiatives in terms of tax measures, tax credits or a family tax credit incentivise pensioners or children to cycle?<\/p> <p>  I ask Mr. Kenny to comment on the fact that the Department of Finance has proposed a tax relief for road hauliers in respect of diesel.

Those are ten years old at this stage.  They had a horizon out to 2020.  In the course of preparing for the public consultation we are doing now, which is part of a review of policy across this area, we specifically took each of those two documents and reviewed our progress on implementation of them.  That was very much informed by the fact that 2009 is not a year we remember for cycling policy documents.

It is important to pick up on that.  We have talked today exclusively about sustainability.  Energy policy, however, is about sustainability, security of supply and competitiveness leading to affordability.  When we talk about all of this, although we need to do so for climate reasons, we always need to be sure of how security of supply is affected.  Will people's homes be heated?  Will they have a supply of electricity?  After recent storms, we saw what needs to be done.  I point to the climate adaptation plans published recently in that we need to prepare our country for climate change, bearing in mind the need to sustain the electricity supply and the points on competitiveness and affordability.<\/p> <p>  I have a couple of points to make on biofuels.  Two thirds of the biodiesel in Ireland comes from used cooking oil.  We have not mentioned the one third that comes from tallow, which is a waste product of animals.  On the two thirds that comes from used cooking oil, there was a case of fraud.  The fraud involved something that was not used cooking oil which was purported to be used cooking oil.  As a result of that fraud, we should not decide that reused cooking oil is somehow bad.  It was something which was purported to be reused cooking oil that was bad.  Used cooking oil, which is a waste product, is still higher up the hierarchy in that it is using a waste as opposed to using land, considering the potential indirect land use changes, etc.  It is certainly better than using fossil fuel.  I take the Senator's point, but where there is fraud we need to stop it.<\/p> <p>  Under the new renewable energy directive, there is a new Europe-wide database to allow for traceability and for all countries to talk to one another and submit information.  The EU is leading in this regard and Ireland will very much play its part in working together to eliminate the fraud.  It is our intention to maintain the double counting.  That is what we set out in the public consultation.  The decision is not made and we will listen to the submissions to the consultation.  Our reasoning is based on the circular economy.  We are trying to use waste above other things.<\/p> <p>  Rewetting the bogs is good for the climate.  It does not really tie in with biofuels.  Bord na M&oacute;na has tried to grow different types of biomass on the bogs but this has not been overly successful to date.  If there is a crop that can be grown on bogs and that can be used to fuel vehicles, we are be absolutely open to listening.

I flagged it on the day of the apology to the women in the D&aacute;il.  I told the Minister and the Taoiseach that they had to get it right.  My concern on this has been public for some time.  I am very concerned about this letter.  I believe that the timelines associated with it are worrying.  It is concerning that they want to bring it in here on the final sitting day of the Parliament and release the information at that time.<\/p><p>The letter presents inherent issues.All the individual reports are completed.  All of the RCOG reports are done.  The letter also says that the aggregate report is now being completed.  All the work is done.  This was meant to be done by last May, then it was supposed to be done by September and then it was meant to be done by October.  It is now done.  The letter states:<\/p> <blockquote> \t  \t <blockquote> \tAs individual reports were transferred from RCOG to the HSE, the HSE undertook a detailed verification process to ensure that each report was provided to the right participant.  This was necessary given that slides and records were identified by number only during the analysis undertaken by RCOG, to protect the privacy of women and next of kin. <\/blockquote>  <\/blockquote> <p>Is that not inherently contradictory?  The individual reports &quot;were transferred from RCOG to the HSE&quot;.  As the reports came back, they went through a filtration verification process.  I know all about this process and we will talk about it whenever we have an opportunity to the HSE.  When the files were transferred with RCOG, they were given a reference number to protect the privacy of the women and next of kin, yet, when the files came back through the HSE, the privacy for next of kin does not seem to have mattered.  How can one have an independent review that has been verified?  How can one have an independent review that is anonymous and is then verified by the HSE?  Trust me, we are going to get into that detail.  That is deeply worrying.<\/p><p>The issue is that the Department is saying it will not bring this forward, even though all the work is done, because all the women need to be communicated with.  If the process of verification was so necessary and accurate, then what is the issue?  The reports have been done for some time.  Why is it taking so long?  If the HSE needed to be instrumental in communicating this, and breaking its own rules with regard to privacy, why did it need to use couriers in some cases to find people?  Why is there such a delay?  Why are we being fobbed off?  I have a deep concern over this and over the timelines.  The Minister for Health keeps on saying it is coming, and I respect the nuances of what he is saying, but it is being pushed out and I am concerned as to why it is being pushed out.  This report is proposed to be brought in to the committee on 18 December or 19 December and then to be released publicly at Christmas time, when scrutiny would not be at the same level it should be for such a serious issue.

As the Chairman has noted, I am joined by Ms Kate O'Flaherty, who is head of health and well-being in the Department of Health; and Ms Maeve O'Brien, who is the acting programme head of the HSE sexual health and crisis pregnancy programme.  I intend to outline briefly the background and context to the group's work before highlighting some of the key findings of the report and possible policy options the committee may wish to consider.<\/p> <p>  The Minister established the working group in April 2019 to consider the range of policy, regulatory and legislative issues that arise as he seeks to improve access to contraception.  The establishment of the group was primarily a response to the ancillary recommendation of the Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution that \"a scheme for the provision of the most effective method of contraception, free of charge and having regard to personal circumstances, to all people who wish to avail of them within the State\" should be introduced.  It also reflected the commitment of the Minister and the Department to improving women&rsquo;s experience of healthcare in Ireland.  It should be seen in the wider context of the establishment of the women's health task force and the work the Department is currently undertaking.<\/p> <p>  The working group comprised officials from relevant policy areas within the Department, including the Office of the Chief Medical Officer and the community pharmacy, bioethics, research, health and well-being, eligibility and primary care units.  I emphasise that this was not a closed departmental exercise.  Consultation was an intrinsic part of the group's work.  More than 5,000 responses were received in response to a public consultation exercise.  Approximately 3,500 of these submissions were fully completed.  The group directly met several key stakeholders, including the Irish College of General Practitioners and Irish Family Planning Association.  I would like to take this opportunity to thank everyone who engaged with the work of the group, especially the stakeholders who met us or submitted detailed submissions to us, or both.  They greatly informed the group's work and the report.<\/p> <p>  The first key finding of the report is that barriers to accessing contraception exist for some people.  It identifies the most prevalent obstacles as lack of local access, cost, embarrassment, inconvenience and lack of knowledge.  It is evident that contraception use in Ireland is high and stable and that difficulty accessing contraception is a challenge at the margins in overall population terms.  The notion that there is a sizable affordability challenge across the population as people seek to access contraception remains unproven.  A number of policy levers are available to the Government as it seeks to overcome the barriers that exist.  There is considerable support among stakeholders for the introduction of a universal, State-funded scheme for contraception.  The cost of introducing such a scheme is indicatively estimated at between &euro;80 million and &euro;100 million.  This is a significant sum and leads naturally to the question of whether such investment would represent the best use of resources.<\/p> <p>  As the committee will appreciate, there is a substantial list of health service development proposals across the spectrum of prevention, primary and community care and the acute hospital system.  Strong cases for additional investment can and have been made in respect of such proposals.  In addition to this opportunity cost, there is a real risk that making contraception free to end users will simply displace or substitute for private expenditure.  Equally, the view that free contraception will lead to a significant reduction in the number of crisis pregnancies may be over-optimistic.<\/p><p>Any policy initiative in this area should be seen as a behavioural intervention and must go beyond the question of cost to address issues of local accessibility, education and workforce capacity, all of which are considered in the report.<\/p><p> In terms of accessibility, the report examined in particular the potential role of community pharmacists in prescribing contraception, seeking to balance the need for easier access to services with the risk of contraindications and the positive health factors associated with continuity of care.  The report recommended that oral contraceptives could be prescribed for a 12-month period to improve accessibility while maintaining patient safety, which would have the additional benefit of reducing costs to the State.<\/p><p> Education is highlighted as key to tackling lack of information, misinformation and embarrassment around contraception.  The review of relationships and sexuality education, RSE, curriculum is under way and is welcome, but there will also be a need for wider public information campaigns, possibly under the Healthy Ireland banner.  Positive steps are being taken in this area, for example, through the sexual well-being website, but it is important that we build on this work to ensure that we are reaching and informing as many people as possible.  It also will be necessary to continue to build our workforce capacity to ensure that we have a sufficient number of trained healthcare providers to deliver safe and accessible contraception services.<\/p><p> The report concludes that there will always be some doubt as to whether a State-funded contraception scheme represents the optimal use of funds on a purely cost-benefit basis.  However, it is clear that there are considerations beyond the economic that need to be taken into account when formulating policy in this area.  These include: the human and women's rights dimension of contraceptive access; the policy context following the introduction of termination of pregnancy services; and the potential health benefits.  It is these social or societal factors that led the group to suggest that further exploration of policy proposals to support contraception may be warranted and three possible options for further consideration are identified.  These are a universal State-funded contraception scheme based on the current General Medical Services, GMS, scheme but including the copper coil; the expansion of the GMS scheme as it relates to long-acting reversible contraception, LARC, to all women; or a phased approach to the introduction of a free contraception scheme, beginning with younger women, possibly in the 17 to 24 years age range.<\/p><p> The order in which the options were presented does not imply a ranking of preference, and the group intended that they be viewed as possible directions of travel for further consideration rather than as fixed recommendations with set parameters.  Clearly, the development of these or other proposals would require further detailed policy and legislative work, as well as consultation with service providers.<\/p><p> It is important to recognise that the issues discussed in the report relate to just one aspect of the wider strategy to support sexual and reproductive healthcare.  The Department of Health and the HSE, in collaboration with stakeholders, are progressing work in a number of areas identified by the joint committee in respect of sexual health promotion and education.  This includes the expansion of the free provision of condoms to at-risk groups, while the HSE will be repeating the in-depth general population survey on sexual health and crisis pregnancy to provide us with up-to-date information to support policy development and implementation.  The development of the national sexual health strategy will also commence in 2020.<\/p><p> The Minister believes that this committee is in a position to make a valuable contribution in charting a path forward that responds to the challenges and cost implications outlined in the report, while seeking to ensure that we can facilitate access to contraception and strengthen sexual and reproductive healthcare in Ireland more generally.  Hopefully, the discussion this morning can advance that aim.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019112700002#D01500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Andrew Conlon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1574812800,"counter":243,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Conlon.

I am a medical doctor and have specialised in reproductive health for over 20 years.  I have been the medical director of the Irish Family Planning Association, IFPA, since 2008.  The IFPA is Ireland's leading sexual health charity.  It promotes the right of all people to sexual and reproductive health information and to dedicated, confidential and affordable healthcare.<\/p> <p>  Access to a choice of contraceptive methods is critical to gender equality, to women&rsquo;s ability to plan the number and spacing of any children they choose to have and to their participation in education, employment and public service, including voluntary work and politics.  It is central to the achievement of the right to health and it is key to reducing the rate of unintended pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections.<\/p> <p>  The IFPA welcomes the working group report.  The introduction of abortion care in January of this year has set a positive precedent for universal access to reproductive healthcare and policy on contraception should be consistent with this approach.  We support universal access to all available methods of contraception without cost to the individual.  This would enable people to choose the contraceptive most appropriate to their changing needs and preferences throughout their reproductive lives.<\/p> <p>  As a provider of abortion care and pregnancy counselling, we are acutely aware that many unintended pregnancies arise from poor or inadequate information and misinformation or because cost barriers force women who wish to avoid pregnancy to use unreliable methods or no method of contraception.  In my daily practice, I have seen women present with unintended pregnancy who had chosen an effective LARC method but had deferred having it because of the cost involved.  I have also seen women following a termination of pregnancy who are unable to afford their method of choice.  This is completely unacceptable and I do not think this is what the public voted for in last year&rsquo;s referendum.<\/p> <p>  Any contraceptive scheme must address the particular needs of young people.  International research indicates that young people have higher rates of non-adherence and discontinuation of contraception than adults.  We know from domestic research that adolescents identify cost as a barrier to access.  Furthermore, the Irish Study of Sexual Health and Relationships identifies those who have sex before the age of 17 years as being significantly more likely to experience a crisis pregnancy.  Given these risks and vulnerabilities, it would be unacceptable to exclude adolescents from a contraception scheme.<\/p> <p>  As the working group report acknowledges, the removal of the cost barrier alone is insufficient to ensure access to contraception for all who need it.  Policy reform must address all barriers in a comprehensive and strategic approach.  This includes legal restrictions, poor access to information about contraception, regional disparities in the quality and availability of services, gaps in provider training and capacity, stigma and lack of confidentiality.<\/p> <p>  The development of an implementation plan with clear goals and achievable actions will be key to the successful roll-out of a contraceptive scheme.  This process must be undertaken in consultation with relevant stakeholders to ensure appropriate levels of planning and resourcing, as well as mechanisms for data collection, monitoring and evaluation.  Specific measures must be introduced to address the contraceptive needs of vulnerable and underserved populations, namely, adolescents, refugees, asylum seekers and other vulnerable migrants, people with disabilities, homeless people, Travellers and other marginalised groups.<\/p> <p>  Members of the Oireachtas have a key role to play in supporting better access to contraception; political consensus and commitment on reproductive health policy will be crucial to full implementation, ensuring that these reforms can be progressed regardless of who is in government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019112700002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Caitriona Henchion"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1574812800,"counter":245,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for affording me the opportunity to address it.  I am a medical doctor, a general practitioner and the director of sexual and reproductive health at the Irish College of General Practitioners, ICGP.  I am also president of the European Society of Contraception and Reproductive Health and chair of the Irish Society of Health Care Professionals.<\/p> <p>  In light of a free termination of pregnancy service, the ICGP fully supports the principle of free contraception that is appropriate, available, accessible and free to those who wish to avail of it.  Put simply, giving access to a free contraceptive service is the logical next step following the implementation of the community-provided medical abortion service.<\/p> <p>  The ICGP commends Mr. Conlon and his team on their comprehensive report but we cannot support the proposed phased roll-out of the service.  His statement that contraception has potential health benefits that impact on people, and women in particular, when the opportunity to choose the most effective and suitable type of contraception based on their lifestyles, health needs and preferences is afforded to them is fully supported by the college.  Reliable and appropriate use of contraception allows a couple to plan, space and limit their family size when they are ready and prepared for parenthood.  In these different phases of a reproductive life, the choice of contraception will change depending on the needs of a couple.  However, there are parts of the report that do not reflect the experience of GPs and I would welcome the opportunity to discuss this today.<\/p> <p>  Dr. Henchion and Mr. Conlon raised good points &ndash; lack of knowledge, fear of stigma and perceived lack of understanding from service providers may make contraception inaccessible.  This raises the fundamental issues of information, education and knowledge, all of which impact on making the right choice at the right time.  While Mr. Conlon makes a case for prioritising free contraception for the vulnerable and the marginalised, he also points out that these groups may for the most part have free contraception available to them through the GMS scheme.<\/p> <p>  The parts missing here are fundamental knowledge of reproduction, that is, sex education; information regarding the different methods of contraception; and empowerment to make informed choices appropriate to the particular need.<\/p><p>In addition, I make a case for those who have the educational knowledge but are at risk of making poor choices due to the initial cost outlay.  A pack of condoms may seem an inexpensive option in the short term while a long-acting reversible method of contraception would be a better option.  There is, again, a case for information and education for women in their mid to late 40s who erroneously believe that age, infrequent intercourse, etc., precludes them from a pregnancy.  The ICGP, therefore, supports full and free contraception for all groups.<\/p><p> GPs are ideally placed to provide a full range of contraceptive services in the community.  We are an education and training body and the college provides training in all methods of contraception and runs designated courses in the training of LARC.  The college would like to expand the training and upskilling of our colleagues.  The provision of LARC requires a specialised skill set of technical expertise.  The training is time consuming and demands up to five sessions or two and a half days, although probably more in real time, to gain the necessary expertise, meaning GPs require funding and support for upskilling but, in economic terms, this is an upfront investment with long-term benefits.<\/p><p>  I hope that we are all agreed that providing free abortion without contraception is not a healthy option.  There is a strong case to be made for the normalising of attitudes to sexual and reproductive health, to rid ourselves of the stigma around our sexuality and to approach our reproductive lives through education and information appropriate to the age cohort.  Free contraception on its own has not been shown to work, for which I gave the example of the UK but this has happened in other jurisdictions.  Free contraception, acknowledgement of our sexual lives and needs over time, and a proper structural information and education programme will work to reduce the need for abortion, which is, I presume, the purpose of this exercise and would be a rewarding outcome for the provision of access to a free contraceptive service in the community. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019112700002#E00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Mary Short","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1574812800,"counter":247,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Short and Dr. Henchion.

Many committee members support the idea that if free abortion services are going to be provided, contraception must be provided free.  It would be a perverse situation whereby women had to pay for contraception but not abortion in the case of a fatal foetal abnormality, crisis pregnancy or whatever.  Introducing abortion services was not a simple thing to do, yet it was done but we are looking at several years after that before movements on contraception can be made.  I am not a doctor but I imagine that steps such as training for GPs or reducing the cost of LARC, or rolling out education programmes for younger people and vulnerable groups are simpler to do than introducing abortion throughout the country.<\/p> <p>  My criticism is not aimed at anybody here but I am disappointed that people in will have to wait several years for action on this matter.  I thank Mr. Conlon for the invite for us to give our views and input.  My view and input is that things needs to start happening now.  The service plan has not been signed off.  I must confess that when I read Dr. Short's opening statement last night I was surprised at her call for further GP training.  I would have thought that every GP understood contraception.  Dr. Short is an expert who represents the ICGP.  If what she is telling us is that GPs need more training, then let us give them more training.  That is certainly not expensive to provide.  Better intervention in schools, and better intervention with some vulnerable members of the population such as immigrant women, asylum seekers and various other groups, could be concocted and rolled out in a matter of weeks.<\/p><p>It is a small amount in the context of an &euro;18 billion budget.  We are all trying to empower women, and men, and especially younger women and women who are at higher risk.  That kind of intervention can happen pretty quickly and at a low cost.  We should get this up and running in the first quarter of next year.  Let us get that into the service plan.<\/p><p> Dr. Short gave figures ranging between &euro;80 million to &euro;100 million, which will take most people by surprise.  That is a chunk of cash.  In the context of women's reproductive health, the Rotunda Hospital is screaming for investment just to make the hospital safe while they wait for God knows how long for a move out to the Connolly Hospital campus.  The Rotunda needs some &euro;20 million to make a significant difference in what is one of Europe's busiest maternity hospitals.  They cannot get that, so &euro;80 million to &euro;100 million is a chunk of change.  I bet the GPs could be trained up, education programmes could be run and targeted interventions could be used for a small amount.  The report, and the opening statements, referred to the GMS scheme for medical cards, including some supports.  It is by no means a perfect way, but it is one way of targeting supports to lower income people, and it is the entire point of the medical card scheme.  It would be possible to identify the additional changes to that, or whatever bits are not currently included.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019112700002#F00700","speaker":"1436","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1574812800,"counter":254,"content":"<p>Let us get some responses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019112700002#G00200","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speech","time":1574812800,"counter":255,"content":"<p>That was my input.

While we are not discussing this matter specifically today, it is interrelated with regard to the education and broader sexual health promotion.  Additional funding of &euro;1.5 million has gone into a HSE sexual health programme for ancillary recommendations in respect of sexual health education and promotion, and the extension of the national condom distribution service, which we have started, and the committee may have seen the start of the roll-out in third level campuses.  This is the start of the roll-out to other areas with at-risk groups.  As Mr. Conlon referred to in his opening remarks, another comprehensive survey has been conducted of the population.

It has been hailed as a huge success in patient satisfaction, in accessibility and in the ultimate goal of having a high uptake of the flu vaccine and convenience for patients.

While the evidence all suggests that the lower the user input, the more efficacious a product is and that we have far more success with long-acting reversible contraceptives, the fact is, as all the experts here know, at different stages in their lives women might choose an oral contraceptive pill at the start as there is a familiarity with it.  I would like to see a point arrive where everybody is familiar with a long-acting reversible contraceptive but we are a while off that.  There are psychological barriers to it and there might be issues where one might only need a contraceptive for a short time.  It is far more complex, as the witnesses know, than just horsing a long-acting contraceptive into everybody.

That might be due to cost, familiarity or because of what is happening in their lives at that particular time.

If a woman who has been on the contraceptive pill for 18 months presents at a pharmacy and seeks a five-year or long-acting solution, why is a referral not part of the process?  Community pharmacists are well used to such scenarios.  An average of 90% of our work is referring people to doctors to be fixed up.  I fail to understand why it cannot be part of the solution.  I cannot understand the resistance to it, apart from the fact that there may to some extent be turf wars, like in the case of vaccines back in the day.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019112700002#K00400","speaker":"1297"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1574812800,"counter":328,"content":"<p>I do not see any problem with it being a part of the solution.

Much more work must to be done in that area, pending the outcome of the review of the RSE curriculum.  That will involve changes for every age group.  The information is there.  As Ms O'Brien noted, a great deal of work has been done in the past few years to build our content and resources and make it much more youth-friendly and accessible through online and social media channels.  Young people would have been consulted in the development of all those materials.<\/p> <p>  Information on contraception is already there, to the extent that it is included in the HSE's resources and is provided as part of a normal consultation.  I take the point that while the content and information may be there, people are not getting the knowledge and confidence they need to make those choices.  That is something we can look at, in terms of how we work with partner organisations that interact with young people and women outside of school settings in particular.  We need to broaden the base of the people using the one trusted set of resources.  It has been important for us to have an evidence-based, factual information resource, which was developed by the HSE in partnership with young people, teachers and parents.  It is helpful for young people that everybody is using the same resources and information, because they will not get confused if they have a good source of information.<\/p> <p>  Another important point to which Ms O'Brien alluded is that we now have a single foundation sexual training programme, which all adults who work with young people go through.  That goes back to some of Dr. Short's points on the need for the adult population to be more open and comfortable in talking about sexuality and sexual and reproductive health.

Does he think it is unfair that contraceptives should have to be bought or means-tested?  For example, when a number of years ago I went to get my Mirena coil inserted, I had to pay for it and bring it with me.  When people go into hospital to get stents or pacemakers put in, do they have to bring them with them in boxes?  Why is contraception singled out in this way when it comes to women's health?<\/p> <p>  What is the rationale for using general arguments such as opportunity costs?  There are opportunity costs with any form of public expenditure on anything.  We will have an expenditure of &euro;3 billion on the roll-out of broadband.  There are huge opportunity costs as to where that &euro;3 billion might otherwise be spent.  I would have a few ideas, such as childcare, home care and a universal system of contraceptive care.  Opportunity costs are an argument but one that does not apply particularly or solely in this instance.  There are always opportunity costs.  Again, why introduce this argument?  It is a red herring and has introduced the kinds of debates we have had this morning about GPs versus pharmacists and older women versus younger women when, in fact, what we need to do is get on with the universal system of contraceptive care that was envisaged in the report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution.  We are now talking about tinkering instead of getting the report right.  That is why I am disappointed with it.  I am also disappointed with the undue delay and the direction of the conversation.

I would like to hear from Mr. Conlon how we can shift away from the economic debate and move back to a more rights-based conversation.  Why should I have to pay for my Mirena coil?

From the group's point of view, that does not seem a sensible system to have, so I completely agree with the Senator.  I am slightly disappointed with the Senator's disappointment, if I may put it that way.  I had hoped this was one of the messages that would come through in the report.  Again, it is explicitly stated in the report that it will spend a lot of time looking at economic and technical issues, but it acknowledges very early in the introduction the human rights and women's rights dimension in the context of the UN, the World Health Organization and so on.  It is explicit about the gendered financial burden, in terms of both the cost of the products and the cost of crisis pregnancy in financial, emotional and health terms.  The conclusion is explicit that, having gone through all the economic, technical and budgetary arguments, what we come back to is the rights issue, specifically the rights of women.  This is associated with the consistency of policy and health benefits.  I would have hoped women's rights would come through strongly in the report as a consideration but also, more than that, a driving force in looking at and changing policy in this area such that it is not about economics.  The group - certainly I as the chair - did not want to advocate a particular course of action.  That was not our role.  Our role was to inform debates, provide evidence and identify policy options.  I had hoped we had been successful in doing that.  I take the point that the bulk of the report is about the technical side of budgets and budget management that reflects the practical concerns.  I certainly would not want that to take away from that fundamental issue of rights.  As a group of civil servants, however, we believe those questions of rights and so on are very much in the domain of political decisions for the Oireachtas, the Minister, the Government and so on.  All we were trying to do was inform debate.  What the report in some way suggests is a slight warning.

Also, on a gender equality basis, we provide free condoms to men who have sex with men and they get prophylaxis medication before they have sex and afterwards, yet we are fighting over a choice of contraceptive for women that can last five to ten years.  It will lead to healthier women with options on when to have their children, when to space their families and when to limit their families.

At every opportunity the Minister emphasised the fact that not only was free abortion going to be introduced on 1 January, and there was a major push to have it done by 1 January, but also that there would be provision of free contraception.  However, there appears to be a push back now.  It is a year later and there has been no progress on introducing a scheme of free contraception for women.

It is an issue, although anecdotally, it may be a decreasing issue.  It does not relate to a single religious outlook, but there may be other considerations.

On the resources being developed by the HSE in consultation and collaboration with education, teachers and young people, the most important thing is that we have clear, factual, evidence-based information which is available at an age-appropriate level.  A key part of that is being able to work with teachers in schools to train teachers who teach SPHE and sex education in the confidence and skills to be able to talk to teenagers in particular around those issues.  That is something that often comes up around the comfort and confidence that adults have in having those discussions and supporting the young people in their skills and so on.  The Department of Health's policy perspective is that all young people would have access to factual information and supports and resources to help them make those informed decisions.  We also have a commitment to support their parents, teachers and youth workers in their work to help the young people to take that knowledge on board, answer their questions and ensure that they can make informed choices as adults.

Following a competitive process overseen by the Public Appointments Service, PAS, Mr. David Gunning was appointed chief officer in September and Mr. Phelim Devine was appointed project director in October.  We have also added to the capabilities of the project team by engaging expertise in a number of areas.  We have reorganised the board committee structure to focus our attention on what will be our critical challenges over the coming years.  As a result of the resignation of a number of board members this year, there are vacancies on the board.  These positions were advertised via the PAS and we understand a shortlist of potential candidates will be submitted to the Minister in December.  We report to the children's hospital project and programme steering group on a monthly basis, providing comprehensive updates on all aspects of the project, and we also report to the project and programme board.  We continue to work closely with the relevant officials in the Department of Health and our colleagues in the HSE, as well as with our colleagues in Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland.<\/p> <p>  Those members who have had the opportunity to visit the site of the new children's hospital, or anybody who has passed the site recently, will have seen the progress that has been achieved in construction.  Across the 12 acre site, the excavation, piling and the structural frame to the underground basement for campus-wide facilities management, energy centre and the 1,000-space underground car park are nearing completion and the first window has been installed in the hospital.  Well over 1 million sq. ft of slabs have been poured.  Mr. Gunning will give some further detail on the construction shortly.

The investment decision approved at the time was exclusive of residual risks, as was communicated at the time of approval.  These exceptions were also set out within the PricewaterhouseCoopers, PwC, report published in April this year.  As pointed out by PwC, some of these risks are under our control and some are not, and we are actively managing those under our control while monitoring those that are not.  One example relates to contractor claims.  Contractor claims are a feature of most construction contracts, big and small, including this one.  We are organised to ensure timely and evidenced responses to claims as they arise and are defending the public interest robustly.  Contractor claims have not had a material impact on the GMP to date.<\/p> <p>   I will hand over to our recently appointed chief officer, Mr. David Gunning, who will introduce himself and provide some more detail on the construction update.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019112700002#R00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fred Barry"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1574812800,"counter":394,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and members of the committee.  This is my first time to address the committee so I am thankful for the opportunity to introduce myself.  I have met quite a few members before in other roles but I am delighted to be here wearing the hat of the chief officer of the NPHDB.<\/p> <p>  During my career to date, I have worked in Ireland and internationally.  For approximately 20 years, I delivered large-scale and complex projects around the globe in positions of increasing responsibility with leading multinational companies.  The projects were typically regional and national telecommunications networks.  The scope of these projects included product design and development, network design, network build, commissioning and service delivery.  I started my career as an Army officer, serving for almost ten years in the communications and information services corps in the Defence Forces.  I am an electrical engineer by profession and hold a master&rsquo;s degree in business administration.<\/p> <p>  In 2006, I was appointed chief executive officer of the State-owned company, Coillte Teoranta, which I led until 2013.  My latest role before taking on this position was in healthcare as chief executive of the Royal Hospital in Donnybrook, where I had previously served on the board as a non-executive director.  It is my intention to use the leadership, project delivery and contract management experience I have accumulated through the years over the course of my career to lead effectively the national paediatric hospital executive team and the broader team in this very significant project.<\/p> <p>  I have been in the role since mid-September and have spent more than two months familiarising myself with all the various strands of the project and getting to know the project stakeholders.  This is one of those important stakeholder events.  As Mr. Barry said, we have also made some operational and organisational changes to help strengthen our team and improve our governance and reporting structures.  I fully subscribe to the vision for this hospital, which is to create one of the finest children's hospitals in the world.  It is a challenging project but one that will have a profound impact on the children, young people and families that it will serve.  Since starting, I have been very impressed by the passion and motivation of the broad team involved in delivering this significant project.<\/p> <p>  I will provide a brief construction update and we have included some images in our presentation.  I am sure many members have either been to, or passed, the site.<\/p><p>To the south west of the site, opposite the South Circular Road, the frame to the finger blocks containing the outpatient departments, cardiology wards, therapy and play areas are completed to the south east.  The structural frame containing the outpatient clinical decontamination unit, radiology, critical care and the theatres is also nearing completion.  The frame supporting the fourth-floor garden to the south of the building is partially complete and sections of the ward block from levels 4 to 6 have commenced.  The mechanical and electrical fit-out of the plant areas is well progressed.  The fit-out of the outpatients department is due to commence shortly. <\/p><p> The north side of the site has come out of the ground to reach ground level, and the north fingers containing the overnight accommodation for outpatients' parents, the hospital school and the public restaurant are on level 1.  The main campus access road, the U-shaped road coming into St. James's Hospital from the right-hand side of the photograph now being displayed, is now in a permanent position around the perimeter of the site.  I refer to the access road from the South Circular Road into the site.<\/p><p> I will now show a couple of photographs.  I direct members to the red writing in the centre of the first image.  Basement 2, basement 1, the lower ground floor, ground level, level 1, level 2 and level 3 are all constructed in this area.  For clarity, another three levels will go on top of level 4.  These will contain the ward blocks in an oval-shaped building sitting on top.  This view looks towards the west from the old access road.<\/p><p> I am now showing a view along the old South Circular Road entrance with which people will be familiar.  It shows the fingers going from left to right.  We can show the cardiology outpatient department, the surgical wards and the work spaces.  The haematology and oncology department is on the left with more wards in the background.  Members will notice that scaffolding is in place on all of this building in order to commence the construction of the cladding and the facade.  Someone passing by on the South Circular Road will see quite a lot of change in the very near future.  <\/p><p> I am now showing an image of the outpatient facilities in the north hot block.  Again, multiple levels have scaffolding in place and are ready for cladding.  <\/p><p> I am now showing the view from close to our offices in Rialto.  This view is from near the Rialto Luas stop, looking north into the hospital.  This will be part of the outpatients department.<\/p><p> While the concrete and steel frame is still under way, some of the mechanical and electrical service installation that has already happened can be seen in this photograph.  The lagged pipes on the left side of the image correspond to the steam room.  The fire protection, in the form of the sprinkler systems and other red-painted installations, is visible in the middle of the photograph.  Members will also notice lots of places for baskets and other cable trays for further mechanical and electrical installations that have to go in.  On the right of the picture one can see a large number of air handling units which have already been installed.  They will condition the environment and ventilate the system.<\/p><p> I am now showing basement car park level B1.  This is at an advanced stage of construction.  There is not much more to be done in this area other than securing it completely and weather-proofing it once the whole building is enclosed.  <\/p><p> In the centre of the photograph I am now showing members will see the cupola of the Royal Hospital, Kilmainham on the horizon.  This is the view through an area which forms the main street through the hospital.  There are buildings on the left and right.  That will remain but it will be covered by a roof and by other buildings on top.  <\/p><p> I have covered most of the areas.  I would like to make two more points.  Sustainability is a question that has come up in the past.  The energy performance of the building is an extremely important factor in the design of the new hospital.  We are targeting an \"excellent\" rating under the BRE environmental assessment method, BREEAM.  This is the highest rating we can seek to achieve.  That corresponds to a building energy rating, BER, of A3.  Achieving this will allow a 60% or 70% reduction in the energy consumed in children's hospitals.  These are large spaces that are expensive to heat.  <\/p><p> As Mr. Barry mentioned, the outpatient and urgent care centres at Connolly Hospital Blanchardstown are now delivering services.  This is making a positive impact on children's lives.  Almost 2,000 children have attended the urgent care centre and 1,000 outpatient appointments have taken place at the centre in Blanchardstown.  Again, the images do not adequately convey the scale and scope of what we are doing.  On behalf of the board, I invite the committee members to visit the hospital at their convenience.  We would be more than delighted to facilitate their visit.  I thank the members for their time and for allowing me to introduce myself.  I look forward to the discussion. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019112700002#R00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Gunning","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1574812800,"counter":396,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their time and for the presentation.

This project started at &euro;650 million and it has now reached &euro;1.733 billion.  At least five separate categories of additional cost risk have been discussed by this committee, namely, inflation, contractor claims, changes to regulations or taxes, design changes and delays.  All of those risks have potential cost implications.  I did not expect the Minister to update me on the absolute costs.  I fully understand that we do not know because these are moving targets.

I have a real concern that when this beautiful new facility is opened, because we do not have any more beds but a growing population the ratio of beds to children may go down.  In other words, the next time there is a virus outbreak, the emergency department will fill up and, again, the new children's hospital would have to start cancelling elective procedures, which would be a disaster.  One way that this is being dealt with in modern hospital design is to physically separate elective and non-elective care so that when the  emergency department must deal with an emergency, a major trauma incident or the outbreak of a virus that the elective and non-elective work is separate.<\/p><p>At Tallaght Hospital, the elective facilities that are being built are physically separate from non-elective facilities.

There was also consideration of developments in care and different and more efficient and effective ways of delivering care.  Although the bed numbers are not substantially different, they are based on calculated activity, which included looking at CSO projections for child populations well into the future, as well as an increase in day care beds.  Account was taken of the fact that an increasing proportion of children who have a day care procedure carried out will not need an extended inpatient admission.  In the past, such procedures might have required an inpatient bed.  There is provision for a day of surgery admission, DOSA, unit, whereby a well child, who is anticipated will have an inpatient stay, will be admitted on the day and not beforehand.  We are developing that within our current facilities and a dedicated DOSA reception unit will be built in the new children's hospital in addition to the 93 day care beds and the inpatient bed provision.<\/p> <p>  A matter in respect of which we have looked at international models, and which fits in with the Deputy's observations regarding Tallaght Hospital, is that there are two dedicated emergency theatres within our theatre provision.

On the inpatient ward population, we are separating specialist tertiary care from secondary general care.  Two wards will be used for high turnover rapid admission inpatient stay.  One of the major differences between paediatric and adult care is that many of the children we see are fundamentally healthy but have contracted an intercurrent illness which requires admission.  They recover quite quickly from the illness.  We have two wards dedicated to this high turnover patient population.  They will be very consultant intensive.  We have developed a general paediatric model which involves an expansion in general paediatric consultant workforce.  That is already under way.  This patient population would spread through other beds in the current hospitals, but it will be provided for in this dedicated intensive high-turnover acute-illness section of the new hospital.  In one way, that protects tertiary national beds and elective care beds.<\/p> <p>  We are also addressing the intensive care department.  One of the causes of cancelled procedures is the availability of intensive care beds.  As this will be the only intensive care unit in the country for children and young people, it has significantly greater capacity than is currently available, which will offer protection in that regard.  There are several initiatives within our planning that are different from the way we currently run services and will stop the cancelling of elective procedures due to emergencies.  We are separating the streams and working differently in the way we designate the need for beds, as well as bringing in initiatives around general paediatrics to ensure that specialist elective care continues at all times in spite of what are predictable peaks and falls in unplanned care.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019112700002#U00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Emma Curtis"},{"type":"speech","time":1574812800,"counter":445,"content":"<p>I thank the representatives for their attendance and the report which has been provided.

I am glad to see the Committee of Public Accounts monitoring the programme, but it has no function whatsoever in determining what money should be spent on any project until after it has been spent.  Its job is to review value for money in almost every area.  To do otherwise would be to interfere in Government policy, which no committee has the right to do.  In particular, the Committee of Public Accounts is statutorily excluded from doing so.  I say this as a reminder.  I do not wish to go into some of the things that have happened at the Committee of Public Accounts down the years, nor would it be appropriate to do so, but I did not approve of them.  Nor would anyone.<\/p> <p>  The purpose of the exercise is to build a modern hospital quickly in a way that gives good value for money, sticks to its contracts insofar as that is possible and, in the event of something inexplicable happening, having it explained.  It may just appear to be inexplicable, but there is usually a reason for everything.<\/p> <p>  Someone approached me before the project even started about a potential reduction in the cost.  This is a new topic, Chairman, given that everyone has been concentrating on increases.  This committee is taken up with them, as are others.  There was a suggestion that, if a road was closed or opened, contractors could use an internal road more effectively.  I brought that to the attention of those involved at the very beginning.  I am sure that the witnesses are aware of it.  I cannot recall the details off-hand, but it would have entailed the closing of a road for some time until a part of the project had been concluded, thereby eliminating the need to criss-cross public traffic.  I will leave that matter with the witnesses.<\/p> <p>  I am impressed with the work to date.  It is great to see a major engineering project of this nature.  It is long sought after and is very necessary for the provision of health services in the country.  We hope that it works well and that there is not an ongoing inquiry.<\/p><p>Lengthy tribunals do not serve us well in terms of service provision and they also do not encourage tenders for State projects.  This is a State project in respect of which there are strict rules which must be observed.  It should be borne in mind that continually dragging down the project is not conducive to good value for money or the delivery of the project.<\/p><p> It was mentioned that some elements of the project are not progressing as fast as people would have liked.

That is pretty unambiguous.

Unfortunately I have been a regular enough visitor over the last ten years and, as it turned out, I had the least sick child in the place, but it is just not acceptable.  This committee has to get the message out that it is unsustainable to have children in an accident and emergency department.  I was into my eighth hour by the time I gave up.

I also welcome the representatives of the Association of Irish Local Government AILG, the Local Authority Members Association, LAMA and anyone else who is tuning in.<\/p> <p>  I read the Minister of State's statement last night and there was nothing new in it.  I have a few questions.<\/p> <p>  The Moorhead report was commissioned in June 2018.  We are now heading into Christmas 2019.  It has been a long time and people are frustrated.  The Minister of State will be aware of this because I have seen the correspondence that has gone to him.  I passed correspondence on to the Minister of State from people of all parties and none in the matter.<\/p> <p>  To set the context straight here in this public meeting, councillors are on &euro;17,359; it is a pittance for the work they do.  The Minister of State himself started in the General Council of County Councils with me in 1999.  I know he is committed to local government.  This is not a dispute with the Minister of State, Deputy Phelan, whose hands are perhaps a little more tied than he wants to say.  The reality is the Government made a commitment in advance of the local elections, in which in excess of 900 councillors were elected, that we would address it.  I suppose I am asking the Minister of State what is the delay.  Has he seen additional drafts of this report in the past two or three months?  Can the Minister of State tell this committee whether he has seen any drafts of this recommendation?  Is there a reticence or reluctance on the part of Government to acknowledge the important work that county councillors do?<\/p> <p>  As I say, it is frustrating.  Members of all parties, including the Minister of State's own, are frustrated by the lack of progress.  I am trying to get confirmation.  What is the Minister of State's plan?<\/p> <p>  I have stated previously I believe city and county councillors should earn approximately &euro;30,000 - 50% of what Senators earn.  I believe their earnings should be linked to Senators and have said so previously.  I do not support decoupling county councillors from other politicians.  We are all politicians.  We are all elected.  We are all serving our communities and our constituents.<\/p> <p>  I will not dwell on it.  As I say, I do not doubt the Minister of State's commitment but it is time that we had clarification.  At this stage, where is this report?  When will it be published?  What is the process for publishing it?  I would also like the Minister of State to give a commitment that he will continue to engage with this committee, as he is doing today, on how we will progress it and to say what is happening.<\/p> <p>  Finally, I did not have an opportunity, because I left early to come here, to hear what was said on \"Morning Ireland\".  The Minister of State might enlighten us as to what he is talking about in relation to \"Morning Ireland\" and his commitment for additional or interim funding.  I simply do not know.  I came down the stairs today to be told that there was an announcement on \"Morning Ireland\".  The Minister of State might share that with the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019112700002#B00300","speaker":"1379"},{"type":"speech","time":1574812800,"counter":809,"content":"<p>I will take Deputy Cassells next.

Given that we were due to have this report at the end of the summer recess, if we could have clarity this morning that this process will be put to bed it would be welcome.<\/p> <p>  I welcome the clarification on \"Morning Ireland\" this morning.  As with all major announcements of significance in this country, such as the budget, the national development and all internal Committee of Public Accounts documents, it went on that programme first.  I welcome the \"Morning Ireland\" clarification.  If, perhaps, as Senator Boyhan said, we could get official clarification for the record of the Houses as to the standing, I would appreciate that.<\/p> <p>  I have a couple of questions.  Can the Minister of State confirm that the increase would cost &euro;7.5 million per annum?  Has the Minister discussed the cumulative amount with the Minister for Finance and has he committed to the process?  Has the Minister of State discussed it with the Taoiseach and has he committed to the process?<\/p> <p>  I refer to the discussions and the position of the AILG, representatives of which are in the Public Gallery and whom I welcome.  Has the Minister of State discussed it in terms of the indicative figure with the County and City Managers Association and local authority directors of finance in the context of future budgets?<\/p><p>Is it going to be a situation where this will be funded in the interim by the Exchequer or by internal financing?  Can the Minister confirm, in respect of his statement on committing to the back pay, that the increment that would be put forward would be backdated to the point of the election in 2019?  If the Minister's position is still the same, can he enlighten us on where that funding will come from on the basis that county council budgets for the current year, 2019, would have been put together in November 2018?  Councils which currently pay local representatives would not have adjudicated for such expenditure in the 2019 period.  Is it the case that such moneys due to councillors in 2019 would be met from central Exchequer funds?

This committee has a really good working relationship and we work in a very collegiate way.  I think we should continue that in all of our discussions, notwithstanding people's different points of view.<\/p><p>I thank the Minister of State for coming in.  Particularly for anybody watching this, it is important we put this discussion into some context.  We have been having conversations over the last year or so, both in this committee and with the Minister, in respect of some forthcoming legislation, about strengthening the powers of local government and increasing the responsibility of our local elected representatives, not just in terms of the directly elected mayors but in terms of some of the other structural reforms the Minister has been proposing.  At the same time, we all acknowledge that it is becoming increasingly difficult to attract as broad a spectrum of people into local politics as all of us would like.  One of the reasons, although it is not the only one, is the very limited financial remuneration for city and county councillors.  People from low-income families, mothers with children and people from a variety of backgrounds find it very difficult to take on the ever-growing responsibilities.  We have to acknowledge that and it is important the public knows that.<\/p><p>It is also important that we state again that city and county councillors do not get a full-time wage.  There are lots of people out there who think city and county councillors get a wage commensurate to some who work in the Houses, but that is not the case.  In fact, there are many local authority representatives who either make very little money or who lose money because of the cost they incur in doing the work.  That is particularly the case for county councillors from larger rural communities, and I say that as a Dublin Deputy and a former full-time councillor.  Our conversation here is about trying to look at ways of improving the throughput of talented and capable people into local government, particularly at a time when their responsibilities are growing, and we are looking to give them more power and responsibility.<\/p><p>The Minister of State is probably not going to be able to answer a lot of the questions because he is going to tell us that the report is being finalised and we will have to await the outcome of that.  In respect of the report by the journalist from the <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>on &quot;Morning Ireland&quot;, is it the case that the Minister of State is considering rolling this issue into broader public sector pay negotiations?  If that is the case, or if that is one of the options, can he talk us through what that would mean, what that could look like, who would be responsible for negotiating that and what the kind of timelines would be, because it is the first time I have heard that publicly and that is certainly a very significant bit of information?<\/p><p>Can the Minister of State give us a commitment in terms of the timeline of the publication of the report his Department has commissioned and a timeline for the period within which he is going to come back with formal recommendations?  One of the difficulties this committee has is that when the Government commissions a report, it takes a very long time to produce it.  It then sits with the Minister - I am sure the Minister and the officials work very hard on it - and there is a long period of time before any action is outlined.  I am looking for some timelines in respect of that.  As the Minister knows from my submission to the Moorehead review, we strongly favour a shift to full-time, paid city and county councillors.  We have made an interim proposal where there should be a kind of a two-grade payment for part-time and full-time councillors.<\/p><p>We are strongly of the view that all unvouched expenses should be abolished and replaced with a basic rate of pay for full-time and part-time councillors and a fully vouched system of expenses for additional cost of work, and we argued for that in the Oireachtas also.  I am hopeful the Minister of State will move somewhere in that direction.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019112700002#C01700","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1574812800,"counter":830,"content":"<p>I call Senator Conway.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019112700002#C01800","speaker":"1357"},{"type":"speech","time":1574812800,"counter":831,"content":"<p>The Minister of State is most welcome to the committee this morning.  This whole debate on councillors' remuneration has been going on for quite a long time, and I respect the fact an independent body has been set up which has already given an interim report, but not a final one.  As colleagues said, what we need here are clear timelines.  Obviously, the Minister of State is privy to an awful lot more information in terms of what may be contained in the final report than we are, but the whole narrative before the 2019 local elections was that there was an expectation in respect of councillors that this whole issue would be addressed, because the system that pertained between 2014 and 2019 was quite unsatisfactory.<\/p> <p>  There were electoral areas but particularly in rural Ireland that had ballooned.  The workload of councillors had, in some cases, quadrupled because town councils had been eliminated and the redrawing of boundaries had moved some electoral areas from being four-seaters or five-seaters to eight-seaters or nine-seaters.  There has been a recalibration there in recent times, and those areas have been reduced, but the workload has not been reduced.<\/p> <p>  The idea of a fair day's wages for a fair day's work is something we all want to see.  There is cross-party support for dealing with this issue.  While it is not popular in the media to increase the pay of politicians, whoever they are, most fair-minded people would accept that county councillors who are at the coalface dealing with issues on a daily basis are not earning a fair day's pay for a fair day's work.<\/p> <p>  In my nine years in this House, I have never been told by anyone from any side to pipe down.  It happened under the Vice Chairman's stewardship.  Usually when people say things off-the-cuff that they do not mean, they withdraw the remark.  It comes as a very great disappointment to me that that remark was not withdrawn.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019112700002#C01900","speaker":"1416"},{"type":"speech","time":1574812800,"counter":832,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Conway.

The Moorhead report has been in process for almost two years.  The Minister of State wrote to me on 6 November and said that he had not received the report and hoped to receive it shortly.  Following receipt of the report, he said he would liaise with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform before submitting the report to the Government for consideration and that it was his objective to publish it thereafter.  That could take a substantial amount of time.  What is the timeline involved?  Can the Minister of State give an indication about the pay, including what was mentioned in \"Morning Ireland\" this morning?  I believe councillors deserve a salary that is at least 50% of a Senator's salary, as was mentioned earlier.  The work they do is comparable to the work of a D&aacute;il Deputy albeit they might have smaller constituencies than Deputies.  However, their work on the ground is key to our democracy and they should be rewarded for it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019112700002#D00200","speaker":"1382"},{"type":"speech","time":1574812800,"counter":836,"content":"<p>I have a question about pension entitlements.

Section 37 of the Local Government Act 2001 states that the councillors shall be deemed to have resigned from membership of a local authority if they miss meetings for a period of six months.  In addition, they must attend 80% of the meetings to receive payment and expenses.  The obstacles to women are obvious and have affected all political parties and others.  I am aware that the Minister of State is interested in this, but can he give a commitment to having a discussion and tabling an amendment to the Local Government Act 2001?  Will he consult with the main parties, the Association of Irish Local Government, AILG, LAMA, the National Women's Council and so forth?

I might be repetitious but I will reply anyway.  I thank the members for their ongoing interest in this matter.  It has dragged on a little longer than anticipated over the past two years.  I would have expected to have the full report at this stage.  Senator Boyhan asked when it will be delivered.  I am told that it is being finalised and that I will have it in the next ten days or so.  It is now my intention to publish it when I receive it.  When I receive it I will have to engage with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, but at this stage the least I should do for the councillors is ensure that it is published once it is received.  I acknowledge what Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill said, which is that the process outlined a month ago could be very long.  I believe it should be published when I get it.<\/p> <p>  Senator Boyhan asked if I had seen a draft.  I saw one draft and I sent it back two months ago.  As to the parameters of the delay, I cannot outline the reasons but I expect to have it in the immediate future.  I am a little reticent about giving timeframes in light of the fact that I previously gave a timeframe that I expected to meet.  These things are outside my control.  Senator Boyhan also said that he does not support decoupling from Senators.  I do.  I believe all public servants, including councillors, should be treated the same and that, as Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill said, we should not be returning to councillors as a stand-alone item at any stage in the future.  They should be treated like every other public servant.  I have no problem giving a commitment that I will continue to engage.<\/p> <p>  I did not hear the radio programme this morning, but I received a report on it.  What was contained therein was a fair synopsis of all the speculation I have heard in the last few weeks.  However, as the final report has not been published I am not in a position to talk about final figures.  Deputy Cassells asked about a specific figure of &euro;7.5 million per annum.  Again, this was in the context of this morning's radio programme.  That may well be the figure from this morning's programme, but having not received the final report I cannot confirm or deny that figure.<\/p> <p>  I have discussed this with the Taoiseach.  In fact, it was the Taoiseach and I who decided that we need to do something in this area and that is why Ms Moorhead was appointed.  I have also discussed it with the Minister for Finance.  Both of them are committed and share my view that councillors should not be the worst paid people in the room among local authority staff, which is the current position.  Essentially, councillors work for the minimum wage and even slightly less in some cases.  That is why this group was established.  The proof of the pudding in respect of my colleagues and the Minister for Finance will come in the next stage of this process, but he has been very committed up to this point to ensuring that councillors are paid better than they are at present.<\/p> <p>  On the initial payment, having discussed it with the County and City Management Association my view is that the Government will have to provide the initial funding, particularly in light of the fact that many budgets are already finalised, but it will have to be built into local government funding thereafter.  Several members of the committee asked about that, including Deputy Cassells.<\/p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Broin is right that we have given extra powers not just to directly elected mayors, which is starting in Limerick, but also in respect of the rates alleviation measures.  I am not sure whether councils acted on them in the most recent budgets, but that power for them to reduce rates is now in place.  It is a new role that councillors did not have previously in terms of a targeted scheme built around their local area plans or county or city development plans.<\/p> <p>  One of the reasons it is difficult to attract people is certainly low pay.  I am aware of the Sinn F&eacute;in submission with regard to full-time and part-time councillors.  I do not agree with it.  I do not believe there should be two types of councillor.  We had that previously with regard to town councillors and county councillors and the issue of some areas having two ballot papers and others having one.  There is value in having a mix of people who are members of local authorities - people who are not just other public servants or people who are retired or who are students but also people who are in full-time employment and who wish to serve their local community.  They should be accommodated without being a second class.  I realise that is not the intention, but it might be the result of having a differentiation between full-time and part-time.<\/p> <p>  As regards publication, I will do it immediately upon receipt of the report, which should be in the next couple of weeks and well in advance of the new year.  Then there will be discussions with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  After that the people in the Department will decide on where the money comes from, what the rate will be and what the path will be.  There is a strong possibility that it will be part of the public sector pay talks which are due to commence next year.  However, that decision has not yet been made so I cannot comment further on it.  It will be part of the discussions I will have with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.<\/p> <p>  On Senator Conway's contribution, I commented on the timelines.  He is correct that the matter was discussed a great deal before the last local elections.  I gave commitments that it would be addressed and I am still determined that it will be.  I acknowledge that councillors are underpaid at present for the work they do and the amount of time that goes into the job.  I am committed to ensuring that whatever is in the report is implemented, but that will be a process of negotiation with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.<\/p><p>I know that I have the support of members here, and other members, in terms of those discussions that will take place in the near future.  Reference was made to a reduction in the size of the local electoral areas, which has helped councillors to be able to better serve their local communities.  I have always believed that local councillors should be local and that we would not have the monster electoral areas that were created in 2014.  It is correct to say that the issue is not popular but I too share the view that it should be a fair day's pay for a fair day's work.  It is my position, as I have stated previously and I will restate it here, that the expenses councillors generate in the pursuit of their work in terms of mileage, which are on the same rates as Oireachtas Members and other public and civil servants, should be retained.  That element of the job is not going to change.  Equally, there is an inherent value in the education and training budgets councillors get because they allow for an exchange of information and an opportunity for councillors to network and to learn from one another, and those funds facilitate that.<\/p><p> I assure Senator Mark Daly that I have not diverted from my view that this should be dated from the last local election.  It is a bit like boundaries when it comes to elections; there should be natural boundaries and elections are natural boundaries politically.  I have not moved from that.  Again, as I said at the outset, central government will have to pick up any increases or a substantial amount of them, but after that it will have to be built into the budgets of local authorities.  From my point of view, as I stated it from the start, the aim is very clearly to link it to public sector pay so that this never happens again and that there will not be politicians in the future deciding the pay of other politicians.  That should not happen.  It is the last vestige of that.  It should have been done when Oireachtas Members were linked to the public service.  A similar arrangement should have been introduced at that time rather than to Senators.<\/p><p> In response to Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill's question, I addressed the timeline.  He said that pay should be 50% of the pay of Senators.  I do not agree with that, but it should be substantially more than it is at present.  I have not received the report.  I expect to receive it very shortly and I will publish it immediately.<\/p><p> The change Senator Warfield referred to in relation to pensions is the reckonability of councillors' PRSI contributions towards their State pension.  As I understand it, and this is the position I will enter into in negotiations with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the pension gratuity system that existed up until the most recent election should remain.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019112700002#D00400","speaker":"1265","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1574812800,"counter":839,"content":"<p>We are very tight on time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019112700002#E00200","speaker":"1357"},{"type":"speech","time":1574812800,"counter":840,"content":"<p>I am almost finished.

The issue at the moment comes down to the fact that expenses cannot be claimed when they are not earned because people are unable to do their job because they are out on maternity leave and paternity leave.

We requested that the committee further consider legal aid as a stand-alone issue at its hearings on the reform of the family law system and are delighted that it will so do.  It is a fitting decision, given that FLAC has been campaigning for comprehensive legal aid and access to justice for 50 years.  My remarks will summarise the more detailed submission which has been furnished to the committee.<br\/><br\/>Access to justice is a process, a goal and a gateway to the exercise of other procedural and substantive rights.  Although it has no single precise definition, its core elements include effective access to legal information, early advice, representation, legal aid and the courts, as well as to a fair system of redress, effective remedies and just outcomes.  Access to justice is important for several reasons.  Most obviously, it enables individuals to know whether they have a claim and how to enforce it.  It has a far broader social value and is vital to social inclusion.  It has been FLAC&rsquo;s experience that people who are socially disadvantaged often experience legal problems accessing social welfare or housing or addressing unemployment or debt issues.  These issues often occur at the same time.  The greater the vulnerability, the greater the number of justiciable issues and the greater the extent of social exclusion.  Solving even one of these legal issues has a beneficial impact and may have a knock-on effect on other areas or may improve social inclusion.  In that regard, it does not make sense that the Legal Aid Board can represent a person in his or her family law case but cannot do so in a social welfare appeal or eviction case which may be going on at the same time in another court.  Research has identified that access to legal advice and assistance can improve people's health and well-being, while reducing pressure on healthcare services.  In the United Kingdom, access to justice is treated as a basic right and a vital element in social inclusion policies and id given a similar priority to health and education.  We would like that approach to be taken here.<br\/><br\/>It is also essential to democracy.  Laws made by the Oireachtas, such as the important new socially protective provisions contained in the Domestic Violence Act 2018 and the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform (Amendment) Act 2019, are only effective if they can be enforced.  It diminishes the democratic process if people do not know about the new laws and are not in a position to avail of the new rights provided.<br\/><br\/>Access to justice is essential to the rule of law.  By that, I mean ensuring that the Executive branch of government carries out its functions in accordance with the law.  In the course of its recent consideration of the issue of access to justice, the UK Supreme Court stated:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn order for the courts to perform that role, people must in principle have unimpeded access to them.  Without such access, laws are liable to become a dead letter, the work done by Parliament may be rendered nugatory, and the democratic election of ... Parliament may become a meaningless charade.  That is why the courts do not merely provide a public service like any other. <\/blockquote> <p>The most pervasive and intractable weakness of our civil justice system is that it only provides reasonable access to justice to individuals and bodies with very significant resources, the small minority of people who are able to get legal aid and the lucky people who are able to access &ldquo;no foal no fee&rdquo; arrangements with their lawyers.  This failing was exacerbated by the financial crisis which resulted in serious budget cuts to the Courts Service and an increase in the number of cases.  There is increasing awareness of the problem, however, and a growing consensus that major reform is required.  The Chief Justice has recently set out on a number of occasions the moral and economic arguments for broader and deeper legal aid.<br\/><br\/>The committee is asked to note certain matters for context.  First, there has been no national economic and social analysis of the impact of the failure to provide civil legal aid in certain areas or the potential cost savings that would be realised through introducing comprehensive access to justice.  Understanding the scale and nature of unmet legal need is vital for designing appropriate Government policy and targeting investment.  Second, the programme for Government contains a commitment to commission an annual study on court efficiency and sitting times, to be benchmarked against international standards and provide accurate measurements for improving access to justice.  An annual study providing accurate measurements would be an extremely important addition to our understanding of the problem.  Third, the President of the High Court, Mr. Justice Kelly, is undertaking a review of the administration of civil justice, which includes in its terms of reference the issue of access to justice.  It is expected to be completed shortly and should be of significant interest to the committee.<br\/><br\/>Ireland operates a common law adversarial system, which places a much greater burden of ascertaining facts and researching law on parties to litigation than is the case in a civil law system where the judge plays a far more inquisitorial role.  This increased burden on the parties in Ireland is relevant to looking at access to legal aid, access to the courts, provision for lay litigants and costs. <br\/><br\/>The recent EU justice scoreboard figures for expenditure as a percentage of GDP across the EU show that Ireland is among the lowest in terms of spend on the law courts system.  There is significantly lower expenditure on the courts system here than in civil law countries.  Ireland also came second last in terms of the number of judges per 100,000 inhabitants.  That may at least partly explains why expenditure by parties is considerably more in Ireland than would be the case under a civil law system.  Given that our system weighs so heavily on the parties, the Chief Justice has argued that a far higher percentage of GDP should be spent on the courts and legal aid.  There is a need to recognise and treat the Courts Service and the Legal Aid Board as being essential to the administration of justice and the rule of law and to resource them accordingly.<br\/><br\/>On the right to legal aid, it is 40 years since Josie Airey took on the might of the church and the State.  She held the State to account for its failure to provide her with legal aid in her High Court family law proceedings.  There is a right to legal aid under both the European Convention on Human Rights and the Constitution where it is necessary to ensure effective access to justice.  It is not an absolute right in all cases but the European Court of Human Rights has indicated that factors such as the importance of the issue, the complexity of the case, the capacity of the individual to represent himself or herself and his or her emotional involvement are of importance in deciding whether to grant legal aid.<br\/><br\/>The European Charter of Fundamental Rights also provides a directly applicable right to legal aid where it is necessary to achieve access to justice if a claim involves European law.  Huge swathes of socially protective law involve European law.  For example, almost all of our employment and anti-discrimination law has a European element.  European law is also present in some aspects of social welfare and in regard to homelessness, environmental law and privacy law.  This requisite assessment of need as set down by the European Court of Human Rights and the breadth of laws covered are not reflected in our legal aid system with its wholly inadequate funding, rigid and out-of-date means test, which requires one to have a disposable income of &euro;18,000 or less, its completely unrealistic accommodation and childcare allowances, its strictly-applied merits test and the exclusion of many areas of law that impact on vulnerable groups and individuals.  We have concerns that the method of delivery of legal aid through law centres does not allow for the targeting of services at particularly vulnerable groups or individuals such as those living in institutions or prisoners.  As the Legal Aid Board is, effectively, the largest family law practice in the State, it should be actively involved in education and research.<br\/><br\/>The current system of civil legal aid in Ireland was introduced in response to the Airey judgment 40 years ago but at the time, fell far short of what had been recommended in the Pringle report on civil legal aid and advice.  Although there have since been minor incremental changes, it has proven extraordinarily difficult to bring about substantive change to this restricted system or to convince the Government that it needs to invest significant increased resources in the legal aid system and the courts.  We hope that will change on foot of these meetings.  A root and branch review of the provision of civil legal aid is needed, to include an examination of the funding of the Legal Aid Board, the means test, allowances, fees, merits test and the exemptions of certain areas of law.<\/p><p>The review also needs to examine the method of delivery of legal services to ensure they are targeted at particularly vulnerable groups and individuals, along with the provision of strategic services for particular communities, as well as the capacity of the Legal Aid Board to engage in education and research.<br\/><br\/>Access to justice involves more than just access to legal aid and includes access to the courts.  We recommend court fees should be poverty and equality-proofed.  There should be provision for waivers for people on no or low income or in receipt of social welfare.  Our current court forms and procedures are archaic, dating back to the 1880s.  While there have been some amendments to them, they need to be reformed to be practical and accessible, including for lay litigants and people with disabilities.  I have provided in my written submission some examples of the complex and obscure procedures still in place.  Either the Law Reform Commission, LRC, or a broadly drawn group comprising relevant stakeholders such as the Courts Service, the human rights committees of the Law Society and the Bar, the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, the National Disability Authority, the Citizens Information board, the National Adult Literacy Agency, as well as relevant NGOS such as FLAC and disability NGOS, should be formed to consider the updating of the forms and procedures to ensure accessibility and clarity.<br\/><br\/>The courts system is predicated on the basis that people with be represented.  We all know a significant number of people try to represent themselves.  Our FLAC information line is contacted every day by people trying to navigate what they see as a complex system.  We recommend a widely drawn working group should be established to examine access to justice for litigants in person, which would draw up a report and action plan.  This has been done in the UK.  Any reforms of the administration of civil justice should factor in that many litigants will not be represented by lawyers.  The Courts Service should provide guides to administrative aspect of the courts, such as the listing system, call overs, hearing dates, how to address the court, as well as more accessible formats than just print.  The more detailed submission repeats the numerous recommendations contained in FLAC&rsquo;s submission to the review of the administration of civil justice regarding access to justice, particularly for people with disabilities.<br\/><br\/>Given the number of people who are comfortable with modern technology, the development of an online court service in appropriate cases with appropriate safeguards should be given consideration.  It has to be recognised, however, that it will need considerable investment.<br\/><br\/>The more detailed submission sets out the importance of public interest litigation and contains several recommendations.  Legislation should be introduced to permit the use of third party litigation funding and abolish the rules of champerty and maintenance.  The Supreme Court has said it is a matter for the Legislature to make provisions for third party funding.  Section 169 of the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015 should be amended to expressly include cases taken in the public interest.  Protective costs orders should be put on a legislative basis.  Legislation needs to be enacted to properly provide for multiparty actions or class actions.  The rules on standing should be liberalised and placed on a legislative basis if necessary.  The doctrine of mootness, which effectively means a court will not look at an issue if the case has been decided, should be relaxed, particularly in cases of public interest.  The State should not use strict confidentiality clauses that require parties to keep confidential the terms and the fact of the settlement.<br\/><br\/>The more detailed submission sets out the importance of and the development of <i>pro bono<\/i>legal practice.  It recommends the introduction of a public procurement model for public legal services requiring all legal services to sign up to a target of <i>pro bono<\/i>hours per year.  The review of education and training, which is being carried out by the Legal Services Regulatory Authority, LSRA, should have regard to the development of <i>pro bono<\/i>legal services, particularly in the training and educational needs of those involved in the provision of such services.  The development and encouragement of <i>pro bono<\/i>legal service could be examined by the authority.  While such work is valuable and needs to be encouraged, it is not the answer to a properly funded and resourced legal aid system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019112700002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Eilis Barry","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1574812800,"counter":895,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Barry.

I am accompanied by Mr. Ken Murphy, director general, and Mr. Stuart Gilhooly, former president and council member.  We come to this discussion with a strong understanding of how the courts are currently operating and how that impacts on solicitors' clients, many of them families and businesses seeking to resolve disputes and move on with their lives.<\/p> <p>  The committee is to be commended for focusing on the issue of access to justice.  Access to justice does not merely apply to access to the courts but also to legal advice and assistance in dealing with many other aspects of citizens' lives.  For example, it can involve how they interact with Departments and State agencies, as well as non-contentious work.  In that regard, solicitors play an essential role ensuring the rights of citizens are protected and defended when compared against the might of the State, as well as facilitating their contribution to the economic and social welfare of the State.<\/p> <p>  The committee has raised queries about competition in the legal sector and transparency in legal costs.  Approximately 11,500 practising certificates were issued by the Law Society this year, representing an all-time high.  This represents a substantial increase of approximately 64% on the 7,000 issued in 2005.  On the education front, we are inching towards 500 trainees at any one time.  Throughout the State, there are approximately 2,300 firms, 90% having ten or fewer solicitors, based in every county, city and town.  Trends that have, in recent years, shaped the competitive environment include changing consumer behaviour.  Consumers increasingly shop around and are happy to have several solicitors looking after various items.  The model of the family solicitor &ndash; the one-stop-shop &ndash; is being increasingly challenged.  As a consequence, we compete on what and how we offer, as well as price.  Close to 20% of the profession now works in-house, providing legal services only to their employer and not to the public.  While many work in the public sector, as well as large institutions and corporations, it is also the case that businesses have employed solicitors to handle legal work internally.  The implication of this is that firms are tendering more competitively for corporate work.  In turn, this is impacting positively on price and delivery for clients.<\/p> <p>  With the new LSRA in place, the option of limited liability partnerships is available to firms who are in partnerships.  We anticipate that this will lead to greater competition and innovation between firms, as it supports a greater appetite for growth and expansion of practices.  As of November 2019, no fewer than 4,000 new admissions from our three neighbouring jurisdictions &ndash; England and Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland - have occurred since 1 January 2016.<\/p><p>The Brexit bounce brings the total number currently on the roll of solicitors to 20,500.  Dublin boasts an increasingly international legal sector and a number of UK and international law firms have established here in recent years.  The legal market in Ireland has always welcomed competition.  Competition is good for the consumer and for the solicitor firms in finding new and innovative ways to deliver for their clients.<br\/><br\/>I will address the issue of transparency.  New and transformative provisions of the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015 commenced on 7 October 2019.  Along with new disciplinary and complaints mechanisms for consumers to avail of, the newly commenced provisions significantly strengthen consumer safeguards and transparency in respect of legal costs.  As a brief overview with regard to transparency, section 150 of the Act provides for: an indication of costs from the outset of a case, including the basis of those charges; an obligation to update clients on costs throughout the lifetime of a case or matter; a cooling-off period; and mediation on disputes about costs.  Failure to furnish this information to clients can result in the solicitors' costs being unrecoverable and it becoming a disciplinary matter.  The Act provides for the establishment of an office of legal costs adjudicators.  The data that will be assembled by the office of legal costs adjudicators through the public register of determinations, under section 140, as well as the criteria that will apply, will provide a valuable tool in ensuring the proportionality of fees, insights into the factors that inform fee levels and consumer guidance on legal fees.  The level of granularity of data in respect of cost headings and stages of proceedings derived from the revised bill of costs, the basis of the forthcoming register, will provide a benchmark to legal professions and to the public that will be much more predictable and transparent.<br\/><br\/>I will address future developments under two headings.  The first is multi-party and class actions.  The LRC in 2005 subjected this matter to considerable scrutiny and analysis.  At present, there are many examples of large numbers of virtually identical claims being issued in the District, Circuit and High Courts in consumer and competition litigation and product liability litigation contexts where the availability of a class action procedure would reduce costs for all parties and lead to more efficient use of court resources.  The LRC recommendations included that a formal procedural structure be set out and rules of court be introduced to deal with instances of multi-party litigation - it provided draft rules in the report - and that reform of current procedures to deal with multi-party litigation should be based on the three principles of procedural fairness for the plaintiff and defendant, procedural efficiency and access to justice.  In 2017, Sinn F&eacute;in prepared a multi-party actions Bill and this might provide some assistance in progressing the matter.<br\/><br\/>The second heading is a statutory form of third party litigation funding.  The Law Society's view is that the Oireachtas must consider a legislative framework to provide for third party funding.  Persona<b><i><\/i><\/b>and SPV Osus<b><i><\/i><\/b>are two recent Supreme Court decisions, which both called for a legislative response, as well as underlining the role that third party funding can play in access to justice.  Such reforms have been introduced in many similar common law jurisdictions and have proven effective in ensuring enhanced access to justice without the perceived downsides associated with US contingency fee models.<br\/><br\/>A discussion on fees is incomplete without discussing the determinants of fees.  Some of those are internal to the solicitor firm, such as rising staffing and operational costs as with any business, and some are external.  Key external determinants of legal fees are the delays and other inefficiencies in the courts system.  In the context of litigation, increased resourcing of the Courts Service would be a fundamental factor in ensuring that costs are avoided and minimised through leaner processes, adequate professional and support staffing and investment in technology.  With 0.2% of our GDP spent on Ireland's courts, as opposed to 0.4% in Germany and the UK, the society believes that investment by the State in the courts system must increase to reverse the cuts and impacts of the recession and to achieve long-term and enduring changes.  The society has a warm and constructive relationship with the Courts Service, which should be commended on how it delivers its service to the public considering its limited funding parameters.  The service is also going through a number of change programmes and is investing in technology.  Substantially increased use of technology is the key to the future and its introduction must be greatly accelerated.<br\/><br\/>Additional issues arise in the context of capacity.  Ireland continues to have one of the lowest numbers of judges <i>per capita<\/i>in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, OECD.  According to the European Commission, Ireland has one of the lowest proportions of second instance judges.  With 6%, Ireland is considerably below the international average of 22%.  While recent appointments are welcome, the courts remain significantly under-resourced, particularly the higher courts.<br\/><br\/>The availability of high-quality research assistance is a major factor in the efficient use of judicial time.  Increased capacity for legal research, case preparation and management and the drafting of memoranda, orders and judgments would deliver improved organisational capacity for the Courts Service and, ultimately, improve Ireland&rsquo;s standing as a forum for litigation.  The review of the administration of civil justice, chaired by the President of the High Court, Mr. Justice Peter Kelly, and of which Mr. Stuart Gilhooly is a member, is examining these capacity and efficiency issues and is close to final publication.<\/p><p>The society urges that the report's recommended measures that will improve efficiency and effectiveness should be progressed without delay.  <br\/><br\/>On the issue of capacity building, the society, along with the Bar, is excited about the Government-endorsed Brexit initiative for the legal sector.  The newly-appointed chairman, former Taoiseach, John Bruton, will lead a valuable infrastructure project that will benefit Ireland's citizens and businesses, as well as attracting additional dispute resolution work and other international legal work to Ireland.  With the right approach and investment, the return on this initiative may endure long beyond Brexit.<br\/><br\/>Our colleagues on the Legal Aid Board have provided an update on expenditure and activity levels in recent years.  We commend the excellent work the Legal Aid Board does, despite its underfunding by the State.  Our Constitution provides, implicitly, for access to legal aid for qualifying applicants on the basis that parties before the courts should be entitled to legal representation.  Accordingly, legal aid is mandated by the Constitution and primary legislation but it must be meaningful and effective, in terms of scope and access.  It must be fit for purpose.  The narrative on legal aid might lead some to conclude that the system is disproportionately costly.  When one considers EU data comparing expenditure on legal aid per head in member states, Ireland's expenditure is disappointingly lower than that of other EU member states, &euro;17.63 <i>per capita<\/i>, as opposed to for example, &euro;24.30 in Denmark and &euro;30.69 in England and Wales.  The willingness of lawyers to carry out legal aid work is necessary for legal aid delivery.  The terms on which legal aid is offered can lead to reluctance to take legal aid work, against the backdrop of increasing complexity of cases, rising overhead costs and the administrative burden of the system.  The rates payable, particularly for criminal law, are inadequate and borderline uneconomic.  The Legal Aid Board has an unenviable task, within the resources available to it, in delivering on its remit.  The society continues to advocate for more resources, improved streamlined systems and process and providing feedback on how the civil and criminal schemes are working.<br\/><br\/>It is the professional obligation of solicitors to seek the best outcomes for their clients under the law.  In pursuing that, the reasonable solicitor generally shows flexibility in terms of fees.  Many solicitors provide access to justice, support their clients on a &quot;no foal, no fee&quot; basis, on a <i>pro bono<\/i>basis, or with a <i>pro bono<\/i>element.  Most of us live in the communities we serve.  We build our practices based on the quality and integrity of our service.  It is therefore in the interests of the reasonable solicitor to charge proportionate and reasonable fees, and to provide transparency on those.  The level of legal fees is the product of negotiation and agreement between individual solicitors' firms and their clients in a highly competitive market of 2,300 firms.  Solicitors compete on specialised expertise, on specialised skills and on quality of service, as well as on the level of fees charged.  I hope these observations have been of interest to the committee and the delegation looks forward to engaging with it on them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019112700002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Michele O'Boyle","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1574812800,"counter":899,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to address it on a very important topic.  For any legal system to operate at its optimum level access to justice must be available to all.  Justice is a fundamental value that is important and essential to the lives of every citizen in a functioning democracy.  Members of the Law Library play what we consider to be a vital role in promoting and safeguarding the right to access to justice.  The principles that barristers are independent, owe an overriding duty to the administration of justice and that the interests of their clients must be and are defended fearlessly are at the heart of the independent referral bar and the regulatory framework that governs members of the Law Library.  All of those principles and rules are contained in our code of conduct and that code binds each member of the Law Library.  The code also contains what is known as the cab rank rule, which precludes members from refusing to take on a case based on their distaste for its nature, or that of the client, the client's conduct or opinions.  This rule plays a very important part and role in ensuring that all members of society have the ability to access the courts and justice with the benefit of expert legal advice and representation.  It means that the consumer, the client or the litigant has access to expert and experienced legal representation.<br\/><br\/>Members of the Bar provide their services through a variety of structures, on the basis of legal aid, on the basis of fees charged, <i>pro bono <\/i>and fourth, on a &quot;no foal, no fee&quot; basis.  I have made a detailed written submission which I know the committee will consider very carefully.  In this opening statement I will outline the headlines.  We have had the benefit of hearing from Ms Barry on behalf of FLAC and will hear from the Legal Aid Board in due course.  It is fair to say that we echo much of what Ms Barry had to say about the necessity for reform and improvement in the legal aid system. <br\/><br\/>I will address legal aid first.  Legal aid has long been recognised as vital to ensuring that a person's constitutional rights have access to the courts and to a fair hearing.  The availability of legal aid to those who cannot afford legal representation from their own means is an essential element of the administration of justice in a democratic society.  Many recipients of legal aid are among the most vulnerable members of our society and their access to the legal system must be supported and protected.  Through the participation of barristers in the provision of civil and criminal legal aid schemes, legally aided clients have the benefit of representation by barristers with experience and expertise.  Unfortunately, however, the civil legal aid system in Ireland is chronically under-resourced and significant additional resources are urgently required if a scheme is to provide meaningful access to justice to those most vulnerable members of our society on a long-term and sustainable basis.  <br\/><br\/>Ms Barry has referred to the need for improvements in the eligibility thresholds and the areas of law covered by the civil legal aid scheme and we share and endorse those views because they are necessary to ensure that the constitutional right of access is promoted and supported and secured through the civil legal aid scheme.  There is also evidence from the World Bank that there are considerable economic gains to be garnered from increased investment in legal aid.<\/p><p>We have dealt with how those economic benefits accrue through investment in the legal aid scheme in our detailed submission.  <br\/><br\/>We are anxious to emphasise that investment in the civil legal aid scheme should not be seen in isolation.  There is little point in investing in a civil legal aid scheme that ensures more individuals have access to a legal system if there are blockages further down the line within that system.  The civil legal aid scheme needs to be amended and improved but there also has to be investment in the court system.  Constricting budgets are making it harder for the courts to do their work.  A series of studies by the European Commission for the Efficiency of Justice, CEPEJ, illustrate how since 2010 Ireland's expenditure on its judicial system relative to GDP is consistently lower than that of neighbouring jurisdictions.<br\/><br\/>According to the Doing Business survey, conducted by the World Bank group for 2020, Ireland ranks 91st out of 190 countries in the category on ease of resolving a contractual dispute.  That is dealt with in detail in our submission but it appears to be the case that Ireland's low rank is largely attributable to its low scores for case management, court automation, and time.  Court automation is a function of the lack of investment in IT structures for the court system.  Case management and time are directly in respect of the ongoing shortage of judges.  <br\/><br\/>The shortage of judges means delays in the courts system and such delays are themselves an impairment on access to justice.  It is undoubtedly the case that a wide series of reforms is required so that timely and efficient access to justice can be secured by every citizen and litigant in the State.  We deal with those various reforms in our detailed submission.  We also welcome the upcoming publication of the administration of civil justice review, which was chaired Mr. Justice Peter Kelly, the President of the High Court, and in which the Bar Council participated.  That review and the recommendations in that report can only be given effect and generate benefits, which I know that this committee wishes to secure in the area of access to justice, if those recommendations are properly supported by funding from the Executive.<br\/><br\/>The second way in which the Bar provides its services is, of course, on a fees basis.  The council recognises that unduly high legal costs can constitute a barrier to access to justice.  Contrary to popular narrative, Ireland is not found to be a high-cost jurisdiction for legal costs.  According to the World Bank survey mentioned earlier, of the eight common law jurisdictions compared by the survey, Ireland has the fourth lowest lawyers' fees at 18.8% of the value of the claim, which is almost identical to the figure in Australia of 18.5%.  That survey also shows that the total cost of resolving a contractual dispute, to include lawyers' fees, court fees, and enforcement costs, is similar to that of Singapore, which is ranked first in the world for the total cost of resolving such a dispute.  The overall percentage costs in Ireland are 26.9% while it is 25.8% in Singapore.  It is also the case that the market for barrister services is more competitive than it has ever been.  This has led to considerable reductions in fees paid to most barristers.  One factor that has contributed to this reduction is the long-standing requirement introduced by the Bar unilaterally that on receiving instructions from a solicitor, a barrister must provide a written fee estimate to the solicitor.  That requirement is set out in our code of conduct and this obligation was reinforced by having been put on a statutory basis by section 150 of the Legal Service Regulation Act 2015.<br\/><br\/>That increased transparency and information provided to the consumer through solicitors will have, and has had, the inevitable effect of generating more competition among practitioners.  It allows consumers to be aware of the proposed fees and to negotiate accordingly.  That, in itself, inevitably has a downward pressure on legal fees.  <br\/><br\/>Those rules generally do not apply where legal services are provided to the State because in those circumstances, work is generally provided according to a fixed schedule or scale of fees unilaterally set by the State.  State bodies are the largest consumer of legal services in Ireland and in circumstances where work and services are provided to such bodies, there is little or no negotiation on fees on the part of counsel because fees are set by the State.  The high standard and low-cost representation secured by State bodies has been recognised by the Government in its 2018 spending review report on criminal legal aid.  <br\/><br\/>It should also be emphasised that similar to public and civil servants and other State contractors, severe cuts were applied to barristers' fees during the economic downturn.  Since 2008, cuts to professional fees have ranged in the order of 28.5% to 69%.  There has been no restoration of those fees in the intervening years.  These cuts impact directly on the question of access to justice that the committee is concerning itself with.  These fees make it unviable for many legal practitioners to continue to participate in State-funded schemes such as the civil and criminal legal aid schemes.  <br\/><br\/>On the criminal front, there is an emerging shortage of experienced junior barristers who can survive the early years of poor income from a criminal practice.  This should not be just of concern to the Bar Council and to barristers but should be of a wider societal concern.  If this is not addressed, it will mean that there will be fewer barristers to provide services to litigants, particularly in the criminal sphere, which will have a direct impact on their ability to access justice by way of mounting a proper defence.  This will have an adverse impact on the administrative of justice and on the public good.<br\/><br\/>Irrespective of the level of costs, there will always be individuals who simply cannot afford legal services from their own means.  In the absence of a proper and adequate system of legal aid that ensures their right of access to the courts, members of the Law Library, along with organisations such as FLAC and community law centres such as Community Law and Mediation, strive to fill that gap by providing their services either on a <i>pro bono<\/i>basis or, in some instances on a no foal, no fee basis.<br\/><br\/>Some 82% of the members of the Law Library undertake <i>pro bono<\/i>legal work.  The voluntary assistance scheme is the formal<i>pro bono<\/i>scheme of the Bar of Ireland, which makes the full range of barrister services available directly to charities, NGOs, and civic society groups on an entirely <i>pro bono<\/i>basis.  The details of that scheme are contained in our submission.  Members of the Law Library also provide voluntary legal assistance to a number of community outreach projects that operate outside of the Bar, such as the Community Law and Mediation centres.<br\/><br\/>In appropriate cases that are not covered by the civil or criminal legal aid schemes, a barrister may be willing to take on an individual client case on a no foal, no fee basis.  This means that a barrister will not be paid unless his or her client is successful in the proceedings.  This is, in effect, a free legal aid scheme operated by barristers at their own risk.  It provides many people with access to the courts where they would not otherwise have such access.  The importance of the no foal, no fee structure and system has been highlighted by FLAC and independent law centres such as Community Law and Mediation in circumstances where there is no comprehensive civil legal aid system in the State.  The no foal, no fee structure is frequently applied in constitutional and public interest litigation and the availability of such services has unquestionably benefited the recognition, protection, and vindication of constitutional rights of individuals, including the right of access to the courts.  Many of the landmark cases in the constitutional sphere have been brought on a no foal, no fee basis. <i>Pro bono<\/i>and no foal, no fee work play an essential role in ensuring access to justice but I emphasise that they should not replace an adequate legal aid system.<br\/><br\/>We are grateful for the opportunity to address the committee on these important topics.<\/p><p>We are obviously available to answer any questions members of the committee may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019112700002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Conor Dignam","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1574812800,"counter":902,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Dignam, who spoke on behalf of the Bar Council.

The Irish civil legal aid system has been in place for almost 40 years.  It was put on a statutory footing with the enactment of the Civil Legal Aid Act 1995.  The Act obliges the Legal Aid Board to provide legal aid and advice in civil cases to persons who satisfy the requirements of the legislation.  It also requires the board to provide a family mediation service.  The board furthermore administers a number of criminal legal aid related schemes in anticipation of legislation to transfer responsibility to the board for the administration of the main criminal legal aid scheme.<\/p> <p>  In order to provide civil legal services, we use a mixed model of service.  We have 30 law centres and two specialist offices, all staffed with solicitors, while we refer out certain cases to private solicitors on a fee-per-case basis.  Last year, we provided or facilitated legal services to approximately 18,400 new clients.  Most of those will have received or be receiving an ongoing service.  The majority will have involved legal representation in court, and many of those matters will be time consuming and often demanding cases.  In 2018, approximately 71% of those who sought legal services from the board did so in relation to a family matter, just over 10% in relation to international protection, just under 10% on foot of the Abhaile scheme and 9% in relation to general civil matters.  I have set out the level of demand in recent years for legal services from the board in the first appendix in my statement.<\/p> <p>  The civil legal aid system in Ireland is relatively speaking compared with other jurisdictions quite broad scope-wise.  All civil matters are within the scope of the system unless specifically excluded, unlike in some other jurisdictions, notably England and Wales, which take the approach that all matters are excluded unless they are specifically included.  The main case types that are excluded are defamation, small claims, disputes concerning rights and interests in or over land, licensing and conveyancing.  Representative actions and group litigation are effectively excluded also.  There are some exceptions to the exclusions.<\/p> <p>  One aspect of our legal aid system is that legal aid, that is, representation, can only be provided for cases before the District Court, the Circuit Court, the High Court, the Court of Appeal, the Supreme Court, the Coroner&rsquo;s Court and any court or tribunal that is prescribed on foot of the legislation.  It is a matter for the Minister for Justice and Equality to prescribe any tribunal or court, and he or she must have the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to do so.  To date, the only tribunal that has been so prescribed is the International Protection Appeals Tribunal and its predecessor, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.  Legal aid is thus not available for cases before the likes of the Workplace Relations Commission.<\/p> <p>  In terms of comparison with other common law jurisdictions, the scope of civil legal aid in Ireland is very similar to Scotland and Northern Ireland, where the legislation operates on the same principles and with many of the same exclusions.  England and Wales have effectively excluded most private family law disputes since the passing of legislation in 2012.  According to the latest available Family Court Statistics Quarterly, published by the UK Ministry for Justice, the number of private family law cases where neither party is represented increased from 12% in January 2012 to 39% as of June 2019.  Most Australian and Canadian jurisdictions do not fund, or only fund to a very limited extent, money damages cases, for example, tort and contract cases, while in Ireland these cases come within scope.  In many European Union member states, other than the United Kingdom, Malta and Cyprus, the legal environment and rules are very different, and in some jurisdictions and courts, legal representation is compulsory.  This makes comparing the provision of legal aid in such jurisdictions with our own very difficult.<\/p> <p>  Our financial eligibility criteria for legal aid are laid down in some detail in the legal aid regulations that have been passed between 1996 and 2017.  Broadly, the regulations provide that a person&rsquo;s disposable income must be below &euro;18,000 per annum.  Disposable income is assessed by taking gross income and deducting certain allowances.  A person&rsquo;s disposable capital assets must be below &euro;100,000.  The person&rsquo;s home, if he or she is a homeowner, is not assessed as a capital asset for the purpose of the regulations.  I have set out in the table in the second appendix the income and capital thresholds for a number of other common law jurisdictions.  Allowances differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and so the thresholds may not be directly comparable.  Research work that we did back in 2009 indicated that approximately 50% of the population was eligible for legal aid.  We updated the research a couple of years ago using 2015 data and the finding was that eligibility was in the region of 46%.  <\/p> <p>  It is common case that the rules of civil procedure in Ireland need updating, and I doubt that I can add anything to what the review group, chaired by Mr. Justice Peter Kelly, is likely to recommend.  However, as I have alluded to, most of the work we do is in the area of family law, which is an area that Mr. Justice Kelly&rsquo;s review group will not address.  I strongly believe there is scope for reform of the family justice system.  I wholly endorse the recent report of this committee in relation to that system, and our chairperson has publicly expressed endorsement on behalf of our organisation.  We have worked with senior officials in the Department of Justice and Equality to progress the heads of a family courts Bill, which I am aware is just one reform aspect but it is a really important one.  Our commitment to reform in this area is about pursuing better experiences and outcomes for persons going through a relationship breakdown, but it is also about having a more efficient system and thus being able to use our resources more efficiently.  I echo the comments that have already been made by other contributors on that particular issue.<\/p> <p>  We have waiting times at our law centres, and it is always a concern of both the statutory board and my own to try to manage those as best we can.  It is worth noting that approximately 57% of those who seek legal services from us will get an immediate or near-immediate service.  We will always prioritise certain case types, including domestic violence cases and cases involving Tusla, where we are representing parents whose children are the subject of applications to be taken into care or under supervision.  Most of those looking for legal services for a remedy in the District Family Court will be granted legal aid swiftly.  Legal services on foot of the Abhaile scheme are effectively immediate.  I am noting this not in any way to diminish concerns about waiting times.<\/p> <p>  In terms of impediments to improving the promptness of services to those who are waiting, one particular challenge at the moment is solicitor recruitment.  We are limited to offering new recruits the first point on the pay scale.  A number of other public bodies have been able to obtain flexibility within their scales in terms of what they can offer, but to date we have not been able to get that flexibility.  A solicitor recently left us to go to another public sector body, anecdotally on the basis that he was going to be paid &euro;15,000 per annum more.  It is an ongoing issue to persuade the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, and we are being supported by our own Department in this regard.<\/p> <p>  We refer work to private solicitors on a fee-per-case basis.  The fees require the approval of our own Minister and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  As an organisation that works on a closed budget basis, we have to strike a balance between maximising the number of cases that we can refer to private solicitors while at the same time ensuring that the fees payable attract enough solicitors to do the work.  I doubt that many would argue that the Irish legal system is lay litigant friendly, though one qualification I would put on this is that it is notably friendlier in the District Family Court in Dublin.  Situations like repossession lists are clearly difficult places for persons who do not have legal representation.  On foot of the Abhaile scheme, we now have a duty solicitor service in county registrar&rsquo;s possession courts, which the  board facilitates and organises, and which may allow what would be lay litigants to get some level of legal assistance on the day of the court.<\/p> <p>  On the subject of class actions, I would urge that considerable attention is paid to any legal aid aspect that might be contemplated for such actions, as this could require a significant rethink in terms of the legal aid system.  While it may be somewhat tangential, there are proceedings in being on behalf of a company limited by guarantee against the board where the company is seeking legal aid for the purpose of other litigation relating to the environment.  I do not propose to comment on the other issues raised in the appendix to the committee&rsquo;s invitation, though we would welcome members' questions on those issues or on any other matter on which we can usefully contribute.  I thank the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019112700002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McDaid"},{"type":"speech","time":1574812800,"counter":904,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McDaid who spoke on behalf of the Legal Aid Board.

I agree with Deputy Connolly.  I have said before publicly that we are very good as a Legislature and we pass very good legislation in this country, but we are not so good at putting the resources in place to deal with the legislation.  The Legal Aid Board is the recipient of change without necessarily having the extra resources to deal with it.  When I came into the Legal Aid Board in 2011, we had waiting lists of 5,000 people.  We spent a lot of time working on those waiting lists and over the years, even up to last year, we were reducing the number on a consistent yearly basis down to approximately 1,600.  This year, it is going back up again because of the issue Mr. McDaid raised earlier about recruitment and resources.  As I said publicly - I have said it before - we are not sufficiently resourced in terms of the type of outreach work that we could or would like to do.  As Ms Barry said, we are probably the biggest family law practice in the country and the biggest childcare practice in the country.

I know there are representative bodies present and they are obliged in many respects to represent the interests of their members, but let us put the person at the centre of this discussion.<\/p> <p>  I will focus first on the criminal context because the State seems to play a greater role in criminal law than it does in civil law.

When one looks at a person who wants to access justice in the area of crime, one has a victim of crime who will go to the police and then a file will be sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions for the prosecution of the case.  Then one will have an accused person who will want to be represented.  I know there are issues about the amount of moneys that are paid, but leaving that aside, from the point of view of the victim of crime and the person accused of the criminal offence, are they being provided with effective access and protection in the justice system?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019112700002#M02700","speaker":"1296"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1574812800,"counter":1029,"content":"<p>My expertise is not primarily in crime.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019112700002#M02800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; hUallach&aacute;in"},{"type":"speech","time":1574812800,"counter":1030,"content":"<p>I beg Mr. O hUallach&aacute;in's pardon.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019112700002#M02900","speaker":"1296"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1574812800,"counter":1031,"content":"<p>I think within the resources that are there, lawyers, be they solicitors or barristers, do the best they can.  There is an ongoing debate, as Deputy Connolly indicated, about how victims are dealt with.  Whether it is civil legal aid or the criminal legal aid, there are deficits in provision.  While budgets alone do not resolve it, one does need enhanced resources.<\/p><p>I certainly think there is room for significant improvement in staffing and proper victim support or resource people.  Other agencies might be more familiar with this than I would be, but I certainly think there is room for significant improvement.  In respect of the Bar's involvement, as Mr. Dignam outlined in our opening and as outlined in our submission, there is an acute problem building up where we find that up to 70% of those practitioners who start out in criminal law are gone by year six.  That is primarily down to what Mr. Ken Murphy called borderline economic pay rates.  In the future, that probably also will be reflected in criminal legal aid solicitors but there is an emerging problem there and that is not just a problem for the Bar.  It is a problem for the Bar at the moment.  We have young members who are desperately keen to work in that area, who have a vocational commitment to it, who have trained up for it and who would love to stay in it.  It is just not economically viable, however.  That is something that will rebound on not only the accused they are representing but possibly even also the victims, because the whole process will slow down, albeit perhaps not to a standstill.  It may not happen tomorrow but if this trend continues, we will find we do not have adequate solicitors and certainly not adequate counsel to represent people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019112700002#M03000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; hUallach&aacute;in","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1574812800,"counter":1033,"content":"<p>Does Mr. Murphy want to come in?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019112700002#N00200","speaker":"1296"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1574812800,"counter":1034,"content":"<p>I note Deputy O'Callaghan mentioned the conflation at times of clients and lawyers and this may be a problem because those who are accused of crimes tend to be unpopular figures in society.  Various Ministers have said to me over the years that there are no votes in giving more money to criminal legal aid.  If the Chairman will permit me a slight moment of levity, it makes a point.  Many years ago, a survey was carried out by our counterpart organisation, the Law Society of England and Wales, about public attitudes to the funding of the criminal legal aid system.  It was a full professional survey and the question essentially was whether people who are accused of serious crimes and who have no financial capacity to defend themselves should be provided with a legal solicitor or barrister to represent them and defend their interests at the expense of the taxpayer.  The answer, properly analysed, was the public felt yes such a person should, if he or she was innocent.  I am making the point somewhat ironically but it shows that there is a degree of ambivalence in the public mind about the funding of criminal legal aid and one only has to listen to a radio phone-in programme on this topic and there is criticism of it.<\/p> <p>  While I take the point Deputy Connolly made about having a healthy democracy and an independent and strong Judiciary and what these measure in society, I would like to emphasise criminal legal aid a little and echo what has been said by the Bar, which is there is a real problem at the moment with the funding of criminal legal aid.  The Law Society in its submission read out by the president a few moments ago, has a phrase we have used in submissions to Government.  The phrase we have chosen is, \"borderline uneconomic for the provision of criminal legal aid\".  The firms that specialise in it and the firms that do a certain amount of it are just simply questioning whether they can continue to do so.  In neighbouring jurisdictions, like we have seen in England and Wales, there are now parts of the country where a far more generously funded criminal legal aid system is also becoming borderline uneconomic for certain providers such that the phrase that is used is \"legal aid deserts\".  There are big geographical areas in England and Wales where no solicitor participates in criminal legal aid because of the funding issue.<\/p> <p>  Again, the Law Society has explained the consequences of the cuts that took place.  We accepted the cuts that took place at the time of economic crisis in the State.  In 2009, 2010 and 2011, I sat in meetings with the then Minister for Justice and Equality, Alan Shatter, and he explained the public finances and the need for the cuts.  We did not protest the cuts, which were quite severe, and much more severe in the criminal legal aid system than in many other areas of State services.  The figure we said was 26% but in fact, calculated in different ways it could be measured as being up to 40% and the Bar had other figures.  Those were really severe cuts.  There has been absolutely no restoration.  While the State has restored funding to many areas where there were cuts during the economic crisis, there has been no restoration here.  The Law Society has made representations to the then Minister for Justice and Equality, Frances Fitzgerald, and the current Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan.  There is sympathy for the case that is made.  There is recognition that it is becoming uneconomic.  I am looking at the public interest and not the interest of the profession in this regard if lawyers cease to practice in this area.  The people who do a lot of legal aid in the solicitors' firms cannot retain staff.  They are transferring to other areas where they are paid better with better lifestyles, instead of going out in the middle of the night to Garda stations and spending endless hours there,  They also spend endless hours, for example, on another feature nowadays, which is the review of CCTV.  Hours and hours of CCTV have to be reviewed by the solicitor as part of his or her preparation of the case.  That is not funded or paid.  It is a rate per case and there is no funding of that.<\/p> <p>  I will just finish on this point.  In the neighbouring jurisdiction of England and Wales, they have been able to document one consequence of this, which is the age of the cohort of the profession that provide criminal legal aid is increasing all the time.  I think they said 49 years old is the average age in England and Wales.  We have not done that research here but it is because young lawyers are not going into this work or, if they go into it, are not staying in this work.  That has consequences for the future of the entire scheme and we believe that unless there is funding and the capacity to address funding of the scheme and to make it economic again for solicitors to provide it, there will be long-term problems in the delivery of criminal legal aid in this country, which is one of the measures of our status as a democracy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019112700002#N00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ken Murphy"},{"type":"speech","time":1574812800,"counter":1035,"content":"<p>What the witnesses are both saying is that the failure to adequately fund the criminal legal aid system will have an impact on access to justice for individuals.

There is too much control by the parties themselves of the litigation.  The State needs to play a much greater role in determining when a case will be heard, expediting it, having procedures to strike it out at an early stage if it is evident it will not win and just taking more control of it, as opposed to the present situation whereby the parties probably have too much control as to how the case meanders down the road.

We live in a digital age.  We have a well-developed website that people can access and that has an awful lot of information on it.  It is a detailed website that sets out clearly the fact that we do not just cover family law.  There is sometimes a perception out there that we only cover family law.  In my law centre in Limerick, according to a quick analysis of the cases we have on hand, approximately 55% are separations or divorces; one eighth are other family law matters; another eighth are non-family law matters, which are quite extensive, ranging from probate cases to landlord and tenant matters to injunctions and lots of other issues before the courts; and a further 20% are childcare cases.  We cover a wide range.  My message as manager in Limerick, and I think many of the managers in the law centres have the same message, is that people should be encouraged to make the application.  People will often ring and ask whether something is covered.  It may require a lot of detailed analysis on our part to see whether it is covered under the scheme.  I am not making an apology for the matters that are not covered, and I accept the points made by Ms Barry and others about certain matters that are outside of our scope, but there are certainly an awful lot of matters within our scope and that the public are not aware of at times.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019112700002#O01700","nonspeaker":"Ms Catherine Ryan"},{"type":"speech","time":1574812800,"counter":1060,"content":"<p>Before I turn to Deputy Pringle, and in case I lose any more members, I wish to offer an invitation.

It requires financial resources and buildings.  This committee has dealt at length with the family law issue and the crying need for the Hammond Lane building, for example.  When we deal with Dublin, resources outside of that must be addressed.  All of the agencies here and the others that will come before the committee in due course have a role in this regard and we can act as catalysts in the way that we deal with our own client base and how we interact with the Legal Aid Board.  This agency is often engaged in firefighting and trying to control a situation.  We need to note that in the public interest.  If anything is to come out of the deliberations of this committee on legal aid, I hope it would be that there is a crying need for far greater investment.  Mr. Ken Murphy has already adverted to the World Bank and International Bar Association survey, and that there are other downstream economic benefits from legal aid.

We provide a more detailed submission with our statement.  On pages 29 and 30, we have set out the recommendations we have made to the Review of the Administration of Civil Justice in regard to people with disabilities.  There are quite a number of recommendations, from engaging in routine data gathering and monitoring, accessibility of the physical space and what the Courts Service needs to do to provide for people with disabilities.  We have recommended that an access officer be made available to assist people with disabilities and that court documentation needs to be in an accessible format, which it is not at present.  We recommend that Wi-Fi needs to be available in all courtrooms, the Courts Service needs to work with people to improve accessibility, the website needs to undergo periodic accessibility testing for people with disabilities and all legal documents need to be available in accessible formats.<\/p> <p>  Ms Malone works with PILA, the Public Interest Law Alliance.  Through PILA, Robbie Sinnott was involved in High Court proceedings seeking access to a secret ballot.  Throughout the hearing, which lasted in excess of ten days, PILA had to attend the court simply to provide support to Mr. Sinnott, who has a visual impairment, to get around the court system.  There is no proper provision for people with disabilities to access the court services.  He was being cross-examined during the hearing with regard to documents that he could not access, and there were huge delays in getting documents from the State in a format he could access.  They are very basic steps that need to be taken.<\/p> <p>  It is important to remind the committee that both the Courts Service and the Legal Aid Board are under a statutory obligation to promote equality under the public sector duty under section 42 of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act.  They are obliged to have regard to the needs of people with disabilities and to look at what steps they can take to improve accessibility for people with disabilities in the courts.  I hope the review of civil justice will look at people with disabilities in particular and will take on board some of our recommendations.<\/p> <p>  In regard to online services, people with disabilities may find it easier to access an online court.  We had a conference in May, where Lord Briggs, who was involved in a report on online courts in the UK, came over and, together with Andrea Coomber, gave a practical demonstration of how an online court would work.  I have to say I was amazed at how easy it was in practice.  It would be easier than booking a Ryanair flight, which can be difficult enough, and I was shocked by how easy it was.  It is time to look at that.  Obviously, there would have to be safeguards.  Ms Ryan referred to how the board's website is accessible.  It has to be recognised that many people who come to FLAC would have literacy and language problems, and would not find websites or online services accessible.  However, it is a resource that is there.  There is quite a cohort of people who are at ease with using technology, so it is something that needs to be examined.  Having said that, the Courts Service as it stands, if it was to look to introduce an online court, would have to cut back on its other services.  While we certainly recommend this, it would have to be properly resourced.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019112700002#Q00800","nonspeaker":"Ms Eilis Barry"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1574812800,"counter":1092,"content":"<p>Virtually all of our offices are disability-compliant and we would make sure that any new premises we are taking are compliant with the disability legislation.

We have a disability liaison officer and an access officer.  Plain English is something we are committed to, although we can certainly do better than we are at the moment.<\/p> <p>  Ms Barry's point on section 42 is well made and it is something we are reflecting on.

I refer to the facilitation or encouragement of mass claims against the State in public health situations, for example.  We have had obviously controversies and scandals and the requirement of each individual who might believe they have a claim arising out of the way in which a public health scheme has operated and the damage they felt may have been caused to them through negligence having to prove their individual case cannot be real justice.  We believe there should be a better system.

True comparatives are probably to be found between the Irish system and other common law jurisdictions.  The inquisitorial civil law system is much more judge-heavy, because the role played by the judge is much more proactive than it is in the common law system.  The point was made that the burden on the parties is much greater in our system.  I do not know if those figures were complied before the increase in the number of judges in the Court of Appeal, which we welcome.  I remember then Chief Justice, Mrs. Justice Susan Denham, constantly referring to statistics, which I do not have to hand.  She had statistics on the ratio of judges per head of population in Ireland compared to civil law and common law jurisdictions all over the world and it seemed to be very low.  I often say the judge is in many respects the cheapest part of the whole system.  Courthouses, staffing, infrastructure and technology could well be more expensive, and I think it is a false economy on behalf of the State not to appoint more judges, because there are economic consequences to delays in the justice system affecting \"Ireland Inc.\" - the econony - quite apart from individual citizens and their entitlement to speedy access to justice.  I have never fully understood the rationale of the State in underfunding judicial appointment levels, except possibly that creating more appointments would require more courtrooms and more infrastructure.  We need that anyway.<\/p> <p>  Certainly, in the context of the joint Bar Council of Ireland and Law Society initiative, which has full Government backing, seeking to attract international legal business to Ireland, we cannot continue to operate with delays in our court system and expect to compete in this contested space internationally with other jurisdictions looking for a Brexit dividend as well.

I am accompanied today by my colleagues, Eddie Forsyth, principal officer with overall administrative responsibility for the fund, and Fiona Creegan, assistant principal officer, also with responsibility for fund administration.<\/p> <p>  The Department of Rural and Community Development was tasked with implementation of the fund in 2018.  The objectives of the fund are a good fit with the mission of our Department, which is to promote rural and community development and to support vibrant, inclusive and sustainable communities throughout the country.  In fulfilling this mission, the Department assists communities by providing the right supports and conditions to encourage economic and social development in their areas.  The rural fund is only one such support and it is complemented by a wide range of additional programmes and schemes which help to maintain the growth and vitality of rural areas and which support individuals and organisations to meet the needs of their communities.<\/p> <p>  Our mission has been further aided by the strategic focus and investment provided through Project Ireland 2040.  The investment delivered under Project Ireland 2040 has enabled the Department to increase significantly the level of funding support available under the range of schemes and programmes that we operate, from the roll-out of the rural fund to capital investment in our libraries.  Project Ireland 2040 also rightfully identifies the strengthening of rural economies and communities as one of the ten strategic priorities at the heart of planning and investment decisions which will be made across Government over the coming years.  The Department is proud to take the lead in achieving progress on this goal.  One of the key ways we will achieve this is to ensure that future growth is balanced and that all parts of the country share in prosperity, and we endeavour to do this in a sustainable way.  The goal of strengthening rural economies and communities is complemented by the other strategic priorities identified under Project Ireland 2040.<\/p> <p>  The overall large-scale investment set out in Project Ireland 2040 is calibrated to deliver upon these priorities over the lifetime of the plan.  Specific support for key priorities is provided through the four funds established under Project Ireland 2040.  These are the &euro;500 million disruptive technologies innovation fund, the &euro;2 billion urban regeneration and development fund, the &euro;500 million climate action fund and the rural regeneration and development fund we are here to discuss today.<\/p> <p>  As part of Project Ireland 2040, an additional &euro;1 billion was provided to the rural regeneration and development fund over the period 2019 to 2027.  The purpose of the fund is to provide investment to support rural renewal, strengthen and build resilience in rural communities and assist in the regeneration and sustainable growth of rural towns and villages.  Since the fund's establishment, the guidelines relating to eligibility have remained relatively unchanged.  The fund focuses on all settlements and rural areas with fewer than 10,000 people located outside the five city areas.  Rural towns with a population of more than 10,000 people are eligible to apply under the urban fund.  Certain towns with fewer than 10,000 people but with more than 2,500 jobs and which function as significant centres of employment may also be eligible under the urban fund but no individual project can apply for both funds.<\/p><p>For the purposes of compliance with public financial procedures, the lead party for an application to the fund must be a State-funded body.  This is defined as body established by central government or with central government approval, which receives a portion of its funding from the State.  This covers local authorities, LEADER local action groups, State agencies and so on.  Community organisations and voluntary groups, private sector interests or philanthropists cannot act as the lead party to an application but can and do partner with appropriate State-funded bodies to access the fund.<\/p><p> Calls under the fund seek applications in respect of category 1 or category 2 proposals.  Category 1 relates to proposals for capital projects which are fully compliant with planning and consent and are ready to commence.  Category 2 relates to projects which require development support to become ready for full category 1 status.  As the fund seeks to support projects of sufficient scale and ambition to make a significant contribution to the objectives of Project Ireland 2040, the minimum funding request for category 1 projects is &euro;500,000, with no maximum funding specified.  There is no minimum or maximum funding request under category 2.<\/p><p> In order to successfully unlock funding, the rules of the fund require matching contributions to be put forward by applicants.  The fund will provide up to 75% of the total project cost with at least 25% to be provided in matching contributions by the applicants.  A minimum of 10% of matching contributions must be in cash.  A higher maximum contribution from the fund of 80% funding is permissible in certain circumstances.  Matched funding may be in the form of a combination of wider Exchequer or State sector expenditure, local authority investment, community investment, philanthropic contributions, private sector investment or other asset contributions.  Funds secured from our existing programmes are not eligible to be used as matched funding.<\/p><p> Calls for applications under the fund are made on a competitive basis.  The applications are assessed based on their alignment with the objectives of Project Ireland 2040 and the fund.  In order to meet the objectives of the fund, proposals need to demonstrate several qualities.  These include the capacity to deliver on key strategies, such as Project Ireland 2040, county development plans, local economic and development plans or forthcoming regional spatial and economic strategies; collaboration between key stakeholders in the area or sector concerned and the endorsement of key stakeholders, such as the relevant authority or agency in the area or sector concerned; sustainability, that is, delivering lasting benefits which will outweigh the investment made, as well as financial independence; additionality, meaning the project could not have taken place without the fund and that the fund is not being substituted for investment already provided for; value for money, that is, delivering outputs and outcomes which will justify the investment; leveraging of funding from parties to the application; a significant and sustainable impact on social or economic development in rural areas; and transformative effect, the potential to deliver transformative change for a rural town or village and act as a catalyst for increased activity.<\/p><p> The Department has avoided limiting the type of activities that can be supported from the fund.  We want the relevant local authorities and other State-funded bodies to consult and engage with communities in rural areas to establish the type of projects which will deliver the most beneficial effects in their areas.  In that regard, the applications received to date and the projects which have been allocated funding have related to town and village regeneration, enterprise development, tourism development, digital and co-working initiatives, libraries, arts and cultural facilities, community facilities and sports and recreation facilities.  The successful projects often combine more than one of these elements.<\/p><p> The first call under the fund was launched in July 2018, with applications welcomed under both category 1 and category 2.  The Department undertook a series of regional information sessions to raise awareness of the fund and to assist applicants in preparing their proposals.  Online information resources were also put in place, including the establishment of a mailing list, a dedicated website for frequently asked questions and an email address for specific queries, the outcomes of which were shared with all interested parties.  A total of 280 applications were submitted under the first call.  Of these, 126 were category 1 applications and 154 were category 2 applications.  On foot of a comprehensive assessment process, 84 projects emerged as successful from the first call, comprising 38 category 1 projects and 46 category 2 projects.  The 38 successful category 1 projects were allocated &euro;69 million from the fund while the 46 successful category 2 projects were allocated &euro;17 million.  In total, the successful projects under the first call were allocated &euro;86 million in support from the fund and will deliver a total investment of &euro;117 million.<\/p><p> It should be noted that under the approach taken by the Department, the announcement of allocations of funding are in principle only and remain subject to the completion of final due diligence, including confirmation of matched funding and oversight of any emerging procurement costs.  In due course, successful applicants enter into contractual arrangements with the Department, which set out milestones upon which payment dates for grant funding are based.<\/p><p> Regarding implementation, the Department is satisfied with the level of progress achieved in the delivery of projects which were successful under the first call.  Many of the projects are large-scale and multi-annual in nature, but several projects have already reached their first and subsequent milestones and funding has been released for them.  The Minister for Rural and Community Development, Deputy Ring, recently opened the first project to be fully completed with the support of the fund, the gteic digital and innovation hub in Spiddal, County Galway, developed by &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta.  Further project completions are expected in the weeks ahead.  As of this week, &euro;22 million has been drawn down from the fund by 46 separate projects.  The Department is continuing to engage closely with project leads to provide whatever assistance is needed to manage the delivery of projects in line with expectations.<\/p><p> Following the completion of the first call in February 2019, the Department engaged with all applicants, both successful and unsuccessful, to garner feedback which would assist us in designing the second and subsequent calls for applications under the fund.  Bilateral discussions also took place with key stakeholders and a feedback and discussion workshop was staged in March 2019.  The detailed feedback provided was welcomed by all parties and was incorporated into the second call for applications, with changes made to the focus of the call and the application material required.<\/p><p> The second call for category 1 applications was opened in April 2019.  The Department undertook a comprehensive process of engagement with all interested parties to communicate the fund's objectives and the level of information required as part of the application process.  The feedback which emerged from the first call, which was supported by the policy discussions the Department had undertaken over that period, emphasised the huge importance of driving increased economic and social activity within our towns and villages.  The importance of vibrant towns and villages in attracting investment, drawing in additional visitors and increasing residency, came through strongly in all our contacts to date, as did the knock-on benefits for the rural hinterlands which surround these centres.  On that basis, the emphasis of the second call was on town and village regeneration and development that had transformational potential.  The second call for category 1 applications closed on 6 August 2019.  There was an excellent response from all across the country and 69 applications seeking a total of &euro;160 million from the fund were received.  The quality of the applications submitted in the second round and the standard of the projects proposed was extremely high.<\/p><p> I will now give an overview of the fund's assessment process.  The assessment of applications is a multistage process.  First, applications are scored by the Department in accordance with the published appraisal scheme.  Secondly, the applications are categorised for submission to an independent project advisory board.  The board is informed by the marks awarded to applications and an overall view of the cost of the projects and the level of funding sought relative to the proposals.  It takes account of the need to ensure balanced regional development and the budgetary resources available from the fund for the call.  Any outstanding issues or queries are also flagged.<\/p><p> The third stage of the assessment process involves seeking high-level guidance on the applications from the independent project advisory board.  The project advisory board for the fund was established on foot of a Government decision applied to all four funds established under Project Ireland 2040.  The advisory board for the rural fund is comprised of representatives from several Departments.  In addition, the board has two independent members with experience in rural and local development.  Another member of the board is the fund's independent process auditor, who is charged with providing guidance to the Department on the overall assessment process to ensure best practice and fair procedures are followed.<\/p><p>As part of the assessment process, the board is tasked with providing high-level guidance and observations on the suitability of proposals for funding in line with the fund's objectives.  The board helps the Department to formulate recommendations for the Minister on projects which should be considered for funding.  Board members are given access to all application documentation and all departmental assessments on each project, as well as summary information for convenience.  The board provides observations on individual projects which are collated and used to inform the preparation of a report on recommended projects.  The board may also identify further issues for the Department to follow up.  Following the board&rsquo;s considerations, the fourth and final stage of the assessment process is the preparation of a recommendation report by the Department for the Minister, identifying the outcomes which emerged from the assessment process and the discussions of the board.  The final decision on successful projects to be allocated funding rests with the Minister.<\/p><p> On foot of the assessment process undertaken in respect of the first call, the Department prepared two reports on recommended projects for the consideration of the Minister.  The 84 recommendations contained across the two reports were accepted by the Minister and represented the final outcome of the first call, as announced in September 2018 and February 2019.  A report on the assessment process undertaken in respect of the second call for applications was submitted to the Minister in October 2019.  The Minister accepted all 26 recommended projects detailed in the report.  On 6 November last in New Ross, the Minister announced details of the projects which were successful under the second call.  The 26 successful projects, which are located across the country, were allocated &euro;62 million in support to deliver a total investment of &euro;95 million.  The focus on regeneration which was the basis for the second call came through strongly in the projects which were successful.  Eighteen of the 26 successful projects should deliver town and village regeneration in different ways.<\/p><p> As I have alluded to previously, the best projects combine regeneration with other priorities, such as renovating heritage structures, providing focal points for activity in town centres or delivering arts or library infrastructure.  The successful project in Castleblayney will refurbish the historic Hope Castle gate lodge and deliver a modern public library and cultural and creative space in the centre of the town.  The Wexfordia project in New Ross will deliver a new visitor and heritage attraction in the centre of the town, using the existing streetscape and regenerating a key building on the riverside to build on the town's Norman heritage.  Once more, the successful projects cover a wide range of sectors.  Economic and enterprise development underpins the projects in Monksland, County Roscommon, and Roscrea, County Tipperary.  Tourism and recreation will be delivered by the Barrow blueway in counties Kildare and Laois.  Community development forms part of the case for the projects in Ballinamore, County Leitrim, and Loughrea, County Galway.  As with the successful projects under the first call, the 26 successful projects in the second call have been approved in principle only for now.  The Department is engaging with the lead parties as part of the due diligence process.  I expect we will shortly be in a position to issue provisional letters of offer regarding these projects.  Second stage and full approval for the projects will follow upon completion of procurement.  We hope to see significant progress on these projects in the new year.<\/p><p> We believe the projects which were successful under the first and second calls from the fund will deliver significant benefits in their local areas, counties and regions for many years.  The Department remains anxious to ensure the fund continues to support the best projects in the areas which most need them.  We are committed to continued consultation and feedback with all stakeholders, including this committee, with a view to ensuring local authorities and other organisations and the communities they serve are fully informed of the aims, intentions and requirements of the fund.  As it did with the first call, the Department will schedule an open and detailed feedback session to give helpful feedback on all the applications received for the now-concluded second call and to assist those applicants to prepare for future calls.  If further queries remain after this open meeting, the Department will endeavour to address them with the applicants.  The Minister intends that a second call for category 2 applications will be announced shortly.  The Minister and the Department are encouraging all potential applicants under the fund to continue to work to develop new and existing proposals which will benefit their local areas.  The Department will continue to provide all appropriate assistance in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2019112700002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Sheenagh Rooney","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1574812800,"counter":1120,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Rooney for her comprehensive outline of the fund.  I have a number of preliminary questions on which she might be able to give me information.  Can she confirm that any proposal received by the Department that has an enterprise element is subject to state aid rules?  Ms Rooney has said that a State-funded agency - I understand that this means a body like a local authority, IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, the Western Development Commission or &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta - must be the lead agency.  When one reads about the scheme, one sees that this stipulation is part of it.  Is a LEADER company eligible to be a lead agency?  I would also like to ask for details on the successful applicants to date, broken down across categories like enterprise agencies and local authorities.  How many of the projects that have been successful to date have been led by local authorities?  How many of them have been led by enterprise agencies?<\/p> <p>  I do not know whether the officials have information on the next issue I would like to raise.  I am not a mad fan of these competitions.  Nowadays, the cost of entering a competition is continuing to increase as the threshold of information that needs to be submitted gets higher and higher.  It would be interesting to compare the total amount of money that all of the applicants spend on taking part in the competition with the total amount of money given to the winners.  It is a bit like the lottery.  We know what happens in the lottery.  The lottery works on the basis that one or two people get a massive amount of money, but the total amount of money paid in by the participants outweighs the total amount of money that comes out.  I am not saying that what is happening under the rural regeneration and development fund is at that level.  Has the Department done a comparative assessment of the total amount of money spent by the applicants in making applications under the fund, in the context of what the winners get out of it?<\/p> <p>  A fundamental question arises in this regard.  It is probably a policy issue for the Government, rather than a policy issue for the public servants who advise the Government.  The example of Gteic, which is based sa Spid&eacute;al, has been mentioned.  Those of us with tidy and simple minds would say that if &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta were funded properly by the Government, as it was in the old days, Gteic would not have had to go to the second fund and would not have wasted money on making applications under this competitive process.  &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta could have decided to support Gteic sa Spid&eacute;al as a gcuid acmhainn&iacute; f&eacute;in, mar at&aacute; i gceist acu a dh&eacute;anamh i gCorr na M&oacute;na, mar shampla.  Is this an efficient way of proceeding?  The same thing goes for the town and village renewal scheme.  Would it not be better for the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government simply to give enough money to the local authorities to do town and village renewal?<\/p> <p>  Another question arises in this context.  It keeps coming up here.  New builds are not allowed outside towns and villages.  The 1.5 million people in this State who live outside towns and villages account for a high percentage of the population.  I do not what is wrong with us.  I do not live in a town or a village.  I do not know why we are banned from having any development.  The other day, I was at the opening of a road that had been built beside a very large enterprise to facilitate people getting to their houses.  They got planning permission for this road.  Actually, it is the best tertiary road in the county now.  It has been taken over by the county council.  It ensures that people living in three houses will not have to go past a major industry of 200 people.  As far as the rural regeneration and development fund is concerned, the industry in question does not exist.  It is out the country at the back of the mountain.  I do not get this hatred of allowing anything to happen outside a town or a village.  It is often easier and quicker.  I think we got the exposition.  I did not get the whole of the submission last week as unfortunately, I had to be in a few places at one time.  My understanding, however, was that in many cases, it is way more expensive to try to refurbish an existing building in a town or a village than to build a new building.  When people are trying to get things done and get the economy going, they cannot be too fussy.<\/p><p>In this town, I have noticed that people seem to be able to knock away buildings that are fine and start again.  What is the logical reason for a Department of Rural and Community Development suddenly putting the brakes on rural development?<\/p><p> There is a departmental score and an advisory board assessment, which is sent to the Minister, who approves applications.  In how many cases did the Minister not approve recommendations?  Has he any facility to approve a project that the board did not recommend?  In how many cases did he send an application back for re-evaluation or is he just the proverbial rubber stamp?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2019112700002#D00200","speaker":"1312","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1574812800,"counter":1122,"content":"<p>Will our guests address those questions?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2019112700002#E00200","speaker":"1273"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1574812800,"counter":1123,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his questions.

From the first two calls, we have seen real evidence of that collaboration.

I refer to taking on derelict or disused buildings such as former courthouses, market houses and such venues?<\/p> <p>    This funding is very welcome.  There was specific mention of the gate lodge in Castleblayney, which is fantastic, in the presentation.  Mr. Paul Clifford, who is a senior official in Monaghan County Council, was before this committee last week talking about the myriad of projects that have to be done in terms of town and village renewal across counties like Cavan and Monaghan.  He also alluded to the fact that the gate lodge is the more minor of all the projects that have to be taken on in towns like Castleblayney, where what was once a beautiful market house is now a shell of a building in the centre of the main street.  The gate lodge is wonderful.  However, as Mr. Clifford stated here last week, it will take millions of euro to do something with the market house.  I am sure there is a cap in funding but could Ms Rooney give us some figures on the cap for such projects?  I met officials in the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht to see how we best go forward to save a building that is of historical importance in a town like Castleblayney but which is literally a shell of a building because it has been allowed to become derelict.  The huge strength in terms of the community organisations will see that building brought back to its former glory.  Can those organisations engage with the Department with a view to funding a project such as that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2019112700002#F00800","speaker":"1271"},{"type":"speech","time":1574812800,"counter":1148,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Rooney for her presentation.

Has Ms Rooney found gaps emerging because of this process, whereby the Department has found it does not have a sufficient number of applications in a particular area?

I will highlight that in the call we just announced, we had applications from people who were unsuccessful in the first round and were successful in the second round.  That was good for us to see because we put a lot of time and effort into providing meaningful feedback to people following the first call.  We were able to clearly point out the type of projects that were successful and the ones that were unsuccessful, and show the reasons for that.<\/p> <p>  This leads to the comment made about gaps.<\/p><p>In the first call we did not see real regeneration ambition but we certainly saw more of it in the second call and we can build on that.  The majority of projects in the second call involved the repurposing of existing infrastructure in towns and villages or plans for regeneration.  That regeneration has a number of elements.  We were very pleased to see that a number of projects that were unsuccessful on the first call were successful on the second call because of the feedback from the Department.  The feedback that we gave and the changes we made to the marking schedule in the second call meant that more regeneration projects came through.  We have just finished the second call and intend to go out with another public session in January, when we will engage with all of the stakeholders on what has been learned from the last call and will try to identify any gaps that exist.  One of the positive aspects of the fund is that it supports a wide variety of projects which means that communities are able to think about the best solution for them.  We are not being prescriptive in that regard, which is good.  We have information on the broad range of projects that have been funded and would be happy to forward that to the committee.  <\/p><p> In response to Deputy Smyth's comment regarding disjointed funding, our Department has tried to present a coherent package of funding.  When we are communicating with stakeholders, preparing application forms and going through the processes, we try to show that the rural regeneration and development fund is for transformational projects.  It is for regeneration projects that require more money than other types of projects.  The town and village renewal scheme is obviously for smaller-scale projects that yet still make a difference.  That is complemented by funding available through CL&Aacute;R and the outdoor recreation infrastructure scheme.  We will continue to monitor the coherence of those funding streams to ensure that they all make sense and are directed towards their different objectives.  It is fair to say that the landscape is fairly busy but it is delivering different objectives for communities.  We always welcome feedback on our various schemes.  One of the most important aspects of the fund is the additionality element.  The fund is there to be additional and to make projects happen that would not otherwise get off the ground.  The feedback we have received is that the projects simply would not have happened without this funding source and that the rural fund is meeting that particular need.  <\/p><p> A question was asked about local authorities and the statistics show that about 70% of the applications were from local authorities on all calls to date.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2019112700002#F01200","nonspeaker":"Ms Sheenagh Rooney","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1574812800,"counter":1153,"content":"<p>What is the position with regard to the cap?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2019112700002#G00200","speaker":"1271"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1574812800,"counter":1154,"content":"<p>There is no cap for category 1 funding.

I have a number of questions for the witnesses.  I thank Ms Rooney for her comprehensive presentation and for engaging with the committee.  This fund is critical and is a game changer for many communities.  County Clare has benefited greatly, with the Ennistymon digital hub due to open soon.  This follows on from the development of the Spiddal digital hub, which is very welcome.  I am interested in the issue of LEADER companies being lead applicants.  In County Clare, the LEADER there company was unsuccessful over the last two calls even though its applications were backed up by a philanthropic organisation called Tomar Trust, which pledged &euro;300,000 for each individual application.  Tomar Trust will only fund projects that are also funded by the State.  There was considerable disappointment when these excellent projects were not funded.  This situation begs a wider question on the number of applications nationwide from LEADER companies.  Ms Rooney has told us that 70% of applications were led by local authorities.  Why is it the case that LEADER companies are not as successful in their applications?  Surely serious consideration must be given to applications that are backed up by a philanthropic organisation like Tomar Trust, which is working in counties Clare, Waterford and Cork.  How much consideration is given to such applications?<\/p> <p>  I cannot overemphasise the importance of this scheme.  I think of Seaworld in Lahinch in County Clare, which opened when preparations for the Irish Open were under way.  The public realm in Lahinch enjoyed a significant upgrade to coincide with that massive sporting event.  Work is also ongoing in Seaworld itself, with the upgrading of facilities and the provision of a surf rescue training centre.  The effect on the village of Lahinch has been massive.  This fund enables communities to think big.  As Ms Rooney pointed out, the minimum award is &euro;500,000 but there is no cap.  <\/p> <p>  This is a new fund and as Ms Rooney explained to Senator Marshall earlier, some of the projects that were unsuccessful on the first call were funded on the second call.  The fund provides enormous opportunities for communities.  Again, I thank Ms Rooney for coming before us today.

It would be wrong of me not to be truthful.  There is great dismay about the RRDF, its distribution and how funds are allocated to rural communities in my own constituency of Cork South-West.  We have what many feel are very strong and valuable projects, supported by Cork County Council, which have been refused funding in recent weeks.  We were also refused funds in the last announcement.  Indeed, I think most of County Cork was refused funding at that time and in Cork South-West there was zero funding.<\/p><p> I would like to delve further into the reasons.  I do not begrudge any community getting from &euro;6 million to &euro;9 million because that is what the fund is for.  Why, however, is one area funded while another is not?  Sometimes there may be an issue over a project, especially when it is the lead project in the eyes of Cork County Council.  Surely the issue would get ironed out in six months.  I am aware that there were projects in Bandon, Clonakilty, Dunmanway, Ballinspittle, Bantry, Skibbereen, and Schull.<\/p><p> I would like to mention the Schull project because that was Cork County Council's lead project.  My worry is that nobody refused ever got funding afterwards.  Maybe I picked Ms Rooney up wrong in that regard.  If so, she might clarify whether an organisation might still get funding if there was a box that was not ticked.

It does not matter what the name of the project is.  Refusals leave a lot of unanswered questions and a sour taste in the mouths of people of Cork South-West.  There are other projects also but I will not get into the detail.<\/p> <p>  When a voluntary community organisation is bending, twisting and turning in the best way possible to carry out what is a super project that is shovel ready, the matter should be addressed.  With some of the projects that received funding 12 months ago, there has been no shovel turned yet.  This raises the question as to how funding was given to projects that might not have been shovel ready, but which may have let on they were, and not given to a project that is ready to roll and has planning permission.  The latter is continually refused.  It begs many questions about the rural regeneration funds.  I cannot answer them.  I have raised them in the D&aacute;il.  The Minister cannot answer.  I have been trying to raise the same question for seven or eight months but cannot get answers.  I would appreciate it if Ms Rooney enlightened me today.  If projects have been refused, they are going to reapply if they believe they are worthy.  If they address an issue that they might not have been aware of, will they be eligible for funding afterwards?

Recently, in the last round, there was funding awarded to the first phase of the regeneration project for Kanturk and the Briery Gap Theatre in Macroom.

That is not in all cases but in some.<\/p> <p>  With regard to shovel-ready projects, it is a matter of all consents being in place.  That is in advance of procurement.  The Department must go through two important stages.  Once someone is announced as successful, that just implies funding in principle.  We then have to engage in a due diligence process.  Then the applicant must come back to us with the procurement cost, and then we sign a contract with them.  That is to protect Exchequer funding and to do things in the right way.  Afterwards, payment is linked to milestone delivery.  It can be the case for some projects, given their scale and the fact that delivery will be over a number of years, that procurement takes longer.<\/p> <p>  It took some time to get the due diligence process and contractual arrangements set up but it was important for us to do that because taxpayers' money is involved.  Now that we have done this, we are beginning to see delivery on projects and expenditure.  There is momentum and we expect it only to increase.  We are delivering all the time on a pipeline of projects and there is a ten-year investment programme.  I highlighted already that the expenditure to date is up by &euro;21 million.

It includes the Departments of Housing, Planning and Local Government, Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Agriculture, Food and Marine, and Transport, Tourism and Sport.  That is five Departments and Ms Rooney's Department is also included, so that is six.  Why was the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht not included?  It has responsibility for the geographic area of na Gaeltachata&iacute; and the islands and it has responsibility for all the waterways, which one would have thought would be a big focus.  It affects the Chairman's constituency, Leitrim up into Fermanagh and so on.  It also has responsibility for national parks and wildlife.   The Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, with responsibility for IDA Ireland and for Enterprise Ireland and SFADCo and Ms Rooney's Department has responsibility for the Western Development Commission, but the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht has responsibility for &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, probably the most multifunctional of all the development agencies there.  Why was it not on the advisory board given that it is very relevant to it?<\/p> <p>  The Department can provide 70% of funding and 80% in some exceptional circumstances.  Can the lead agency or another State agency provide the other 20%?   There would be obvious implications for that.<\/p> <p>  Ms Rooney said that the spend was &euro;22 million to date.  From next week, and we need to take out weekends and Christmas, there will be about 20 days of spend.  What does Ms Rooney expect the Department's outturn to be?  Her estimate was in excess of &euro;50 million for the year and it is now about 40% of that.<\/p> <p>  As a general comment, &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta should not have had to go to the Department.  It should have had enough funding to do it itself.  The Department has done an excellent project in west Connemara that I do not think would have happened without the Department's fund.  I am not convinced on the totality of it, that it is not a whole duplication.  As far as most of the village renewal and town renewal is concerned, we should just fund local authorities properly so that they can do these things themselves without running around with a begging bowl from agency to agency, thus duplicating the whole administration, the system delays and so on, but that is a personal view.<\/p> <p>  The difference between this fund and CL&Aacute;R is how matching funding was done in CL&Aacute;R which was fundamentally different.  This fund is open to the whole country because there is another fund in another Department, namely, Housing, Planning and Local Government, for the big towns and cities.  Everyone is in this gig and it is not trying to achieve an objective of pulling the money in one direction.  It would be claimed that, between the two Departments, all the assistance is covered.  The idea with CL&Aacute;R matching funding was there was a perception, which I think was valid, that the depopulated areas did not get their fair share of funding.  There was a pull factor, therefore, where a previous Government decided to pull the money into these areas by saying it would provide a euro where there was a good project in a depopulated area.  I used to do that in the islands where if someone built a health centre, for example, we would provide 50% matching funding, but that was to pull money into areas that normally would not be able to compete in getting priority for funds.  Since this is open priority for the whole country, it does not have that bigger philosophical logic behind matching funding.<\/p> <p>  An interesting paper was written for the Department of Rural and Community Development on RAPID.  I did not agree with the paper but it excoriated the principle of matching funding.  I am wondering why it has since come back to fashion.  It was one of these value for money things.  The Minister gave it to me and it excoriated the whole idea of matching funding.  I thought it was wrong because it missed the whole point that it was matching funding into very deprived areas, but that is another day's work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2019112700002#J00400","speaker":"1312"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1574812800,"counter":1169,"content":"<p>The project advisory board is a high-level advisory board that provides guidance.

As the Vice Chairman has said, I am accompanied by my colleague, Mr. John Kennedy, who is head of the cultural schemes unit, which has been examining the matters under discussion today at the behest of the Minister, Deputy Josepha Madigan.  On behalf of the Minister, I thank the committee for its interest in this matter and for the opportunity to present to the committee on this subject today.  The Department is aware that the committee has engaged with other stakeholders on this topic in recent weeks and I know our role in this matter was acknowledged by various committee members at a previous meeting.<\/p> <p>  The Department, directly and through its agencies, contributes substantial supports to night-time cultural activity on an ongoing basis.  Some &euro;189 million is provided in the Department&rsquo;s Vote in 2019 for cultural purposes.  This funding supports cultural activity in the evenings through bodies such as the National Concert Hall, support from the Arts Council for the theatre sector, including the Abbey Theatre, Gate Theatre and Druid Theatre Company, and through events such as Culture Night.  Work presented at regional theatres and arts centres is, in many instances, developed with the support of the Arts Council and performed in facilities developed with capital support from the Department.  I recently attended the opening of the French film festival at the Irish Film Institute, IFI.  The support of the Arts Council for the festival was acknowledged on the evening, as was the capital support from the Department for the IFI.<\/p> <p>  The topic of night-time culture has a wider dimension reflecting broader creative pursuits and this is constantly evolving.  This has been of growing interest in light of a demand for a more varied night-time creative landscape and recognition of the cultural, economic and social value of Ireland's evening experiences.  It is also building on the back of movements throughout Europe, such as Museum Night, and, for example, the appointment of a \"night czar\" in London.<\/p> <p>  On 17 April, the Minister, Deputy Madigan, hosted a symposium to investigate the possibility of creative nightlife and cultural activity at night time as an alternative and complementary option to Ireland's existing rich night-time experience.  Since then, the Department has engaged further with key partners to develop an approach to support a sustainable and forward-looking infrastructure to facilitate the development of after hours cultural events.  The Minister has proposed a number of measures to deliver on these objectives.<\/p> <p>  The Minister is establishing pilot projects to identify how a night-time culture initiative might work in local settings.  To this end, the Department has thus far written to two local authorities, namely, Dublin City Council and Cork City Council, to establish groups comprising representatives from the local authority, the local creative nightlife sector, policing, transport and artists and-or creative workers.  The purpose of these groups is to consider and collate what supports and impediments are impacting on opportunities for creative and cultural activity at night, in different settings, and what would be required locally to develop, promote and encourage late night culture.  These groups will also consider the appropriateness of appointing local night-time commissioners.  We have asked the local authorities concerned to progress the establishment of these groups as soon as possible.  We will meet Dublin City Council next week and look forward to continuing a common interest approach to this matter<\/p> <p>  In parallel with this process, the Minister is establishing a national forum comprising the Department, the Arts Council and other Departments with key roles in supporting night-time culture and creativity.  This forum will consider matters arising from the operation of the pilot local groups, which could require a national policy or legislative response,  This, in turn, would be referred to the relevant Department or agency for consideration.  The Minister will engage with local authorities and arts groups on a mapping exercise of existing venues and civic spaces which may be suitable for night-time cultural events to identify gaps and opportunities, building on work carried out previously in this area.  Flowing from these engagements, the Minister will develop a national night-time cultural policy, which will complement existing initiatives and supports.  This night-time cultural policy will, in turn, give consideration to the appointment of a night-time commissioner to oversee the implementation of recommendations and outputs arising.  Any decision in this regard will be a matter for the Minister and the Government in due course.<\/p> <p>  The key issue will be to identify those factors that are having an impact on the opportunities for artists and creatives to develop and present creative work for the benefit of all, to ensure that these issues are brought to the attention of the relevant agencies and bodies concerned, and that progress on responding to these issues is monitored.  There will, no doubt, be some complexity in these matters.  The issues that have been highlighted in Dublin in recent months are being experienced elsewhere internationally and we have had feedback on this.  It arose at the cultural conference we had last January, when people spoke about challenges in locations such as London and New York.  A key objective will be to distinguish between the natural ebb and flow of venues and events based on changing tastes and to identify those factors which are impacting on the overall level of activity.  It is also the case that many of the agencies and bodies concerned will be attempting to balance sometimes competing demands.<\/p><p>In this context, it is worth noting developments such as the recent decision of Dublin Bus to introduce a 24-hour service on two routes, the 15 and 41, from next month.<\/p><p> The Minister considers there is a genuine opportunity to create an environment in which night time culture can thrive, with the beneficial knock-on effects of increasing the night time economy, expanding the reach of our cultural offering and, ultimately, helping to create a society with wider night time options focusing on the arts, well-being and the broader human experience.  In addition, the Department has had discussions with the Arts Council, the Office of Public Works and some local authorities to consider possible short-term and longer-term approaches to the issue of the availability of artists' spaces in general in Ireland. <\/p><p> The Minister, on behalf of the Government, is committed to identifying ways to effectively support greater opportunity for night time cultural and creative events.  She welcomes the engagement of the relevant local authorities and that of the committee.  The Department will be pleased to receive any output from the committee&rsquo;s deliberations on this issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22019112700002#B00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Conor Falvey","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1574812800,"counter":1212,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Falvey for his presentation.

I thank Mr. Falvey for taking the time to come here and present to the committee.  We have had a number of presentations on this issue.  We have heard one of the major issues for venues is insurance costs, and Mr. Falvey alluded to the challenges and complexities involved, but that issue does not only affect venues.  Increasingly more venues are finding it difficult to sustain themselves with the insurance requirement demands that exist.  That means that some of the more creative venues that may have a small following find it especially difficult to sustain themselves.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Falvey alluded to Dublin Bus operating a 24-hour service on two routes.  It is about time we had that service and it is a pity more routes are not operating on that basis, given that Dublin is a capital city.  I am not aware of any such service operating in any of the other cities.  The Luas operates a service at 1 a.m., 2 a.m. and 3 a.m. on Fridays, Saturday and perhaps Sundays during the Christmas period.  We were advised the Luas cannot operate a 24-hour service because there must be some time available for servicing but the operation of its service at 1 a.m., 2 a.m. and 3 p.m. should be nearly the norm every weekend rather than only during the Christmas period. <\/p> <p>  This topic involves a range of issues.  Mr. Falvey mentioned the Minister is engaging with local authorities and art groups regarding a mapping exercise.  When will that happen, as there is an urgency to this, as Mr. Falvey reflected, due to the fact that some venues are closing?  If the Department takes too long in doing this, we might lose some venues.  Also, in terms of their experience, what are the problems involved?  I note the Minister is establishing pilot projects and Department officials will meet Dublin City Council next week.  It is a pity that did not happen sooner.  In terms of the pilot projects, probably the first ask of Dublin City Council or any other council will be where is the money for this initiative and what money is available to draw up a plan for this.  While that might not cost much, there will be a cost in implementing it and putting somebody to be in charge of it.  A night czar is in place in London, for example.  Has the Department reached a stage where money is required to be set aside in a budget for the pilot projects planned for our two biggest cities?  We heard from representatives of Waterford at an earlier meeting.  It is not a big city but it has a vibrant creative community, which is struggling to sustain itself.  Perhaps consideration should be given to establishing a pilot project in one of the smaller cities.  We are not overloaded with having very large cities but we are overloaded in terms of having much creative talent in Ireland and that should be harnessed whether that be during the day or in the evening-time.  Much more could be done in the evening-time to harness the talents of those members of the creative community and also to provide enjoyment to those of us who live in Ireland and those who come here to avail of that experience.  I will leave it at that and I might speak later on a few other issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22019112700002#C00300","speaker":"1305"},{"type":"speech","time":1574812800,"counter":1214,"content":"<p>Would Senator Warfield like to contribute?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22019112700002#C00400","speaker":"1263"},{"type":"speech","time":1574812800,"counter":1215,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Falvey for his presentation.  The Department should be commended on being quite responsive to the mood among creatives.  The night time economy is essential for the creative and cultural sector and the Department recognises that.  The way in which Mr. Falvey's statement is laid out is helpful in terms of establishing the groups in Dublin City Council.  We were told by representatives of Dublin City Council two weeks ago that the council had not set up that group.  Is the Department frustrated about that?<\/p> <p>  Officials from the Department of Justice and Equality also appeared before the committee and when I asked them whether Creative Ireland had been in touch with the Department, I was told it had not been.  Creative Ireland is an all-of-government initiative and it would probably be quite useful in terms of this issue given its spread across Departments.  What role does Mr. Falvey envisage Creative Ireland playing in this respect?  Did he watch the committee's proceedings two weeks ago and, if he did, what were the take-away points from that for the Department?<\/p> <p>  There is quite a focus on Dublin and our cities in the presentation but our rural towns are also being affected.  I have noted a number of venue closures particularly in the south west of the island, one being the Hillgrove nightclub in Dingle, County Kerry, which has been a prominent venue in the Other Voices festival.  It announced it will shut its doors, citing costs of licensing and insurance.  Also, we had the recent closure of Connolly's of Leap in Cork, which was a previous Irish Music Rights Organisation, IMRO, Munster venue of the year.  It is moving into the restaurant market and has cited unnecessary licensing issues.  A venue in Clonakilty has mentioned licensing and special exemption order costs.  Another venue is O&rsquo;Riada&rsquo;s in Macroom, which mentioned licensing and special exemption order costs.  Also, in Kenmare and Tralee, people have nowhere to dance at night.  There is a pretty extensive list of closures in the south west.  The Minister, Deputy Madigan, has noted the issues these venues are facing in respect of planning, licensing and insurance.  Does Mr. Falvey consider the current costs involved for venues to operate after standard hours such as the &euro;410 on legal fees per night is a fair cost, especially given the current issues around insurance?  Given that most venues face issues that have a legislative remit in other Departments, and this comes back to the Creative Ireland initiative, does Mr. Falvey have confidence there is an appetite in those Departments to make the necessary change that we need?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22019112700002#C00500","speaker":"1372"},{"type":"speech","time":1574812800,"counter":1216,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Falvey and his Department for their hard work on this issue.  To follow on from what Senator Warfield said, the Department has chosen the cities of Dublin and Cork in which to establish pilot projects.  I am surprised Galway was not included.  Is there a reason it was not, given it is a leading light in terms of its international arts festival and that it will be the European Capital of Culture?  It is pretty remiss of the Department not to have it included as part of any pilot project or research to move forward on this issue.<\/p> <p>  I concur with what Senator Warfield said.  There is an opportunity for the more rural constituencies and counties to be involved in this initiative.  Our urban areas are the hive of activity and there is great potential and outlets in them but this initiative could be an opportunity for rural areas.  There are many creative industries and creative workers in those areas who probably have limited outlets and opportunities.<\/p><p>Is the Department looking at the opportunities this could present?  It may not be an issue because it does not even consider work in terms of night life.  This might present an opportunity.  Could Mr. Falvey expand on that?

Who might these partners be and what role might they play?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22019112700002#C00600","speaker":"1271","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1574812800,"counter":1218,"content":"<p>Insurance is an issue for us across the sector with regard to different activities.  It is presenting as different issues.  As members are aware, the Government has produced an initiative on this.  We have raised the matter with the Department of Finance in terms of the impact it is having.  There is a whole-of-government response.  Regarding impediments to any sector-specific or State-driven response, it needs to be a comprehensive package that tackles the insurance industry generally.  We are aware of it.  It is presenting in different sectors for us.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the question about Dublin Bus, these are matters for that company.  I happened to hear a spokesperson for Dublin Bus on the radio when it announced this recently saying that the ambition potentially is to expand the number of services.  From our perspective, this is certainly very welcome.  That might, in part, flow from the experience of the operation of the new service as it is being introduced.  <\/p> <p>  Regarding the mapping exercise and when it might happen, we are really looking at quarter 1.  I would say to any members who might raise this issue that the Minister very much shares their ambition regarding timelines and is looking for the measures that have been set out to be implemented as promptly as possible.  I hope we will be able in some locations to build on previous work done in this area.  I am informed that there has been but we just need to make sure this is up to date.  We may not be starting from scratch with regard to that exercise.  We are meeting Dublin City Council next week.  We have all read material in the newspapers about things such as District 8, the Bernard Shaw or other venues closing.  Venues come and go for different reasons.  It is just a case of arriving at an evidence base in order that there is something underpinning something more fundamental here and that there is a broader and more generally based impediment to opportunities for people to either do creative work at night or to experience and participate in it than has been the case previously.  It is about building that evidence base to see what the appropriate policy responses to those pressures are.  We are working with Dublin City Council on the precise structure to do that most effectively.  <\/p> <p>  Regarding Waterford and the other locations, we may not be finished with this exercise.  The issues in other locations can be quite different.  Dublin is where the issue appears to be presenting most acutely in the context of some of the issues we have discussed.  To some extent, the issues in rural Ireland are a bit different.  <\/p> <p>  I do not know whether Senator Warfield will be rejoining us but I am from Tralee, live in the south west and am acutely aware of the circumstances in rural Ireland, particularly in the south west.  I had heard that the Hillgrove was to re-open temporarily next week in the context of \"Other Voices\".  There are issues regarding changing tastes.  All manner of issues impact on the way people, including young people, socialise that are possibly different today but, again, it is about building that evidence base.  If the venue is saying that these are insurance issues, these are matters we need to take into account.  <\/p> <p>  Regarding the appetite in other Departments, we have engaged with other Departments, met them over the summer and written to them regarding our intentions in this regard.  We will write to them again.  It is not our intention to duplicate the role of any other Department.  The point of the exercise is to provide the structures so that these issues can be raised, identified, referred and progressed with regard to responding to the issues.  People have been discussing this issue in the media and there have been very effective campaigns such as Give Us The Night, so we need to be able to respond to this at an official level.  That is what the Government wants to do so we need to provide a structure through which these issues can be raised formally, referred to the appropriate level for resolution and if they cannot be resolved at local level through the participation of the local transport providers or the local authority and if a legislative or a policy response is required, there is a structure through which that can be referred to the appropriate body or agency.  That is a key element of what we are trying to achieve regarding the exercise that is under way.  <\/p> <p>  The role of Creative Ireland was mentioned.  It is something we have not considered at this stage.  The Creative Ireland programme has a defined body of work set out.  The focus is very much on the creative youth plan strand, with which members will be very familiar, and the creative communities strand through the local authorities.  It has been very involved in terms of the audiovisual stream, the capital plan in the Department and our international presence and is doing a significant piece of work around supports for creative industries in the context of future jobs so that is where the focus is.  That is not to say that the Department does not have other means through which to engage with colleagues across the system and other Departments to identify issues and assess what those responses might be.  Having said that, it is not our job to step in and assume the role of the Department of Justice and Equality or the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government but rather to say that we are interested from a cultural perspective in the impact of Departments' policies on creative spaces and are raising these issues in that context and will see what the Government response will be with regard to those matters.  <\/p> <p>  The issues raised at the previous meetings were broadly aligned with the issues raised with the Minister at the symposium in April.  Consequently, many of the same issues such as venues, licensing, transport, policing and costs generally came up.  I will not say that nothing was new.  It is useful to have those conversations and to hear those views being verified and echoed but the issues raised were broadly similar to those raised with the Department through the symposium.  <\/p> <p>  Next year will be a very busy year in Galway, although that is not say it would not be an appropriate place.  By their nature, pilots involve picking a small sample.  We picked Dublin on the basis that it is most acute.  I do not know whether, if Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire was in the Chair today, he would have a different view about Cork city.  Everybody will have an opinion but we will run the pilots.  If we think there are other issues that are not being captured, we can look to expand and see what other issues emerge or come back to us from different sources.  By their nature, however, pilots tend to be limited.  <\/p> <p>  We spoke about the challenges in urban and rural areas.  Some of the narrative in the media appears to be around development pressures, particularly in Dublin, and their impact on those opportunities and venues.  It is different in rural areas.  I know some very established artists based in Kerry, possibly because those development pressures are not there, and they are able to find venues more easily.  The difficulty may involve things like transport and the density of population to support demand for particular types of arts pursuits.  What is the optimal level of support?  The Deputy is quite right in that the issues will be different.  We should look at the issues that come out of the pilots in the cities to see whether they are applicable or whether we are looking at something quite different.  Pilots are limited and restricted.  We will see in due course whether we think there is a need to sample more widely.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22019112700002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Conor Falvey"},{"type":"speech","time":1574812800,"counter":1219,"content":"<p>I do not think Mr. Falvey and I are at odds.  It is one of these areas where society is starting to grapple with certain concepts.<\/p><p>In the past, things happened by their nature.  I attended the venue in Dingle many times as a youth and it was of its time when I visited it.  I have visited quite a number of venues over the years and when one visits them now, they do not look the same because owners change their premises to meet current demand.  Sometimes it takes a number of  years for venue owners to see how the demands of younger people have shifted.  Changing or upgrading a venue can often be a significant undertaking and there are no grants available.  Owners usually have to get a loan based on a business plan.  Such a plan will show that if they invest, they can change their venue to reflect the new cultural landscape.  A music venue could change and become a film venue, for example.  In the main, it is the dance and music venues that have had the strictest health and safety and fire safety conditions imposed on them and rightly so.  Tragically, this city has seen the need for such conditions in the past.  Meeting those conditions is often a significant undertaking for venue owners.  At this point, more and more of the larger, under-utilised venues in semi-derelict parts of the city are being gobbled up by the building boom.  The same thing happened towards the end of the Celtic tiger period.  Dance venues in the city of one or two storeys have shot up in value.  It is the owners of such properties, who may have leased them out for a number of years, who will decide what happens.  It is not necessarily in the gift of the Government or the local authorities to prevent owners from selling.  I am not suggesting that the State buys lots of venues but we do need to look at the venues that are under the control of the State.  Are we getting full value from them?  Are there venues under the control of the councils or the State that could serve a different purpose at night from that which they serve during the day?  I am talking here about multipurpose venues.  If the State is planning further investment in community halls in Dublin or in the larger towns, it could consider whether such halls can sustain events at night and on weekends.  Festivals held in particular venues will come to an end if the venues close.  The Other Voices festival in Dingle is happening this weekend but if its usual venue closes, to where will it move?<\/p><p> We also need to ask questions about access to transport.  In the city, if a venue is four miles away, one can walk to it because there are footpaths and street lighting or one get a taxi.  If one is in rural Ireland and there is no transport, however, one is not going to walk home at 4 a.m. in the dark.  That is an issue with which rural Ireland and the Government are grappling in a very haphazard way.  While it is not specifically an issue for the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, it is an important consideration nonetheless.<\/p><p> The Give Us The Night campaign is not just about venues and extending the licensing hours.  It is also asking what activities can be run at night that people will go to.  There is no point in putting on events that nobody will go to.  We have seen State buildings in this city opening on Culture Night.  Can that be extended to later hours?  Can we look at other events?  Dublin City Council is planning to develop white water rapids at the International Financial Services Centre.  Will that be a late-night venue?  Can cinemas be encouraged to show late-night films or to show films all through the night as part of a film festival?  The same question could be posed in the context of drama festivals.  Things like tech conventions or superhero conventions take place in the city but they usually run from about 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.  Is there encouragement, prompting or funding available to organisations that are running such events to think outside the box?  This is possibly a question for the Arts Council rather than the Department.  Could the Department encourage the Arts Council to work with Dublin City Council and other local authorities to encourage those who are making applications for funding for events or festivals not to limit their activities to normal hours?  Could we concentrate for a period of two to three years on evening and night time events?  Is that doable?  Do we have sufficient footfall?  Can we attract more tourists to the country by having offerings that are not limited to the day time?  In that context, the licensing hours and fees payable must also be considered.  If events had State backing, with additional funding to promote themselves, that would make up for the extra cost of opening at night.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22019112700002#D00300","speaker":"1305","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1574812800,"counter":1221,"content":"<p>To come back to the rural question, the way people consume culture is different now.  The festival format which is popular now is good for rural Ireland.  Festivals like Other Voices draw people in, albeit for short bursts and people seem to have a taste for that now.  One can run such festivals anywhere.  There are many locations in rural Ireland where opera, contemporary music and traditional music festivals are held.  It is a format that people like and to which they have become accustomed.<\/p> <p>  In terms of spaces being used for other purposes, one of the cultural highlights for me this year was when the very distinguished arts practitioner Ms Kim Gordon from a punk band that I liked when I was young, Sonic Youth, performed at IMMA on a summer's evening.  It was a really nice event and I now that IMMA has ambitions to run more such events in that space.  In terms of the cultural institutions, their primary objective is to protect, preserve and present national collections so anything they would do in that space would have to be consistent with that objective.  A very substantial programme of capital investment is underway in the cultural institutions which will enhance the spaces.  We will explore with them all options, while also considering the resource implications but there is already evidence of the cultural institutions themselves looking at opportunities to widen their reach.  Culture Night, when people visit outside of the normal times, has inspired them to ask if they can do more in that area and that is something that the Department is interested in exploring over time.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the Arts Council, the Department is entirely respectful of the arm's-length principle and the independence of the council in terms of its funding decisions.  As stated earlier, the Arts Council would be a participant in any forum that would consider these issues at a national level.  We would certainly be happy to present issues to the Arts Council and engage with it on them.  I am very confident that this is a topic that the council is very interested in exploring.  The licensing question may well prove to be one of the more difficult and challenging issues.<\/p><p>I will not get into the nub of it now.

Journalists like Ms Una Mullally in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>have written pieces highlighting the pressures.  The Minister is keen to respond to those and bring stakeholders together to see what can be done.  The city council is anxious that we move forward on a strong evidence base.  We are talking to it about how to proceed, and the Minister is ambitious.  I have no doubt about the city council's bona fides and commitment to working with us on examining the issues.<br\/><br\/>Creative Ireland has a full programme in terms of creative youth and creative communities.  It was involved in the development of the audiovisual and capital plans.  Outside of the long-running elements in the form of creative youth and creative communities, its main focus is on the creative industries and mapping supports for same in the context of the future jobs initiative.

Members should feel free to raise any matters arising from that correspondence during this discussion.<\/p><p>Correspondence No. 2019\/543 is an email sent to the office of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport requesting details of the Minister's availability to appear before the joint committee throughout November and December.  We will note that correspondence. <\/p><p>Correspondence No. 2019\/544 is an email sent to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport requesting an updated briefing on drones and air traffic security, in light of our meeting on the topic on 23 October.  I propose that we note that correspondence.  Is that agreed?  Agreed. <\/p><p>We now turn to correspondence received by the committee.  Correspondence No. 2019\/542 is an email from Mr. Se&aacute;n Murphy, the manager of public affairs at the ESB, 23 October, advising that ESB eCars plans to introduce pricing to support electric vehicle, EV, network expansion.  I propose that we note that correspondence.  Is that agreed?  Agreed. <\/p><p>Correspondence No. 2019\/545 is an email from the policy adviser to the joint committee, attaching an article from the <i>Sunday Business Post<\/i>, published on 2 November, on the school bus scheme, which refers to a meeting of the joint committee.  That has been circulated for the information of members.<\/p><p>Correspondence No. 2019\/546a is an email from our Vice Chairman, Deputy Kevin O'Keeffe, attaching for the consideration of the committee No. 2019\/546b, a letter from Mr. Niall McCarthy, managing director of Cork Airport, regarding statements made at a joint committee meeting.  Deputy O'Keeffe is not here at the moment but he may raise this when he comes in, with the agreement of other members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019112700002#B00100","speaker":"1329"},{"type":"speech","time":1574812800,"counter":1243,"content":"<p>Did the CEO of Cork Airport write to us directly as well?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019112700002#B00200","speaker":"1346"},{"type":"speech","time":1574812800,"counter":1244,"content":"<p>He wrote to Deputy O'Keeffe-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019112700002#B00300","speaker":"1329"},{"type":"speech","time":1574812800,"counter":1245,"content":"<p>As Vice Chairman.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019112700002#B00400","speaker":"1346"},{"type":"speech","time":1574812800,"counter":1246,"content":"<p>Yes, because he chaired the meeting in question.

As of today - I am conscious we were all celebrating a good performance of Ireland last week - we are the only country in the world not supporting soccer in any way financially at this time.  I think that it would be worth discussing and that the committee would develop a position that the funding could be made available, be it week-to-week, month-to-month, quarter-to-quarter, with additional oversight, if necessary from this committee or, if not, by Sport Ireland or whomever satisfies the Minister.

There is funding for soccer by way of capital grants.  It is not direct funding for the non-commercial side that was there heretofore.

Looking at that organisation now, it is not recognisable in comparison to what was there heretofore.

As we initially noted when the committee issued its invitation, we are not yet in a position, as requested, to discuss the specifics of proposed legislation to deal with the emergence of personal powered transporters, PPTs, as no such legislation is proposed at this time.  However, insofar as we can assist the committee to develop its understanding and appreciation of the issues which developments in this area raise, we welcome the opportunity to engage with the members.  It is, I may say, an important and positive development to see the committee take such a forward-looking approach to its work.<\/p> <p>  The use of devices such as e-scooters, Segways, electric skateboards, powered mini-scooters, electric unicycles and non-pedal assisted electric bicycles on the streets and roads of cities has become more common across the world in the past few years.  These various devices are often collectively classified as powered personal transporters.  Because many such vehicles are not easily defined in law, their regulation, particularly in terms of safe usage on public roads and other public places where they interact with other modes of transport, varies considerably from country to country and indeed, in federal jurisdictions, within countries.  The notable upsurge in the number of e-scooters used in many of the main cities in Europe and the US has focused recent discussions regarding their numbers, collisions, how and where they can be used and by whom, and the criteria in respect of the vehicles themselves.  There have been particular concerns where private operators have started to offer these items for hire on the side of the street by means of mobile phone apps, without having any regard to the regulatory or physical environment in which they are doing so, but not only in such circumstances.  This upsurge has been driven by new private firms, typically owned by venture capital and other private equity funds, and by a rapid increase in the production of the items by manufacturers primarily based in China.  A number of main cities have moved to introduced controls to restrict their numbers and to control and even license their use.  In some cases, cities have moved to ban their use, either for hire or more generally, because of the adverse impact experienced and risks associated.<\/p> <p>  In this country, section 3 of the Road Traffic Act 1961 classifies such vehicles as mechanically propelled vehicles, MPVs.  Mechanically propelled vehicles cannot be driven on public roads or in public places without the appropriate driving licence, tax and insurance.  Due to the multiplicity of forms of PPTs and lack of established standards, they do not fall within the categories which we currently use for such purposes.  It is therefore not permissible to tax or insure them and no category of our EU-based driving licence covers their use.  Therefore, despite some opinions expressed to the contrary, there is no legal grey area and they are not considered eligible for use on a public road or in a public place.  Such an approach is also that of a number of other countries, including our neighbours in the United Kingdom.<\/p> <p>  E-scooters and other forms of PPTs are treated differently in other countries.  In the UK, they fall under the definition of a motor vehicle, similar to our MPV, and their use is still illegal on all UK roads, cycle lanes and pavements, although they may be used on private property.  Riders found using them in a public place are subject to a &pound;300 fine and six points on their driving licence should they hold one.  Germany has recently taken a different approach.  There they are classified as personal light electric vehicles.  I am afraid I do not know the German for that.  These have recently been provided for by the personal light electric vehicles regulations, introduced on 6 June 2019, which legalised their use.  Users must be aged 14 or over and vehicles must be registered and insured.  There are stringent testing procedures and conditions regarding their use.  Much of this reflects the broad civil law environment where, as a lecturer told me many years ago, anything that is not specifically permitted is forbidden.  Everything is very tightly regulated in these environments.  <\/p> <p>  Arising from public discussion on the question of providing for legislation to deal with the emergence of PPTs on our roads and footpaths, the Minister, Deputy Ross, requested the Road Safety Authority, RSA, to conduct research into the use of e-scooters in other countries, taking account of the implications for the interaction of such vehicles with other vulnerable road users along with other normal vehicular traffic.  The RSA commissioned Transport Research Laboratories, TRL, of the UK to carry out this research on its behalf.  TRL recommended that if the Minister were minded to provide for their use, the use of such vehicles could be allowed in certain circumstances, with controlled and considered roll-out to mitigate against potential negative safety implications.  The RSA also recommends that a restrictive approach be taken when regulating the use of such vehicles.  I will not recap the details because the RSA will be touching on them in its opening statement.  The RSA also stressed that the suitability of our infrastructure is a critical factor in considering whether to allow the use of these vehicles.<\/p> <p>  A number of the recommendations in the RSA report raise fairly fundamental legislative and other legal and indeed practical issues.  Clearly, the additional administration required for licensing and so on would have to be funded, presumably by those who wish to avail of these vehicles.  The question then arises as to where such regulation properly should lie - the report refers to both local and national regulation - and of course as to whether any such regulation can be effectively enforced, if at all.  There are other key resource questions to be considered.  These include the implications in terms of additional infrastructure and its cost, and most of all there are a number of opportunity costs to be considered.  These include the potential loss of road space for other sustainable modes, such as public transport, walking and cycling, which are already highly competitive modes in urban areas.  Some Deputies from the Dublin area would, I imagine, note how contentious issues around road space have proved in regard to recent plans for public transport.  Other opportunity costs are the potential diversion of Garda resources to enforce these vehicles from wider enforcement of the law; and of course the general question of which sectors would lose out if additional funding is required.<\/p> <p>  These issues are to some extent reflected in the views of the National Transport Authority, NTA, which had a look at the issue of e-scooters some time back and took the view that they should not be allowed on our roads.  That view was reached following consideration of a number of key issues, including the question of how the top speed is to be enforced as there are a number of options available to upgrade the vehicle&rsquo;s software that will increase the top speed to nearly 80 km\/h or 50 miles per hour for those of us who were taught in what one of my teachers called Christian units.  Other key issues include the suitability of their operation after dark, as the position of lights, particularly the rear lights, on existing models can be too low to be effectively seen by other vehicles sharing the road space; as well as the question of whether the onus will shift to road authorities to provide road surfaces suitable for tiny wheels as such an engineering requirement does not exist at present.  The NTA national cycle manual gives advice for road and street design based on the normal and expected road behaviour of existing road users and does not take account of e-scooters and so on.  This goes back to the issue of conflicting modes.<\/p><p>Our understanding is that these first came to be used by adults in the context of private firm and university campus environments in the west of the US where, very often, the standard of road surface is very high.  How will claims for compensation following accidents due to road surfaces, not to mind incidents involving other road users, be dealt with?  Given the size of the wheels on these vehicles, the speed at which they can travel and how prone they can be to imperfections in the road surface, including drains, their use could increase the number of claims taken against local authorities, which ultimately will reduce the resources available for road maintenance and improvement.  This is significant given the challenging budgetary situations faced by many local authorities.  These are valid concerns and must be taken into consideration when making decisions about legislating for or regulating these vehicles.  It is not a simple or straightforward matter of just legislating for them.  There are many factors to be considered and road safety is of paramount importance.  <\/p><p> At an EU level, anecdotal evidence on the high number of accidents is hardening, with many member states calling for technical harmonisation to improve the quality of the vehicles themselves.  As a consequence and recognising that the RSA and TRL, along with most researchers in this area, encountered significant difficulties in carrying out research due to a lack of robust evidence being available at this time, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport initiated a public consultation process which asked whether their use should be legalised.  The consultation process sought to investigate from a purely Irish perspective the conditions under which e-scooters and their like might be legislated for in this country, as well as the fundamental question as to whether the public interest, in terms of resources, public safety and sustainability would be served by legalising them.  The consultation concluded on 1 November and in excess of 500 submissions have been received.  The Department is currently examining those submissions with a view to submitting a comprehensive report to the Minister in early 2020 at the latest, at which time a decision will be made as to whether to amend existing legislation and if so, to what extent it should be amended.  <\/p><p> I am happy to answer any questions members may have but I will not claim to have hard answers, as noted in my statement.  This is an area in which sound, research based evidence is limited and we must rely on our best analysis of the facts that we do have.

I am accompanied by Ms Sharon Heffernan, senior researcher and Mr. Aidan McGinty, the RSA's vehicle standards engineer who is fast becoming the subject matter expert in the area of micromobility and e-scooters.<\/p> <p>  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport requested the RSA to research how e-scooters and other such vehicles are regulated in other countries, particularly in other EU member states.  A report was submitted by the RSA to the Department for the Minister's consideration.  I will summarise that report including the recommendations made by the RSA at that time.  I have also included some information on recent studies, events and publications for the committee's information. <\/p> <p>  In January 2019, the RSA commissioned the Transport Research Laboratory, TRL, a world leader in transport innovation and research, to review current practice and the safety implications of powered transporters.  Powered transporters were defined as a variety of novel personal transport devices which are mechanically propelled, that is, propelled by a motor, as well as or instead of being manually propelled.  These include devices such as electric scooters, commonly known as e-scooters, segways, hoverboards and powered unicycles.  The aim of this work was to inform considerations for future policy and regulatory framework updates by the RSA regarding the operation of powered transporters in Ireland.  To achieve this, TRL adopted a two-pronged approach, first completing a literature review and then a series of international case studies. <\/p> <p>  Following a stringent search and selection process, 45 items of literature relating to powered transporters were reviewed.  Although there was a noted lack of robust evidence available for review, the findings of the literature review indicated that policy and legislation should be developed to encourage the use of personal protective equipment such as helmets, when using powered transporters.  This could be completed via a targeted public awareness campaign and by placing responsibility with the powered transporter providers to promote safety.  It also indicated that training be undertaken by operators of powered transporters prior to their use in public, the specification of safety standards for powered transporters, for example, weight or size restrictions, minimum lighting and conspicuity standards, which could possibly be enforced through a type-approval system or certification process, as well as the specification of user requirements such as age limits, licence conditions and how and where the different devices can be used, for example footpaths, cycle paths or roads, and the rules for each of these. <\/p> <p>  It is important to note, however, that there is currently little evidence on which to base these proposed standards and requirements.  Although direct evidence is lacking, it was clear from the literature reviewed that these devices have potential benefits for active transport, reducing traffic congestion and improving air quality.  However, anecdotal evidence suggests that e-scooter-related injuries increase with greater e-scooter use.  It was also noted that regardless of legislation and enforcement in relation to powered transporters, in most countries there has been increased uptake by users and as such, an outright ban would not be practical to enforce. <\/p> <p>  Eleven countries were investigated for the case study portion of this report, including Ireland, the UK, the US, Germany, France, Switzerland, Spain, Belgium, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Australia and Israel.  Summaries were produced for each country in terms of current powered transporter-related legislation, if any, safety standards and policy recommendations, restrictions on usage including minimum age requirements, restrictions to certain roads and the next steps in those jurisdictions.  The findings of these case studies highlighted the difficulties being faced by regulators, policy makers and the public in respect of these devices.  In particular, there is a lack of consistency in how different types of powered transporters are being defined and named.  The same make and model of a device can have different names in different countries.<\/p><p>This kind of technology is developing at a rapid pace, such that some countries have had to take a reactive approach when developing and revising policy and legislation as usage and the legislative context changes.<br\/><br\/>On the Road Safety Authority's recommendations, in light of the findings of the report, recommendations were made to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport to guide the Minister if he was of a mind to legislate for the introduction of such devices.  The overall recommendation is that a restrictive approach be taken in terms of regulating for these devices in Ireland in the interest of road safety. Specifically, this means applying restrictions to the devices themselves, the operators who provide these, such as the names with which we are familiar already in other jurisdictions, the roads on which they can be used and the age of user.<br\/><br\/>Specifically, we recommended that consideration be given to the following items.  Electric personal mobility devices, including e-scooters, should be defined in legislation and, as such, any such definition should be sufficiently broad to be future-proof and to take account of legislation and the pace of development in this area of technology.  Consideration could be given to revising the classification of a mechanically propelled vehicle, MPV, or the creation of a new category of electric MPV, an eMPV.  Devices permitted on Irish roads should adhere to minimum safety standards, for example, a maximum speed of 20 km\/h.  In addition, design features for devices permitted on Irish roads should prioritise safety features such as brakes, lighting and audible warning mechanisms.  A review of the draft EU standard, CEN, could be considered in this context.  Some jurisdictions allow such devices on footpaths provided they do not exceed a speed of 6 km\/h.  However, from a practical perspective this would be very difficult to enforce, therefore, because of the risk these devices would pose to pedestrians if travelling at higher speeds, the recommendation is that they should not be used on footpaths.<br\/><br\/>There is merit also on safety grounds to limit their use to roads with a speed limit of 50 km\/h or less.  Ideally, they should not be allowed travel outside 30 km\/h zones.  They could be used in cycle lanes, where available.  A system should be put in place whereby device operators must seek a permit for leasing these devices, either from a national authority or a local authority.  They must adhere to certain guidelines, for example, the safety features of devices and the parking of devices while not in use.  These proposals need to consider congestion and street littering for the granting of a permit.  Each local authority should oversee compliance with these guidelines and mandate training as part of the permit approval process.  They could also limit the number of permits to ensure an over-proliferation of these devices does not occur because we cannot underestimate the volume of them in cities that have permitted them.<br\/><br\/>In some countries an age restriction applies to the user, depending on the power of the device.  This is a pragmatic approach that should be considered, for example, a minimum age of 16 for use of a device with a maximum speed of 20 km\/h.  This does not include, however, making personal protection equipment, PPE, mandatory.  Users should be encouraged to wear helmets and high visibility clothing, as per our recommendation for cyclists.<br\/><br\/>Rather than regulating for the use of these devices at national level, it may be appropriate for local authorities to pass by-laws to regulate for these as they also have powers to introduce by-laws in terms of speed zones, depending on the suitability of local infrastructure.  Local authorities will need to give consideration to the future-proofing of infrastructure to account for the growth in popularity of these devices.  <br\/><br\/>Overall, from a safety perspective, it is critical that Ireland&rsquo;s infrastructure is fit for purpose to accommodate the safe use of these devices and that dedicated parking spaces are provided or adequate collection measures are implemented, such as the city bikes systems, to avoid a proliferation of hazards on pavements or roads and cycle lanes.  The Transport Strategy for the Greater Dublin Area 2016 - 2035 calls out the inadequacy of the current infrastructure in section 3.2.  Consideration must be given by transport planners to ensure the current infrastructure is enhanced for all vulnerable road users and capable of accommodating electronic personal mobility devices.<br\/><br\/>Finally, legislation will need to be considered to give An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na the necessary powers to enforce the safe and legal use of electric personal mobility devices, and any legislation will have to be enforceable.<br\/><br\/><b><\/b>With regard to personal transporters and casualties, from a safety perspective it is widely acknowledged, both nationally and internationally, that there is a lack of data in this area on collisions and injuries resulting from the use of powered transporters.  This is typically due to the difficulties in classifying the various powered transporter devices when they are captured in national collision data.  Definitive statistical information on safety and also mobility patterns, for example, modal shift and the proportion of modes that are being displaced by powered transporter trips, are needed to further inform policy and legislation regarding powered transporter use.  A series of studies referenced in the Transport Research Laboratory, TRL, report on electric personal mobility devices provides snapshots of injury rates from powered transporters.  For example, Kim <i>et al.<\/i>in 2018 reported that 65 patients were admitted to hospital in Korea between January 2016 to December 2017, while Do <i>et al<\/i>. in 2016 reported on 35 cases in the Canadian hospitals injury reporting system.  That was between 2015 and 2016.<br\/><br\/><b><\/b>There are other recent publications and events.  There was a micromobility conference in Ljubljana, in October.  A recent European Commission conference highlighted the need for renewed planning to ensure road safety as the popularity of these devices continues to grow.  Among the topics the conference participants discussed was the need to integrate micromobility solutions into public transport, such that they can be complementary to one another rather than replacing or displacing it.  Tailored infrastructure to accommodate this will likely be needed, which may be city or jurisdiction-specific.<br\/><br\/>The need for a minimum technical standard for powered transporters was also discussed, as was the recommendation that different modes of transport be kept separate to minimise potentially dangerous interactions with other road users.  It was suggested that over-regulation be avoided but that a common regulatory framework must be drafted which addresses safety aspects such as speed limitations, guidance for parking, minimum age requirements and technical requirements.<br\/><br\/><b><i><\/i><\/b>The European Transport Safety Council, ETSC, PIN Flash report 37, Safer Roads, Safer Cities: how to improve urban road safety in the EU, was published in June 2019.  It examined how best to reduce road traffic collisions that occur on urban roads, the majority of which involve vulnerable road users.  It focuses in part on the safety challenges facing cities and towns across Europe in light of the rapidly changing means that people are using to travel in urban environments.  The need for tailored infrastructure, education and awareness campaigns, and national legislation and city-level regulations to accommodate growing use of shared and personal powered transporters, is highlighted, as is the unfortunate lack of data to further inform policy and legislation regarding their usage.  Given the often restricted space in urban areas for travel, this must be used efficiently to ensure road users are not put at increased risk.<br\/><br\/>Key recommendations regarding the use of powered transporters, particularly e-scooters, included that traffic regulations on space sharing be defined, for example, whether e-scooters should travel on the pavement, cycle paths or on the roads with motorised traffic, that e-scooter collision data are collected, and that further research on the road safety implications of powered transporters be conducted.<\/p><p>A report by the International Transport Forum, ITF, in August 2019 considers how new, app-based mobility services, including car-sharing, bike-sharing and e-scooter sharing services, can be effectively regulated to ensure innovative forms of urban mobility deliver their full benefits for society while ensuring the safety of road users.  Based on an ITF round table discussion, this report discusses the various benefits, including cheaper, more comfortable and timely transport options and risks, including safety and security concerns and cluttering public spaces with bicycles, e-scooters and associated vehicles with app-based mobility services.  Among a series of recommendations, the authors propose that the broader urban policy environment is taken into account when designing regulations for app-based mobility services.  Mitigating greenhouse gas emissions, reducing congestion, improving air quality and enhancing mobility particularly through the promotion of active travel are of substantial societal benefit and regulatory design for mobility services should account for such factors.  In line with this, it is recommended that suitable infrastructure is invested in to ensure these benefits are maximised while reducing road user risk.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019112700002#E01300","nonspeaker":"Ms Moyagh Murdock","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1574812800,"counter":1285,"content":"<p>I will now move to members' questions.

We should bear in mind the transmission of views from the RSA's consultants, who are drawing on international experience.  I am referring to the question of what legislation would be entailed.  The Deputy will have had this experience with his.  It would be a matter of creating an environment for regulating the items and then a matter of regulating their use.  One could have a system whereby the items come under some sort of regulation, with or without a recognised standard.  Their use, and particularly where they can be used, could then be provided for, subject to a permissive by-law regime.  We would have to sit down, scope this out, work with our colleagues in the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel and consult our colleagues in the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  As the Deputy knows, the road traffic law code pertains to a mix of areas that are regulated nationally and at by-law level.  By-laws cover parking and one-way streets, for example.  Certainly, it is possible to have a mix of national and local regulations.  The other option would not be a common manoeuvre in the Irish context.  It would involve some kind of private legislation for a particular area.  In a sense, it would still end up with the same generic questions in terms of the vehicles themselves and so on.  I would not rule it out.  I am always slow to rule out an option until I have had a chance to draw out how it could work and its implications.  That is as much as I can say at this stage.  The aspect under discussion was a more surprising aspect of the conclusions but I believe it would be seen in the context of either the scope for a pilot or another context.  It relates to an earlier point we were making.  Not only is there the matter of how the user uses the vehicle but also the matters of the basic mechanical standards that need to be met and the safety fittings required.  Then the question arises as to what constitutes the best use of the road space that the vehicle might occupy.  Generally, the regulation of road space is led by local authorities.  There is, in a sense, a road-space aspect to this that might best be addressed at local authority level.  Equally, however, we do not want to put an excessive burden on local authorities.  It is a matter of striking a balance.  As ever, we are always trying to strike balances, accepting that we never come up with the perfect answer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019112700002#K02700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ray O'Leary"},{"type":"speech","time":1574812800,"counter":1378,"content":"<p>As Ms Murdock said, it could not be done now anyway as it would require a change to primary legislation.

This has totally to do with the Department of Justice and Equality and the Committee of Public Accounts and it is not relevant here but there is a link with enforcement given that many fines are road traffic fines.  The service is down by 38%, according its own figures.  Approximately &euro;27 million is outstanding.  There are in the region of 90,000 related court cases backed up.  We were trying to get our head around this at a meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts and we were asking how it could be.  It is not the fault of the Garda.  It is doing its job and the GoSafe vans are engaging in enforcement at the required level.  The issue, however, is with the Fines Act.  The Act was to ensure somebody who could not pay a &euro;50 fine because he or she did not have the means would not go to jail and would instead be able to do community service.  The Department of Justice and Equality was advised the measures could not be implemented.  In the meantime, there is the unintended consequence of a huge drop in enforcement.  Can the delegates help this committee in any way in this regard?  Clearly, we know we need to take the matter up with the Department of Justice and Equality and its Minister.  Is there any assistance the delegates could give us while they are here today?  If they cannot answer, that is 100% acceptable.

The hardest part is trying to manage the conflicts between different classes of users.  In a sense e-scooter users are somewhat in the same bracket as cyclists but they are also different.  On the one hand, they are vulnerable road users with respect to somebody in a larger mechanically propelled vehicle such as a motorbike, car, van, truck or bus in terms of the spaces those vehicles use but, on the other, they are potentially hazardous vehicles, whether stationary or moving in respect to particularly what one might call - this is not a technical term - the highly vulnerable user, including the person with a disability or mobility issues.  We need to be incredibly conscious of those users.<\/p> <p>  We were recently preparing a response to a parliamentary question from a Deputy and we did not have the detailed information to provide on how many people with disabilities are among those killed.

Austin Public Health published a joint epidemiological study with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the US.  The sample was small comprising 192 people who were injured in collisions while they were using an e-scooter.  However, there are findings on the types of injuries.  For instance, 48% of these people received head injuries, 35% sustained a bone fracture and almost half had some kind of severe injury.  They were interviewed and were asked for their view of what happened at the time of the collision.  Some 37% said that excessive scooter speed, for instance, may have contributed to the collision and 19% said they believed the scooter malfunctioned.

Clearly, it makes the lives of professionals dealing with the law much easier if the law code concerned is consolidated.  That might reflect the views of certain organisations.  We are not aware of any specific cases where the lack of consolidation caused prosecutions to fall.  We have looked at a few instances where similarly lengthy and complex law codes have been consolidated.  There are only two proper examples to date, namely the Companies Act and the Finance Act, both of which have limited criminal elements.

One involves putting the words together and the other involves tightening up legislation without changing the substance.

Given the scale of the road traffic law code and the investment of time required for any consolidation, that would be the best option in this case.

It is one of the things we would like to do, but we are also dealing with emerging technologies such as personal powered transport, issues around autonomous vehicles and unexpected international events such as Brexit.  Our legislative efforts are focused on responding to the fact that we are not meeting our road death targets, and we are, therefore, trying to strengthen the code on killing behaviours like intoxicants and speeding.  Given the resources we have, our legislative efforts have prioritised those areas.  I recently had a very informal discussion with some colleagues about this matter.  I am not making a commitment to the committee, but trying to show that this is something we think about.  We have been considering what do in the short term, not just tomorrow.  To start, we will probably need to think about getting somebody in to do some kind of project plan on this, if Deputy MacSharry will permit that.  It is worth noting that we have consolidated in previous iterations of the road traffic law.  For example, the drink driving code is consolidated, bar the most recent amendments.  There are elements where that has happened.  If one were to do a project plan for this, one would first take a part of the code and consolidate that.  There are models where it might be consolidated in phases as well as one big block.  There is a political bullet to bite in terms of the Oireachtas, Ministers and our own capacity to divert our resources to manage that.
