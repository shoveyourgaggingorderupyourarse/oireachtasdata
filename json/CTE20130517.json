Is it agreed that we begin in public session?  Agreed.  I remind members of the committee, witnesses and those in the Gallery, be they members of the media or members of the public, to ensure their mobile telephones are switched off for the duration of the meeting as they interfere with the broadcasting equipment even when they are on silent mode.  It is particularly unfair to members of staff who have to wear headphones.<\/p><p>  This is the first of the sessional meetings of the Joint Committee on Health and Children dealing with the heads of the protection of life during pregnancy bill.  The fundamental role of the Oireachtas is to enact legislation and in doing so it must act within the parameters set down by the people in the Constitution, Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann.  The Constitution is a living, dynamic document which is applied by the courts and ultimately interpreted by the Supreme Court.  It is within this framework that the Government and the Oireachtas must act.  Both are constrained by its provisions and neither can go beyond what is constitutionally prescribed.  In this context, the Government has asked the committee to discuss and analyse the Bill.  It has referred the heads of the Bill for our consideration and scrutiny.<\/p><p>  I thank committee members and those who have joined us for the duration of the meetings for their deliberations in advance.  I wish in particular to thank members of the committee from all parties and the Independents for their co-operation with me and the clerk in the composition of the hearings.  Our approach and the approach of the Government is that we will have analysis of the heads of the Bill over the next three days.  I hope we will do so in a manner that is calm, tolerant and respectful of each viewpoint expressed by Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas, committee members and witnesses.  I also hope that similar to other hearings we held on other legislative proposals that our deliberations will be constructive and will have a positive role to play in assisting the Government in the formulation of legislation.<\/p><p>  As part of our hearings it is important that we gather information and that we listen to and engage with the views of witnesses who have voluntarily given of their time to come before the committee to assist with the scrutiny of legislation.  I know that I speak for all of us on the committee when I say that I hope we will continue in the same vein and approach we took in the January hearings when the contributions were positive, helpful and courteous.  Given that we are discussing a very sensitive matter with diverse viewpoints, it is incumbent on all of us to be respectful of all of the views expressed within this Chamber.  I remind members that we are in the Chamber of Seanad &Eacute;ireann and as a consequence there is a responsibility on all of us to uphold the dignity of the Houses of the Oireachtas.<\/p><p>  This morning we will hear from the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, the chief medical officer, Dr. Tony Holohan, and we are also joined by Mr. Ambrose McLoughlin, the Secretary General of the Department of Health and Ms Geraldine Luddy.  I thank them for their presence this morning.  Over the course of the day I hope that our hearings will be positive, constructive and that all members of the committee and of the Oireachtas will engage in the analysis of the heads of the Bill in a dignified manner.  Each member will have three minutes for questions to the witnesses and the Chair will be impartial on adjudicating on the time allocated.  I ask each member to comply with the time constraints.  I do not wish to be in any way disrespectful to members but the ruling on time will be strict.<\/p><p>  Before we commence, I remind members and witnesses that witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they give to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter to only qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of the proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that where possible they should not criticise nor make charges against any person, persons or entity by name in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice or ruling of the Chair to the effect that they should not criticise, comment on or make charges against either a person or persons outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable. <\/p><p>  I call on the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, to make his opening remarks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013051700002#A00200","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1368779400,"counter":8,"content":"<p>Thank you, Chairman and members of the committee.  I am pleased to be present today to open the hearings on the general scheme of the protection of life during pregnancy Bill.  I look forward to the presentations of the invited guests.  I am confident the hearings will provide very useful input as we come to finalise drafting of the terms of the Bill.  I was struck by the balanced and respectful approach taken by all during the previous three days of hearings held by the committee in January, and I echo the Chairman's hope that the present hearings will be as productive.<\/p><p>  As all are aware, on 30 April the Government approved the drafting of the protection of life during pregnancy Bill 2013, subject to any technical amendments that may be deemed necessary following consultation with the Attorney General, and the publication of the general scheme of the Bill.  The general scheme aims to give effect to the Government's decision in December 2012 to legislate in this area within the parameters of Article 40.3.3&deg; of the Constitution, as interpreted by the Supreme Court in the X case, in order to implement the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in the A, B and C <i>v<\/i>. Ireland case.<\/p><p>  Before I proceed it is worth reminding ourselves of the findings of the judgment.  Three applicants, A, B and C, all of whom had crisis pregnancies, brought proceedings against Ireland before the European Court of Human Rights claiming violations of Articles 2, 3, 8, 14 and 13 of the European Convention on Human Rights.  In its judgment delivered on 16 December 2010 the Grand Chamber determined that there had been no violation of the convention in relation to the first and second applicants, Ms A and Ms B.  The Grand Chamber determined that there had been a violation of Article 8 of the Convention in relation to applicant, Ms C.  The court found that Ireland had failed to respect the Ms C's private life contrary to Article 8 of the convention, as there was no accessible and effective procedure to enable her to establish whether she qualified for a lawful termination of pregnancy in accordance with Irish law.  The aim of the general scheme is to provide such a procedure.  However, it is worth noting again that the issues at stake here are extremely complex and engage with fundamental rights.<\/p><p>  I will now go through the general scheme head by head.  I do not wish to pre-empt the committee's discussion but I am mindful that there might be issues still to be dealt with and my Department has already identified some provisions that might need to be revisited from a technical perspective.  Furthermore, some of the participants in the hearings might also have identified additional technical issues that might need examination.  I look forward to any suggestions that will lead to the improvement of the operation of the legislation.<br \/><b><\/b>Head<b><\/b>1 of the scheme deals with the interpretation of the Bill; it defines the meanings of some of the terms used for the purposes of the Bill, including appropriate location, reasonable opinion, and unborn.  Head 2 deals with the risk of loss of life from physical illness.  It provides that it is not an offence for a registered medical practitioner to carry out a medical procedure in the course of which, or as result of which, unborn human life is ended under certain circumstances.  These are that the procedure is carried out in an appropriate location and two medical practitioners registered on the specialist division of the Medical Council register have certified that in their reasonable opinion there is a real and substantial risk to the life, as opposed to the health, of a pregnant woman arising from a physical illness that can be averted only by a termination of pregnancy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013051700002#A00300","speaker":"952","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1368780000,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his opening remarks.

The Minister has already provided the background and a detailed presentation on the heads of the Bill.  I will begin by setting out the principles which underpin the legislation and commenting on matters of professional medical practice which arise in the context of these heads.  These guiding principles are derived from the work of the expert group chaired by Mr. Justice Sean Ryan of which I was a member.  It is important the committee understands these and how they guided the drafting of the heads.<\/p><p>  The first principle behind the general scheme is that it should provide legal clarity by way of legislation and regulations on the circumstances in which a termination of pregnancy is permissible, which is where there is a real and substantial risk to the life, as opposed to the health, of a woman.  The aim of the general scheme is to bring clarity to the existing situation.  As the Minister has already alluded to in his presentation, the scheme does not confer any new substantive rights to termination of pregnancy.  Rather, it provides for rights which already exist, within constitutional provisions and the Supreme Court judgment in the X case.  Its purpose is to confer procedural rights on a woman who believes she has a life-threatening condition, or whom others believe on her behalf she has a life-threatening condition, so she can have certainty as to whether she requires this intervention.<\/p><p>  The second principle underpinning the legislation is that the State will uphold the right to life of the unborn as far as practicable, as per the constitutional obligations in Article 40.3.3&deg;.  This means that where a woman has a pregnancy which places her life at risk and her foetus is or may be viable, she may have a right to have the pregnancy brought to an end but not a right to deliberately end the life of the foetus.<\/p><p>  The third principle is that termination of a pregnancy must be necessary to save the woman's life.  In these circumstances, termination of pregnancy will always be considered a medical intervention which operates within all the existing arrangements that pertain to other medical services and interventions, and standard medical practice should be adhered to as much as possible in its delivery.<\/p><p>  I should note, however, that certain additional requirements are considered appropriate due to the fundamental constitutional rights at stake here, namely, the right to life of the pregnant woman and the right to life of her unborn child.  The requirements provided for in the legislation include a process for assessment, a process which sets out the number of doctors required for this assessment, the process of certification, the locations where terminations might take place, a formal medical review process, and a notification system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013051700004#C00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tony Holohan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1368780600,"counter":14,"content":"<p>Thank you, Dr. Holohan.

In the context of an interruption to a pregnancy, a termination or an abortion - whichever terminology one wants to use - is there, or will there be, an obligation under this legislation, coupled with Article 40.3.3o of the Constitution, to vindicate the life of the unborn at whatever stage?  In other words, if there is an interruption to a pregnancy for emergency medical reasons, non-emergency medical reasons or in the context of assessment for self-destruction, is there always an obligation on the medical practitioners who will be carrying out that termination to make every effort to deliver the child alive and make every effort thereafter to sustain the child's life?  I would like to get clarity on that matter.<\/p><p>  In the context of the panel for assessment for self-destruction or suicide - the words sound very callous at times - we will have an obstetrician and two psychiatrists.  I want to get a flavour of how Dr. Holohan would see this particular panel working.  Will this just be a panel that will make the assessment and adjudication as to whether the woman's life is at serious risk because she is pregnant, or will there be a patient-professional relationship with the psychiatrists and obstetrician when they are assessing the woman for that?  In other words, do they just decide to assess her, make their decision and move on, or is there a type of patient-professional relationship on the panels themselves?<\/p><p>  Head 11 concerns reporting to the Minister.

We were informed only yesterday by e-mail at 4.30 p.m.  It is typical of the way this has been handled and I am very disappointed.  In the absence of the Minister, can our guests provide specific examples indicating how the heads of the Bill were influenced by the evidence presented at this committee during the hearings held last January, especially regarding the unanimous evidence presented at these hearings clearly indicating that abortion is not a treatment for suicidal ideation and that it is impossible to determine that a person is suicidal?<\/p><p>  As the Minister has left, this may be very unfair, but we have to ask the following question.  I heard the Minister interviewed on the radio recently and he indicated that a child who survived a termination and whose mother did not want to parent the child, him or her, that this child will be put into State care.  Yet the heads of the Bill which we are discussing here today make no provision for this eventuality whatsoever.

If I could describe how I think the panel might work in practice it might help in answering Deputy Kelleher's second question.  The likelihood, and by no means the only scenario that could arise, is whereby a GP, for example, who is visited by a pregnant woman who is expressing suicidal ideation, and who has concerns, may make a referral to a consultant psychiatrist for his or her expert assessment.  That psychiatrist may well then form a reasonable view that there is a genuine risk to her life, if he or she believes that to be the case.  The psychiatrist would then seek the opinion or involvement of a second psychiatrist to essentially corroborate that view.  If the view further extends to a potential requirement for an intervention such as a termination, they would then have to consult with or engage an obstetrician.  That would be the likely mechanism through which one would end up with three different doctors coming together to assess.  It is not a panel remote from the individual.<\/p><p>  This is very much about treating a woman whose life is at risk or where there is a belief that there is a real and substantial risk to her life.  We are placing a framework around the care the doctors who are caring for her will provide.  This is a medical service the woman is receiving, not a remote panel.  This is very much the group of doctors who are involved in caring for and looking after that woman in that situation.  The requirement for reporting will give rise to an ability on our part to produce some form of annualised reporting of numbers, potential indications and so on.  It will be open and available to us to have the information upon which we can make reports that people can use to assess the impact of the legislation.<\/p><p>  On Deputy Kelleher's first question, arising from the Constitution there is a clear duty upon doctors to make every effort to save the life of an unborn child where that is reasonable, feasible and practicable.  That is enshrined in current Medical Council guidelines.  While I would not in any sense seek to direct the council in the guidelines it would set out, I would expect that the council will, when any new legislation is prepared in this area, seek to update and change its guidance to set out that form of expectation.  There may well be room then for colleges, for example, to set out what that means in practice.  Without my saying this is what will happen, this will be very much open to obstetricians.  It might well be set out that there would be a requirement for a certain form of imaging to take place as part of the foetal assessment process.  That brings detail to what would be required to make an assessment of and take steps to vindicate the right to life of the unborn child.<\/p><p>  To answer Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in's first question, yes, we believe they fulfil the conditions set out in the expert group report.  My answer to Deputy Kelleher's question may help to answer Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in's question on head 4.  I would see the initial psychiatrist as the person who would be primarily looking after that individual person, but I would like to think, as I said in my opening statement, that the colleges would begin to set out guidance on the detail of medical practice that will arise to give effect to the services that will be governed by this broad framework of legislation.<\/p><p>  Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in raised the question of conscientious objection.  That is provided for in Medical Council guidelines.

They must make appropriate arrangements to ensure there is an appropriate onward referral.  They cannot simply step away from the care of that woman.

Clear evidence was given to the committee at our last hearings and, despite Dr. Holohan's comments, was unanimous.  All of the psychiatrists, including those who were pro-choice, stated that it was almost impossible to diagnose suicidal ideation.  According to a study in Britain, such a diagnosis was accurate in only 3% of cases, with 97% false positives.  In January, the committee received a submission from St. Patrick's University Hospital, whose staff are the recognised experts in this field.  It clearly stated that mental health professionals were unable to predict suicide and that no test or clinical assessment was valid or reliable in that regard.  It also stated that no evidence in the literature or from its own work indicated that the termination of pregnancy was an effective treatment for any mental health disorder or difficulty.<\/p><p>  Dr. Holohan will accept that no psychiatric evidence was presented to the court in the X case.  I am sure he will acknowledge that, in the interim, there have been significant advances in medical science that inform our knowledge today and indicate that abortion is not a treatment.

Regarding head 6, the Minister and Dr. Holohan referred to how the formal review pathway was in addition to, rather than in substitution for, a woman's seeking a second opinion.  If so, and I believe it should be the case, does it mean that a woman who is unsatisfied with the first decision can, instead of going through the appeals process, search for two other consultants until she gets a determination that suits her?  How will the system work in reality?<\/p><p>  On a related point - namely, suicidal ideation and self-destruction - two psychiatrists are required to make a determination of a risk of suicide.  The review process also involves two psychiatrists.  This country has only three perinatal psychiatrists.  In January, the committee heard evidence that no service was available to women outside Dublin.  The majority of women with suicidal ideation during pregnancy want to give birth to healthy babies.  Will we spread limited resources thinly and concentrate on a small cohort to the neglect of women who have serious mental health issues?  Will the witnesses assure members of the committee that adequate resources will be provided to treat those women with suicidal ideation who want to continue their pregnancies?<\/p><p>  In Dr. Rhona Mahony's evidence to the committee in January, she asked whether a \"substantial risk to life during pregnancy\" was \"a 10%, a 50%, an 80% or a 1% risk of dying\".

It is not proposed by any stretch that the obstetrician has expertise or a function in assessing suicidal ideation.  That is not the reason for the obstetrician's being a part of the certification process.  The Supreme Court test requires that, first, the criterion of a real and substantial risk to the life of the woman be satisfied and, second, the termination is necessary to save her life.  This assessment can be made only by an obstetrician.  As the Minister stated, it requires, in part, an assessment of the foetus's viability and such matters.<\/p><p>  The obstetrician might be the person who carries out a necessary termination.  It would not be workable if this process of certification of necessity did not involve the person carrying out the termination.  Therefore, we require two psychiatrists, for the purpose of creating greater certainty around some of the uncertainties to which we referred that arise in the assessment of suicidal ideation, and an obstetrician for those reasons that I have just indicated.  They all form part of the process of certification.  We are not in any sense suggesting that obstetricians have miraculously found a capacity to assess suicidal ideation.<\/p><p>  I presume the Senator was referring to a minor rather than an infant.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013051700007#F00900","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tony Holohan"},{"type":"speech","time":1368781800,"counter":32,"content":"<p>I am sorry; yes.

Is that overly restrictive, particularly in view of the possibility that they will be dealing with minors, who ideally will have to see a child or adolescent psychiatrist, and the fact that the maternity hospitals in Dublin are not part of a general hospital with a big psychiatric department attached?<\/p><p>  My second question relates to the review provided for in head 6.  Seven days seems unduly long where a woman is seeking to vindicate her right to life.

It falls foul of the Constitution in terms of creating a criminal offence that is too vague and broad in its current drafting.  I also suggest that the woman concerned should not be criminalised.

In respect of the definition of appropriate location, the intention is that the service be provided through all of the 19 public obstetric units in the country.  It will not be possible under the heads as proposed for organisations that are not governed - and I use that word loosely - by HIQA and its framework, which is the 2007 Act, to be involved in the provision of these services.  Without going into the names of individual organisations, some of those mentioned by Deputy Fitzpatrick are not so governed as things stand.<\/p><p>  In respect of the care of children, I think I answered the question earlier by saying that the same obligation arises.  If there are children who require care, there are other pieces of legislation that govern the situation.<\/p><p>  In respect of Deputy Healy's question on viability and gestational age, the legislation is silent on gestational age.  I know there has been a substantial amount of media and public comment on that particular point.  We believe the making of an assessment as to the viability of a pregnancy is best placed in the hands of the doctors who are making the assessment.  It does not mean that we believe doctors - who have a duty, as I noted earlier, to vindicate the right to life of the unborn child - are going to engage in what might be termed late-term terminations.  The situation that currently pertains is that doctors will see patients as things stand, where, perhaps as a consequence of suicidal ideation or some physical illness, it is necessary and indicated that a early delivery take place.  That is something that happens in the here and now and perhaps gives rise to children being born at an earlier time than might otherwise be the case.  This legislation does not change that situation in any way.  Issues relating to assessment of the health and viability of the foetus are subject to change as obstetric and neonatal practice improve so it is appropriate and prudent that we would not enshrine specific time periods in the legislation but rather to leave it to doctors to make that assessment in the individual situation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013051700009#H00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tony Holohan"},{"type":"speech","time":1368783000,"counter":52,"content":"<p>Deputy Healy may speak regarding a point of clarification.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013051700009#H00600","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1368783000,"counter":53,"content":"<p>The point I was raising concerned fatal foetal abnormality.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013051700009#H00700","speaker":"960"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1368783000,"counter":54,"content":"<p>I apologise if I misunderstood the Deputy's question.

Dr. Holohan stated that the guiding principles which underpin the legislation derived from the work of the expert group.  It is very important that the origin of the principles has a sound foundation.  For the past few months I have been trying to get some information through parliamentary questions and the parliamentary party but I have not been able to access it.  I want clarification on the terms of reference of the expert group and the paragraph on page 8 of that report where Mr. Justice Ryan states:<blockquote>The only brief that the Minister gave this Group was to deal with the requirements of the European Court of Human Rights judgment and to advise the Government on how to give effect to existing constitutional provisions.<\/blockquote>That appears to contradict the terms of reference if it is the only brief the Minister gave this group.  I want to know whether the Minister briefed the chairman of the group separately or did anyone brief him or has the judge misinterpreted his terms of reference?  I sought to have Mr. Justice Ryan come before the committee but he was not one of those chosen.  It is important to clarify that point.<\/p><p>  In addition, based on responses to parliamentary questions that I tabled, it appears that nominations to that group were sought from various bodies but those forwarded by the Irish College of General Practitioners, the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and the College of Psychiatry were not the ones accepted.  I would like clarification on that because I may be incorrect, although in the case of the College of Psychiatry the nominees certainly were not in the group because I heard Dr. McCarthy say in interview that the college's nominee was not picked.  Why were these nominees not picked?  Who was picked instead and who nominated those people?<\/p><p>  We were told that the purpose of these hearings is to inform the legislation.  I sat through the hearings in January and the clear message that came through to me was that termination is not a treatment for suicidal intent.  Dr. Holohan said that would be very rare.  From the evidence we received, it seems that the ratio for this is 1:500,000.  Weighed against that, the assessment can be inaccurate in 97% of cases and termination is not a treatment for suicidal intent, yet head 4 puts this into the legislation.  Is there any point in our listening to evidence presented at these hearings when the legislation does not reflect what happened at the hearings or are we just going through a charade?<\/p><p>  Do we have any statistics on minors in the care of the HSE who come before the court and go abroad for terminations on the grounds of suicidal intent?  Those statistics must be available somewhere and, if so, are they accessible?<\/p><p>  With regard to the issue of conscientious objection, if, for example, staff in a hospital in Ballinasloe or Tralee or wherever decide that they will avail of this clause, where does that tie-in with the fact that the hospital cannot avail of that facility?

Deputy Mitchell O'Connor referred to opening the floodgates and that is a genuine fear of people who are probably not prisoners of either extreme in this debate.  There is a provision under heads 10 and 11 for an accountability structure to give the Minister an anonymised version of numbers of applications, etc., but there is no role envisaged in the heads for the Houses of the Oireachtas to be informed, consulted or asked for their opinion on this information.  Can Dr. Holohan tell me whether there is resistance at any level in his Department to bolstering and enhancing that review mechanism and involving the Houses of the Oireachtas?  Section 18 of the Offences against the State Act 1998, for example, provides that the relevant section \"ceases to be in operation\" on and from a particular date \"unless a resolution has been passed by each House of the Oireachtas resolving that that section should continue in operation\".  Would it not be appropriate, in order to allay the floodgates fear, to put a structured review mechanism into the legislation to ensure its continued operation, particularly in respect of head 4 making provision for termination on the grounds of suicidal intent?  I heard the witnesses say that termination is not an appropriate treatment for suicidal intent.  I note Dr. Holohan's comments about the numbers which I hope are correct but we do not know.  We are fallible so we may get it wrong.  Given the fears about the appropriateness of the treatment and the international experience which shows that people in good faith introduced legislation to cover mental health grounds that was subsequently exploited, would such a review not be appropriate?  I would like to hear Dr. Holohan's comments on that point.<\/p><p>  Article 40.3.3&deg; refers to the equal right to life of the mother and child.  Under heads 4 and 6 there is provision for an application for a termination on the grounds of suicidal ideation and under head 6 the pregnant mother is entitled to an appeals process if her original application is not granted.  Given that Article 40.3.3&deg; provides for an equal right to life, would it not be an appropriate provision, under either or both heads but particularly head 6, that some authorised officer of the State &ndash; I have suggested elsewhere that this might be Dr. Holohan &ndash; would be empowered to appeal a decision, also to that body, if the right to a termination was granted because all of this has to tie-in with Article 40.3.3&deg; and the equal right to life?

It certainly illustrates the difference between the notion of a hearing and an inquiry.<\/p><p>  I did not quite understand the answer that Dr. Holohan gave in regard to a review in terms of the equal right to life of the unborn.  Given that the unborn is a constitutionally protected actor, why is there not the requirement that there would be a voice, an advocate for the unborn, to test whether the initial certification is even necessary by the definitions provided?  <\/p><p>  Dr. Holohan referred to the third principle, that termination of pregnancy is always a medical intervention.  Is there any other example he can give where doctors are called on to make a certification of a procedure in the absence of any evidence-base, particularly where it has such far-reaching consequences, fatal and final consequences, for a constitutionally protected actor?  It was clear that there is no evidence that abortion is a treatment for suicidal ideation.  There was unanimity on that point at the hearings.  <\/p><p>  Dr. Holohan suggests that the only reason that we have head 4 is that the Supreme Court requires that we make provision for this, but surely he is aware of the separation of powers and that it remains the prerogative of the Oireachtas, of the Legislature, not to activate an interpretation of the Constitution by the Supreme Court where it would consider that to do so would be dangerous and unjust.  It was for that reason that we did not have legislation and why the former Taoiseach, John Bruton, said he would not legislate for the X case because it would have the effect of bringing abortion into Ireland.  That is a legal point but I am sure it is one on which Dr. Holohan has taken advice.<\/p><p>  I also note that Dr. Holohan said that the numbers were quite likely not to be significant.  Will he accept, however, that the consequences will be very significant for whatever children are involved?  I refer in particular to head 4.  <\/p><p>  The subjective nature of the psychiatric assessment is one Dr. Holohan acknowledged in his presentation.  Given that subjective nature, has he had any regard to the experience of other jurisdictions such as California and New Zealand where similar apparently extremely tight grounds were set up in the area of mental health - with we should note suicidal ideation being an even more subjective issue to assess - and where it was noted, even by the Californian Supreme Court, that it was surprising the extent of abortions that took place on foot of that?  <\/p><p>  Will Dr. Holohan accept that, in reality, the only checks and balances he is talking about is that there will be two psychiatrists and that the obstetrician will have no role in disputing whether the abortion is necessary to end the real and substantial risk and will have a role only in the mechanics of carrying out the abortion and other related physical issues?  Therefore, the only check and balance will be one psychiatrist backed up by another, two people who have a psychiatric qualification in an area that is subjective. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013051700011#K00200","speaker":"1146"},{"type":"speech","time":1368784200,"counter":71,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Holohan for his presentation.  I want to go straight to the heart of this matter.  We are here to uphold the Constitution which provides for the equal right and value of lives of mothers and children.  Two points in the discussions this morning come to mind.  The first is a question raised, in the first instance, by Deputy Mattie McGrath, which has not been adequately answered.  I will read it again.  Deputy McGrath asked can the Minister provide specific examples indicating how the heads of the Bill were influenced by the evidence presented to this committee during the hearings held in January, especially in regard to the unanimous evidence presented at those hearings indicating that abortion is not a treatment for suicidal ideation or intent and that it is impossible to determine with any degree the probability that a person is in fact suicidal.  There are other aspects to the scheme of arrangement with which I am not happy.  Words are not being used correctly.  I refer, for instance, to the risk to the life of the mother as opposed to the health, there is no opposition between the life and the health, it is &quot;as distinct from&quot;.<\/p><p>  On a careful, robust and rigorous reading of the document Dr. Holohan produced, I do not believe one would understand the impression it gives.  I believe that the discipline of rigorous thought and rigorous appraisal has been lost in this debate and the consequences for Ireland, its people, its mothers and its daughters are far too important to be racing into this.  We have to be very clear.  It is very clear, even from Dr. Holohan's paper, that the medical profession, with its current peer reviews and peer checks and balances, is carrying on very well with a duty of care - that word &quot;care&quot; coming from the words &quot;heart&quot;,<i><\/i>&quot;core&quot; - not measurement, rulers or calibration, but care and intent.<\/p><p>  Deputy Timmins is correct in his comments about the base and foundation of the expert group and so on.

It is a very important question relating to the expert group.  We are here because of the decisions taken by the expert group, of which Dr. Holohan was a member.  The expert group was given three terms of reference, which gave it a broad spectrum of decision-making powers, yet in its report as presented by Mr. Justice Ryan, it is indicated that the Minister had provided only one briefing for the group in which the solution or solutions the group could offer were confined.  I ask Dr. Holohan to clarify the position.  I have tried to clarify it directly with the Minister at the parliamentary party meeting.  Apparently, there has been a parliamentary question.  Was the expert group advised or briefed on the type of solution it would bring forward?  The terms of reference are broad, yet we have been advised of this briefing by the Minister that the answer would have to be within the confines of the X case judgment.  It is very important that we know.  We are debating the heads of the Bill because of the expert group's report.  I am worried that the expert group's hands were tied in order to bring about a pre-designed answer.  Dr. Holohan sat at the table.

The IMC is a statutory body with responsibility for the regulation of doctors in Ireland.  Its purpose is to protect the public by promoting and ensuring the highest standards among doctors.  In the interests of patient safety and the protection of the public, the IMC has been vested by the Oireachtas with responsibility to ensure that only those doctors with the necessary education, training and skills are registered to practice in the State.  The IMC also specifies standards of practice for doctors in the areas of professional conduct and ethics.  The IMC provides principles-based guidance to doctors on matters relating to conduct and ethics in its <i>Guide to Professional Conduct and Ethics for Registered Medical Practitioners<\/i>.  The seventh edition of the guide was published in 2009, following extensive consultation with doctors, the general public, medical schools, post-graduate medical training bodies, Departments, employers and a range of other stakeholders.<\/p><p>  While doctors are expected to adhere to the IMC's guide in their professional practice, it is important to note that it is not a legal code.  In drafting its ethical guidance, the IMC sought to incorporate and reference relevant legislation to ensure that doctors would be aware of the legal framework within which they operate.  The guide is a principles-based document which must be relevant to each of the approximately 18,000 doctors registered to practice in Ireland, regardless of specialty, interest or discipline.  It covers issues as diverse consent, confidentiality, end-of-life care, clinical trials, prescribing practices and referral of patients.  It has been designed to support doctors in decision-making with regard to conduct and ethics and to complement other sources of clinical guidance developed by professional bodies, expert groups, the HSE and others.  While the IMC's guidance sets out the principles which are the cornerstone of each doctor's practice, it is the role of expert bodies and employers to devise procedures and protocols for use by doctors in day-to-day practice.<\/p><p>  The IMC has a number of general comments on certain matters arising in relation to the heads of the protection of life during pregnancy Bill in respect of which provision must be made in primary legislation or by way of regulations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013051700014#O00200","nonspeaker":"Professor Kieran Murphy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1368786900,"counter":152,"content":"<p>I also welcome Ms Caroline Spillane, chief executive officer of the Medical Council.

As such, the IOG has a compelling interest in the contents of the final Bill.  We have a responsibility to ensure it will be the best way to protect women's' health and lives, and also allow for the necessary flexibility to cater for future advances in obstetrics.<\/p><p>  Maternal health services in Ireland are among the best in the world and pregnant women and their families should be reassured that they are receiving the very best of care during pregnancy.  Recent accurate figures have been collected in Ireland in the past three years which show that approximately one woman per 12,000 pregnancies dies in pregnancy.  This low rate compares very well with that in the United Kingdom and the rest of Europe.  However, we are never complacent and it is our absolute priority to ensure pregnant women receive the very best of care.  To maintain these high standards and improve on them, we need to continue to adequately resource maternity services.  The situation where termination of pregnancy or delivery of a very premature baby is required in order to avert a substantial threat to the life of the mother is rare, although these situations do occur.  The heads of the Bill provide a process that can be accessed to deal with this rare clinical situation when there is a concern about maternal life.  This process will require underpinning with robust multidisciplinary guidelines from the Department of Health and the HSE; input will be required from the Royal College of Physicians, the Royal College of Surgeons, the College of Psychiatrists of Ireland, the College of Anaesthetists of Ireland, the Irish College of General Practitioners, An Bord Altranais, the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation to mention a few.  Robust Medical Council guidelines will also be required.<\/p><p>  At all times we remain acutely aware of the potential negative consequences for the unborn when cessation of pregnancy is necessary to protect maternal life.  We highlight the fact that enormous additional challenges to clinical management arise when termination is being considered in gestations approaching foetal viability but still extreme prematurity.  In current practice, all efforts are exhausted within medical margins of safety to prolong the pregnancy in the foetal interest.  Additionally, once the baby reaches a stage when it can survive, it is current practice that every effort is made to support the life of the baby after birth, if medically appropriate.  We do not see this Bill in any way providing for late terminations, nor the destruction of the baby and our members would not support this.  These are complex difficult cases and a multidisciplinary team approach is required.  However, obstetricians are the experienced clinicians in the care of pregnant women and should be central to the assessment of sick pregnant women and any decision-making process when there is a substantial risk to the mother's life.<\/p><p>  In this submission we represent the majority view within obstetrics and gynaecology in Ireland following a planned, structured consultative process.  In preparation of this opinion on the heads of the Bill we used the content of our positional paper from January 2013, the final text of which had been approved by the institute and circulated to all of our members.  Following a request for an opinion on the protection of life during pregnancy Bill, an initial draft was considered and discussed in detail by the executive of the institute and the final text was approved at a meeting on 7 May.  The final version has been circulated to all members.  In addition, direct contact was made with representatives of all maternity units for comments directly on this document.  The response overall was supportive of the institute's written submission.<\/p><p>  A number of areas require amendment and the following are the main points.  Our full opinion is contained in the written submission.  We propose adding a definition of \"termination\" under head 1.  When there is a real and substantive threat to the life of a pregnant woman, the gestation at which the pregnancy is interrupted is the critical factor influencing outcome for the unborn.  We suggest restricting the use of the term \"termination\" to situations where there is no chance of survival after birth such as when a pregnancy is ended before a foetus is viable.  The definition of \"obstetrician-gynaecologist\" for pragmatic reasons will need to be expanded to include those acting in the role of consultant obstetrician-gynaecologist who may be on the general medical register rather than in the specialist division.  All Government approved general hospitals, including the 19 maternity hospitals, will need to be regarded as suitable venues to provide these procedures, as necessary.  Pregnant women with a severe illness requiring specialised inpatient treatment are often cared for in a general hospital setting with access to coronary care and intensive care units.  General hospitals, therefore, must be included.  Failure to make these two changes could result in delays in accessing life saving treatment in pregnancy and it is the institute's opinion that they must be made.<\/p><p>  Under head 2, in  non-emergency situations, whatever the indication, two obstetricians-gynaecologists must be involved in the decision-making process; one obstetrician would be required to examine the patient and sign the documentation and the support of a second obstetrical opinion sought.  In addition, where the condition warrants but only then, other consultants on their own specialist register form a team assessment.<\/p><p>  With regard to head 3, we accept that, although consultation between two obstetricians-gynaecologists is desirable in the acute emergency case, this may not always be possible and a single opinion would suffice.  It is the institute's view that emergency procedures should only be carried out in a hospital setting and I suggest changing the term \"health facility\" to \"hospital setting\".<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013051700016#Q00400","nonspeaker":"Professor Fionnuala McAuliffe","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1368787500,"counter":156,"content":"<p>Our next speaker, representing the Irish College of General Practitioners, is Dr. Margaret O'Riordan, medical director.

This is an extremely important Bill.  The college welcomes the opportunity to be involved in the legislative discussions.<\/p><p>  The general practitioner has a key role in supporting women during pregnancy.  By way of introduction, I am a general practitioner and medical director of the Irish College of General Practitioners.  I am accompanied by Dr. Seamus Cryan, president of the Irish College of General Practitioners, Dr. Darach O'Ciardha, chair of communications, and Mr. Kieran Ryan, chief executive officer.<\/p><p>  Established in 1984, the Irish College of General Practitioners is responsible for postgraduate specialist medical education, training and research in the specialty of general practice.  The college also provides an extensive range of practice management services focused on the effect of organisation of general practice.  The college has a national advisory role in relation to clinical standards and it interacts regularly with the number of bodies, including the Medical Council, the Department of Health, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, the Health Service Executive and the Health Information and Quality Authority, among others.<\/p><p>  As a membership organisation, the Irish College of General Practitioners is responsible for providing continuing medical education for established general practitioners, who number more than 2,500 at present.  The mission of the college is to serve the patient and its members, general practitioners, by encouraging and maintaining the highest standards of general medical practice.  The core values of the college are quality, equity, access and service to the patient.  The college has provided guidance for its members on the management of crisis pregnancy since 1995 and the latest guidance is available on open access on the college&rsquo;s website.<\/p><p>  At this point I would like to clarify that I am representing the specialty of general practice.  Individual general practitioners have diverse views on this issue.<\/p><p>  In the majority of cases, a termination of pregnancy is a decision taken as a last resort and in great distress.  The college believes that the structures, resources and systems to support women during a crisis pregnancy should be enhanced.  There is a need to improve access to social supports, counselling and psychology services.  Perinatal psychiatry should be a priority for the Government in supporting women in crisis pregnancy.<\/p><p>  The general practitioner is usually the first point of contact a pregnant woman has with the health service.  The general practitioner has a key role in supporting women during pregnancy.  All pregnant women are entitled to free antenatal care under the mother and infant scheme.<\/p><p>  Current obstetric practice does not place a patient in the care of an obstetrician until 16 to 20 weeks gestation.  General practitioner care is immediately available to every pregnant woman, and general practitioners routinely play a supportive role to women through the provision of antenatal and postnatal care.  The general practitioner has knowledge of the woman's past medical and psychological health and of her social supports.  In many instances, this knowledge extends over a number of years.  General practitioners view every patient as an individual and care for them in their unique circumstances.  Therefore, the general practitioner has a vital role in the assessment of risk.  This role is supported by the expert group's report, which suggested \"it may be appropriate that general practitioners are consulted as a matter of best practice in the course of the diagnostic process.  This would provide access to their knowledge of the patient and establish continuity of care for the woman after the treatment has been delivered\".<\/p><p>  Consultation with a general practitioner should take place only with the woman's consent, and the importance of confidentiality should be emphasised in all aspects of the Bill.  The current heads of the Bill could be strengthened in this regard.  The legislation should not be enacted until a specific, well-defined referral pathway is in place with appropriate professional support.  General practitioners will usually be the first persons to whom a woman with a crisis pregnancy presents, and they will need to know exactly how to refer the woman in a timely manner.

We have a very short period of time so I will try to be brief.  I have questions rather than opinions, and would welcome hearing opinions on my questions.<\/p><p>  In terms of GPs having conscientious objections, should there be an obligation on a GP, when a patient arrives at a surgery and has reason to believe there is a substantial risk to her life because of pregnancy, to inform her of his or her conscientious objection to a termination of pregnancy in the context of a threat to life by suicide or physical health grounds?  According to the Bill, when a woman presents to the panel or review group comprising an obstetrician and two psychiatrists, there is a provision whereby a GP can be informed if she so wishes but, equally, the GP is not informed if she declines.  Who will provide aftercare treatment for a woman who goes before a panel which deems that her life is at real and substantial risk for physical or mental reasons?  If the woman does not want her GP to be made aware of that, where in the Bill should there be some obligation for aftercare to be provided without her GP being informed of the termination?  Clearly, a certain amount of aftercare would be required in that context.<\/p><p>  I refer to the comments of Professor McAuliffe.  We need clarity.  An issue which has been spoken about around the country is foetuses on the cusp of viability.  Does an obstetrician, in making a decision about an intervention for physical or mental reasons to save the life of the mother, take into account the viability of the foetus?  If he or she can delay intervention for a number of days or weeks without further threat to the life of the mother, is that taken into account?  I refer to the two patient approach which has often been spoken about.  Is foetal viability of secondary consideration?  Many people are agitated and confused about current medical practice.  Article 40.3.3&deg; is quite clear and specific in that there is an obligation to make every effort to vindicate the life of the child.  I ask the witnesses to elaborate on current medical practice in maternity units throughout the country.<\/p><p>  I note the comments of Professor Murphy.  The IMO guidelines in 2009 included the risk of suicide as grounds for termination in the State.  Is that based on clinical evidence or is it because of the legal obligations under the current Constitution, as interpreted by the X case?  Do our maternity hospitals currently have the physical and personnel capacity to implement the Bill if it is passed with the current heads?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013051700019#T00300","speaker":"983"},{"type":"speech","time":1368788700,"counter":166,"content":"<p>I thank each of the witnesses.  Unfortunately, the time allowed will not allow us to question each of them and elaborate but their contributions are very valuable. <\/p><p>  I ask Professor McAuliffe to answer a question on the risk of loss of life due to physical illness.  She talked about two medical practitioners, one of whom shall be an obstetrician or gynaecologist who must be employed at a specific location.  How will this work in practice?  I ask her to assure me that this could not mean that a woman might be examined in two locations, one being that where the procedure could be carried out.  Surely it is about bringing the necessary professional expertise to the woman.  The IMO presentation made a number of points in regard to patient confidentiality.  Would the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists agree it is something which should be addressed?  <\/p><p>  Head 3, the risk of loss of life from physical illness in a medical emergency, allows one medical practitioner to carry out a termination in an emergency at any location.  I note from its presentation that the institute views that such emergency procedures should only be carried out in a hospital setting.  I ask the witnesses to elaborate on that.  Would they take the view that, while the Bill provides for any registered medical practitioner to carry out such a procedure, such a person should be somebody who is registered on a specialist division?  I would like further clarification, if possible, on that.<\/p><p>  I may be open to correction, but from my preparation for this committee I note that, in regard to the requirement for notification to the Minister, notification of all emergency terminations will be sent to the Minister.  As the Bill is currently drafted, that does not require the involvement of an obstetrician or gynaecologist.  Should the same apply in regard to non-emergency situations such as physical or general illnesses and the risk to life as a result of mental illness and the associated possible risk of self harm or self termination?<\/p><p>  Would the institute envisage there would be oversight and a review of notified terminations carried out?  Would an effort be made to at least confirm the efficacy of the decisions taken and to win the widest possible public confidence for them?  For some considerable time that will be an issue and focus.  It would be desirable and helpful if that were to be the case.<\/p><p> I refer to Professor Murphy and the Irish Medical Council.  Deputy Kelleher made reference to the guide to professional conduct and ethics.  My sense of the guide in the 2009 publication - the witnesses can tell me if I am wrong - is that its wording does not change by the passage of this Bill.  Detail regarding the outworking will require revisitation, but the specific guide on how and when it is permissible for an intervention that results in termination would not change.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013051700019#T00400","speaker":"969"},{"type":"speech","time":1368789300,"counter":167,"content":"<p>Several contributors referred to the provisions regarding appropriate locations, which refer to public obstetric units where there is a mental health facility.

We must bear in mind that we are talking about rare clinical cases where a mother's life is in danger or there is a risk of loss of life.  It would be a small number of cases and we would offer follow-up in the hospital setting.  These are patients with complex medical disorders or perhaps life-threatening obstetrical emergency conditions.  As such, they would always be offered after care in the hospital setting.  It would be rather unusual for such patients not to inform their GPs of what had transpired, given that, as I said, they are patients with complex medical disorders of which their GPs would usually be aware.  They would require long-term follow-up care for that medical disorder, whether it be mental or physical.  It would be unusual for the GP not to be aware of the patient's situation.  We would always follow up with the patient in the hospital in the first instance.<\/p><p>  On the important issue of viability, Article 40.3.3&deg; remains in the Constitution.  We are committed to the health and life of mother and baby.  It sometimes happens that we have a very sick mother around the time of viability, in which case every effort is made to prolong the pregnancy to allow the baby to get to a stage where there is some chance of survival.  If we feel prolonging the pregnancy could jeopardise the mother, where, for example, she might develop overwhelming infection, uncontrollable blood pressure, seizures or life-threatening bleeding, we would have no option but to terminate the pregnancy or, depending on the gestation, deliver the baby pre-term.  We work very hard with the family and each other to promote foetal viability in order that the baby will get to a stage where it can survive.  After the baby is born, intensive care would be offered. if medically appropriate.  That is current standard medical practice.<\/p><p>  Deputy Billy Kelleher also asked whether we had capacity for this Bill.  To reiterate, we are talking about rare medical disorders and small numbers of cases.  We already look after such cases.  The Bill merely provides a legal framework for our current clinical practice.  I do not anticipate large numbers of patients suddenly becoming suitable for these procedures where previously we have seen only very small numbers.  However, it is important to note that we have approximately half the number of obstetricians per head of population in Ireland as there are in the United Kingdom; therefore, we are dreadfully under-resourced and would welcome improved resourcing.<\/p><p>  Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in asked how many obstetricians would be required to examine the patient.  Again, we are talking about complex medical disorders where multidisciplinary teams are required.  In current medical practice it is often the case that more than one obstetrician would assess such a patient in order to achieve a consensus view.  However, if a colleague felt there was no option but to terminate the pregnancy, we are not saying two obstetricians would be required to examine the patient but that a second obstetrical opinion be sought just to underpin the approach.  In complex cases such as these there is always consultation with more than one person and often with a very large team.  We would want the obstetrician who examines the patient to seek support, which could be in the form of a telephone conversation, for instance, or a case review.  We are totally supportive of patient confidentiality at all times and there would no difference in such cases.<\/p><p>  In regard to head 3, the Bill refers to a health facility and talks about locations other than those recognised.  We are concerned that emergency treatment should only be offered in a hospital setting, not in a clinic or an outpatient setting such as a GP's surgery.  These are emergency life-saving procedures and it is our view that they should only be carried out in a hospital setting.<\/p><p>  The specialist division of obstetrics and gynaecology came into being in 2005 or thereabouts.  Consultants appointed prior to that time will be on the general medical register but may not be in the specialist division.  This means that a number of very experienced consultants who are very capable of making patient assessments are not in the specialist division.  For this reason, we have asked that the provision be expanded to include an obstetrician or gynaecologist acting in the consultant role who is in the general division only.  Otherwise, the concern is that patients who present requiring emergency treatment might not be able to receive it if the consultant who sees them is not on the specialist register.  This is an historic issue that will be resolved over time.  In the meantime, however, we have several experienced obstetricians who are not on the specialist register.<\/p><p>  In terms of notification of cases, we are totally supportive of the requirement for audit and documentation.  In fact, within our own hospitals these cases are already recorded and discussed.  I suggest this matter is best dealt with in guidelines, with these unusual cases being reviewed, say, on an annual basis.  Members may be aware that the National Perinatal Epidemiology Centre is collecting data on cases of severe maternal morbidity.  This means that many of the cases are already captured in a national context.<\/p><p>  Deputy Seamus Healy referred to the provisions regarding appropriate locations.  In our previous submission we explained in detail that we were talking about patients who were medically very unwell and needed access to specialist physicians, coronary care units and intensive care units.  Many of our maternity units are not co-located.  The units in the three Dublin maternity hospitals and one in Limerick, for example, are stand-alone units.  The patients to whom we are referring are usually cared for in hospitals with a general intensive care unit and coronary care unit.  It is imperative, therefore, that general hospitals are able to carry out these procedures.  That is where these patients will be treated because they are too ill to be looked after in a stand-alone maternity unit.<\/p><p>  The Deputy also asked about the availability of personnel throughout the country.  There are 19 maternity units in this country providing high quality maternity care.  They are also providing emergency care, which would include termination of pregnancy.  That is current practice.  What the legislation does is put a framework around it.  <\/p><p>  I will defer to my colleague, Dr. M&eacute;abh N&iacute; Bhuinne&aacute;in, to provide detail on the smaller units.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013051700020#U00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Fionnuala McAuliffe"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1368789300,"counter":170,"content":"<p>The smaller units in this country are not small by international standards.  In fact, there are no single-handed or dual-handed practices in operation at this time.  All of the facilities are delivering more than 1,000 babies per annum and, in total, 20,000 mothers receive their care, including emergency care, in these units every year.  Consultant-provided care is delivered in all 19 units on a 24-7 basis.  There is a three-tier on-call system, involving a registrar, a senior house officer and a consultant.  There are systems to support obstetric emergency provision in the cases to which Professor McAuliffe has alluded, where there is haemorrhage, bleeding, infection or uncontrollable high blood pressure and, in the case of complications of miscarriage, where a foetal heartbeat may still be present.  There is the to provide that at this point in time.<\/p><p>  The smaller units will be affected more by the logistics of implementing the services, but the networks and governance established through Medical Council best practice and ethical practice and through college governance will ensure a woman has access, regardless of which maternity unit she attends.  For maternal survival, access to a unit that can save her life is essential.  The timeliness of moving to a city unit and bypassing a rural unit could certainly confound maternal survival possibility.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013051700020#U00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. M&eacute;abh N&iacute; Bhuinne&aacute;in"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1368789300,"counter":171,"content":"<p>In response to Deputy Billy Kelleher's questions, the Medical Council guidelines are very clear in regard to conscientious objection.

Perhaps it might be helpful for Deputies and Senators if I outline the current guidance.  Before doing so it may be worthwhile for me to articulate how the Medical Council came to produce such guidance.  Approximately every five years, the council completely revises its ethical guidance, doing so in a way that engages a range of stakeholders.  We engage with members of the profession, employers and patient groups.  We want to ensure that the guidance we produce to assist doctors will be useful and informed by our engagement with stakeholders.  It is also important to say that the guidance produced by the Medical Council is a principle-based document, meaning it cannot deal with every day-to-day eventuality; it deals with principles rather than operational day-to-day matters.<\/p><p>  The guidance, as mentioned earlier, follows on from legislation.  As legislators, Deputies and Senators are tasked with ensuring that appropriate legislation is in place.  Once the legislation is in place, it is the task of the Medical Council to draft guidance based on the legislation.  As we heard from the Chief Medical Officer this morning, once the new legislation has been passed, he intends to work with a range of stakeholders, including the professional bodies and the Medical Council, to ensure that the subsequent regulations will implement what is passed by legislators.<\/p><p>  Deputy Healy asked a specific question on conscientious objection, so I will outline the current Medical Council guidance on the issue.  There are a number of points taken from the guide to professional conduct and ethics for registered medical practitioners, and members may recall that during our submission in January, we circulated copies of the guide.  We have not done so this time because we assume they have seen it already.  If Members wish to see copies of the guide afterwards, we would be very happy to circulate them.  With regard to conscientious objection, the guidance is as follows:<blockquote>10.1 As a doctor, you must not allow your personal moral standards to influence your treatment of patients.<br \/>10.2 If you have a conscientious objection to a course of action, you should explain this to the patient and make the names of other doctors available to them.<\/blockquote>That addresses the point made by Deputy Kelleher, which was also addressed by Dr. O'Riordan in her response.  The council wishes to see this particular head extended in regard to the Medical Council's third point in the guidance, &quot;10.3 Conscientious objection does not absolve you from responsibility to a patient in emergency circumstances.&quot;  As we noted in our submission, the Medical Council suggests that head 12 should be expanded to ensure that the holding of a conscientious objection does not absolve the registered medical practitioner of responsibility to a patient in emergency circumstances.  The view of the council is that the right to conscientious objection must be balanced against the right of the patient, particularly in the case of a medical emergency.<\/p><p>  I will take the questions from Deputies Kelleher and &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in together as they relate to the Medical Council guidance on abortion.  It might be helpful for Deputies and Senators for me to outline the current guidance provided by the Medical Council to doctors on abortion.  The guide states:<blockquote>21.1 Abortion is illegal in Ireland except where there is a real and substantial risk to the life (as distinct from the health) of the mother.  Under current legal precedent, this exception includes where there is a clear and substantial risk to the life of the mother arising from a threat of suicide.  You should undertake a full assessment of any such risk in light of the clinical research on this issue.<\/blockquote>To address Deputy Kelleher's point, the council formulates its guidance based on the current legal position.  The council drafted its guidance in the light of the Supreme Court judgment.  The guide continues:<blockquote>21.2 It is lawful to provide information in Ireland about abortions abroad, subject to strict conditions.  It is not lawful to encourage or advocate an abortion in individual cases.<br \/>21.3 You have a duty to provide care, support and follow-up services for women who have an abortion abroad.<br \/>21.4 In current obstetrical practice, rare complications can arise where therapeutic intervention (including termination of a pregnancy) is required at a stage when, due to extreme immaturity of the baby, there may be little or no hope of the baby surviving.  In these exceptional circumstances, it may be necessary to intervene to terminate the pregnancy to protect the life of the mother, while making every effort to preserve the life of the baby.<\/blockquote>It is worthwhile restating that this guidance was drafted and published by the council after extensive consultation with a range of stakeholders, particularly the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists.  As I stated earlier, we ensured that this guidance would target to the doctors faced with these decisions and be useful in ensuring that doctors had the appropriate guidance.<\/p><p>  Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in asked if Medical Council guidance would change.  We are engaged in a process today that will lead to the subsequent development of legislation, and nobody can predict at this stage how the legislation will look.  Once the legislation is passed, the Medical Council will examine it and reconsider its advice based on the eventual legislation.<\/p><p>  Ms Spillane wishes to make a point on specialist division of the register.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013051700021#V00200","nonspeaker":"Professor Kieran Murphy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1368789900,"counter":174,"content":"<p>Deputies Kelleher and Healy raised questions about the number of doctors.

I have some specific questions aimed at ensuring women have access to effective procedures, whereby their constitutional right to life could be vindicated in the very rare cases we are discussing, as we have all said.  There is a proposal to merge heads 2 and 4 which makes sense.  Is the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists suggesting two obstetricians should certify risk, as well as an additional doctor in the case of a physical risk, or an additional two psychiatrists in the case of risk of suicide?  That seems unduly cumbersome and would render the process less accessible and effective for women.  I believe Professor McAuliffe said the second opinion would be more informal rather than formal extra certification or examination.<\/p><p>  The Irish Medical Council and the Irish Medical Organisation suggest the requirement that psychiatrists be attached to specific institutions is too restrictive.  Particularly in the specialist maternity hospitals in Dublin which will not have large psychiatric departments attached, is it practical to ask that psychiatrists be attached to specific places or should it be a more general point that they should be consultant psychiatrists?  What exactly do they mean?<\/p><p>  Heads 6, 7 and 8 provide for a review procedure.  The IMO and the ICGP have raised some very practical and important points about access for a woman to a review and the obstacles that might apply.  Do they believe the time limit is unduly onerous?

However, we need to remember that we are talking about pregnant women, in respect of whom after consultation two senior obstetricians, plus or minus physicians or psychiatrists, feel there is a significant risk to her life which can only be averted by termination of pregnancy or early delivery of the baby.  We are talking about a small number of cases of very sick women who need access to life-saving treatment.  The general view of the institute - the majority view - is that we will not differentiate between causes of risk to life, whether they be mental or physical.<\/p><p>  The Deputy asked if it was ethical to perform a termination for a suicidal woman.  Again, we are down to the expert assessment of two psychiatrists, plus an obstetrician.  The Deputy needs to remember what we are talking about.  We are talking about risk of threat to the life of the mother which can only be averted by termination of pregnancy.  Therefore, we are talking about very serious conditions and we are talking about small numbers of cases.  These are issues that we will resolve using a multidisciplinary approach.<\/p><p>  There was a question about late terminations which I addressed in my opening submission.  There is no question of late terminations in the Bill, as far as the institute is concerned.  If the baby is delivered before viability, it will die unfortunately - that is a very sad consequence.  If the baby is born after viability, every effort will be made to support its life.  I hope that is clear.<\/p><p>  Senator Colm Burke asked about the role of the obstetrician in suicidal cases.  As obstetricians, we need to be centrally involved in any decision in terms of termination of pregnancy or early delivery of the baby because we are the experts in pregnancy and can assess it.  There could be other comorbidities in the patient who is suicidal.  There could be comorbidities that need to be assessed.  She needs to be assessed for her health to assess whether she is even suitable for any procedure or process.  Therefore, we in the institute strongly believe one obstetrician should examine the patient and sign the documentation, but he or she should seek a supportive second opinion - at least one.  It is normal practice that there be multiple opinions, but we are stipulating that one obstetrician in all of these cases, regardless of the cause of risk to life, examine the patient and sign the documentation but seek the support of a second opinion.<\/p><p>  In terms of the smaller units, we envisage that networks would be available.  As the Senator knows, earlier this week proposed networks were published.  It would be good clinical practice for smaller units.  There are informal networks where people will refer to certain hospitals.  I often receive telephone calls from my colleagues outside Dublin.  I am happy to receive a telephone call at any time of the day or night and any day, including weekends.  Therefore, we are there to support each other.  I would certainly favour having a more structured referral pathway for all complex pregnancy disorders.<\/p><p>  Senator Ivana Bacik mentioned location.  The Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists believes this should be available in all Government-approved hospitals which would include the 19 maternity units because these women are sick and need to have access to the appropriate medical care, whether it be psychiatric care or a coronary care unit or an intensive care unit.  We believe very strongly that it needs to be opened up outside these maternity units.  It needs to include Government-approved general hospitals.<\/p><p>  In terms of the unborn, if a foetal heartbeat is absent, that is a miscarriage.  There is no ethical dilemma that I am aware of around this.  If a foetal heartbeat is absent, unfortunately, the baby has died and either the patient will miscarry naturally or we can give her medication or perform a procedure to speed up the process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013051700023#X00400","nonspeaker":"Professor Fionnuala McAuliffe"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1368791100,"counter":190,"content":"<p>I endorse all the answers Professor McAuliffe has given to the questions asked.

Why do they feel the desire to merge heads 2 and 4?  Deputy Kelleher referred to the guidelines which cover the risk of suicide.  I assume the IMC monitors its guidelines, so what do the records show with regard to terminations for suicidality since 1992?  Also in that regard, does the IMC have records on women who subsequently committed suicide because of post-abortion trauma?  Those statistics would be of interest and value to us.<\/p><p>  I welcome some of the comments in the report of the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists.  Its representatives said they \"remain acutely aware of the potential negative consequences for the unborn and in current practice all efforts are exhausted within medical margins of safety to prolong the pregnancy in the foetal interest\".  In practice, under this legislation, how will the requirement to make those reasonable efforts for the life of the baby actually work?  In other words, if the baby is born around the viability period of 22 or 23 weeks, what will effectively happen in practice?  <\/p><p>  With regard to premature deliveries, can the IOG representatives tell us the potential complications and risks to the baby?

We had a submission from obstetricians and gynaecologists back in January who said that \"the psychiatric grounds for abortion on the basis of suicide risk appear non-existent in the view of the experts in this field.  An obstetrician, the doctor with responsibility to patients, faced with terminating a normal pregnancy on grounds of suicide risk, will be placed in an impossibly conflicted situation where there is no benefit to the mother\".

We have heard that there are approximately 30 such terminations per year.  We have also heard evidence that suggests that suicidality is at most a vanishingly rare cause.  It may never have occurred in Ireland, although there is some dispute about this.  There is also some dispute as to whether it is ever necessary.  However, in theory it could be.  As I have said, we are legally prevented from excluding suicidality by two specific questions put to the people in referendums.<\/p><p>  It is frequently being mentioned here that best medical evidence is not at the moment suggesting that suicidality is ever needed as a ground for termination.  There has been some dispute about this and many have stated that it would occasionally be needed.  However, this committee is not drawing up guidelines for medical practice - doctors do that.  They live within those guidelines and practise according to the best evidence which is available.  I would ask our various experts, especially the obstetricians here, to provide some research for those who somehow, for reasons I am not quite certain I understand, believe that the evidence base of medicine will change if this law is introduced, which allows for the theoretical possibility of suicidality as a necessity for abortion, to reassure these legislators that that in fact is not the case, and that doctors confronted with an individual patient will still have access to the best evidence base and will make the best decision for that patient who is in their charge at that time.<\/p><p>  I cannot let this moment pass without paying tribute to Professor Desmond Carney, who is one of the fathers of Irish oncology.

Just to reiterate, these are rare situations involving complex medical disorders.  We take a multidisciplinary team approach.  No individual doctor, or two doctors by themselves, will make these decisions.  However, it is our opinion in the institute that if two experienced doctors feel, in good faith, that there is a risk to a woman's life that can only be averted by termination of pregnancy, and if it is our assessment also, then we would be in agreement with that decision.<\/p><p>  There were a couple of questions about viability, and Senator Walsh and Deputy Mattie McGrath also discussed this.  Foetal viability changes over time.  When I first started in medicine the earliest point of viability was 28 weeks.  It is now about 23 or 24 weeks, so it is changing all the time.  Therefore I would favour not putting gestational age into the law, because it changes.  At present, foetal viability is 23 or 24 weeks, so if a baby is delivered at 20 weeks' gestation, there is unfortunately no chance of survival.<\/p><p>  If we have to intervene in a pregnancy - for example, if a woman has overwhelming infection or there is some other life-threatening maternal cause at 20 weeks - if we could extend that pregnancy to 24, 25 or 26 weeks, of course we would.  Every effort would be made and every effort is made.  Regardless of what this Bill shows when it comes to fruition, we will continue our current practice of trying to get every pregnancy to a stage at which the baby will survive, but we have to do that if it is medically safe.  If the mother died while we were waiting for that time, that would be a disappointing situation.  We work together with our neonatal colleagues in multidisciplinary teams to try to advance gestational age.  <\/p><p>  With regard to Deputy Naughten's question, our institute's opinion is that we favour legislation plus regulation. <\/p><p>  In terms of destruction, to reiterate, if a pregnancy needs to be ended before viability, the baby is delivered and it will die, unfortunately.  If it is after the point of viability, the baby will survive.<\/p><p>  I was asked if I was aware of any cases of suicidal ideation requiring early delivery.  I cannot say that I am particularly aware of it without a review of cases.  If a pregnant woman is sick and needs medication, we work together to get a plan in place.  Sometimes that may involve pre-term delivery, but we have to take the mother and foetal longevity and life together.  We do that every day. <\/p><p>  A general point has come up with a lot of the questions.  The institute's view is that this Bill will just put a legal framework around current practice.  We do not see any significant changes to current practice.  It will just give us a legal framework for current practice, so we do not see big changes to how we approach the equal rights to life of a mother and a baby in pregnancy.<\/p><p>  The average gestation at which a pregnant woman presents to hospital is generally about 15 to 18 weeks.  If she is identified as having a medical disorder she will be seen much earlier.  There are medical clinics available at all tertiary referral centres and patients can be seen there from as early as four or five weeks.  We often see patients with medical disorders much earlier on.  The patients we are talking about will be identified as having medical disorders by the general practitioner and will be referred to us.  It is our experience that general practitioners appropriately refer patients in a timely manner.<\/p><p>  As regards our opinion on suicide, it is a very rare situation in which a woman is suicidal and the only option is to terminate the pregnancy to avert the risk to life.  This is a very rare situation.  We have not seen this case, so we know that these cases are very rare.

On the need for earlier referrals, GPs generally refer pregnant women as soon as they present.

Deputy Mattie McGrath raises an important point, which is what happens if there is not agreement.  It is very important that the members, as legislators, put the interests of the woman at the centre of all they do, which is what the Irish Medical Council does in all its own actions.  If there is a disagreement and the woman is unhappy with the outcome of the process, there is a review mechanism within the draft heads of Bill which allows for an appeal process.  The council is very supportive of this and would go further.  In our submission earlier this morning I outlined that we believe there should be a further appeal process enshrined in the legislation to allow a woman to access an appropriate treatment if she feels this is what she wants to do.<\/p><p>  On Deputy Mattie McGrath's comments on the new Medical Council, clearly, as an outgoing member of the current Medical Council, I cannot possibly comment on what the new Medical Council might do.  Regarding what Deputy Naughten said, as the Taoiseach and our Minister for Health have said, it is important for doctors to have legal clarity when making clinical decisions.  Consequently, it is the Members' role, as legislators, to ensure they can provide that legal clarity to doctors.  Once that legal clarity is provided it will be up to other organisations - such as the colleges and the Medical Council, co-ordinated by the Department of Health - to ensure that the guidelines developed based on the legislation are appropriate to ensure that the woman, who is at the centre of all this, is protected.<\/p><p>  Regarding the questions from Senator Walsh, I have already dealt with the rationale for a merger of heads 2 and 4.

The other question that was directed towards us was Senator Walsh's question on proper psychiatric care.

In their comments on head 5, the witnesses expressed a preference for clinical guidelines established by the relevant professional colleges over prescription from the Minister.  Would it be fair to say they fear legislation could be overly prescriptive and could tie the hands of medical professionals?  In their comments on head 6 they suggest that \"practitioners who declare a conscientious objection must be excluded from review panels\".  Is it the IMO's position that doctors should be screened for pro-life values and excluded on that basis, or that review panels should be made up exclusively of doctors who have no principled objection to the direct killing of an unborn baby?

We do not want to end up in a position where medical evidence or procedures make something feasible but the law makes it illegal.

That motion, which was approved in 1993, states that the IMO endorses the principle of respect for all human life, born and unborn, and rejects abortion.  That answers the question.

She predicted that there would be a very low number of individuals who would need this type of treatment in the cases of suicidality.  We heard at similar hearings here in January that prediction accuracy for suicide is about 3%.  Given that the legislation identifies that objective medical markers will not be available to the decision makers but that subjective analysis will be available and the fact that in every other jurisdiction where similar legislation has come through, the experience has been quite different and there has been a very large increase in the number of people accessing this service with similar types of symptoms, it is very difficult to make that prediction that the numbers will be very low.  Professor McAuliffe said earlier that the legislation is not really a change in the <i>status quo<\/i>.

Part of my training was undertaken in London and after I qualified I held an academic post in the United States for four years.  Over many years I have been invited to give lectures and perform clinical practice reviews in the United Kingdom, the United States, Europe, Scandinavia, Singapore, Israel, Australia and New Zealand.  All of this experience has given me wide opportunity to observe the practice of obstetrics as it relates to the issue under discussion, namely, the termination of pregnancy to save the life of the mother.<\/p><p>  Ireland is in a unique position in that there is ready access to termination of pregnancy in the United Kingdom for residents of this State despite it being illegal here.  It could be interpreted that the State has implicitly agreed to facilitate this access by way of the constitutional amendments of 1992 which guaranteed the right to access information regarding termination of pregnancy and guaranteed the right to travel to obtain a termination.<\/p><p>  The situation in Ireland regarding termination of pregnancy where there is a real and substantial risk to the life of the mother remains unclear.  As doctors, we are aware of the Supreme Court judgment in respect of the X case but we are left, in the absence of legislation and regulation, to attempt to interpret that judgment on an <i>ad hoc<\/i> basis when it comes to termination of pregnancy in order to save the life of the mother.  Meanwhile, the Offences against the Person Act 1861 remains on the Statute Book.  This is a wholly unsatisfactory and, I believe, unreasonable situation to expect doctors to operate in.  It also places the woman in the highly unsatisfactory position whereby doctors caring for her are unsure about whether they may be breaking the law in cases where they believe they must intervene to save her life.  For these reasons I welcome the intention to enact legislation to protect life in pregnancy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013051700031#FF00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Peter Boylan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1368795300,"counter":270,"content":"<p>My name is Dr. Sam Coulter-Smith.  I am master of the Rotunda Hospital in Dublin.  My submission to the committee today is based on my views and the views of my consultant colleagues at the Rotunda Hospital following consideration of the draft heads of the Bill.  I thank the Chairman and members of the Joint Committee on Health and Children for giving me the opportunity to present these views on this important draft legislation.<\/p><p>  I will start by making some general comments.  I acknowledge the work that was done on this extremely difficult and contentious document and I commend those who drafted the text for avoiding the word \"abortion\" in the terminology.  This is a positive move and ensures that those women who have to have a pregnancy terminated in an emergency situation are not stigmatised in any way and this should be welcomed.<\/p><p>  In terms of where a termination of pregnancy can occur, there are two factors that need to be considered.  I welcome the fact that the legislation provides for termination of pregnancy in an emergency situation in any of the 19 maternity units in the country.  However, there are occasions when it may be necessary to terminate a pregnancy outside these institutions, for example, in Mount Carmel Hospital, which is a private, non-HSE institution delivering maternity care.<\/p><p>  In addition, in each of the big maternity hospitals in Dublin there is no provision for intensive care.  Therefore, our sickest patients from these units, some of whom will have been transferred from other units around the country for care, will be looked after in intensive care units in hospitals such as the Mater Misericordiae University Hospital, St. Vincent's University Hospital, St. James's Hospital and others.  There may be occasions, therefore, when it is necessary to provide this type of emergency care, which is provided for within this legislation, to patients in these intensive care units, which are currently outside the draft legislation.<\/p><p>  I will turn my attention now to the clinical scenarios that the heads of the Bill cover.  The document broadly covers three clinical scenarios.  First, when a woman's life is acutely at risk in an emergency situation due to a complication of pregnancy.  Second, when the acuity of the situation may be less urgent but the severity of the situation relates to a co-morbidity such as cancer, significant heart disease or other illness.  The third clinical scenario is where there is imminent risk of death from suicide or self-destruction.<\/p><p>  In respect of the first two scenarios, the heads of the Bill provide clarity and appropriate protection for those giving care to pregnant women.  This, in turn, should provide clarity and reassurance for all professionals, including medical, midwifery and nursing professionals, that their actions in giving best care to the mother are covered under the law.  It should also provide reassurance for women and their families that the medical profession can act in their best interests during difficult, life-threatening situations, and this is to be welcomed.  It is also important to note that there is no gestational limit applied to either of the first two scenarios and this, in my view, is appropriate.  It is also important to note, and it is confirmed and reiterated in several areas within the draft document, that doctors must have regard to the protection and preservation of the unborn human life where practicable.  This should provide appropriate reassurance for patients and their families in very difficult and distressing situations.<\/p><p>  In respect of the first scenario where a woman's life is at risk in an acute emergency situation, it is now acceptable for one obstetrician to decide whether a termination of pregnancy is required to save a woman's life.  It is good practice for an obstetrician in this situation to seek a second opinion from a colleague if it is possible to do so.  However, in these difficult situations there will often be other consultants involved, such as a haematologist in the case of haemorrhage or a microbiologist in the case of infection.  It is also likely that a consultant anaesthetist will be available and it would be appropriate for the consultant obstetrician to seek advice and to discuss the decision-making process with these colleagues.<\/p><p>  In respect of loss of life from self-destruction there are a number of issues that need to be raised.  First, this is an extraordinarily rare situation with the incidence of suicide in pregnancy of the order of one in 500,000 pregnancies as per United Kingdom figures.  Second, our psychiatric colleagues tell us that there is currently no available evidence to show that termination of pregnancy is a treatment for suicidal ideation or intent and, as obstetricians, we are required to provide and practice evidence-based treatment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013051700031#FF00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Sam Coulter-Smith"},{"type":"speech","time":1368795300,"counter":271,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013051700031#FF00400","speaker":"1027"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1368795300,"counter":272,"content":"<p>It, therefore, creates an ethical dilemma for any obstetrician who has requested to perform a termination of pregnancy for the treatment of someone with either suicidal ideation or intent.  Third, this legislation, I am sure, is designed to create clarity and reassurance for both health professionals and patients alike.<\/p><p>  The fact that there is no gestational limit in respect of the third scenario relating to suicidality is a major ethical issue for obstetricians.  I will illustrate this with two scenarios.  First, let us consider the case of a patient who is 25 weeks' gestation.  If she is deemed to be sufficiently suicidal to require a termination of pregnancy by one or more psychiatric colleagues, an obstetrician who is tasked with dealing with this situation is faced with an enormous ethical dilemma.  Delivering a baby at 25 weeks' gestation could lead to death, due to extreme prematurity or it could lead to a child with cerebral palsy or with other significant developmental issues for the future.  This outcome would be entirely iatrogenic and the responsibility of those clinicians who have agreed to be involved in the process.  This is a source of serious concern for myself and my colleagues.<\/p><p>  Another clinical scenario which provides a difficult ethical dilemma is a situation whereby at a woman's 20 week anatomy scan a significant but non-lethal malformation is discovered.  The patient, for a variety of reasons, may decide that she cannot continue with the pregnancy and it is causing her significant mental health issues with risk of suicide.  The obstetrician is left in the unenviable position of, by law, having to look after the best interests of the baby but also the understanding of the mother's issues.  It would, therefore, seem appropriate in a case where there is a risk of self-destruction that there is no gestational limit applied in this situation as this creates a major ethical dilemma for us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013051700031#FF00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Sam Coulter-Smith","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1368795900,"counter":274,"content":"<p>Chairman and members of the committee, I thank you for the opportunity to comment on the draft heads of the protection of life during pregnancy Bill.  I am the master of the National Maternity Hospital.  I am a practising obstetrician, having practised for 17 years, and am a specialist in foetal and maternal medicine.  I have practised as a consultant at the National Maternity Hospital since 2008.<\/p><p>  This Bill is about saving women's lives.  Women sometimes die during pregnancy and it is my belief that everything possible must be done to prevent such a tragic outcome.  Where there is a substantial risk to a woman's life during pregnancy there should be no hesitation to save her life.  If she dies her baby will die too.  Despite this fundamental imperative there remains today in Ireland a lack of clarity surrounding when termination of pregnancy is legally permissible.  It could be argued that the State has gone to great lengths to avoid legislating for this reality, the reality of maternal death as a consequence of pregnancy.  This is inexcusable.<\/p><p>  Provision has been made in Ireland for women to access termination of pregnancy outside of this jurisdiction despite the fact that it remains a criminal offence in Ireland.  I believe this Bill, which is restricted to circumstances where a pregnant woman is at risk of dying, sets out to provide clarity in a number of key areas which directly affect clinical obstetric practice.  Despite the Supreme Court judgment in the X case which provides for termination of pregnancy when there is a real and substantial risk to a pregnant woman's life which may be ended or removed by ending the pregnancy, there remains today no legal framework through which this risk can be determined.  This leaves doctors and their patients, women at risk of dying, legally vulnerable.  This Bill addresses this issue.<\/p><p>  The Offences Against the Person Act 1861, sections 58 and 59, means that abortion, termination of pregnancy, is a criminal offence in this country.  This is addressed also by the Bill and provision is made to remove this which is necessary.  At present there is no formal process through which a woman who perceives that she is at risk of dying can access opinion on whether termination of pregnancy is appropriate.  I believe women deserve that consideration and this Bill addresses that issue.  I therefore commend the Government on the decision to provide legal protection for women and their doctors in this very difficult, rare and complex circumstance when termination of pregnancy is necessary to save a woman's life.<\/p><p>  Most importantly, I understand that according to this Bill the constitutional protection of the unborn is preserved where practicable.  We must vindicate the life of the foetus where it is practicable.  This obligation has underpinned my clinical practice over 17 years and will continue to do so.   In current practice all efforts are exhausted within the medical margins of safety to prolong pregnancy in the foetal interest.  When a foetus has reached a gestation where survival is possible, every effort is made to optimise that survival.  This is regardless of the indication for termination of pregnancy which in this context will be to save a woman's life.  In practical terms with current neonatal intensive care, neonatal survival is now possible from as early as 23 weeks' gestation.  Every year in Holles Street we look after at least 20 babies who were born somewhere between 23 and 26 weeks' gestation.  This is not strange to us.<\/p><p>  I want to leave the committee in no doubt of the following: we do not destroy or kill foetuses.  We deliver them and on occasion delivery in order to save a woman's life is required at gestation so early that very sadly foetal survival is not possible.  In this context if a pregnant woman dies her baby will die too.  It is my experience - and I am experienced in this area, I specialise in foetal and maternal medicine - the majority of women do not wish to lose their babies but they do not want to die.  The indications for termination of pregnancy prior to foetal viability include situations such as infection, choreoamnionitis, blood pressure that we are unable to control, haemorrhage, treatment for some cancers and management of severe medical disorders in pregnancy such as heart disease.  These situations are very complex and very rare.  At the National Maternity Hospital, which is one of the busiest maternity hospitals in Europe, we have annually up to five cases.<\/p><p>  Following the months of debate regarding the draft heads of this Bill one could be forgiven for thinking that this Bill is about the risk of suicide in pregnancy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013051700032#GG00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Rhona Mahony","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1368796500,"counter":276,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Mahony.

There there are varying views in their three presentations.  Large parts of legislation are quite agreeable to the vast majority of professionals and the broader public but the issue of self-destruction is something that divides Irish society.  I wanted to get the varying views of our three witnesses on this.  First and foremost, if there was no constitutional obligation because of the X case to bring forward legislation on self-destruction, should it be included in any event if one were introducing legislation in this area?  In other words, do the witnesses believe there is the potential of a threat to one's life because of suicide and should it be legislated for, even if the X case was never heard in the first place?<\/p><p>  The Irish Medical Council's guidelines of 2009 include suicide as a ground for a termination.  I get the impression from Dr. Coulter-Smith that he believes there is never a reason to terminate a pregnancy because of the threat of self-destruction.  I want to get clarity on that point.<\/p><p>  In the broader context, what we are trying to do here, as Dr. Mahony has pointed out, is to bring forward legislation that saves the lives of women and gives clarity to the professionals who are dealing with them.  There are varying views on how that should be done but the Government has decided to legislate.  In that context, are the witnesses satisfied with the legislation before them in the practical terms in respect off making interventions to save the life of a woman and that it will not inhibit them in doing that and that it will give them protection?  Are they satisfied it will not inhibit them in dealing with an emergency case, a non-emergency case or a case of self-destruction?<\/p><p>  I wish to ask the witnesses a question that I have asked the previous witnesses and it is about an issue to which Dr. Mahony has referred.  We need to get clarity on this issue, which I have already got, but I raise it for the benefit of the broader public who may be following the proceedings and others who have an interest in this matter.  It is the area of foetal viability and when the foetus is on the cusp of viability.  Obviously in emergency situations, a decision must be made there and then but in non-emergency situations or in a case of self-destruction, do obstetricians in the course of their duty in trying to save the life of the woman look at the viability of a foetus and believe that if they could extend the time of intervention it would give the foetus greater viability?<\/p><p>  People have asked me to raise the issue of how a termination of a pregnancy is performed.  It has been described as an interruption of pregnancy.  In Britain there is an intention to destruct the foetus whereas the opposite is the case here.  Every effort is made to save the foetus, regardless of gestational age.  I would like to get clarity on that.  Is a pregnancy terminated normally through inducement or caesarian section?  I understand they would be the normal ways of inducing early pregnancy.  I would like clarity on that issue.  I met many members of the public in recent weeks and these are issues on which they would like certainty and the witnesses are the people best placed to give it to us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013051700033#HH00300","speaker":"983"},{"type":"speech","time":1368796500,"counter":278,"content":"<p>I join the Chairman in welcoming our three guests.  In relation to Dr. Peter Boylan's contribution, it should not strike one as strange that I would not have known that intensive care units did not exist in any of the three maternity hospitals in Dublin but it has come as a shock or certainly a surprise.  It poses the question of whether these entities, as they are currently resourced and configured, have the capacity to provide for all situations that could present.  It is not just about legislation; it is like all legislation here, it must be resourced.  I take the opportunity to welcome Dr. Boylan's exposure of that deficiency, which I expect may have presented difficulties in the past, not only in the context of for what we are currently legislating.<\/p><p>  A number of the contributions made this morning would complement and echo Dr. Boylan's points regarding a wider number of approved locations, other than the 19 designed, extending it to the general hospitals and he also made a case for the approved private hospital scenarios.  <\/p><p>  Dr. Boylan and Dr. Mahony referred to limitations regarding only obstetricians and gynaecologists who are in the specialist division.  There is a number, whatever number that would be but it is an significant and important number, who would not be on the specialist register but on the general register of the Irish Medical Council.  We welcome all these points and that light has been thrown on these because these are elements that can and hopefully will be addressed during the Bill's passage through Committee, Report and Final Stages.<\/p><p>  I do not want to go over the area covered by my colleague, Deputy Kelleher.  I note in Dr. Mahony's contribution her commendation of the Government for bringing forward the Bill.  I presume the subtext of that is that she accepts that the five obligations of the State, as set out in the expert group report, are addressed here.  She might elaborate on whether they are addressed to her satisfaction.  I recall very well her stated concerns back in January regarding the Offences Against Person Act and sections 58 and 59 and we all join in welcoming the fact that this is now being addressed.  I asked Dr. Holohan this morning if in is view, as chief medical officer, this complies with the obligations of the State, as set out in the expert group report.

At the hearings of the committee in January Dr. Mahony dismissed the notion of performing late-term abortions in Irish hospitals.  However, this Bill contains no term limits.  While she told <i>The Irish Times<\/i> that babies who were viable would be kept alive, there seems to be a legal question about a potential liability which arises for doctors who deliberately induce a physically healthy child who was being carried by a physically healthy mother.  Even if viability becomes a term limit for abortions, I would like an answer to the following scenario.  A woman presents in the 20th week of her pregnancy.  She is suicidal and requests an abortion and this is granted.  The 20-week old baby is not viable outside the womb but the baby has been fully formed for many weeks.  The baby is quite big, perhaps up to 10 inches long, reacts to her mother's voice, can feel pain and the mother can feel movement.

My expertise and that of obstetricians is in the area of obstetrics, not psychiatry.  I understand the council of the College of Psychiatrists of Ireland has made a submission.  It is the representative body of the more than 800 psychiatrists in the country.  As an obstetrician, I am happy to defer to their expert opinion.  If a woman is referred to me by a psychiatrist whose opinion I respect - an opinion which is not driven by ideology but by care for the woman, taking everything into account - and if that psychiatrist believes the only way she will be prevented from killing herself - it is her life I am talking about - is by terminating that pregnancy and if I trust the psychiatrist's opinion, I will terminate the pregnancy.  If the mother dies through suicide, so too does the baby.  This is about the protection of life in pregnancy.  That is my comment in that regard.<\/p><p>  I advise the committee that it should not really give much credence to evidence which is not expert in this area.  I also advise it and perhaps the broader public and the Government in general not to be misled by bad science.  Medicine and society are littered with examples of the damage bad science can cause.  One of the most recent examples which will be fresh in people's minds is the evidence from the United Kingdom of the bad science about vaccination and a link with autism in children.  The consequence of that bad science has been many children dying and many ending up mentally handicapped.  If the committee plans to interpret scientific studies, I advise that members should make sure they are from a good reputable source and that they have been properly conducted.  That is all I wish to say about suicide.<\/p><p>  Dr. Sam Coulter-Smith will deal with the point raised about the Medical Council.  I am very satisfied with the legislation proposed.  I did not go through my commentary on the various heads of the Bill because I did not understand that was part of my opening presentation but, no doubt, it will arise during the course of the discussion.  I am happy to deal with the individual heads, if the committee wishes and there is time to do so.  <\/p><p>  Foetal viability is considered in all of our clinical decisions.  This arises, for example, in the case of women with extremely severe hypertension.  In that case if a mother has seizures, she may well die or she may effectively become brain dead or blind if we do not deliver the baby.  We will deliver a baby at 23 weeks in order to save a mother's life.  As I said, we cannot allow a woman who is pregnant to die in front of our eyes.  We cannot allow her to get to a situation where she may kill herself.  If she kills herself or she dies, the baby dies too.  <\/p><p>  Deputy Mattie McGrath and others asked about the method of termination.  The majority of terminations of pregnancy will be done medically by induction of labour, certainly in the early stages of pregnancy.  We do not at any stage set out to destroy life.  The Bill is about the protection of life in pregnancy; it is not about the destruction of life in pregnancy.  The concept that Irish obstetricians would involve themselves in dismemberment of a living foetus is, frankly, on the extreme end of I am not sure what, but it is on a very extreme edge of opinion and not one that would be shared by us.<\/p><p>  In reply to Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, there are no intensive care units in the three Dublin maternity hospitals.  That is one of the reasons we need relocation in order to be located close to general hospitals with intensive care facilities.  Despite this, we have very good working relationships with the general hospitals.  Holles Street Hospital has a very good relationship with St. Vincent's Hospital.  We transfer women to St. Vincent's Hospital when they are very ill and require intensive care.  It is not entirely satisfactory because they have to be put in an ambulance, sometimes on a ventilator, and transported.  We deliver babies in St. Vincent's Hospital on occasion when we believe the mother will be at risk, particularly in a case of a severe form of placenta previa where there can be dangerous bleeding.  There is that precedent, but it would be much better if we were co-located.  When the Deputy is in government, no doubt he will accelerate that process.<\/p><p>  On the question about designated hospitals, I make the point in my submission that because of the way things will happen in emergencies all Government-approved hospitals in the State should be designated rather than just the maternity hospitals or maternity units in general hospitals.  Things can happen very fast.  One cannot have a situation in Mount Carmel Hospital, for example, where a woman is going to die if she does not have a termination of pregnancy, but she is put in an ambulance and dies on the way to a designated hospital.  It is a minor point, but it should be considered by the committee when reviewing the Bill.<\/p><p>  On the specialist register question, some of the more senior colleagues are not on the specialist register, even though they have been consultant obstetricians for many years.  This is a result of historical reasons because a specialist register was introduced by the Medical Council in 2005 and some specialists have not bothered to put themselves on the register.  That is a minor matter.<\/p><p>  Everyone in this room will be aware of the relative shortage of specialists in the country.  We have the lowest ratio of specialists per head of population in the European Union.  On occasions such as at weekends and holiday times, particularly in smaller hospitals around the country, there is a dependence on locum consultants who may be registrars and who are in an acting up capacity.  They are not on the specialist register.  That point needs to be taken into account when the committee is considering alterations to the Bill.  <\/p><p>  Dr. Mahony will answer the question about the expert group.  I think I have dealt with all the questions raised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013051700034#JJ02100","nonspeaker":"Dr. Peter Boylan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1368797100,"counter":302,"content":"<p>On the question of whether we should legislate for suicide, even in the absence of the X case, my view is that this legislation is required to protect doctors and give reassurance to mothers and their families that when a woman's life is at risk for whatever reason, doctors are duty bound to look after the baby, if at all practicable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013051700034#JJ02200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Sam Coulter-Smith","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1368797700,"counter":304,"content":"<p>I will answer the questions Deputy Kelleher raised.  If the X case did not exist, would we still legislate for suicide?  Suicide is death.  We are legislating here for the substantial risk to life.  If one commits suicide, one dies so, inherently, when someone plans to take their life, they are at risk of dying.  I make no distinction between medical and physical risk to life.  I am not talking about mental health disorder but about the intent to commit suicide which can occur without a history of mental disorder.<\/p><p>  In terms of suicide and all the evidence we talk about, the incidence of suicide is about one in 500,000.  There is no evidence.  When a condition is that rare, it is impossible to perform adequate research or studies which inform one because the condition and the outcome are so rare.  If one was to truly examine the issue of suicide, one would have to take a group of women who planned to kill themselves and randomise them to termination of pregnancy to prevent them from killing themselves or to not being allowed have termination of pregnancy.  I suggest that studies should never be done.  What we do instead is we defer to our psychiatric colleagues who are expert in the assessment of suicide ideation and they use their clinical experience and acumen.<\/p><p>  Does the legislation do what we wish and does it give us clarity?  I think it does in a number of key areas.  It now gives us a framework in which we can define a substantial risk to life.  That is supported by the law and that is one of the key issues.  It also addresses the issue of the 1861 Offences Against the Person Act which hangs over us with that chilling effect.  In addition, and very importantly, it gives women, if they feel they are going to die or are at risk of dying, a process through which they can determine whether termination of pregnancy is appropriate.  That is very important.  <\/p><p>  I have said a lot already about the threshold of viability and I am concerned that this message still does not seem to be getting across.  When we deliver babies, we do our utmost to protect and vindicate that baby's life.  We are mandated to do that; we must do that and we wish to do it.  I have no desire to see late termination of pregnancy coming into this country.  That would be an affront to me.  I spend a great deal of time in my own medical practice trying to look after both the mother and the baby but I am aware that if a mother dies, her baby dies too and we must prevent the unnecessary death of two people.  Therefore, we will do our best to prolong the pregnancy until a baby is viable and again if a baby is born at that threshold of viability, every effort is exhausted to optimise that baby's chances of survival but one simply cannot allow a woman to die.<\/p><p>  In terms of the scenario of delivering the 20-week old baby at the threshold of viability of a woman who has suicidal intent, that woman requires assessment by an experienced psychiatrist.  In terms of the method, we do not kill babies; we do not destroy babies.  We induce babies medically.  Dilation and extraction at 18 to 20 weeks is a very dangerous procedure.  We are not trying to kill women; we are trying to save their lives and so they will be induced medically - a medical induction of labour where, as Dr. Coulter-Smith has said, after viability is achieved and by whatever method is practicable.<\/p><p>  I will address Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in's issue.  Again, I am echoing my colleagues on the whole issue of intensive care.  The three Dublin maternity hospitals are quite unusual and unique in terms of obstetric care in that they stand-alone.  This is not normal for an obstetric hospital and it means that not only are we deprived of intensive care facilities but we are deprived of a whole range of on-site medical facilities that would be very useful to us.  For example, we transfer our tiny babies to access an MRI scanner because we do not have one on our site.  We must transfer patients everyday for simple scans to see if they have a deep venous cloth in their legs.  There is no doubt that co-location with an adult hospital is the way to go.  It is not just me saying this, that is supported by an independent international recommendation in the KPMG report.<\/p><p>  I refer to the technical issue on the wider number of hospitals.  Sometimes we elect to deliver women in a general hospital because of the concurrent medical difficulty she might have.  In addition, in an emergency, we cannot have a situation where we have to require to transfer a patient to an obstetric unit for determination of pregnancy.  Therefore, it is very important that we include all Government-approved hospitals in this legislation.<\/p><p>  Again, Dr. Boylan has covered the issue of specialist omission.  This is a historic omission.  Some doctors have simply not put themselves on to the specialist register, which began in 2005, so perhaps for the sake of safety we should use the term &quot;obstetrician-gynaecologist&quot;.  This again would cover the situation of locums.  <\/p><p>  I was asked about the recommendation of the European court in the case of A, B and C <i>v.<\/i> Ireland.  Central to that is that we are now obliged to find a process for women through which they can see if they qualify for termination of pregnancy and, when that happens, whether they are able to access termination of pregnancy when their lives are at risk.  Today all of this is restricted to when a woman is at risk of dying.  <\/p><p>  Again, I would say that this legislation gives us the protection we need to allow this happen.  It addresses the issue of providing a process.  It allows us to establish substantial risk in a way that is supported by the law and it gives a woman a process through which she can explore this risk when she perceives herself to be at risk of dying.  In terms of suicidal intent, it is always a psychiatric assessment and we defer to our psychiatric colleagues in this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013051700035#KK00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Rhona Mahony"},{"type":"speech","time":1368797700,"counter":305,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their presentations.

It seems that induction is what we are talking about here whereas the legislation is silent on the matter.<\/p><p>  Dr. Mahony in her evidence last January said that there was no definition of substantial risk to life during pregnancy in terms of whether it meant a 1%, 10%, 50% or 80% chance of dying.

It is very difficult to estimate the incidence of suicide.  Occasionally, that verdict can be returned as an open verdict.  According to the triennial report on all deaths in Ireland between 2009 and 2011, there were two cases of suicide and I understand there was an antenatal case of suicide last year.  Suicide is extremely rare and the numbers can be difficult to estimate.<\/p><p>  I was asked if legislation will save lives.  Legislation will provide legal protection and flexibility for doctors to do their job.  I believe it will give doctors some peace and prevent hesitation where doctors are uncertain about whether they may act.  Doctors will always try to save a life but at the moment what is wrong is that they do not have the necessary legal protection.  That is really what the Bill is providing.<\/p><p>  In terms of mandatory care for a late delivery, we care for all babies.  I have to keep saying this.  Once a baby is viable, we give that baby every support to survive, regardless of why the baby is born.  If the baby requires support to survive, we do that.  We will always vindicate the life of the foetus.  That is not at issue.<\/p><p>  I will allow Dr. Coulter-Smith to address the ethical dilemmas surrounding suicidal intent.  In terms of the Irish Medical Council's proposal on head 4 and whether or not there are two psychiatrists, we must be clear that obstetricians and psychiatrists have very different roles.  I am not qualified to assess suicidal intent or ideation.  However, in a patient who may require termination of pregnancy because an expert psychiatrist feels she will kill herself, there are obstetrical considerations and, therefore, there must be a team involved.  We work as a team, generally.  These are rare, complex cases and it is very much our culture that we function as a team and include a broad range of disciplines.  It was interesting that Senator Burke asked about the patient who is under 18 years of age.  Of course, she is X.  I interpret this head of Bill as legislating for the X case and would argue that it is X who is very vulnerable and who needs to be protected by the State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013051700036#LL00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Rhona Mahony","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1368798900,"counter":313,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman.  With regard to suicide and where it ranks in terms of maternal mortality, suicide is extremely rare in pregnancy.  According to the UK figures, it is around one in 500,000.  It is extremely unusual and there are much more common causes of maternal death.  This is really more a question for psychiatrists.  From my discussion with psychiatrists, particularly in our hospital, it can be extremely difficult to decide how suicidal a woman is and how to rate it.  Our psychiatric colleagues tell us that, in pregnancy, if a patient's mental state is so altered that she has suicidal ideation or suicidal intent, she needs psychiatric treatment.  If the psychiatrists tell us the only way the woman's life can be saved is through a termination of pregnancy, it will require a number of psychiatrists to agree with that view.  If that is the case, following a multidisciplinary meeting about the case, that is what we will do.  The legislation confirms, reassures and provides clarity, certainty and protection for the doctors involved in the treatment of pregnant women in these very difficult situations.  It also provides clarity, reassurance, certainty and protection for the mothers and their families.  With regard to the protection of the baby, I totally agree with what Dr. Mahony has said.  In every situation where intervention must be made in order to save the mother's life, we do our utmost to prolong the pregnancy as long as we possibly can to give the baby every chance of survival.  Intervention is only made at the point at which we feel that if we do not intervene the mother may die.<\/p><p>  With regard to the Medical Council recommendation on the number of psychiatrists and obstetricians involved in the decision, it is a resource issue for our professions.  I will allow the psychiatrists to answer the question about their specialty.  If we get an increase in the number of women seeking to avail of termination of pregnancy in this country based on the legislation, there will be resource issues for our obstetric personnel, our psychiatric personnel and our hospitals.<\/p><p>  On the question of the legislation being prescriptive or silent on the methods of termination, I do not think the legislation should be prescriptive in any way.  The decision on how a pregnancy needs to be brought to a conclusion is based on a large number of factors.  The method used will be one that is the safest for the mother in any particular situation.<\/p><p>  On the question of whether the scheme of the Bill provides adequate protection for us as doctors, I think it does.  It goes a long way towards bringing forward legislation that sits well with the Medical Council guidelines, which is good.  In the case of a minor - someone under the age of 18 years - there are appropriate services that need to be put in place to deal with younger women.  Professionals in mental health care need to be made available to allow the appropriate care to be given.  The same multidisciplinary team involvement will be required in any major decision-making for patients who are minors and for older women.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013051700037#MM00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Sam Coulter-Smith"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1368798900,"counter":314,"content":"<p>A number of points have been raised.  The issue of suicide has come up again, as has the incidence of suicide in pregnancy.  Until recently, the CSO did not stipulate that it had to be included on a death certificate whether a woman was pregnant in the recent past.  We will never know the incidence of suicide among women in the early stages of pregnancy.  From time to time, coroners have issued verdicts that avoided the use of the word suicide out of sensitivity to the families involved.  It is understandable but perhaps not helpful in other contexts.  I will say no more about suicide; it is a matter for the psychiatrists, but it is important that members understand that we just do not know.  A question was directed to me about Professor Ferguson's paper and bad science.  I defer to the College of Psychiatrists of Ireland, which will deal with this in evidence on Monday.  I am not a psychiatrist and, as I emphasised before, we should be wary of people interpreting articles, information or papers in a field in which they are not practising on a daily basis and in a field in which they are not expert.<\/p> <p>I would not give an opinion on an orthopaedic problem to somebody who might need a hip replacement.  I would not dare give that opinion.  Similarly, I would not give an opinion in regard to psychiatric problems.  I am not trained for that and I have no experience in it.  We will always strive to save the life of the baby.  We make those decisions on a daily basis.  There are ethical issues involved and we deal with those on a daily basis as well.  That is what we do in our practice so there is no big problem in respect of that.<\/p><p> Under the heading of reasonable opinion in my statement, I said that I welcome the confirmation that the constitutional protection to the right to life of the unborn child is retained at all times where practicable.  Some campaigners are attempting to suggest that late terminations will be performed in Irish hospitals if this legislation is passed, implying that doctors would deliberately kill an unborn baby who is capable of existence outside the uterus.  Some of the more extreme groups are suggesting that newborn babies might be killed if this legislation is passed.  These views are clearly extremist, have no basis in fact and are, quite frankly, insulting.  There should be no suggestion that obstetricians and neonatologists would ever fail to make every effort to maintain the life of a baby once the threshold of viability is reached.<\/p><p> I refer to the issue of how we assess the risk.  The legislation reflects the judgment in the X case by saying it is not necessary for medical practitioners to be of the opinion that the risk to the woman's life is inevitable or immediate, as this approach insufficiently vindicates the pregnant woman's right to life.  We are talking here about the right to life of a woman and we need to remember this in discussing this entire issue.  It is interesting, though, that no figures are available for what percentage risk of death is acceptable and I hope that, in the future when the legislation is passed, that we, as obstetricians, will be able to take into account a woman's point of view as to the degree of risk she is willing to accept.  Some women are willing to accept an extreme risk and are willing to die in order to hope that they might have a child; other women decide that the risk is too great for them and, in these circumstances, when the outlook is utterly hopeless they prefer to have a termination of pregnancy and perhaps try again.  I need not elaborate on that anymore.  We have to be careful about trying to quantify risk that is unquantifiable.<\/p><p> The question of consultant numbers and ratios has come up and the committee would like some figures.  The figure in our maternity hospitals is approximately one consultant per 1,000 deliveries.  The ratio in the UK, with which we are frequently compared in all sorts of ways, is less than one in 500.  We are one in more than 1,000. Those of working in the National Maternity Hospital recently visited a hospital in Malmo, Sweden, which is of similar size to our hospital.  There were 30 consultants on the staff there; we have eight.  I hope that answers the question.  It means that obstetricians working in this country have no shortage of experience in dealing with complicated obstetrical cases and are well able to make decisions in the best interests of both patients for whom they are caring.<\/p><p> Have I left anything out?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013051700037#MM00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Peter Boylan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1368799500,"counter":316,"content":"<p>No.  Deputy Doherty had a question for Dr. Coulter-Smith.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013051700038#NN00200","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1368799500,"counter":317,"content":"<p>The only reason I asked the question again is because his opinion is so highly regarded, I would not like it to be misconstrued by people.

Currently, approximately 5,000 women a year and probably more go from Ireland to the UK for termination of pregnancy.  They never cross the threshold of our maternity services.  We do not know who they are and we do not have any understanding of the issues they have.  Some of them are crisis pregnancies and some are a result of rape and incest.

All three witnesses have suggested that the definition of \"appropriate location\" under head 1 should be broadened to include Government approved hospitals.  Related to this, under head 4, it is required that one of the two psychiatrists would be attached to an appropriate location, that is, to a maternity unit.  As Dr. Coulter-Smith pointed out, currently only three sub specialist psychiatrists are attached to the three large Dublin maternity hospitals.  Does that mean in Dublin if a woman is seeking to access the procedure under head 4, there are only there psychiatrists from whom one psychiatrist can be drawn?  That is a restrictive pool.  We heard earlier from the medical bodies that this restriction might not be practicable.

Dr. Boylan seems to be ruling that out as a possibility.<\/p><p>  Dr. Mahony laid heavy emphasis on the lack of clarity over when interventions can be made at present.  I remember when she was here on the last occasion.  Was there any occasion on which she was unable to intervene, leading to the death of a mother under the current legal position?  Dr. Mahony mentioned Ms X and stated she should be listened to.  I do not disagree with her.  She will know that Ms X did not have an abortion.  In 1997, Ms C was brought to Britain unaware of the fact that she was going to have an abortion.  She was subsequently suicidal.  She was in this House two days ago talking to Members.  Should Ms C and women who have had abortions and who have suffered from serious trauma subsequently, sometimes for 20 and 30 years, not need to be listened to also?<\/p><p>  I thank Dr. Coulter-Smith for the clarity of his presentation.  He mentioned something that struck me.  It was stated that if one carries out an induction of a baby of 25 weeks, there is a risk of death or disability and cerebral palsy.  That was not mentioned by Dr. Boylan or Dr. Mahony.  Does Dr. Coulter-Smith agree it is a possibility?  I have been told by an obstetrician that there could be a 50% chance of cerebral palsy for that early delivery.  Do Dr. Boylan and Dr. Mahony agree that we should operate on the basis of evidence-based medicine and, above all, do no harm?  Can they point to any evidence that will actually vindicate the position that abortion is a treatment for suicidality?  I acknowledge that is outside their range.<\/p><p>  The spectre is being raised that this, perhaps, is a very restricted regime.  I suggest that the doctors examine California's Therapeutic Abortion Act 1967.  Within three years of enactment, the number of abortions grew from hundreds to 61,000.  An expert and constitutional scholar in the Visitors Gallery, Mr. Linton, will be able to fill in the witnesses on precisely what happened in that area.

The figures are that Ireland has 2.4 obstetricians per hundred thousand members of the population while the figure for the second lowest-rated country in Europe, the Netherlands, is four, which is twice as high.  The Netherlands has a birth rate of approximately two thirds that in Ireland.  Our proportion of obstetricians to members of the population is one third the European average, and we have one of the highest birth rates in Europe.  None of the hospitals in our network can provide comprehensive care to a woman who becomes seriously ill in pregnancy.  Most of our maternity care is being given in small units or specialist stand-alone hospitals that do not have adequate backup.  My profession, our medical schools and hospitals bear some responsibility for this; the fault is not entirely that of politicians, but let us at least leave this Chamber after these three days of debate having put firmly on the public agenda the need to reform the way in which we deliver obstetrical care in this country.  We need to reform it urgently.<\/p><p>  Let me get down to the business of the moment, the endless tendentious questioning about the suicidality issue.  All of the doctors who have been here will have been here because we follow evidence.

I will come to Dr. Crown's comments presently.  I passionately believe that the maternity hospitals should be co-located and that they require a great deal of further resources to carry out their day-to-day work.<\/p><p>  I appreciate the comments on psychiatrists.  The additional resources needed in psychiatry comprise a question best posed to the psychiatrists.<\/p><p>  I am interested in the Senator's comments on head 19.  She is absolutely correct.  If a doctor has made an error in judgment or has not acted according to the law, I do not believe a woman could then be at risk of finding herself in breach of the law.  If it were the case, it would not be wise law, I would argue.<\/p><p>  The question of time limits is more related to Dr. Boylan.  I agree, however, that we must be very careful that the appeal time not be too long.  The appeal time must be appropriate to the urgency of the medical condition that is unfolding.<\/p><p>  With regard to head 3, on the termination of pregnancy in private institutions, the concern must, of course, be addressed.  I refer to the idea that one could set up a clinic and perform terminations of pregnancies.  I think we can assume that Government-approved hospitals would get around that so it would not be possible to set up a clinic.  That is not what we are suggesting here.  Practically, it is very unlikely that a Marie Stopes or termination-of-pregnancy clinic would be dealing with very sick women at risk of dying.  That is simply very unlikely.  Most of the women would be in hospital because they would be very ill.<\/p><p>  With regard to head 6, it seems to be a matter for the psychiatrist.  There is a hint and a suggestion that we should be locking women up.  I would always not concur with that, but that is a matter for the psychiatrists.<\/p><p>  With regard to the effect, I have no doubt that the termination of pregnancy can be really harmful for a woman's health, and the circumstances surrounding it can be really harmful.  I also believe that, on very rare occasions, it could save a life.  That is my only comment on that.  Psychiatry is not my area of expertise.  With regard to delivery at the threshold of viability, I practice in foetal and maternal medicine and believe that there is no doubt that where we deliver babies at a very early gestations, there is a risk of cerebral palsy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013051700039#OO01400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Rhona Mahony","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1368800700,"counter":345,"content":"<p>With regard to the lack of intensive care facilities, I agree that head 1 must be broadened to include the general hospitals as some of our sickest patients will be in those institutions.  It is absolutely correct that there are three specialist perinatal psychiatrists, all of them based in Dublin.  This is a very restricted pool of professionals in this area.  Not only are we under-resourced from a maternity services point of view, the mental health support of those maternity services is also under-resourced.  It is something that must be addressed.<\/p><p>  I have nothing to add to what Dr. Mahony said about decriminalisation in head 19.<\/p><p>  To return to a question I missed earlier, I was asked if I was aware of any intervention in a case of suicidality.  I am not.<\/p><p>  There was reference to the Californian experience.  I do not have any knowledge of that or of what legislation was introduced which might have led to that change.<\/p><p>  We have talked in detail about the consultant-patient ratio.  Our midwife-patient ratio is also approximately half of what it should be.  The internationally recognised appropriate ratio of midwives to patients should be between 1:25 and 1:30.  In our hospital at present it is approximately 1:50.  That is in a situation where, at our peak levels of activity, there were 42 deliveries in a 24-hour period last December.  That was delivered from nine labour ward rooms.  One cannot imagine the level of activity and the risk associated with trying to put that level of activity through an extraordinarily busy labour ward.  It is not a matter for this setting, but I should point out that the safety of the services we provide is down to the skill, dedication, hard work, missing meals and missing breaks of our extraordinarily talented and gifted midwives.  We owe a huge debt of gratitude to that group, mainly women although there are some men.<\/p><p>  In terms of Professor Crown's point about how often this situation occurs, I agree that suicidality in pregnancy is extraordinarily rare.  Most obstetricians will go through their entire working life and not encounter this situation.  However, it is important that if a woman's life is deemed to be at risk, she has access to the appropriate psychiatric care.  If termination of pregnancy is deemed to be appropriate in that situation, that is fine.  We will get involved and we will do that.  However, it is important that gestation is not covered by that element of the legislation, and that leaves this open.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013051700040#PP00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Sam Coulter-Smith"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1368800700,"counter":346,"content":"<p>With regard to Senator Bacik's points, the issue of head 1 being broadened has been dealt with adequately.  I support everything that was said.  As to whether a perinatal psychiatrist should be involved, we do not have three.  We have one and a half.  As Dr. Mahony said, these are whole-time equivalents, so we have 1.5 perinatal psychiatrists for 75,000 pregnant women per year.  It is approximately 100,000 if one includes miscarriage.  That is questionable.<\/p><p>  Regarding the time for the medical review procedures, seven days is too long to initiate the process, with another seven days for the review team to give an opinion.  These women are at risk of death and a fortnight is probably too long to wait in those circumstances.  The circumstances will vary from one woman to another.  We need to be able to individualise.  My personal opinion is that seven days is too long.<\/p><p>  On head 19, I have difficulty with the proposal that a pregnant woman who undergoes a termination will potentially face 14 years in prison.  If a woman is subject to medical opinion and if that opinion, even if erroneously, concludes that termination is necessary to save her life, it is entirely unreasonable to expect her to second-guess a doctor's opinion in this respect.  It would appear somewhat bizarre and contradictory to propose that a woman be sentenced to 14 years imprisonment on foot of accepting medical advice in this State, whereas should she travel to the UK and have a termination there, she is protected under the constitutional amendments of 1992.  That does not seem to make sense.<\/p><p>  There were several other questions relating to the Marie Stopes clinic and private institutions.  The end of the sentence was omitted by Senator Walsh, that is, in emergencies.  Women in emergencies will not be attending the Marie Stopes clinic and I doubt very much that the Minister would approve that the Marie Stopes clinic terminate pregnancies.<\/p><p>  Head 6 is a matter for comment by the psychiatrist.  In my practice I have not come across an instance where a woman has died because we have not terminated her pregnancy.  I have come across it in other circumstances in the recent past.<\/p><p>  Should women who have had an abortion be heard?  Absolutely.  Women who have had all experiences should be heard.  However, the climate in which women have terminations in this country, albeit they have them abroad, is quite hostile.  We should, perhaps, carry out some research on the influence of hostility, antagonism, guilt and so forth that these women experience and the inability, in particular for women who have foetal abnormalities and who go abroad for a termination, to grieve for the loss of that child.  They grieve for them; these are very much wanted children.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013051700040#PP00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Peter Boylan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1368801300,"counter":348,"content":"<p>There are four minutes remaining in this section and three members have indicated, two of whom have not yet spoken.

I have always been uncomfortable with the idea of legislators - that is, people like myself - interfering in that relationship between a woman and her doctor in pregnancy and childbirth.<\/p><p>  To use that awful phrase, \"We are where we are.\"  We are dealing with a Bill which is extremely restrictive and deals with only one item - namely, pregnant women whose lives are at risk by suicide.

Why do the witnesses think there is a need to separate physical illness and self-destruction?  Should it not be left to medical professionals to determine what the real and substantial risk is?

It is quite extraordinary that in Ireland the 1861 Act stands and we have not legislated for the X case, yet we have gone to great lengths, as I said earlier, to avoid addressing the reality of maternal death during pregnancy.  Therefore, women are allowed to travel from this jurisdiction despite the fact that termination of pregnancy remains a criminal offence in Ireland.  That is, of course, extraordinary.<\/p><p>  Deputy Healy asked number of questions, some of which might best be addressed to the lawyers.  When we talk about legal clarity and whether I am happy that the provisions in the Bill give us what we are looking for, there is provision to remove the 1861 legislation, which I favour.  There is provision in the Bill to have doctors protected by the law in making their opinions, and where they perceive there is a substantial risk to life I believe, under this Bill, they will be protected in that regard, which is very important. <\/p><p>  On whether there is adequate access, there are number of issues.  In terms of emergencies, all of the 19 units in this country have comprehensive cover.  For example, in the case of haemorrhage or fulminating blood pressure, all units in Ireland are capable of carrying out those procedures.  If they are not, they should not be open for business, because if one is running an obstetric institution one must be able to take on obstetric emergencies. <\/p><p>  In terms of access for more complicated medical disorders, as I said, we have a great network.  We cannot have every single medical discipline in every single hospital.  We do network for expert opinion and can pick up the phone and talk to each other.  We all know each other quite well.  We are used to working together.  We have a culture of working together and of seeking other opinions.<\/p><p>  On the specific area of access - namely, the question of seven days to make a submission and seven days for appeal - I agree with Dr. Boylan.  We have to be very careful.

I am happy that the Bill, if enacted with the alterations we are suggesting, will introduce legal clarity and provide protection for doctors, midwives and so on.  <\/p><p>  The question was raised about access in respect of the decision as to whether a woman is entitled to a termination.  There is also the question of access in the case where the decision is that she should have a termination to save her life.  We have discussed the issues relating to which hospital and so on and doctors' definition of a specialist register, etc.<\/p><p>  Deputy Robert Troy asked why we should separate medical from psychiatric illnesses.  I have always felt, like my colleagues Dr. Mahony and Dr. Coulter-Smith, that if a particular procedure is required to save the life of a mother, the reason the procedure is required should not depend on whether the risk to her life is a consequence of a medical condition such as a congenital or complex heart disease or the consequence of an imminent danger that she will kill herself.<\/p><p>  An issue we have not covered in great depth is that of conscientious objection, which I propose to deal with briefly.  It is important to note that this issue also applies to the mother.  We, as doctors, may make a decision that a mother is very likely to die, unless there is a termination of pregnancy, but the woman herself may refuse that termination because she is willing to take the risk or she has a conscientious objection to undergoing a termination of pregnancy.  As doctors, we will respect that wish.  Likewise, the wishes of doctors and midwives who have a conscientious objection to being involved in a termination of pregnancy will be accommodated.  Those of us who have trained abroad, in the United Kingdom and elsewhere, have personal experience of this and not faced any difficulty when it has come to performing terminations of pregnancy, primarily for social reasons in the United Kingdom.  There is no problem with this and no need for people to be afraid.  Nobody will be forced under this legislation to do anything against his or her conscience.

In this room this morning we listened to other witnesses, and Professor McAuliffe reminded us - we should not need such reminding - that maternal health services in Ireland are among the very best in the world.  She stated that \"families should be reassured that they are receiving the very best of care during pregnancy\", with Irish experience in this regard comparing \"very well\" with the UK and the rest of Europe.<\/p><p>  There is the issue of a \"chilling\" factor, and we have allowed a myth to be created that is becoming a chilling factor.

Will she comment on that?<\/p><p>  I fully agree with Dr. Mahony's comment today that suicide is death, but I would invite her to agree with my statement that abortion is also death.  All of us should try to ensure that with whatever legislative changes we enact, the medical changes that will be required, along with the investment spoken of by Senator Crown and others, must be addressed to ensure that the spectres of both suicide and abortion are removed as far as practicable from the landscape.<\/p><p>  The witness indicated surprise at how the 1861 Act remains in force, but it is still operational in Britain, where we are exporting our problem.  The 1861 Act in Britain is not stopping the huge abortion problem there.  Perhaps we should take that fact on board as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013051700043#SS00500","speaker":"1121"},{"type":"speech","time":1368802500,"counter":372,"content":"<p>On a point of order, I understood, as a member of the committee, that we would be discussing the heads of the Bill today.

It is important to clarify this with a \"Yes\" or \"No\" answer for the committee.<\/p><p>  My next question is about the heads on physical and mental illness and has as much to do with the legislation as with a medical ethos.  A physical illness is very much about an objective diagnosis which one can clearly make very straightforwardly, whereas mental illness involves a more subjective diagnosis.  Under the legislation as proposed, there is a reference to two psychiatrists and one obstetrician.  Do the witnesses feel the obstetrician should have an informed opinion to add to those of the psychiatrists rather than an overall veto?  This more or less goes back to what is a medical ethos and the relationship with the patient.  Dr. Boylan has said the decision is the patient's because some patients want more and some want less, which is the basis of the relationship practitioners have with them.  Perhaps we should approach it from that point of view in the legislation.<\/p><p>  Since I qualified as a doctor 20 years ago, 100,000 women of child-bearing age have had terminations in other jurisdictions.

I have learned a lot today and would like to know if I would be correct to say the termination of a pregnancy does not automatically mean the termination of the life of the foetus or the child.  I would like to be able to mention this next week in the Seanad.  It is vitally important for the way the Bill is treated.<\/p><p>  I address a question to Dr. Coulter-Smith who raised two interesting hypothetical questions - one on the delivery of a baby at 25 weeks and the second on delivery at 20 weeks and the consequences for the health of the child through cerebral palsy or whatever else.

Underpinning my questions is the fact that I would not like there to be a chilling effect on legislators or specialists doing their best to understand what the evidence says.  That is a job we must all do.  It is quite clear from Dr. Coulter-Smith's paper that it is a job he and his colleagues, as obstetricians, must do having regard to what they have learned from their psychiatric colleagues.  I do not think my friend, Senator Crown, necessarily intended it but it is important to remember that we must respect one another's genuine search.<\/p><p>  I have two housekeeping questions that we should ask of all our guests and they are meant in the best spirit.  Do our guests mind telling us whether they were consulted in any way by the Department of Health or the HSE post the expert group in the preparation of the heads?  I have not had the chance to read the papers in detail but Dr. Coulter-Smith said he was here to give the views of himself and his colleagues in the Rotunda Hospital.  Are our other guests here in a purely personal capacity, are they speaking for their colleagues or a majority of their colleagues, or did they consult among colleagues?<\/p><p>  My second question concerns Dr. Mahony's point about the X case.  She posited the test of the possibility and the challenge is that the Supreme Court in the X case found, without the benefit of a psychiatrist in the High Court, that it was where there was a probability.  The difficulty seems to be whether there is any evidence on which psychiatrists could rely that could allow them to say that, as a matter of probability, this will happen.  I ask Dr. Coulter-Smith if that lies under his statement about enacting and underpinning the idea that the termination of pregnancy is a solution when there is no evidence to support the intervention.  It creates a major ethical dilemma for the profession.<\/p><p>  Building on that, the legislation does not just put the obstetrician in the role of carrying out the procedure but of certifier.  The obstetrician's certification is necessary along with that of the two psychiatrists.  In the same way that under head 2, the doctors are faced with a child of 20 weeks in the womb and every effort will be made to bring two patients out safely and hold off on treatment, as Dr. Mahony and others said.  In exercising the certification role, would the witnesses consider asking the psychiatrists whether it is possible to delay the procedure to get the child to the point where it could be delivered not just prematurely but also safely and well?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013051700045#UU00300","speaker":"1146"},{"type":"speech","time":1368803700,"counter":400,"content":"<p>T&aacute; an t-am caite.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013051700045#UU00400","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1368803700,"counter":401,"content":"<p>Is that within the witnesses' capacity under these heads?<\/p><p>  Finally, what is the situation in regard to painkilling in these situations under heads 2, 3 and 4 when dealing with later term deliveries?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013051700045#UU00500","speaker":"1146"},{"type":"speech","time":1368803700,"counter":402,"content":"<p>Like a number of speakers, I am conscious this Bill is about the preservation of maternal life and we are addressing ourselves to the heads of the Bill.

In spite of Senator Crown's question, I am at a loss as to his answer.  If no evidence exists, surely none of his psychiatric colleagues would prescribe a termination of a pregnancy in these circumstances, no more than he would prescribe the termination of a pregnancy on the grounds of heart failure, for the sake of argument.  I am at a loss to see how this is relevant.<\/p><p>  Dr. Coulter-Smith mentioned that the inclusion of suicidality would lead to an increased demand for termination services.

Nor do we know whether part of our excellent record in Ireland is due to the fact that women over 45 years of age travel abroad because they believe their lives may be at risk and choose to vote with their feet.

Will the legislation force us to do anything against best medical practice?  No.  With regard to two psychiatrists and one obstetrician having an input into the decision and the patient decides, the patient decides within the law and we also decide within the law.  When this legislation is enacted we will all have to work within the law.  There is no question about that.  There is a huge variety of different experiences.  Unquestionably, many women are damaged by termination of pregnancy, and many women are damaged by not having a termination of pregnancy.  That is life.  Life is messy and we as obstetricians and doctors see all the shades of human experiences.  There is a wide spectrum and one cannot just focus on a single particular group.<\/p><p>  This Bill is about the protection of life.  People have different opinions about the inclusion of foetal abnormality, rape, incest and so forth.  However, the terms of this Bill are very straight and we should not get into discussing other issues in this environment.  Archbishop Martin's letter referred to the possibility of a baby being left to die or a baby being killed.  Those two would be criminal offences.  There is no question about that.  Everybody must be reassured on that.  He raised the question perhaps hoping for clarification of this issue in a public forum.  I am very happy to clarify that for the archbishop.<\/p><p>  We have dealt with the question of pre-term birth.  On the chilling factor and the 14 year jail sentence, I do not have a problem with doctors being held responsible for making illegal decisions regarding termination of pregnancy.  That must stay on the Statute Book.  No doctor has a problem with that as far as I am aware.  I do have a problem with a woman being criminalised if she follows medical advice.  I think that is fundamentally wrong and unfair, particularly if she has the constitutional protection of this country if she goes to the UK and has the same procedure.  It just does not make sense.<\/p><p>  There was a question about the law of unintended consequences and the fear that there would be a very liberal regime of termination of pregnancy as a result of this legislation.  The figure of one in 500,000 has been introduced into the debate.  That is a woman who commits suicide in the UK, which has a very liberal regime and where there is very easy access to termination of pregnancy, effectively on request.  We will never be able to answer the question of how many women would commit suicide in this country if termination of pregnancy was not available because it is available.  It is just available in the UK.  Therefore, we will never be able to answer that question.<\/p><p>  However, it appears that genuine suicide risk in pregnancy is extremely rare.  We must trust our professional colleagues in psychiatry who assess this risk on a daily basis.  The committee will hear evidence on Monday from experts in psychiatry and I urge the members to listen to the balanced opinions that will be put forward that day, and not to be swayed by ideological opinions.  We were asked if we would ask a psychiatrist to delay a termination if the duration of the pregnancy was 20 weeks.  We are obliged under this legislation to take due care to do all we can to preserve the life of the baby.  It is not a question of a psychiatrist rolling up and saying we should terminate a pregnancy without any discussion between us.  We do not act like that.  It is not a professional way to behave and we do not behave like that.  These will be joint decisions taken in consultation with our psychiatric colleagues, whose opinions we respect and trust.<\/p><p>  With regard to the State getting things wrong, I am not sure that is relevant to this.  I have made reference to head 19.  I do not believe a woman should be criminalised.  Yes, everything must be done to save life.  That is what this Bill is about; it is about saving lives, which is why it is called the protection of life during pregnancy Bill.<\/p><p>  The question has arisen about women being coached to fool experienced professional psychiatrists to believe that they are genuinely suicidal.  We have to trust psychiatrists.  They are not going to be fooled.  They are well able to recognise women who are attempting to pull the wool over their eyes.  I do not think there is any question of a psychiatrist in this country being fooled by somebody setting themselves up.  Undoubtedly, there will be mischievous people who will try to trick them into the belief that they are suicidal when they are probably not even pregnant in the first place.  However, our psychiatrists are a smart bunch of people.  They will recognise those women when they walk in and they will be able to deal with it.  Do not worry about that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013051700046#VV00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Peter Boylan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1368804300,"counter":407,"content":"<p>My comments on the first question would echo those of Dr. Boylan.  Senator Norris asked about babies being left to die or deliberately killed.  There is absolutely no question of that happening in this country.

He asked about the different clinical scenarios.  Where there is a threat to the life of the mother based on a physical illness, in all likelihood the evidence will be much clearer.  Where there is a risk of suicide, the evidence is a little less clear and it makes that situation much more challenging and difficult to deal with.  That is where the expertise of our psychiatric colleagues is required.  Senator Norris is absolutely correct that whether the intervention occurs because a woman has a physical illness or because she is suicidal, the outcome of that situation will be the same at a particular gestation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013051700046#VV00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Sam Coulter-Smith","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1368804900,"counter":409,"content":"<p>On the question of whether it would alter my practice if we passed the legislation, the answer is &ldquo;No,&rdquo; although there are some amendments we have discussed today that need to be taken into consideration.  We have had a discussion on the concept of physical illness versus mental illness.  One is objective - we have definite signs - and one is very subjective.  I am an obstetrician and cannot assess suicidal ideation, but I am very confident that my colleagues who are experts in psychiatry can assess it.  They do this very commonly in the course of their practice.  As an aside, one very tragic objective outcome of suicidal ideation is death.<\/p><p>  On Senator David Norris&rsquo;s comments, the Bill, of course, is not about physical health but about the risk to life.  That needs to be very clear.  We are not talking about physical or mental health but about the risk of death from any cause, be it physical or mental.  In the majority of cases it will pertain to death from physical causes.<\/p><p>  With regard to Archbishop Martin&rsquo;s letter, I really hope that by now it is clear to everyone that we are not in the business of killing babies and there is no question that a baby that is capable of surviving will not be offered every support to optimise its survival.  There is no question that a baby born at 28 or 30 weeks gestation would somehow be killed.  That is murder, a criminal offence, and out of the question.  One must understand that we will do everything and exhaust every single medical avenue open to us to prolong pregnancy such that a baby may achieve viability and to give babies born at early gestations every support to optimise their survival.  We do this all the time.  It is a very fundamental part of our job.<\/p><p>  I have been asked directly to clarify what I am worried about.  The 1861 legislation still stands and nobody has yet told me it does not.  The Supreme Court judgment is in place, but it has not been legislated for.  I presume we are all here because we see a necessity to legislate for the Supreme Court case.  We need legal clarity surrounding the termination of pregnancy to save women&rsquo;s lives and the sort of legislation and regulation that will afford us legal protection and flexibility to do our job.  It is really important that everyone take on board that the 1861 legislation pertains not only to doctors but also to women.  That is very important.  The question of women being at risk of penal servitude must be taken on board.  Therefore, I welcome this legislation and commend the Government for introducing this long-overdue Bill.<\/p><p>  We return time and again to the question of suicide which is extremely rare in pregnancy.  I am not a psychiatrist, but I have some expertise in publishing papers and setting up studies.  There is no evidence regarding suicide.  There is a lot of evidence on mental health and many papers dealing with different aspects, but there is no paper in this country that deals specifically with the outcome of suicidal ideation.  Gold standard therapy would involve a randomised controlled trial.  That would give us the best evidence.  All other evidence is quite flimsy, actually, and one will have different papers stating different things.  I do not believe there should be a randomised controlled trial.  Are we really going to take women with suicidal ideation and randomise them into two arms, one that is allowed a termination of pregnancy in the belief we are saving their lives and another prevented from terminating their pregnancies in the belief this might result in their dying.  That study should never be undertaken.  There is no evidence; this is extremely rare and there cannot be compelling evidence when the numbers are very tiny.<\/p><p>  With regard to head 19, I agree that we need to be very careful.  Women should not be liable for criminal prosecution on the grounds of this, particularly considering that when we may perform a termination of pregnancy, the women concerned would be taking a doctor&rsquo;s advice that they should have a termination of pregnancy to save their lives.  There should be no question under any circumstance of a woman being liable legally.  That answers that question.<\/p><p>  We had a discussion on the circumstances concerning two patients and it was stated 5,000 women travelled to England.  That is not the issue; today we are talking about the heads of a Bill that deals with the protection of life during pregnancy.<\/p><p>  On the question of suicide, the idea that women will turn up in front of expert psychiatrists and lie in vast numbers and the suggestion our psychiatrists who are extremely well trained and competent have no idea how to assess ideation just have no basis in fact.  Furthermore, we need to be very careful.  Women with suicidal ideation need to be taken seriously and believed.  I would be a very bad doctor if I began every single medical consultation with the presumption that my patient was lying.<\/p><p>  We have had a conversation about resources.  I would be the first person to say obstetrics and maternity services in this country are dreadfully under-resourced.  There is an urgent need to address the resource issues within the maternity sector.  The approach we should have is not to fail to legislate in this Bill; the approach should be to address the issue of resources in the maternity sector.  I hope the Government will take on board these views and give maternity services the attention they so urgently need and deserve.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013051700047#WW00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Rhona Mahony"},{"type":"speech","time":1368804900,"counter":410,"content":"<p>I thank our three witnesses, Dr. Mahony, Dr. Coulter-Smith and Dr. Boylan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013051700047#WW00300","speaker":"989"},{"type":"unspoken","content":"<p><b>Obstetric Care Facilities - Smaller Hospitals<\/b><\/p>","time":1368805500,"counter":412,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013051700048#YY00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1368805500,"counter":413,"content":"<p>We will resume in public session for the fourth and final part of today's discussion and analysis of the heads of the Protection of Life during Pregnancy Bill 2013.

I welcome the publication of the Protection of Life during Pregnancy Bill 2013 and commend the Government on bringing it forward.  I also commend the members of the committee and other Members for the intellectual effort they have put into this debate through the course of the day.  It has been a long day, so I will be brief.<\/p><p>  On the issue of resources, in the next decade we can expect in the order of 100 maternal deaths in Ireland.  It is possible that one, two or three of these potential maternal deaths might be affected by the legislation before us.  In terms of the number of possible deaths, therefore, this great intellectual effort will affect a relatively small number of women.  It is important that the Oireachtas would at some point address the state of the maternity services.  The unit in Limerick which I represent, for example, has the lowest number of obstetricians in the whole of Europe at two per 100,000.  This shortage of resources will likely lead to some difficulties in the future.<\/p><p>  Turning to the specifics of the heads of the Bill, the first issue that has come up for discussion in my department is the question of what is a real and substantial risk to the life of the woman.  I note that this is not defined clearly in the heads and I understand the reasons for that.  The issue has been raised in the submission by the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, which I support.  My personal preference is that there would be an explicit statement setting out that this is a matter which cannot be defined in terms of real numbers or percentages, and that it should really be left to the medical experts to determine.  It would be wrong if what is actually a matter for legislators were ultimately to be decided by a court.<\/p><p>  We have identified two minor technical issues that should be addressed, the first of which relates to the question of an ectopic pregnancy.  It is possible to have an ectopic pregnancy within the  womb, in the cervix, in the neck of the womb or in the scar of a previous caesarean section.  We are seeing more and more of the latter as the rate of caesareans has risen.  One can have a pregnancy that is ectopic but within the womb, and that is an extremely dangerous condition which could fall under this legislation.<\/p><p>  The second issue, which was also pointed out by the delegates from the institute, relates to locations.  Some 40% of babies in Ireland are born in stand-alone hospitals, namely, the three in Dublin and my own unit in Limerick.  Some of the more difficult work we have to do is carried out in the general regional hospital.  A caesarean section on a critically ill woman, for instance, would have to be done in a general hospital.  That needs to be included in the legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013051700048#YY00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Gerard Burke"},{"type":"speech","time":1368805500,"counter":415,"content":"<p>Thank you, Dr. Burke.

Like Dr. Burke, I commend the Government and the legal draftsmen on putting together these legislative proposals under such difficult circumstances.  My submission is intended to reflect on how the proposed legislation might impact on the practice of obstetrics in small to medium-sized units, that is, in units with three consultant obstetricians on the staff.  There are 12 such units out of the total of 19 in the country, and they deliver approximately one third of all babies.  Therefore, they make up a significant number of deliveries.  I will not dwell too much on the issue of resources other than to say that, in general, we would tend to be very under-resourced.<\/p><p>  There has been a great deal of repetition in the discussion today, so I will address only those heads of the Bill which we consider specific to the practice in our units.  I have collaborated with a number of colleagues in clarifying our position in this regard.  In regard to head 2, which deals with the risk to life from physical illness, not being a risk of self-destruction, my understanding is that this relates to cases of severe heart disease, cancer or other major medical illnesses.  Under the proposed head, one obstetrician and a doctor from the speciality caring for the significant complex medical condition are required to make a decision regarding ongoing management of the pregnancy.  We feel that the bulk of these cases, in general, are likely to be managed in tertiary referral hospitals and are not likely to impact on the smaller maternity units.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013051700048#YY00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Mary McCaffrey","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1368806100,"counter":418,"content":"<p>Thank you, Dr. McCaffrey.

I previously sent in a submission in early January which dealt with two specific matters which I will deal with today.  As I was instructed to deal with the heads of the Bill, I have four points to make this evening.  The word I am intending to use is &quot;clarity&quot;, which seems to be the word of the evening.<\/p><p>  Head 2 refers to risk of loss of life from physical illness.  My point on this is personal and relates to cancer.  Senator Crown may be one of the most eminent oncologists in the country, maybe in the world.  I have a personal point to which he may attend.  One of the reasons we are here is the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in the A, B and C cases.  One successful plaintiff, C, was a woman who had been treated for cancer.  She was, according to the expert report, &ldquo;unable to obtain clear advice as to the effect of the pregnancy on her health or the effect of medical treatment on the foetus.&rdquo;  If this legislation goes through, as broadly outlined in the heads of the Bill, will a woman such as C be in a better position?<\/p><p>  Part of my reason for bringing this up is that the medical risks involved with cancer in pregnancy, which is one of the major threats to a woman&rsquo;s life that may lead to a need for termination, have changed dramatically over the past few years.  A Belgian doctor, Dr. Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Amant, has spoken in Ireland several times on these developments and there are several publications in <i>The Lancet<\/i> on the matter from last year, which I attached to my submission.  While they may be technical in nature, I added them for two reasons.  The first is that they describe the changes in the treatments available and the second is that they deal with the problems of treating cancer in pregnancy.  The three that are listed are under-treatment because of fear of treating the baby, late diagnosis and the carrying out of terminations of pregnancy when not required.<\/p><p>  My end reason for bringing up this subject is that I suggest to the committee that the legislation should mention somewhere that patients with cancer in pregnancy should be referred to a single cancer treatment centre which has acquired expertise in the management of pregnant patients.  One of the articles I attached to my submission dealt with the question of leukaemia or blood and bone marrow cancers.  The reason I put it in is that it is an extraordinary complex area.  As an average obstetrician and gynaecologist, it is beyond my understanding.  My basic idea is that patients who are pregnant and have cancer should have access to a specialist oncology centre with surgery and radiotherapy.  There should be one such centre in the country which has expertise to offer this particular group of patients.<\/p><p>  My second point refers to head 4, which deals with the risk of loss of life from self-destruction.  The other reason we are here today is the Supreme Court case of X, which occurred 22 years ago.  As an obstetrician, I do not have any first-hand experience of psychiatry.  It reflects an enormous change in obstetric practice that an obstetrician is being asked to intervene in a physically healthy pregnancy.  While it appears from the legislation that an obstetrician would be involved in the decision-making, he is referred to otherwise possibly as a technician, suggesting that maybe he should be involved so he does not feel like a technician.  However, my gut is extremely unhappy with the idea of a mindless terminator for psychiatric reasons.  This decision was made 21 years ago.  From the hearings that were held in January, I do not believe any case of suicide associated with refusal of termination has ever surfaced.  The evidence from my reading of it seems to be extremely poor.  Many of the speakers earlier were happy to take the expert advice of a psychiatrist to act if required.  I am not certain how a psychiatrist can reach a decision on this matter where to date I do not believe any evidence has been produced.<\/p><p>  The psychiatric or suicide risk clause has been brought in in other jurisdictions and has been widely - I would say universally - abused.  Last year, <i>The Daily Telegraph<\/i> did an expos&eacute; of the abuse of psychiatric reasons in the UK, with the use of pre-stamped forms.  People went to one doctor to get a form stamped, then to another to get it stamped and then got a termination.  I can see no reason, despite the safeguards built into this legislation, that culture could not arise in this country in the future.  I am extremely concerned as an obstetrician that I would be drawn into a situation in which a termination of pregnancy will be done for psychiatric reasons without very clear evidence that this is to the patient&rsquo;s benefit.  If the baby is going to lose its life in this circumstance, then I would want to be very clear that there is a clinical benefit to the mother.  To date, I can see none of that.  That is my big issue with the heads of the Bill.<\/p><p>  The other matter which I would like to deal with is the question of conscience, which Dr. Mary McCaffrey mentioned as well.  I use the term &ldquo;conscience&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;conscientious objection&rdquo; because the latter implies that this is a problem.  Twice in the past few months, as a doctor, I have been told that a doctor should leave his or her conscience outside the room.  I would ask the committee to reflect on what it means if a doctor suspends his or her conscience faculties.  Conscience is not a religious concept.  If one sees somebody beating a child on the street and one continues to do one&rsquo;s shopping, then there is something wrong with one&rsquo;s conscience.  It is an obvious thing.  For example, if I decided to suspend my conscience with a patient on a waiting list and he offered me &euro;300 to go up the list, then that is a very tempting, painless and invisible transaction which I am sure occurs in the political world.  The only thing that will stop a practitioner-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013051700050#AAA00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. John Monaghan"},{"type":"speech","time":1368806700,"counter":423,"content":"<p>That is an objectionable statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013051700050#AAA00400","speaker":"1075"},{"type":"speech","time":1368806700,"counter":424,"content":"<p>I ask Dr. Monaghan to withdraw that remark.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013051700050#AAA00500","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1368807300,"counter":425,"content":"<p>I am certainly happy to withdraw it.

The Bill to be produced should recognise the importance of conscience rather than the importance of conscientious objection, on which I would be happy to answer questions.<\/p><p>  In relation to head 19, it appears to be a significant endorsement of the constitutional position of the unborn in this country where it states it shall be an offence for a person to do any act with the intent to destroy unborn human life.  I support this.  As obstetricians would know, the problem in other jurisdictions is that children, or babies, are directly killed by injection or suction and evacuation of the uterus.  I know that previous speakers have referred to this and said they do not see it happening in Ireland.  Certainly, surgical termination, as it is called, is more dangerous than medical termination of pregnancy and the Act should specifically prevent doctors from killing a baby, where it is necessary for it to be delivered, directly before it is born, either by surgical means or lethal injection.  I ask that this be specifically included in the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013051700051#BBB00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. John Monaghan"},{"type":"speech","time":1368807300,"counter":429,"content":"<p>I thank each of the speakers and apologise to Dr. Burke that I was not back in time to hear his oral presentation, but I thank him for his written submission.  <\/p><p>  I am not directing my questions at anyone in particular, but I am anxious to learn from the witnesses if there are particular differences in their collective experiences because of their largely rural, non-Dublin city locations, as against those of the other witnesses we heard earlier.  I refer to some of the questions we asked in relation to the situations that might apply.  We presume obstetricians-gynaecologists not being registered on the specialist listing with the Medical Council would be something the witnesses would reflect also because they would have colleagues on the general rather than specialist listing.  That is important.<\/p><p>  In terms of a smaller number of professional colleagues, does this create particular situations, given the larger body of colleagues those from the major Dublin-based hospitals would have to call on?  For instance, I refer to the issue of conscientious objection, to which Dr. Monaghan referred.  Are there given situations where the witnesses may not have the complement of necessary professionals to make the evaluations?  For instance, in relation to the risk of loss of life from physical illness, we are looking at two medical practitioners - one obstetrician-gynaecologist and other a medical partitioner in a specialist division.  Is there sufficient professional cover on each of the hospital sites across the jurisdiction currently designated - the 19 within the proposed legislation - to comfortably ensure there will not be unnecessary delays and that the assessment can be made in a hospital where the woman is presenting and that there will not be a requirement for an examination at two locations on the part of the woman involved?  Surely, the professionals would go to her at whatever hospital site she was located.<\/p><p>  It was exposed to us when we spoke to the masters of the various Dublin-based maternity sites that they had no intensive care facilities within the three hospital sites.  I put up my hand and said I did not realise that.  Are there infrastructural difficulties which should be shared with us and on which we might be able to reflect because I have made the point that the passage of legislation is not only about what it says but also about the capacity to implement and that means resourcing?<\/p><p>  I wish to ask about one particular issue which has not presented before, that is, the incidence of ectopic pregnancy.  Again, I put up my hand and say I always thought an ectopic pregnancy occurred outside the womb, but it is all about learning, which is why we are here.  Are the witnesses making a case to include this in the legislation?  Will they elaborate a little on it?  Do they accept that we have made no other such exceptions in terms of physical illnesses presenting?  Might it not be covered?  Would the witnesses' professional assessment be sufficient to determine whether a termination was required in the so-called 7% of cases that present a risk to the life of the mother?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013051700051#BBB00500","speaker":"969"},{"type":"speech","time":1368807300,"counter":430,"content":"<p>We are talking about smaller maternity units, but I presume a lot of the complicated pregnancies would be referred to the larger hospitals.

Clonmel is a little behind us.  The questions asked by Deputies &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in and Healy about smaller units are quite similar.  I think we need to step back and look at the three indications which are outlined under this Bill.  When we talk about the risk of loss of life from a physical illness in a medical emergency, we are looking at women who have severe infections, bleeding or severe pre-eclampsia.  As I said already, sadly we deal with this every year in all of the small maternity units throughout the country.  We deal with it appropriately and in a manner that is clinically appropriate.<\/p><p>  Obviously, we all want more resources.  In an ideal world, there would be no three-person maternity units in the country.  That stance would certainly be taken by many senior obstetricians.  We have three-person maternity units at this time.  We deliver care to women in emergency situations.  We deal with it adequately and appropriately.  We link into our sister hospitals.  Tralee General Hospital's sister hospital is Cork University Maternity Hospital.  Some of our patients from north Kerry go to Mid-Western Regional Maternity Hospital in Limerick.  We have access to the expertise from those places.<\/p><p>  When a woman who walks in the door needs to be dealt with there and then, we have the resources to deal with her.  Ironically, the maternity unit in our hospital has an intensive care neo-natal unit and access to a cardiology service in the town.  We regularly do teleconferencing for non-maternity cardiology cases.  The cardiology team sends down teams to look after patients who are not pregnant.  Our resource is better, in many ways, even though we have a smaller maternity unit.<\/p><p>  We were also asked about the risk of loss of life from physical illnesses such as cancer.  Severe cardiac disease was the other example that was used.  As a general principle, patients in those types of situations tend not to need immediate care within the next hour.  We have access to the specialist care units in Dublin, Limerick and Cork.  I think most small maternity units have appropriate links and are able to care for their patients.  There are multidisciplinary cancer teams.  There is an oncology team looking after each unit at this stage.<\/p><p>  I am not here to speak for the psychiatrists.  The committee will have access to them on Monday.  The psychiatrists in my unit appear to think that they would not have the resources to deal with this and that additional resources would be needed.  Ironically, it is not an obstetric resource in that situation.<\/p><p>  Conscientious objection would never come into play when someone's life is in danger there and then.  That has always been our practice at the time the woman is dealt with.  Nothing will change in that regard.  Obviously, we would expect every doctor to look after an acute medical situation.  In a less acute situation, we would expect doctors to meet their requirements under the Medical Council guidelines.  If they are not going to look after a patient, we would expect them to ensure someone else looks after that patient in a timely manner.  I would be disappointed to hear there is any unit where a person would suffer due to a conscientious objection of all the staff.  I do not think such a unit exists.  We will always look after the life of a mother and the life of a baby.<\/p><p>  I do not think I have missed anything that was asked about small units.  We will keep saying we need more resources.  I do not think any woman will suffer in a small maternity unit as a result of a lack of resources if this legislation is enacted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013051700052#CCC00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Mary McCaffrey"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1368807900,"counter":435,"content":"<p>Deputy Kelleher asked about referring people to England for a termination.  I have never referred anybody to England for a termination.  I have sometimes referred people there for medical or diagnostic expertise, but I have not done so for a termination.  I know that women are referred there for treatment or delivery in cases of congenital malformations, but such cases are not the subject of this legislation.<\/p><p>  The Deputy also asked about the overburdening of the maternity services.  Our unit at Portiuncula Hospital delivers approximately 2,200 mothers a year.  We might encounter one or two cases of serious maternal illness where the pregnancy has to be ended.  I think the figure given for the Dublin hospitals was 30 a year.  Such cases do not overburden the maternity service.  If a patient has a very serious fulminating pre-eclampsia, for example, she might need to be transferred to a tertiary unit in Galway or Dublin.  There may be problems with the transfer if there is overcrowding in the tertiary centre.  I do not envisage that this legislation will overburden maternity services significantly unless there is an explosion in the number of terminations of pregnancy under psychiatric or self-destruction grounds.<\/p><p>  Deputy Healy asked whether psychiatric services are located alongside maternity services.  In the rural system, there might be a maternity or general hospital in one town and a psychiatric hospital in another town.  In practice, almost all of the rural maternity units are in close proximity to a psychiatric department.  I am afraid I did not understand fully the question about the central location of personnel.<\/p><p>  The Deputy also asked about conscientious objection.  As Dr. McCaffrey said, if one is prepared to allow a mother to die, one is guilty of very serious professional negligence.  There has been no maternal death in my hospital, or death of a woman who was transferred out of the hospital, for 29 years.  I am sure that is the norm throughout the country.  It is not true that the conscientious refusal by obstetricians to offer necessary treatment which might involve termination of pregnancy is leading to maternal deaths.  I am sure it has been pointed out already that this country's maternal mortality rate has always been significantly lower than the rate in the UK, regardless of the figures one uses.  Similarly, the maternal mortality rate in Northern Ireland, where the UK Abortion Act does not apply, is lower than the rate in the rest of the UK.  I do not think conscientious objection could be considered to endanger women's lives in any way.  We do not know where conscientious objection would arise in psychiatric cases.  I do not know how an obstetrician would deal with an emergency precipitated by suicide.  I cannot imagine that scenario.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013051700052#CCC00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. John Monaghan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1368807900,"counter":436,"content":"<p>I want to make a comment about the development of networks around the country.

The numbers are so small, most of us will never see this in an entire career.<\/p><p>  The idea that you would have a patient arriving into your office with two abortion tickets from random psychiatrists is nonsense.  That is not the way that medicine works.  We would have a working relationship with the psychiatrist.  If you did not know the psychiatrist and did not trust them you certainly would not be doing anything near terminating a pregnancy.  The institute has made a suggestion in this regard, there would be a second obstetrician involved and I would support that.  I can tell you, there are very few of us in the country - 125 consultant obstetricians - and we are not beholden to psychiatrists telling us what to do.  We have to do this procedure ourselves so we are going to be absolutely certain that it is thoroughly justified, medically and ethically.  That is the way medicine operates.   <\/p><p>  In regard to Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in's question on whether Limerick is different, Limerick has 5,000 babies and eight obstetricians so it is more like Dublin and Cork.  We do not have the problem of small numbers.  We have the entire range of sub-specialty facilities available.  I would say that when there is any question of a maternal death, the entire resources of the hospitals are wheeled out to deal with that woman.  It goes to the top of the priority list, as you can imagine.  They are taken extremely seriously.  Cardiologists etc. would drop everything to deal with a thing like that. <\/p><p>  In regard to resources, we have very few obstetricians.  When the country was awash with imported money a few years ago not a red cent was voted to improve the resources by this House.  The Deputies were aware of the issues because the numbers were well known but not a red cent was put into maternity services.<\/p><p>  With regard to the question of an ectopic pregnancy, this happens in about maybe one in 2,500 cases so we will see a number of cases.  In my unit we will see two every year.  They are extremely difficult to deal with.  They are one of those issues that could come under this legislation.  We do not refer people to England for terminations but a lot of our patients, in difficult circumstances, elect to go to England for a second opinion.  Of course, we have a responsibility to make sure, if they are critically ill or unwell, that they do not go to an inappropriate place.  They would be pointed in the right direction of where they could get top class care in a university type hospital with a full foetal maternal medicine service.  We do not have data on this, in terms of numbers, but certainly it is not extremely rare.<\/p><p>  A conscientious objection would not arise in my unit.  There are eight of us and I do not think there will be any difficulty about providing opinions and care.<\/p><p>  Is there adequate clarity?  The one issue that I would bring up is that I think you, the legislators, should determine what is meant by a real and substantial risk to the life of the mother.  I think that is your job but because we cannot put numbers on it, because we do not have data, because things change over time, because the timeframe is very unclear, because the dates in the literature are very unclear, and we often only have our expertise, experience and knowledge to work with, I think it would be beholden of the Deputies here to sign that job over to the obstetricians and the other medical experts.  I think that should be specific in this piece of legislation.  You can trust us in this regard.  The people who are in at night and at the weekend dealing with haemorrhages and heads that are impacted, we are not waiting in the long grass to start doing terminations.  That is not the way we operate.  I think that the Oireachtas can trust the medical profession that it is going to do its absolute best to save every single life.

The super specialties cannot be in every hospital.  They are in Cork University Hospital or one of the specialist hospitals in Dublin.  Is it not good practice for a woman with a cardiac problem, regardless of whether she is pregnant, to be sent to the most senior cardiologist to get whatever specific care necessary?

The commonest arrangement might be to have an endocrinologist, a cardiologist, a gastroenterologist and, perhaps, a respiratory physician.  Roscommon Hospital, which is near Ballinasloe, has a respiratory physician but there is not one in Portiuncula.  There is a cardiologist in Portiuncula Hospital.  That would be the arrangement.  In the case of a serious medical problem, such as a woman with a major heart disease, a local assessment would decide the severity.  There are many patients with mild cardiac disease being managed in local hospitals, and then the move to transfer them would be made.  I do not think there has ever been a problem with referral or obtaining expertise.  I referred earlier to the cancer problem, which I thought was different from cardiology.  One finds cardiology expertise in Galway and Cork, and specific skills would not be required for the management of pregnant women.  If surgery were required, it would not be that much different.  I do not know if that is helpful on the specialist question.<\/p><p>  I was asked about maternal deaths.  There has always been a difference, as is well known, between Ireland and the United Kingdom.  The question was whether this was because of abortion.  I am not suggesting it is because of abortion, but I suggest that if abortion was a significant factor in the improvement of maternal health, the figures should be better in the United Kingdom than they are in Ireland, especially given that a very large number of terminations are done in UK.  I suggest that the results should be better in the UK than they are here if medically mandated abortion improves women's health.<\/p><p>  A related issue which I have studied slightly myself is the problem with recruitment into obstetrics and gynaecology in the United Kingdom for the last 35 years.  The matter is well written up in the reports of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists.  Another study which was published in the <i>British Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology<\/i> showed that recruitment into obstetrics and gynaecology was highest in Northern Ireland and lowest in places like Leeds and Oxford.  Certainly, Dr. Jim Clinch, who was one of the doctors who was keen to come today but could not, is of the opinion that if an abortion culture becomes widespread, it seriously affects recruitment into obstetrics and gynaecology.  That would have been my experience.  I worked in the NHS for three and half years in total.  Certainly, in my time in the north of England, I used to speak to medical students and ask them if they would consider a career in obstetrics and gynaecology.  During the two years I was in the north of England, no student said he or she was interested in a career in obstetrics and gynaecology.  When asked the reasons, fear of being sued and a hard-working rota were cited, but the single biggest factor was that students did not like the abortion culture, not for particularly ethical reasons but because it was distasteful to them.<\/p><p>  I was asked about psychiatrists as qualified doctors.  I cannot second guess psychiatric expertise, but I do not think psychiatric expertise around the country is different to the expertise in the city.  Much is made of the availability of perinatal psychiatrists and I am not sure that is as important as has been stated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013051700054#EEE00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. John Monaghan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1368809100,"counter":445,"content":"<p>Deputy Conway asked about surgical termination as referred to by Dr. Mary McCaffrey.

This is not in any way going to be a very common scenario and it does not introduce hugely difficult technical or logistical difficulties.  Surgical termination is a procedure that is employed every day in some hospitals.  It depends.  There are now many ways of dealing with miscarriage where the uterus has not started to empty itself.  We are talking here about where a woman's life is in danger, which means one is often talking with someone who is very ill.  Sepsis, which we have all been hearing about from the case in the media, is often occasioned by the rupture of the membranes and the pregnancy is, therefore, already starting to evacuate itself.  It is similar with severe pre-eclampsia or haemorrhage.  Very often, the haemorrhage is coming from the uterus which is emptying itself anyway.

It is absolutely hard to believe that they would be managed anywhere other than at a tertiary referral unit.  For example and as I mentioned in January, the Coombe Women's Hospital has a very specific clinic where it looks after medical problems in pregnancy.  They liaise with various specialties.  The question the Deputy is asking is whether we refer people on to centres with special expertise.  Certainly I do and I am sure most colleagues do.  Women are also very well informed now and women who have come from a clinic like that where they have been with a cardiologist since they were two or three years of age will be very well versed in the risks to them in terms of their pregnancy and will already know they need to be under specialist care.<\/p><p>  On access to psychiatry at weekends, a woman who is pregnant is no different from any person who walks into an emergency unit at the weekend who is seriously ill, be it with a psychiatric illness or otherwise.

He flagged an issue flagged in January, which is how to define a real and substantial risk.  He referred to it on a number of occasions.  Last January, Dr. Rhona Mahony, master of the National Maternity Hospital, raised the specific concern of whether a real and substantial risk is 10%, 50%, 80% or 1%.  Interestingly, the evidence of Dr. Gerard Burke contradicts the evidence of Dr. Rhona Mahony earlier.  She believes the legislation provides clarity.  I do not believe there is but Dr. Gerard Burke could comment on her evidence.<\/p><p>  In Dr. Tony Holohan's evidence, he said that there may have been women who had early deliveries due to suicidal ideation.  Although two of the witnesses were asked twice, they did not answer that question.  I ask the four witnesses whether they have experience of early delivery based on suicidal ideation.  Has it happened within their facilities?<\/p><p>  We are anxious to have smaller units present to indicate whether there are different implications for smaller units in respect of this legislation.  Subhead 1 defines the appropriate location.  With regard to Dr. John Monaghan and Portiuncula Hospital, the facility must provide obstetric and mental health services.  That is quite close at the moment, with Portiuncula and an acute unit in St. Brigid's Hospital in Ballinasloe.  There are two acute psychiatric units in the Roscommon-Galway services, one in Ballinasloe and one in Roscommon.  One of these will close in the not-too-distant future.  If the one in Ballinasloe closed, would that have implications on the delivery of the service?  I ask the speakers from smaller hospitals if they have specific concerns regarding the implementation of the legislation and the definition of appropriate location when they consider the traditional agenda within the HSE to remove the smaller units.  A HIQA investigation is ongoing and we do not know what recommendations are going to come of it.  Have the witnesses any fear the legislation could be a Trojan horse?<\/p><p>  There are normally three consultants in smaller units.

Sometimes my colleagues here miss one point, which is that in western countries maternal mortality is an extraordinarily rare event.  In Ireland in recent decades we have had entire years with no maternal mortality.  The occurrence of one maternal mortality is a disaster.  If we have to legislate to prevent one maternal mortality, we should do it.  This is not like cancer or heart disease mortality, where there are thousands of deaths per year.  This is different and we must treat it differently.<\/p><p>  In the previous hearings, I got to the crux of the matter by putting the Dublin folks through a detailed interrogation.  We worked out that, although figures are not kept, there are approximately 30 abortions per annum in Ireland within the legal parameters of our Constitution, that is, to preserve the life of the mother.  They reckoned there were six to eight in each of the Dublin maternity hospitals and, with a little extrapolation, that is what we reckoned to be the probable total.  I have asked some of my colleagues about this and my understanding is that the great majority of these will be for cardiovascular complications, blood pressure emergencies, renal failure emergencies, occasionally haemorrhage and sometimes cancer.<\/p><p>  Incidentally, in a long career of practising cancer medicine I have never had to send anybody for an abortion to save their life.  It is not typically the way it happens.  Many of my patients have made a decision to have an abortion and I have supported them in their decision, but I have never said to them that they need it to save their life.<\/p><p>  Of the 30 cases per annum, the great majority will fall into the categories I outlined.  My best guess, and I ask my colleagues to comment on this, is that in the majority of those cases it is not a sudden, out-of-the-blue event where a previously normal healthy pregnancy suddenly deteriorates.  There is usually a warning - the woman has had pre-eclampsia, which is a blood pressure and kidney problem occurring in pregnancy, or it is discovered that the placenta is dangerously misplaced or that there is cancer-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013051700056#GGG00800","speaker":"1147"},{"type":"speech","time":1368810300,"counter":474,"content":"<p>Thank you.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013051700056#GGG00900","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1368810300,"counter":475,"content":"<p>One second, Chairman. I have not interrupted anybody today and I have tried to stay within my time, so just hear me out.<\/p><p>  My understanding is that in the great majority of cases there will be warning, so the scenario of this type of occurrence occurring in one of the smaller hospitals is very unlikely because the hospitals will generally refer the patients to one of the larger, specialist units at an earlier stage in their pregnancy where they will be cared for by the high risk people.  In those rare cases where it will occur in the smaller hospitals, it will be category one or the emergency.  It is the one where the patient is either bleeding or dying of abnormal blood pressure, the doctor cannot consult, there are no psychiatrists and the patient is not suicidal.  The doctor sees a woman whose life will drain from her body in the next few hours if they do not end the pregnancy, something which is very rare.  That is my understanding of the only cases the witnesses will see.  Is that the case?  Should anybody have a right to conscientious objection in that setting?

That includes mental health and mental health treatment.

Do the rest of the witnesses have a view, given that the Medical Council and the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists have indicated that it would be useful to merge them on the basis that they go to the crux of the issue, which is a threat to the health of the mother in pregnancy?<\/p><p>  With regard to the requirement in head 4 for two psychiatrists, a view has been expressed that this might be unduly onerous, particularly depending on where one is located in the country.  Ironically, it might be more difficult to comply with that requirement in Dublin than it might be in other locations.  As Dr. Burke said, one might be less well served in Dublin than one might be in other parts of the country.  Is the requirement for two psychiatrists unduly onerous?  More importantly, is it unduly restrictive in requiring one of the psychiatrists to come from one of the hospitals that have been nominated for the purposes of carrying out a termination?<\/p><p>  As regards the provisions under heads 6, 7 and 8 and the timescales provided, do the witnesses believe those timescales are workable or could they be further reduced?<\/p><p>  My final question is about the penalty of 14 years imprisonment provided for under the legislation.

With physical illness, one may be forced to deliver the baby because one has to do it.  Simply, the baby could be born at 20 to 24 weeks; it has to be done.  The psychiatric component is unknown.  The question has arisen as to whether one could care for the woman until the baby had reached a certain stage of viability.  It has been suggested if a child is delivered at 23 or 24 weeks and survives, because of the age at which it is delivered, it is significantly more likely to be handicapped by cerebral palsy or blindness or suffer from another serious life-long disability.  I could not say anything more than that on that question.<\/p><p>  On the real and substantial risk and the obstetrical element of impending serious maternal illness, an experienced clinician knows a real and substantial risk.  Decisions on the medical complications involving cardiology, cancer, etc. are often multidisciplinary and an experienced clinician would know the answer intuitively.  The only question to which the answer is unknown is that of suicide.  I cannot comment on it.<\/p><p>  Deputy Denis Naughten referred to the subhead on obstetric and maternal health and the closure of a psychiatric unit.  I would not be able to tell whether the closure of a unit in Roscommon, for example, would affect the unit in Ballinasloe or <i>vice versa<\/i> in terms of the availability of services.  There is a centralising tendency within the HSE and, in the past 15 or 20 years, hospitals have gradually been run down.  Dundalk, Monaghan and Roscommon are examples.  I do not know what the effect from a psychiatric point of view would be.  As I said, I am not a psychiatrist.  If a problem proves to be an important medical one, the nearer the psychiatric help is to an obstetrical unit, the better.  The question on appropriate locations and the removal of smaller units was the same.<\/p><p>  Senator John Crown asked about maternal mortality, which he said was exceptionally rare.  It is clear that the rate of maternal mortality is rising and has been for approximately the past ten years in the United Kingdom, Denmark, Canada and the United States.  There is little evidence that it has risen in Ireland, but I do not think we can tell as yet.  There are multiple reasons for the trend.  The major one in the United Kingdom has been sepsis, or infection, in addition to increasing maternal age and higher rates of multiple pregnancy.  There are many reasons.  One component may be training and the care of pregnant women.<\/p><p>  On the question about it being sudden or not sudden, it is correct to say many situations of termination of pregnancy in a rural unit would arise on a Sunday afternoon when somebody arrives in suddenly having seizures, in which case the baby has to be delivered immediately.  Regarding whether one can extrapolate from this to take in the suicide question, I am not going to answer and I am not capable of answering.  As I stated, it is a matter of grave concern to me.<\/p><p>  Consider the question of having a right to conscience in a smaller department or rural unit.  As I said, there is no evidence that conscientious objection has led to any maternal death.  Senator Jim Walsh asked about the case in Galway.

There were several questions on suicidal ideation and the termination of pregnancy at very early, intermediate or late gestations.  We were asked directly whether we had had such a case.  Psychological and psychiatric problems are very common in obstetrics nowadays as life is tough for a lot of people.  We deal all the time with mental health issues.  A question was asked about psychiatric support and whether it was adequate.  We do not just go to the psychiatrist for psychological or psychiatric support; it is inherent in what midwives and obstetricians do.  All members of the team are involved in supporting women.<\/p><p>  With regard to delivering in the circumstances in question, it would be common to induce labour a week or two before, or usually within the ambit of, full term.  Occasionally, it is slightly earlier on the grounds of mental health.  Suicidal ideation is probably more common than we think because most people contemplating suicide do not tell anyone this during pregnancy.  As far as we know, however, it is very rare.<\/p><p>  Personally, I have had one or two cases in which a woman was in a psychiatric hospital for a condition directly related to the pregnancy.  One woman almost died on her first attempt at suicide, but it was never related to the question of terminating pregnancy.  It never came up.  She absolutely wanted to have her baby; it was the hormonal effect that was in question.  The Bill is about the threat to the life of the mother by suicide or physical illness.  It would be very rare, but, as with everything, one will see everything in one's practice if one lives long enough.<\/p><p>  With regard to the comment made by Senator John Crown on what we are going to see, I do not believe we see anything different in our practices from what is seen in Dublin.  We see fewer of the most difficult medical cases.  We may not have as many women with congenital heart disease or who are having cancer treatment in pregnancy.  We have a lower concentration, but we see the entire gambit.  Often, as Dr. Monaghan says, what one must deal with is what turns up on a Sunday afternoon.  We are not exactly in a different category; we are dealing with the same spectrum.<\/p><p>  I have never referred to the United Kingdom from the point of view of worrying about a woman's medical condition, or in terms of having concerns for her future during the pregnancy.  Personally, I have never had to do that, nor has it come into my ambit of practice.<\/p><p>  On the question of where I can find clarity in the Bill, I am not a lawyer.  I have simply read the heads of the Bill.  In several situations in my career I had a worry at the back of my mind about a woman who was very sick with sepsis, in circumstances very similar to those in the Galway case, and I had hoped nature would deal with it.  In fact, that is what happened, very happily.  Nineteen times out of 20, nature does deal with things, but, unhappily, it does not always do so.  For me, my patients and the staff on my team, the Bill gives my practice more clarity.  I note this from having talked to my colleagues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013051700057#HHH00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. M&aacute;ire Milner","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1368811500,"counter":487,"content":"<p>My colleagues have dealt with a lot of the issues.  I will again refer to the substantial risk and what its size may be.  A figure of 10% was mentioned as the smallest one.  If, over the next six months, 166 Deputies and 60 Senators were told that 10% of them, or 20 Deputies and Senators, would be dead by the end of that period, nobody would be in this House today.  If we reduced the risk to 1%, two Deputies or Senators would be gone.  I do not know which two it would be.  That is the ridiculousness of trying to put a number and percentage on risk.  <\/p><p>  We do not know the numbers.  When a complex patient comes along one cannot go to the medical literature and figure out the woman's exact percentage risk of dying if she is still pregnant next month or the month after.  We simply do not know.  The only way to deal with this is to say that the matter is for the opinion of the medical experts.  I request that Deputies write that statement into the Bill, namely, that it is a matter for medical experts and the guidelines of committees that will oversee the legislation at hospital level.<\/p><p>  In regard to the number of maternal deaths, infection is a particular factor that creeps up on one out of the blue.  One does not see it coming. A patient who has ruptured membranes could be very well one day and have very mild signs of infection but could be extremely ill 24 or 48 hours later.  My understanding is that there was a significant rise in the number of maternal deaths in Ireland last year.  We have a low base, but it is possibly only a statistical chance.  We would not be able to say there was a trend unless we had seen the figures for three years or so.<\/p><p>  I agree with Senator Walsh that we should have much better data collection nationally on every aspect of medical care, not just this.

I will start with Deputy Durkan who asked about the rarity of cases and evidence, referring I think to the X case in the Supreme Court.  I was not sure whether the Deputy was referring to other rare cases but his observation on the X case was very interesting.  The relationship between the law and the practice of medicine is a very critical interaction in this instance.  Next Monday's hearings will be critical for the committee's decision on the question of the psychiatric evidence.  My understanding is that if the medical evidence does not support it and we have a legal obligation to the Supreme Court there is a conflict which it is beyond a doctor to recognise.  A doctor is ethically obliged to act on evidence.  I regret that the expert group did not invite in expert psychiatric evidence because it seems as if this must be done by this committee in a public forum rather than by careful study of the evidence available.  It is a very difficult issue and I appreciate the position in which legislators are placed in trying to deal with these two different aspects of the problem, the medical evidence and the Supreme Court decision.<\/p><p>  Deputy Durkan also asked about surgical means.  I did not check on the lethal injection but I did consult with a colleague yesterday on the question of surgical termination as in suction termination whereby the baby is sucked out and destroyed.

I asked my colleague whether this is commonly done and she said it is, principally because it is cheaper, even though the medical means are more appropriate.

The way medicine is practised these days, people do not tend to practise in isolation but as part of teams.

I believe we will continue to practise obstetrics as we do.  I do not believe we will see a dramatic increase in requests for assessments for suicide.  I hope not anyway.  Senator Mullen needs to ask the psychiatrists about the subjectivity of it but that is the reason there would be more than one psychiatrist on an assessment team.

I feel I learned much more in this session than in the earlier one on the actual delivery of the safe care for mothers and their babies.  I got a much better sense of conversation and real meaning about the whole issue.<\/p><p>  We are here to discuss the heads of the Bill.  That derives from the difficulty that there is in applying the Constitution&rsquo;s Article of the equivalence of life when it arises in difficult and rather rare circumstances, namely, the threat to the life of a mother.  As Dr. John Monaghan pointed out, there was the particular case of the X case on which the Supreme Court made a majority decision - not a unanimous one - in terms of its understanding based on what had been presented to it which was only a limited picture.  The court got a psychologist&rsquo;s report, not one from a psychiatrist or a body of psychiatrists.  The court was painted into a corner and had to determine for one case.<\/p><p>  We have to be honest about this and decide how we want to express the intention in law as to what is the meaning of the Constitution in its application and what is guided by guidelines from professionals.  One point that has come out in this and the last session is that guidelines are delivering excellent care for mother and child.  There have been little setbacks here and there which have been accidental and unfortunate, as well as being very tragic for the families involved.  For everyone&rsquo;s wife, mother, sister or daughter who is expecting a baby, everything - the whole fire brigade of medicine - will be brought to bear in saving that mother&rsquo;s life.  Being honest about it, the expression of the Constitution in its simple English is followed by the fact that the life of the mother is of paramount importance at all times, the profession has a duty of care to that mother at all times and that it will use the best guidelines within its professional specialties at all times to deliver that.<\/p> <p>We come back to what even Dr. Boylan spoke about, that is, trust.  Dr. Monaghan spoke about that.  We have got to trust people.   We trusted our mothers not to drop us when they put us in our prams.  We trust those around us.  Today there has been the hijacking of a few set backs to lead us down various long paths of complication and multi-word argument and discussion and we are getting away from the truth.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013051700061#MMM01400","speaker":"1027","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1368813900,"counter":555,"content":"<p>Go raibh maith agat.

One has quite a small psychiatric unit and quite a small maternity unit in a regional hospital.

Any person - male or female, pregnant or not - who arrives at an accident and emergency unit in any hospital or at a psychiatric unit tonight or tomorrow night will be dealt with acutely, assessed and admitted.  All the services will be rolled out for them.  Some psychiatric services in smaller hospitals are concerned that if there is a larger number of review committees and review processes, or if assessments for two psychiatrists have to be done together, that rather than the acute situation might put a strain on the resources of the department in question.  As the legislation is enacted and brought into practice, it will be important for the health services to watch what level of resources is needed to allow obstetrics and psychiatry to continue to provide safe practice.  My earlier comments did not relate to the safety of the acute situation.  They were about the ongoing assessments that might arise.  We have all seen how the mental health tribunals are costing a fortune and have taken on a life of their own.  That is really what my remarks were about.  I apologise if I came at it in a circuitous manner.<\/p><p>  Deputy Flanagan raised the issue of viability, which is obviously very important in a smaller unit.  We have to acknowledge that the dates of many pregnant patients are actually wrong, despite good ultrasound scanning.  If they present very late on in a pregnancy, there is always the possibility that their due date might fall a week or two either way.  My personal practice in such situations is to transfer the patients in question to a place where all the neo-natal services are available.  I suspect anyone in a smaller unit would do the same.  It strikes me now that I did not answer Deputy Naughten's question about neo-natal services and I apologise for that.  If the woman is too ill to be transferred, we can deliver the baby locally before getting a neo-natal transfer team to come down, provide the services in the smaller hospital and, if the baby survives, take it to a larger unit.  That happens in smaller units on a regular basis.<\/p><p>  Senator Bradford asked whether there will be a change in law or in practice.  Obviously, if a new law is on the books, then it is a change in law.  On the question of whether there will be a change in our practice, my personal feeling is that there will be much more reassurance and clarity in terms of dealing with difficult situations.  I know there is great concern about the possibility of opening the floodgates.  I think the law is so tight, for example in requiring two psychiatrists and all the support services for the diagnosis, that I do not think the things we do will change hugely.  It will provide huge security.  It is very hard to be on one's own on a Sunday afternoon in a small hospital, trying to decide whether one will be reported to the Medical Council if one does something and worrying whether there will be garda&iacute; in the hospital the following morning.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013051700063#OOO01700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Mary McCaffrey","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1368815100,"counter":585,"content":"<p>I had four questions.
