This role also includes the organisation of work placements in my Department for people with disabilities, specifically for the Willing and Mentoring (WAM) project. This project provides the opportunity for people with disabilities to gain experience in different workplaces through coaching and mentoring, as well as building the capacity of employers to integrate disability into the workplace. There are currently 4 graduates participating in work placements in my Department as part of the WAM Programme.<\/p><p>Also in place is a Disability Monitoring Committee, which serves to monitor the number of employees within my Department and Agencies who have declared a disability, ensure compliance with Part 5 of the Disability Act 2005, and share best practice to support those with disabilities in our workplaces. Through this Committee we have recently established an annual online and confidential census to more accurately measure our progress against national targets. <\/p><p>Further to this, we established a Disability Consultative Committee in 2018. The purpose of the DCC is to provide a focus for disability inclusion in respect of the policy work, schemes and initiatives of the Department. \u00a0Membership of the Group includes nominated representatives of disability groups along with Departmental officials and representatives from the Department&rsquo;s Offices and Agencies. The DCC also reviews my Department&rsquo;s actions under the 'Comprehensive Employment Strategy for People with a Disability 2015-24'.<\/p><p>My Department also places a focus on learning and development opportunities that support people with disabilities in the workplace. This includes a recently launched Disability Awareness Training Programme, which\u00a0seeks to increase the understanding of inclusion and diversity in the workplace. This training focuses on accommodating people with disabilities into the workforce and providing an understanding of inclusion in the workforce. Participants who successfully complete the course and obtain a pass mark obtain a 2-year certificate in Disability Awareness.<\/p><p>The Department has not advertised a competition in relation to the quota.

The system is intended to act as a conduit for key skills which are required to develop enterprise in the State for the benefit of our economy, while simultaneously protecting the balance of the labour market.  <\/p>  <p>  The system is managed through the operation of the Critical Skills and Ineligible Occupations Lists which determine employments that are either in high demand or are ineligible for an employment permit where there is a surplus of those skills in the domestic and EEA labour market.  <\/p>  <p>  In order to maintain the relevance of these lists of occupations to the needs of the economy and to ensure the employment permits system is aligned with current labour market intelligence, these lists undergo twice-yearly evidence-based reviews which are guided by research undertaken by the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGFSN), the Skills and the Labour Market Research Unit (SLMRU), SOLAS and involves public\/stakeholder consultation.  Account is taken of education outputs, sectoral upskilling and training initiatives and known contextual factors such as Brexit and, in the current context, COVID-19 and their impact on the labour market. Consideration is also taken of the views of the Economic Migration Interdepartmental Group, chaired by the Department and of the relevant policy Departments, in this case the Department of Health.<\/p>  <p>  Following completion of the most recent review, it was decided to remove the occupation of healthcare assistant (in hospital and residential care establishments) from the Ineligible Occupations List. The review did not recommend extending eligibility to care worker\/home carers as the evidence suggests that other factors, such as the contracts of employment on offer and employment terms and conditions being offered are a factor in the recruitment challenges faced by the sector, rather than a demonstrable labour market shortage.  The sector has also previously been advised that a more systematic and structured engagement with the Department of Social Protection needs to be demonstrated.<\/p>  <p>  If a sector wishes to propose a change to the occupations lists, they need to submit a detailed evidence based business case to substantiate their request. A review is currently underway, with submissions received, including submissions from the Home Care sector, under consideration. It is expected that the review will be finalised by the end of September\/early October. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021090900003#WRA03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1505"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Flexible Work Practices","counter":54,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021090900003#WRA03650"},{"type":"question","counter":55,"qnumday":17,"qnumall":"[41950\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021090900003#WRA03700","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"the measures he is taking to promote or facilitate remote working for staff in his Department or bodies under the aegis of his Department; the costs this has generated in terms of the provision of laptops, desktop computers or contributions to wi-fi costs or phone-related expenses; the number of staff who have applied for permission to work from home on a permanent or hybrid-model basis (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1592","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":56,"content":"<p>My Department and Offices are currently working in line with Government COVID-19 guidance, which provides for home working to continue where possible.

The decision impacts four routes - the X1 Dublin\/Belfast service (which ceased operations in November 2020), the X12 Dublin\/Limerick service (which ceased operations on 30\/01\/2021), the 20\/X20 Dublin\/Galway service (which ceased operations on the 28\/07\/2021) and the X8 Dublin\/Cork service which is also due to cease operating.  \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In circumstances where a commercial operator ceases operating a specific route, the NTA undertakes an examination to determine whether, with the discontinuation of the commercial service, it is necessary for a replacement PSO service to be introduced to ensure no loss of connectivity to the travelling public. This process includes an assessment of the level of demand for public transport services in the affected area, an evaluation of whether existing PSO services can be reconfigured to meet any shortfall, or whether it is necessary to competitively tender for the provision of services. In light of the decision by Bus &Eacute;ireann to cease operating the X20 route, the NTA completed a detailed assessment of the X20 corridor and have determined that despite Expressway&rsquo;s withdrawal, sufficient connectivity is provided by the remaining operators and the public service obligation is adequately met by other rail and bus services, thereby negating the need for any further intervention on the route.<\/p>  <p>  Given the\u00a0NTA's statutory responsibility for securing the provision of public passenger transport services nationally, I have also forwarded the Deputy's question to the Authority for reply.

Since May 2021, the RSA has been returning to delivering tests for all customers, while continuing to prioritise critical frontline workers. This means, in the interest of fairness, the RSA targeted test appointments to those waiting longest who are ready and eligible to take the test. The number of tests being offered weekly<\/p>  <p>  continues to grow <\/p>  <p>  \u00a0The service continues to operate under restrictions in the interest of making it safe while there is an ongoing presence of Covid. Given the necessity for a tester to be in close proximity to a test candidate, and to get into vehicles brought by the candidates which are therefore not a controlled environment, this places limits on the capacity of the test service. <\/p>  <p>  When the service resumed in June 2020, testers were conducting 5 tests each per day, as against 8 before the pandemic. This increased to 6 tests from 14 September 2020. The RSA is looking to increase the number of tests to 7 per tester per day from late September 2021, subject to compliance with health protocols. <\/p>  <p>  In order to deal with the backlog, the RSA received sanction to hire 40 new temporary testers, in addition to 36 they were sanctioned to retain or rehire in 2020. These new testers have completed their training and are now conducting live tests since July 2021. Sanction has also been granted to recruit a further 40 testers and the process has commenced. <\/p>  <p>  \u00a0An extra 10 temporary test centres have been opened (and are effectively an expansion of existing locations or replacing unsuitable locations), and a further 9 locations have been expanded within the existing premises, to accommodate more testers. <\/p>  <p>  The Government will continue to be guided by public health advice on the safe provision of services and, in conjunction with the RSA, continues to keep the situation under review to ensure that every possible measure is being put in place so that the maximum number of customers can be served, while adhering to public health requirements. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021090900010#WRH05500","answer":true,"speaker":"1578"},{"type":"question","counter":472,"qnumday":160,"qnumall":"[42860\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021090900010#WRH05700","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"when a driver test is expected for a person (details supplied).

Bi-monthly DLO Network meetings are held to share knowledge and assist other DLOs across the Civil Service, as well as engaging with staff in accessing training and learning events. My Department has also held awareness presentations in the areas of Autism and Dyslexia in the Workplace and has marked International Day of People with Disabilities and it is proposed to continue to do so.<\/p><p>My Department&rsquo;s website, intranet and Build to Share programmes all have software to aid the visually impaired.

It gathers data on disability in the workplace via an annual employee survey; 2.7% of respondents to end-2020 disclosed that they had a disability. This equates to 1.45% of the total workforce at that time. The Central Bank is considering ways in which it can increase disclosure rates to build a more accurate profile. In addition, the Bank is currently considering, via a cross-functional Disability Taskforce, what further actions are needed to increase the number of employees with disabilities taking into account the legislative target of 3% and the 6% target outlined in the Comprehensive Employment Strategy for People with Disabilities. The Bank has participated in recent years in work experience programmes designed specifically for people with disabilities including the Willing Able Mentoring (WAM) work placement programme run by the Association for Higher Education Access and Disability (AHEAD) and placements via the National Council for the Blind of Ireland. Working with WAM, the Central Bank ring-fences roles, typically two, in its annual Graduate Programme for graduates with disabilities. The Bank also attends AHEAD&rsquo;s Annual Careers Fair. Across all of its recruitment campaigns, the Central Bank highlights that it welcomes diverse candidates and is an equal opportunities employer. It provides reasonable accommodations throughout every stage of the recruitment process. The Bank aims to provide an accessible physical environment which supports the attraction and retention of people with disabilities. Its headquarters in North Wall Quay has won national and international awards for its universal design and accessibility. Over one hundred specific recommendations were integrated into the design, from large &ldquo;smart&rdquo; lifts with good signage, clear controls, light floor finishes, and contrasting handrails to half-height mirrors. A variety of supports are provided to colleagues with disabilities as required, including ergonomic\u00a0and accessibility assessments, personal emergency evacuation planning, &lsquo;buddy&rsquo; training, assistive technologies such as voice activated software and other equipment or awareness training. The Central Bank has an Access Officer to provide a central point of contact for staff and the public, as well as to promote awareness across all activities and services. It has an active employee led network (Bankability Network), the aim of which is\u00a0to ensure a strong and supportive network for colleagues impacted by disability and to raise awareness among all staff. Amongst other activities, the network hosts regular events which are open to all staff to attend with inspiring speakers on various topics relating to disability in the workplace. Disability awareness training is also provided to frontline staff and to those providing services to the public. The Central Bank provides staffing to the Investor Compensation Company DAC which is also a body under my Department&rsquo;s remit.<\/p><p>The Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman (FSPO) fully recognises its obligations and responsibilities with regard to the Employment Equality Acts 1998-2015 and Disability Act 2005, and is committed to enabling access to employment for persons with disabilities. The FSPO operates its recruitment campaigns in compliance with the Codes of Practice for Appointment to Positions in the Civil Service and Public Service and is committed to a policy of equal opportunity for prospective candidates. It encourages applications under all nine grounds of the Employment Equality Acts and offers reasonable accommodation to current and prospective employees with disabilities, in accordance with the Acts. A staff census undertaken in 2020 indicated that, at 8.23%, the FSPO exceeded the minimum requirement set out in the Disability Act 2005 in relation to the level of employment of people with disabilities, which demonstrates that its recruitment policies have been effective in reaching the targets set out in the Comprehensive Employment Strategy for Persons with Disabilities. The FSPO continues to enhance practices in this area and has emphasised the requirement to achieve an inclusive and diverse workplace over the course of the next strategic period.<\/p><p>The National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA), is aware of and engaged in achieving the targets to increase employment of persons with a disability. The NTMA is exceeding the target of 3% with a current disability workforce of 4.28%. The NTMA is working towards the target of 6% by 2024 by engaging with specialist recruiters and attending specialist recruitment fairs. The Disability Awareness Team works with business units to recruit roles for persons with a disability. The NTMA partners with organisations in order to expand and advance its objectives and continues engagement with Down Syndrome Ireland, the National Council for the Blind of Ireland, AHEAD, Trinity College, and Specialisterne Ireland. Under the terms of a Service Level Agreement, the NTMA provides staffing services to Home Building Finance Ireland, the National Asset Management Agency and the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland,\u00a0all of\u00a0which are also bodies under the aegis of my Department.<\/p><p>The Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General\u00a0takes all reasonable measures to promote and support the employment of persons with disabilities. The Disability Act 2005 requires public service employers to report\u00a0each year\u00a0on the number and percentage of employees with disabilities according to the legal definition of a disability. Each employee fills out\u00a0this form as part of their induction process\u00a0in the Office. All employees are given access to this form on the Office\u00a0intranet and may also submit this at any time during employment should a disability develop or come to light. There is a DLO in place to support staff with disabilities employed by the Office.\u00a0Currently just under 8% of staff of the Office\u00a0have self-declared a disability. The Office\u00a0has a range of items available to assist staff with a disability, including sit-stand desks and scanner pens which read text aloud once scanned over an electronic document. Hearing aids are also available and can be linked to staff telephone extension numbers. Other items such as larger monitors for the visually impaired or specialised chairs for back conditions are purchased by the Office on a case by case basis. The Office is also\u00a0fully wheelchair accessible.\u00a0The Office\u00a0also ensures that all vacancies are advertised on its website; the website is enabled with software, Recite me, which reads the site, translates and\/or increases the size of text to provide information to visually or audibly impaired persons who may wish to apply for vacancies.<\/p><p>I am advised by the Office of the Revenue Commissioners that there is a strong culture of acceptance and equality among Revenue staff and towards taxpayers, ensuring that human rights and diversity are embraced and accepted. As an Equal Opportunities employer,\u00a0Revenue operates\u00a0in compliance with the relevant legislative framework to promote the inclusion of people with disabilities at work, including the\u00a0Employment Equality Act 1998, the Equal Status Acts 2000, the Employment Equality Act 2004 and the Disability Act 2005. Revenue has two DLOs, who provide information to support new entrants and serving\u00a0employees with disabilities, as well as those requiring workplace accommodations which may include the provision of assistive technology and certain office equipment. Most Revenue offices countrywide are adapted for use by staff with physical disabilities. In compliance with its reporting obligations under Part 5 of the Disability Act 2005, Revenue provides information on its employment of people with disabilities to the NDA annually. In 2020, the proportion of Revenue employees with a declared disability was 4.1%. Revenue staff are trained in Equality and Diversity as part of their induction training. In 2019, Revenue established a Partnership Intensive Group to review and update its Equality and Diversity Strategy and Public Sector Duty Action Plan. In 2020, the group drafted an Equality, Diversity and Inclusion (EDI) policy document and associated Action Plan. This work is being further developed in 2021, in the context of Revenue&rsquo;s Statement of Strategy and Workforce Plan for the period 2021-2026. The policy provides a future EDI framework, ensuring that Revenue is following best practice, promoting a culture of dignity and respect for all employees, and eliminating all forms of discrimination. Revenue&rsquo;s recruitment competitions are subject to the Code of Practice of the Commission for Public Service Appointments, which has a statutory role to ensure that appointments in the organisations subject to its remit are made on merit and as the result of fair and transparent appointment processes. Revenue actively participates in Disability Programmes such as the WAM Initiative, which serves to widen access to employment for those with disabilities and create attitudinal change and opportunities for further employment and is committed to continue taking\u00a0all reasonable measures to promote and support the recruitment and employment of people with disabilities and enrich the culture of inclusivity and diversity in its workforce.<\/p><p>The Tax Appeals Commission\u00a0conducts all its recruitment campaigns through the PAS and any request for staff does not differentiate between persons from minority or disadvantaged communities or anyone who may have a disability.

Revenue allows an employer to make compensatory payments of up to &euro;3.20 per day to remote workers, subject to certain conditions, without deducting PAYE, PRSI, or USC.<\/p><p>Where an employer does not pay &euro;3.20 per day to an e-Worker, or indeed where an employee incurs costs in excess of the &euro;3.20 per day paid by the employer, the employees concerned retain their statutory right to claim a deduction under section 114 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 in respect of actual vouched expenses they have incurred wholly, exclusively and necessarily in the performance of the duties of their employment. PAYE employees are entitled to claim any such additional costs in respect of the number of days spent working from home, apportioned on the basis of business and private use.<\/p><p>As regards the Deputy&rsquo;s question, the position is that the HTB scheme is mutually exclusive from other claims for refunds of tax paid by an individual.\u00a0 By way of example, where an individual paid tax of &euro;25,000 in 2019 and claimed &euro;20,000 in that year for HTB, some or all of the balance of tax of &euro;5,000 remaining could be refunded to the person, if he\/she had additional tax credits or reliefs to claim that year in respect of expenditure on items such as working from home expenses or health expenses.\u00a0 Of course, if a person has had all their tax deducted for a year refunded to them under the HTB scheme, he\/she would not be entitled to any further tax refunds for that year.<\/p><p>In the scenario mentioned by the Deputy, for an individual who availed of the HTB scheme to purchase his or her home in 2020, he or she is not precluded from claiming a deduction in respect of actual vouched expenses incurred in working from home in 2020 or 2021 (or for that matter, from an employer paying that individual &euro;3.20 per day).\u00a0 The HTB legislation prescribes that an individual must select a relevant tax year, which means a year of assessment within the four tax years immediately preceding the year in which the application was made.\u00a0 Thus, for a house purchased in 2020, the relevant tax years are 2016, 2017, 2018 or 2019. <\/p><p>A PAYE worker who incurs relevant expenditure can claim e-Working expenses by completing an Income Tax return at year end. Revenue advises that the simplest way for taxpayers to claim their e-Working expenses and any other tax credit entitlements is by logging into the myAccount facility on the Revenue website.\u00a0 <\/p><p>Revenue has published detailed guidance on this subject and on the question of how claims for e-Working expenses should be calculated and submitted in the Tax and Duty manual &lsquo;e-Working and Tax&rsquo;, which is available on the Revenue website at www.revenue.ie\/en\/tax-professionals\/tdm\/income-tax-capital-gains-tax-corporation-tax\/part-05\/05-02-13.pdf.<\/p><p>Finally, the national remote working strategy &lsquo;Making Remote Work&rsquo;, commits the Tax Strategy Group to reviewing the current tax arrangements for remote working in respect of both employees and employers.\u00a0 The Tax Strategy Group will take account of the economic, financial and organisational implications arising from the experience of remote working during the pandemic and assess the merits of further enhancement for consideration in the context of Budget 2022.\u00a0 <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021090900012#WRK01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Financial Services","counter":532,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021090900012#WRK01700"},{"type":"question","counter":533,"qnumday":181,"qnumall":"[41649\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021090900012#WRK01800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if the commercial terms under which public investment was made by ISIF in a company (details supplied) assure the State preferential access to genome data collected by the company; if so, the details of preferential access; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1501","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":534,"content":"<p>The NTMA have informed me that in line with its double bottom line mandate, ISIF made an investment in Genuity Science.

As a consequence of this decision all staff were already equipped to work remotely from 16 March 2020 when Public Health restrictions were introduced. Approximately eight weeks after the introduction of these restrictions the Central Bank began a process of providing additional equipment such as a monitor, office chair, laptop stand, keyboard and mouse, to improve the ergonomic experience of remote working staff at a cost of &euro;353,259. The Bank does not pay any contribution towards home telephony or Wi-Fi costs. The Bank is currently undertaking an impact assessment of potential future ways of working which will result in the introduction of an optional hybrid working model for the majority of staff. Temporary transitional working arrangements in line with current public health guidelines are in operation pending completion of this assessment.<\/p><p>The Credit Review Office (CRO) currently has 3 staff: 1 Credit Reviewer employed by my Department and 2 seconded from Enterprise Ireland. The CRO has incurred no additional costs in relation to remote working, and has received no applications for remote working to date.<\/p><p>The Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman (FSPO) has taken measures to facilitate remote working since March 2020, in order to comply with public health measures in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic while ensuring it continues to fulfil its statutory role and meets the needs of its customers. The costs associated with the facilitation of remote working are as follows: &euro;105,892 on IT equipment and &euro;1,887 on telephony. The FSPO has not contributed to individual staff Wi-Fi or phone-related expenses. The costs detailed above relate to the provision of FSPO equipment to facilitate staff to work remotely. The FSPO has undertaken staff engagement surveys on remote working to assist in determining the future working arrangements of the FSPO in accordance with public health guidelines. The FSPO is examining the potential to pilot a blended working arrangement for team members, where appropriate, recognising that the primary focus of any future working arrangements will be delivery against the FSPO&rsquo;s statutory role and ensuring the delivery of an efficient, accessible service for all its customers, while taking account the needs of staff and ensuring that Government policy in this area is implemented. <\/p><p>All staff of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council have been working remotely since March 2020 and continue to do so.\u00a0The Council has invested approximately &euro;7,500 in respect of the provision of laptops and equipment to facilitate remote working. The Council has a remote working policy in place with a hybrid-model applying on a physical return to the office.<\/p><p>The National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) introduced remote working for employees in July 2019 by way of the NTMA Remote Working Guide. Since the onset of the pandemic in 2020, and in accordance with Government advice, NTMA employees have predominantly worked from home. It is the NTMA&rsquo;s expectation that employees will not have to seek permission for hybrid working rather that a hybrid working model will be available to all employees. The costs incurred to date in terms of the provision of Laptops and ICT related peripherals to promote or facilitate remote work for staff are as follows: &euro;207,260 on ICT equipment and &euro;3,191 on reimbursement of employee costs incurred on personal mobile accounts for the purposes of carrying out work. While the NTMA Remote Working Guide is dated July 2019, costs were primarily incurred further to the impact of Covid-19 from March 2020 onwards. Under the terms of a Service Level Agreement, the NTMA provides staffing services to Home Building Finance Ireland, the National Asset Management Agency and the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland which are also bodies under the aegis of my Department.<\/p><p>Staff of the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General are working remotely in line with current Government and HSE guidelines and will continue to do so until updated advice has been received. Due to the nature of the work of the Office, a degree of remote working was already facilitated prior to the current pandemic, a teleworking policy was in place and staff had the necessary equipment to work outside of the Office, at home or in client premises. The Office has been able to fund any additional costs associated with remote working during the pandemic from savings in other areas within the Office&rsquo;s voted allocation. A model for the future of work in the Office developed with extensive staff consultation, has recently been approved by the Audit Board. The model will facilitate a hybrid working arrangement enabling staff to divide their time between remote and in-office work while ensuring that the business objectives are achieved. The model will form the basis of a blended working policy for the Office to be developed once the central policy framework has been agreed.<\/p><p>Most staff at the Office of the Revenue Commissioners have been working remotely since March 2020. Generally in excess of 75% of Revenue&rsquo;s staff are remote working each week. Revenue staff are currently continuing to work in line with Government Covid-19 guidance, which provides for home working to continue where possible. Revenue is an active participant on the interdepartmental working group that is developing General Principles to inform a longer term remote working framework for the Civil Service. It is expected that the central policy framework for Blended Working in the Civil Service will be finalised in conjunction with employee representatives over the coming months. This framework will inform the development of Revenue&rsquo;s future blended working policy. The primary objective of the longer-term framework will be towards ensuring that Revenue&rsquo;s business requirements are fully supported and will also be in accordance with the objectives of the &ldquo;Programme for Government &ndash; Our Shared Future&rdquo; in relation to the availability of remote working for staff in the Public Sector. Revenue is also actively participating with other Government Departments in the design of the application process that will be used to administer staff requests to work from home once the current Covid-19 restrictions are lifted. In a survey of Revenue staff carried out in May 2021, 67% of respondents indicated that they favoured blended working for the future. Revenue&rsquo;s key expenditure figures for equipment to enable homeworking since March 2020 are &euro;565,000 on laptops, &euro;92,000 on headsets, &euro;39,000 on network equipment, and &euro;447,200 on mobile phones.<\/p><p>The Tax Appeals Commission has drafted a remote working policy for its staff members but is awaiting final guidelines and direction from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform before implementation can take place. The new remote working policy is expected to be offered to all staff members. The Commission spent &euro;27,847 procuring laptops for the majority of staff to enable employees to work from home. This expenditure was also necessary for the Commission to move to a &ldquo;Build To Share Desktop Service&rdquo; in August 2020 provided by the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer. This support now underpins the ICT infrastructure that maintains the Commission&rsquo;s business services including servers, storage, government networks, perimeter defenses, conferencing services, web content filters and anti-virus faculties. To date, no staff member has requested remote working on a permanent or hybrid-basis, however, the Commission conducted an internal anonymous survey in May 2021 which indicated a level of interest in some form of hybrid working.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021090900012#WRK04200","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Insurance Industry","counter":558,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021090900012#WRK04300"},{"type":"question","counter":559,"qnumday":189,"qnumall":"[41968\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021090900012#WRK04400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if his attention has been drawn to insurance companies declining employer&rsquo;s insurance to disabled employers who manage their own support services in order to live independently in the community; if he has engaged with insurance companies on this issue; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1473","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":560,"content":"<p>I understand that the issue referred to relates to insurance for companies which are set up with the support of &Aacute;iseanna Taca&iacute;ochta.

However, as the Deputy will appreciate, neither I nor the Central Bank of Ireland can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products, nor do we have the power to direct insurance companies to provide cover to specific individuals.\u00a0This position is reinforced by the EU Solvency II Directive insurance framework. <\/p>  <p>  Having said that, since becoming aware of this issue, my officials have engaged with the industry representative body Insurance Ireland.\u00a0\u00a0It has acknowledged that some insurers have withdrawn from parts of the liability insurance sector in recent years, and also noted the increase in average claims costs during this time, pointing to data from the recent report of the National Claims Information Database. \u00a0According to Insurance Ireland, increases in claims costs were due to volatility in the personal injuries claims environment. <\/p>  <p>  In this regard, I believe that the new Personal Injuries Guidelines should provide much greater certainty regarding award levels, in addition to reducing awards for many common injuries, and also leading to lower legal fees by encouraging greater use of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board to settle claims. This should have a stabilising impact in relation to the issues currently being experienced by these organisations.\u00a0 Indeed, in meetings with the main insurance companies in the Irish market, Minister of State Fleming has stated the Government&rsquo;s expectation that insurers should now increase their risk appetite to extend cover to new market segments or areas they may have withdrawn from in recent years, in light of these savings. \u00a0I understand that he will be meeting with insurers again in the coming months to review their response to the Guidelines and other insurance reforms.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, I also hope that the improved claims environment resulting from the implementation of the Guidelines will help to attract new entrants into the Irish market, or encourage providers who previously exited this market to return. Separately, I understand that the new Office to Promote Competition in the Insurance Market is working with IDA Ireland to develop a customised proposition for potential new market entrants, and to identify a shortlist of specific target companies. <\/p>  <p>  These and further important actions, such as reviewing the duty of care, are being prioritised under the Action Plan for Insurance Reform. The implementation of the Government's broad package of\u00a0reforms should\u00a0assist in the development of a more sustainable and competitive market by deepening and widening the supply of insurance here, thereby improving both the cost and availability of cover for all groups, particularly those that deliver such valuable services as the organisation in question.\u00a0 <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021090900012#WRK04500","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Credits","counter":561,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021090900012#WRK04600"},{"type":"question","counter":562,"qnumday":190,"qnumall":"[42001\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021090900012#WRK04700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if the 5% tax credit (details supplied) will be retained; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1487","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":563,"content":"<p>Section 481 TCA 1997 provides a 32% payable credit for eligible expenditure on film production in Ireland.

The scheme is intended to act as a stimulus to the creation of an indigenous film industry in the State, creating quality employment opportunities and supporting the expression of the Irish culture.<\/p>  <p>  Finance Act 2018 introduced a short-term, tapered regional uplift. The purpose of the regional uplift is to support the development of new, local pools of talent in areas outside the current main production hubs, to support the geographic spread of the audio-visual sector. The regional availability of the uplift is limited to areas in Ireland sanctioned to receive regional aid under the EU regional aid guidelines.<\/p>  <p>  When introduced in Finance Act 2018 the regional uplift was to be phased out on a tiered basis with 5% available in years 1 and 2 (2019 &amp;amp; 2020), 3% available in year 3 (2021), 2% available in year 4 (2022), and 0% available from year 5 on. However, the COVID-19 crisis had a detrimental impact on the audiovisual sector, with the majority of production companies having to suspend activity for a significant portion of 2020 and, as a result, much of the intended incentive effect of the regional uplift in 2020 was lost. Therefore Finance Bill 2020 amended the regional uplift to provide for an additional 5% year in 2021, in effect to replace the incentive year lost as a result of the Covid-related public health measures.\u00a0 The tapered withdrawal of the uplift then restarts, reducing to 3% in 2022, 2% in 2023, and Nil thereafter.<\/p>  <p>  My officials examine a range of possible measures in advance of the Finance Act each year, including potential amendments to Section 481 Film Relief, and the Deputy's proposal will be considered as part of this process.

ISIF has invested &euro;66m in Genuity Science to date, alongside a range of sophisticated private investors on commercial terms which were acceptable to such investors and ISIF. Consistent with the approach it takes on all investments, ISIF conducted an appropriate due diligence exercise prior to making its investment. I understand that for reasons of commercial sensitivity ISIF does not comment on the carrying value of its investments from time to time but I note that ISIF has publicly stated that Genuity&rsquo;s valuation has been negatively impacted by the global pandemic and its exposure to geopolitical events. <\/p>  <p>  ISIF&rsquo;s portfolio is diversified, comprising investments in a range of asset classes across the spectrum of risk that are consistent with its mandate of achieving economic impact while earning a commercial return. High-risk investments in the life sciences and tech sectors comprise a very small percentage of the overall portfolio (less than 3%). Investments of this nature can be volatile and are often early-stage but have the ability to deliver significant return potential. ISIF has a number of direct investments that have and continue to deliver significant gains, however ISIF also expects that there will inevitably be some individual investments where it will recover less than the total invested. Notwithstanding the risks inherent in these investments, since ISIF&rsquo;s inception, overall high-risk investments have delivered positive returns of circa 18% at H1 2021. Overall, the returns on the total portfolio of &euro;9.2bn since inception exceed &euro;2.2bn, with as of H1 2021 generating returns of 5.2% year to date. The fund has generated annual returns of 4.1% pa since inception.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021090900013#WRL01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Insurance Industry","counter":596,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021090900013#WRL01600"},{"type":"question","counter":597,"qnumday":201,"qnumall":"[42559\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021090900013#WRL01700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his advice on an insurance matter (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1581","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":598,"content":"<p>At the outset, it is important to note that neither the Minister for Finance, nor the Central Bank of Ireland, has any influence over the pricing or provision of insurance products, as this is a commercial matter assessed on a case-by-case basis.\u00a0 This position is reinforced by the EU legislative framework for insurance (the\u00a0Solvency II\u00a0Directive).<\/p>  <p>  Motor insurers use a combination of rating factors in making their individual decisions on whether to offer cover and what terms to apply.\u00a0 Factors include those such as: the relevant driving experience; as vehicle age and type; the drivers age; the relevant claims record; the number of drivers; how the vehicle is used, etc.\u00a0 Insurers do not all use the same combination of rating factors, and as a result prices vary across the market. Consumers are accordingly free to choose whatever product best meets their needs, with price obviously being a relevant factor.\u00a0 Insurance companies also price in accordance with their own past claims experience. This illustrates the importance of shopping around for insurance.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the experience referred to with a specific insurance provider, it is important to note that as Minister for Finance, I am not in a position to comment on or intervene in respect of individual cases.<\/p>  <p>  I understand that there is no statutory basis behind the individual policies of insurance companies pertaining to the time period of non-continuous driving experience for the purposes of retaining insurance cover. \u00a0Officials in my Department have previously engaged with Insurance Ireland on this issue.\u00a0 They confirmed that the general current timeframe of two years companies use in this regard is one which appears to have evolved within the insurance market itself, rather than representing a rule imposed by the industry and\/or the State, and that there may be flexibility from certain individual providers if the time period concerned is marginally over two years.\u00a0 Ultimately, this is a commercial matter for companies and will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis.  \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Throughout the pandemic, Government has consistently called on insurers to treat customers honestly, fairly and professionally, and in line with the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code. With regard to insurance for Small Public Service Vehicle (SPSV) drivers, I understand from my officials that several insurers in the market introduced measures last year to ease the burden on drivers, including the ability to reduce vehicle cover to social, pleasure and domestic use only with pro-rata refunds provided. However, as the Deputy will be aware, I cannot direct insurers to offer such measures. It should be noted that the National Transport Authority (NTA) advises that where SPSV insurance is not in place, the driver does not hold a valid SPSV licence. I believe that it is important that anyone concerned should engage directly with their insurer or broker and the NTA regarding their circumstances and options. <\/p>  <p>  In situations where a person is not satisfied with the service of an insurance provider, it is advisable that that person make a complaint to the firm's internal complaint resolution process. The Consumer Protection Code requires that if after 40 days the complaint has not been resolved to the customer&rsquo;s satisfaction, the regulated entity must inform the consumer that they may refer their complaint to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman (FSPO). The FSPO is a statutory official who acts as an independent arbiter of disputes, which consumers may have with their insurance company or other financial service provider. The FSPO can be contacted either by email at info@fspo.ie or by telephone at 01-567-7000.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, where an individual is having difficulty in receiving an insurance quotation, or a private company has issues in relation to named drivers on their fleet policy, which may be relevant in this case, they may wish to use the Declined Cases Agreement (DCA). Under the terms of the DCA, which is adhered to by all motor insurers in Ireland, the insurance market will not refuse cover if the person has approached at least three insurers and has been unable to obtain cover from them. In this regard, there are further details available on the Insurance Ireland website, while more generally, Insurance Ireland also operates a free Insurance Information Service for those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in relation to obtaining insurance. The relevant contact details are: feedback@insuranceireland.eu or declined@insuranceireland.eu.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021090900013#WRL01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Reliefs","counter":599,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021090900013#WRL01900"},{"type":"question","counter":600,"qnumday":202,"qnumall":"[42560\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021090900013#WRL02000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if a Revenue Commissioners relevant contracts tax refund will be paid to a self-employed person (details supplied) in County Kerry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1581","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":601,"content":"<p>Section 530P of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 precludes Revenue from issuing a refund of Relevant Contracts Tax (RCT) until the income tax return for the relevant year (or the Corporation Tax return for the relevant accounting period of a company) has been filed and all associated liabilities discharged.

Revenue confirmed a refund of exit tax has occurred in such circumstances, where the requirements of section 189 have been met.\u00a0 However, where income or gains arise to, or are received by, the estate of a deceased individual, the exemption provided for in section 189 would not apply in those circumstances and consequently the repayment of any exit tax deducted cannot be made by Revenue. <\/p>  <p>  As Revenue was never entitled to make repayments of the exit tax that arises under section 739G TCA to the estate of a deceased individual and there has been no change in the law to permit such refunds, I am advised that there has been no change in Revenue&rsquo;s practice in relation to these matters. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021090900013#WRL04700","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Government Communications","counter":628,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021090900013#WRL04800"},{"type":"question","counter":629,"qnumday":214,"qnumall":"[42924\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021090900013#WRL04900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if his ministerial phones have been hacked or attempted to be hacked during the term of office.","asker":"1560","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":630,"content":"<p>I wish to indicate to the Deputy that to my knowledge,\u00a0I am not aware of any instance of a hack on my Ministerial phone.<\/p><p>The Department&rsquo;s ICT providers (the Office of the Government&rsquo;s Chief Information Officer [OGCIO]) have deployed a multi layered approach to security, with defence-in-depth comprising of people, process and technology to protect against cyber security attacks. \u00a0<\/p><p>For operational security reasons, my Department is not in a position to provide further details of its cyber security systems as it would be inappropriate to disclose information that may in any way assist those with malicious intent.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021090900013#WRL05000","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":632,"qnumday":215,"qnumall":"[42942\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021090900013#WRL05200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he has ever used his personal phones for Government business; and if so, if the personal phones have been hacked during his term of office.","asker":"1560","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":633,"content":"<p>I can confirm to the Deputy that I do not use a personal phone for Government business. <\/p><p>I also wish to indicate to the Deputy that to my knowledge,\u00a0I am not aware of any instance of a hack on my phone.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021090900013#WRL05300","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Freedom of Information","counter":635,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021090900014#WRM00200"},{"type":"question","counter":636,"qnumday":216,"qnumall":"[42964\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021090900014#WRM00300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of freedom of information requests responded to by his Department in each of the years 2016 to 2020 and to date in 2021; the number of responses that included documents related to text messages and other phone message communications such as messages sent through an application (details supplied), in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The CRSS operates on a self-assessment basis, and claimants are required to satisfy themselves that they are correctly eligible for the scheme before registering to receive payments. Claimants are also required to review their continued eligibility for the scheme before making a claim for payment in respect of each subsequent claim period.<\/p>  <p>  To qualify for the CRSS, a business must operate from a business premises located in a region that is subject to restrictions introduced in line with the Government&rsquo;s Living with COVID-19 Plan, requiring it to prohibit or considerably restrict customers from accessing its premises. It is not sufficient that a business experiences a reduction in demand for its services or a reduced footfall because of Covid-19 measures. For example, dry cleaning and laundry businesses were not required to restrict customer access under the public health measures and as such do not qualify for the CRSS, even if service demand is reduced. Such businesses may however qualify for the other support schemes introduced to support them during the pandemic.<\/p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that the business in question operates a dry-cleaning service and incorrectly claimed and received CRSS payments to which it was not entitled, which must be repaid in due course. Revenue has also confirmed that it accepts that the business genuinely believed that it qualified for the scheme and that repayment of the amount owed as a single payment could cause it financial difficulties. To avoid such a scenario to the greatest extent possible, Revenue will engage directly with the business to agree a suitable payment solution, including the possibility of adding the amount owed to its current warehoused debt under the Debt Warehousing Scheme, even though that scheme does not specifically provide for CRSS related liabilities.<\/p>  <p>  The company may be also eligible to register for the new Business Resumption Support Scheme (BRSS), which is an additional support for businesses with reduced turnover due to COVID-19 related restrictions. Further details on the BRSS, which is now operational, are available on the Revenue website.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, Revenue has confirmed that in addition to receiving financial support through the Debt Warehousing Scheme, the Business is also receiving payments under the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS).<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021090900014#WRM00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Commissions of Investigation","counter":641,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021090900014#WRM00800"},{"type":"question","counter":642,"qnumday":218,"qnumall":"[42992\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021090900014#WRM00900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the cost of each commission of investigation under the remit of his Department over the preceding decade.

The OPW are currently reviewing the application and a decision is expected to issue in the coming weeks.<\/p><p>In addition to the above proposals, prior to forecasted extreme weather events, local area staff from Cork County Council are implementing interim measures to assist mitigate flooding, such as deployment of sandbags at Sands Quay and mobile pumping.<\/p><p>Skibbereen<b>:<\/b><\/p><p>The Skibbereen Flood Relief Scheme was substantially completed on 6th June 2019.All identified defects arising from the construction have been remedied, with some delays as a result of Covid-19. <\/p><p>Planning for the operation and maintenance of the scheme is ongoing in conjunction with Cork County Council, who will act as agents of the OPW in carrying out the statutory operation and maintenance of the scheme.\u00a0 A small number of works to address elements identified during construction, which were outside the main construction contract, remain to be completed and are being progressed in separate works packages.<\/p><p>In addition, some drainage works on Cork Road, which fall outside the remit of the main Scheme, have subsequently been identified as being necessary.\u00a0 Detailed assessments are currently being progressed by Cork County Council and consultants RPS, in conjunction with the OPW and Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII), to identify the most effective solution.\u00a0 While work is currently ongoing on the development of a solution, the Council is not yet in a position to confirm the programme times in relation to planning approvals and construction.<\/p><p>Following the flood event, which occurred in August, 2020 in the Rossa Road area, Cork County Council and its consultants have been undertaking assessments of the problem and these assessments are progressing. \u00a0The OPW is providing funding under the Minor Works &amp;amp; Flood Mitigation Scheme towards these works, which involve the upgrade of the Rossa Road culvert trash screen and inlet chamber. \u00a0Some discussions have taken place with a local landowner with a view to completing some remedial\/improvement works.\u00a0 Any further works can only be progressed once the required reports are completed.<\/p><p>Bandon<b>:<\/b><\/p><p>The Bandon Flood Relief Scheme was substantially completed on 16th October 2020.<\/p><p>A number of additional minor items are still planned to be completed, such as fencing, railings and conservation works to Bandon Bridge.<\/p><p>Work is ongoing on preparing the operation and maintenance plans for the scheme and it is envisaged that the maintenance and operation of the scheme will be carried out for and on behalf of the OPW by Cork County Council. <\/p><p>As part of the completed Bandon flood relief scheme, the Office of Public Works installed a large &lsquo;rock-ramp&rsquo; fish pass in the Bandon River, measuring some 130m, in October 2018.The fish pass was designed by international experts, with input from national experts in the then Department of Environment, Community and Local Government (DECLH), along with Inland Fisheries Ireland (IFI).<\/p><p>In March 2021, the OPW became aware that the boulders, rock and gravel material that formed the bed of the ramp had deteriorated, possibly as a result of extreme flows in the river in February 2021. The OPW immediately carried out inspections, accompanied by IFI representatives and the fisheries&rsquo; specialist on the Project which identified serious deterioration of the rock and gravel bed materials used in the construction of the fish pass, over its full length.\u00a0 Of immediate concern was the erosion of bed material at the upstream end of the fish pass, which had resulted in the retaining wall, originally constructed below the bed level of the pass, becoming exposed and creating a &lsquo;step&rsquo; up from the bed level immediately downstream of it, which was creating serious difficulties for various aquatic species in migrating over this newly exposed &lsquo;step&rsquo; at the upstream end of the fish pass, particularly in low flows.<\/p><p>The OPW and IFI agreed that urgent measures were required to alleviate this problem, which, following all appropriate assessments and approvals, were carried out successfully.<\/p><p>While these emergency works were critical in solving the immediate problem, an investigation into the reasons for the deterioration of the bed material on the fish pass is ongoing and a longer term solution will be developed with a view to fully rectifying the issue with the carrying out of any necessary works when the investigations are completed. <\/p><p>Clonakilty<b>:<\/b><\/p><p>The Clonakilty Flood Relief Scheme undertaken by the Office of Public Works in partnership with Cork County Council was substantially completed on 4th February 2021 by the main contractor, Ward and Burke Ltd and now provides protection to 296 properties.<\/p><p>A number of works to address outstanding items and snags to be completed by the contractor are currently ongoing.<\/p><p>Planning for the operation and maintenance of the scheme is ongoing in conjunction with Cork County Council, who will act as agents of the OPW in carrying out the statutory operation and maintenance of the scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021090900015#WRN04400","answer":true,"speaker":"1494"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":736,"content":"<p>Question No. 251 answered with Question No. 250.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":737,"content":"<p>Question No. 252 answered with Question No. 250.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":738,"content":"<p>Question No. 253 answered with Question No. 250.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Brexit Supports","counter":739,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021090900015#WRN04800"},{"type":"question","counter":740,"qnumday":254,"qnumall":"[42827\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021090900015#WRN04900","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the overall amount of the Brexit Adjustment Reserve Fund for Ireland;

There are 44 PAA&rsquo;s in the South East region (Laois, Kilkenny, Carlow, Wexford, Waterford, Tipperary, some overlap into Wicklow, Offaly and Limerick).\u00a0 <\/p><p>The first step of LAWPRO&rsquo;s work in a PAA, is to improve the scientific understanding by gathering and collating all relevant and available data into a Desktop Study Report. \u00a0This ensures there is a focus on the issues that are significantly affecting water quality and the mitigation actions that should prioritised.\u00a0 <\/p><p>Another important aspect of LAWPRO&rsquo;s work in the PAA&rsquo;s is informing and working with local communities. Following their desktop studies and prior to commencing their fieldwork assessments, LAWPRO organises a community information meeting to discuss the water body with local people and interest groups. Local meetings are followed by farmer engagement events organised by advisors from the collaborative Agricultural Sustainability Support and Advisory Programme, with the support of LAWPRO staff. Work to this stage has been completed for 34 of the PAA&rsquo;s in the South East region.<\/p><p>Using this and other scientific information, LAWPRO catchment scientists then begin their fieldwork, walking the riverbanks and taking water samples to assess the condition of the river. Once the fieldwork is concluded and analysed, LAWPRO discuss the outcome of the assessment with the relevant implementing bodies or landowners, agreeing timelines for implementation of measures to improve water quality. The advisors from the Agricultural Sustainability Support and Advisory Programme will discuss any agricultural measures with the farmers.\u00a0<\/p><p>Noting the impact of the COVID emergency on their work, particularly the community meetings and fieldwork elements, to date LAWPRO have completed 11 overall assessments, with fieldwork in 18 PAA&rsquo;s currently ongoing.<\/p><p>A summary of the PAA&rsquo;s in the South East Regions is outlined below, with further information available on LAWPRO&rsquo;s website at <i>awaters.ie\/priority-areas-for-action\/<\/i>.  Additional information on water quality and the status of waters can also be viewed on <i>www.catchments.ie<\/i>.<\/p><p>As key commitment in the Programme for Government, my Department is currently preparing a new strengthened River Basin Management Plan for Ireland, to cover the period 2022 &ndash; 2027. Further advancing Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to the implementation of the Water Framework Directive, the new plan will build on the work of the second-cycle, again describing the main pressures and activities affecting water status and setting out the environmental objectives to be achieved up to 2027. The plan will also identify the measures needed to achieve these objectives, including a proposed expansion of the Areas for Action. <\/p><p>A draft plan is due to be published shortly for a 6 month public consultation, so I would urge\u00a0everyone to please engage in this process once the consultation is launched.<\/p><p><b>PAA Progress Summary for the South East Region:\u00a0\u00a0<\/b> <table>    <tr>       <th>Area for action<\/th>       <th>County<\/th>       <th>Catchment<\/th>       <th>Progress status<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Aherlow<\/td>       <td>Tipperary\/Limerick<\/td>       <td>Suir<\/td>       <td>Fieldwork underway<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Ara<\/td>       <td>Tipperary<\/td>       <td>Suir<\/td>       <td>Fieldwork underway<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Athy Stream<\/td>       <td>Kildare\/Laois<\/td>       <td>Barrow<\/td>       <td>Fieldwork completed<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Ballyfinboy (Upper)<\/td>       <td>Offaly\/Tipperary<\/td>       <td>Lower Shannon<\/td>       <td>Not commenced yet<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Ballyroan<\/td>       <td>Laois<\/td>       <td>Nore<\/td>       <td>Not commenced yet<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Bannow<\/td>       <td>Wexford<\/td>       <td>Ballyteighe-Bannow<\/td>       <td>Fieldwork underway<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Blackwater (Wexford)<\/td>       <td>Wexford<\/td>       <td>Owenavorragh<\/td>       <td>Not commenced yet<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Borrisoleigh<\/td>       <td>Tipperary<\/td>       <td>Lower Shannon<\/td>       <td>Not commenced yet<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Bregagh (Kilkenny)<\/td>       <td>Kilkenny<\/td>       <td>Nore<\/td>       <td>Initial Public Engagement completed<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Brownstown (Pococke)<\/td>       <td>Kilkenny<\/td>       <td>Nore<\/td>       <td>Not commenced yet<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Bunow<\/td>       <td>Tipperary<\/td>       <td>Lower Shannon<\/td>       <td>Initial Public Engagement completed<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Burren<\/td>       <td>Carlow<\/td>       <td>Barrow<\/td>       <td>Fieldwork underway<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Clashawley<\/td>       <td>Tipperary<\/td>       <td>Suir<\/td>       <td>LCA report completed<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Clodiagh (Portlaw)<\/td>       <td>Waterford<\/td>       <td>Suir<\/td>       <td>Fieldwork completed<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Colligan-Brickey<\/td>       <td>Waterford<\/td>       <td>Colligan-Mahon<\/td>       <td>Fieldwork underway<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Dead &amp;amp;

It is important to note that the limits introduced in 2011 also reflected a blanket increase of &euro;5,000 introduced prior to the new system coming into operation, in order to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn, both promoting sustainable communities and also providing a degree of future-proofing.<\/p>  <p>  Given the cost to the State of providing social housing, it is considered prudent and fair to direct resources to those most in need of social housing support.

Included in the planning exemptions set out in the Regulations are those applying to the installation of solar infrastructure on a variety of building types, including houses, businesses, industrial and agricultural to which specific conditions are attached.<\/p>  <p>  My Department, in the context of the Climate Action Plan and in consultation with the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications, has undertaken a review of the solar panel planning exemptions set out in the Regulations, with a particular focus on facilitating increased self-generation of electricity.<\/p>  <p>  This review is now complete. Substantial changes to the current planning exemption thresholds for solar panels are proposed, as well as the introduction of new classes of solar panel planning exemptions relating to their use in apartments and in educational\/community\/religious buildings.<\/p>  <p>  In light of the need to appropriately address aviation safety concerns arising from the &ldquo;glint and glare&rdquo; impacts of solar panels and the easing of the solar panel planning exemption thresholds, my Department is in the process of commissioning the development of detailed aviation safeguarding maps which will identify and delineate specific but limited areas in the vicinity of airports and aerodromes (referred to as exclusion zones) within which the exemptions will not apply. This mapping process will take approximately nine months to complete.<\/p>  <p>  Whilst this work is ongoing, my Department proposes to advance interim regulations, adopting a temporary, albeit more stringent, radial approach incorporating initial defined exclusion zones around airports and aerodromes. These interim regulations, allowing for increased solar panel planning exemptions, will cover the vast majority of the land area of the country, only excluding those limited exclusion zones around airports and aerodromes.<\/p>  <p>  The draft interim regulations have been reviewed under the Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) Directive 2001\/42\/EC and it has been determined that they are likely to have significant effects on the environment, necessitating the undertaking of a full SEA on the draft proposals. The SEA process, involving a public consultation on the proposals, is currently underway and is expected to be completed by mid-December 2021.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Following the public consultation and consideration of any submissions received, and as required under planning legislation, the proposed exempted development regulations must be laid in draft form before the Houses of the Oireachtas and receive a positive resolution from both Houses before they can be made and the SEA process concluded.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Accordingly, the process for\u00a0finalising the interim solar panel planning exemptions as referred to above, with interim exclusion zones around airports and aerodromes, is now expected to be completed in early 2022. As outlined, pending the finalisation of the aforementioned aviation safeguarding maps, these interim regulations will allow for the vast majority of the country to be covered by the proposed new solar panel exemptions apart from those areas in\u00a0close proximity\u00a0to airports and aerodromes.<\/p>  <p>  Work on the development of the aviation safeguarding maps for airports and aerodromes is expected to be completed in early 2022. The final supplementary set of regulations - delineating the final exclusion areas around airports and aerodromes in which the exemptions will not apply - will be prepared thereafter and, subject to environmental reporting considerations, will subsequently be laid in draft form before the Houses of the Oireachtas for approval in a timely manner.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021090900018#WRQ07200","answer":true,"speaker":"1595"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Planning Issues","counter":936,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021090900019#WRR00200"},{"type":"question","counter":937,"qnumday":317,"qnumall":"[41871\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021090900019#WRR00300","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if plans are in place to extend planning permission due to delays arising from Covid-19 (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1590","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":938,"content":"<p>Section 42 of Planning and Development Act 2000 ('the Act') currently enables the holder of a planning permission to apply to a planning authority for an extension to the period of permission by an additional period not exceeding 5 years. <\/p>  <p>  At present, if\u00a0an extension to planning permission has been previously granted, the holder of a planning permission may be granted a\u00a0further extension of duration under\u00a0section 42(1A) of the Act in respect of a development that relates to 20 or more houses, where substantial works have been carried out,\u00a0subject to the development being completed within 5 years of the originally extended permission or by 31 December 2021 (as extended in 2020\u00a0by Government Orders under Section 251A of the Act), whichever first occurs.<\/p>  <p>  Section 7 of the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2021\u00a0('the 2021 Act'), which was commenced on 9 September 2021, provides a temporary provision allowing for applications for further extensions of planning permissions which have already availed of an extension under section 42 of the Act, or otherwise under section 42(1A),\u00a0and in circumstances where\u00a0no further extension is\u00a0permissible. <\/p>  <p>  Where\u00a0an application is made to a planning authority for a further extension, pursuant to the 2021 Act amendments,\u00a0setting out the reasons why a development cannot be reasonably completed within the appropriate period as already extended, the planning authority shall further extend that period by an additional period of up to 2 years or until 31 December 2023, whichever first occurs, subject to the planning authority being satisfied of a number of matters, including that the development has commenced, substantial works have been carried out and that the extension is required to enable the development to be completed.\u00a0This is subject also to the planning authority being satisfied that environmental impact assessment or appropriate assessment\u00a0would not be required for the proposed extension of the appropriate period.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021090900019#WRR00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1595"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":939,"content":"<p>Question No. 318 answered with Question No. 316.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":940,"content":"<p>Question No. 319 answered with Question No. 316.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Waterways Ireland","counter":941,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021090900019#WRR00700"},{"type":"question","counter":942,"qnumday":320,"qnumall":"[41886\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021090900019#WRR00800","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if he will clarify whether businesses operating under a licence issued by Waterways Ireland are eligible for a commercial rates waiver in the context of Covid-19 restrictions; and if he will further clarify whether Waterways Ireland are exempt from Directive S.I.

Many of these developments will now progress to being considered for taking in charge by the relevant local authority. <\/p><p>- 124 developments remain &lsquo;unfinished&rsquo;.<\/p><p>Of the 124 unfinished developments, 326 houses and 13 apartments were vacant at the time of survey in 2020.\u00a0 The table below outlines the breakdown by county, including those that were fully unoccupied.\u00a0<\/p><p>Unfinished Developments by County, September 2020  <table>    <tr>       <th>LA<\/th>       <th>Total Developments<\/th>       <th>Total Unoccupied<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Carlow<\/td>       <td>6<\/td>       <td>1<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Cavan<\/td>       <td>5<\/td>       <td>4<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Clare<\/td>       <td>4<\/td>       <td>1<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Cork County<\/td>       <td>7<\/td>       <td>4<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Donegal<\/td>       <td>17<\/td>       <td>7<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Dublin City<\/td>       <td>1<\/td>       <td>1<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Fingal<\/td>       <td>5<\/td>       <td>0<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Galway County<\/td>       <td>4<\/td>       <td>2<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Kerry<\/td>       <td>2<\/td>       <td>2<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Kilkenny<\/td>       <td>3<\/td>       <td>1<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Laois<\/td>       <td>3<\/td>       <td>3<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Leitrim<\/td>       <td>9<\/td>       <td>5<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Limerick<\/td>       <td>6<\/td>       <td>4<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Longford<\/td>       <td>1<\/td>       <td>1<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Louth<\/td>       <td>4<\/td>       <td>0<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Mayo<\/td>       <td>3<\/td>       <td>2<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Monaghan<\/td>       <td>1<\/td>       <td>1<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Offaly<\/td>       <td>3<\/td>       <td>0<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Roscommon<\/td>       <td>14<\/td>       <td>7<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Sligo<\/td>       <td>3<\/td>       <td>1<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Tipperary<\/td>       <td>10<\/td>       <td>4<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Waterford<\/td>       <td>3<\/td>       <td>0<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Wexford<\/td>       <td>9<\/td>       <td>5<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Wicklow<\/td>       <td>1<\/td>       <td>1<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td><b> <\/b><\/td>       <td><b>124<\/b><\/td>       <td><b>57<\/b><\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p><p>A list of unfinished housing estates can be found under the &lsquo;unfinished&rsquo; tab layer on the MyPlan website available at the following link: <i>www.myplan.ie<\/i>.<\/p><p>In the line with the commitment in Housing for All, local authorities will continue to assess the best options for resolution of unfinished developments and\/or developments that are to be taken in charge.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021090900020#WRS00868","answer":true,"speaker":"1595"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":995,"content":"<p>Question No. 341 answered with Question No. 340.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Turf Cutting","counter":996,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021090900020#WRS00900"},{"type":"question","counter":997,"qnumday":342,"qnumall":"[42240\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021090900020#WRS01000","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"when a person (details supplied) will receive a payment under the turf cutting compensation scheme for 2021.

If a household has been deemed eligible for social housing support, it is a matter for the local authority to examine the suite of social housing supports available, to determine the most appropriate form of social housing support for that household.<\/p><p>The 2011 Regulations prescribe maximum net income limits for each local authority, in different bands according to the area concerned, with income being defined and assessed according to a standard Household Means Policy.\u00a0 The 2011 Regulations do not provide local authorities with any discretion to exceed the limits that apply to their administrative areas.<\/p><p>Under the Household Means Policy, which applies in all local authorities, net income for social housing assessment is defined as gross household income less income tax, PRSI, Universal Social Charge and Additional Superannuation Contribution. The Policy provides for a range of income disregards, and local authorities also have discretion to decide to disregard income that is temporary, short-term or once-off in nature. <\/p><p>The income bands are expressed in terms of a maximum net income threshold for a single-person household, with an allowance of 5% for each additional adult household member, subject to a maximum allowance under this category of 10%; and separately, an allowance of 2.5% for each child. The income bands and the authority area assigned to each band were based on an assessment of the income needed to provide for a household's basic needs, plus a comparative analysis of the local rental cost of housing accommodation across the country. It is important to note that the limits introduced in 2011 also reflected a blanket increase of &euro;5,000 introduced prior to the new system coming into operation, in order to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn, both promoting sustainable communities and also providing a degree of future-proofing. <\/p><p>Given the cost to the State of providing social housing, it is considered prudent and fair to direct resources to those most in need of social housing support. The current income eligibility requirements generally achieve this, providing for a fair and equitable system of identifying those households facing the greatest challenge in meeting their accommodation needs from their own resources.<\/p><p>However, as part of the broader social housing reform agenda, a review of income eligibility for social housing supports in each local authority area is underway. The review will have regard to current initiatives being brought forward in terms of affordable housing both for purchase and for cost rental.<\/p><p>Where MTR is not an option, it will be a matter for the borrower to discuss with their lender if there are other options available to resolve their mortgage arrears solution.\u00a0 The Abhaile service is a\u00a0national mortgage arrears resolution service\u00a0provided free of charge to the borrower and its aim is to help mortgage holders in arrears to find the best solutions and keep them, wherever possible, in their own homes.\u00a0 The Money Advice and Budgetary Service (MABS) acts as the gateway for the service and can be contacted by telephoning (076) 1072000 or by accessing their website at: <i>www.mabs.ie\/abhaile<\/i>.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021090900021#WRT00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Authorities","counter":1052,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021090900021#WRT00800"},{"type":"question","counter":1053,"qnumday":362,"qnumall":"[42575\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021090900021#WRT00900","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the total amount collected by local authorities through commercial rates for 2019.","asker":"1464","askee":"1561"},{"type":"question","counter":1054,"qnumday":363,"qnumall":"[42576\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021090900021#WRT01000","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the total amount collected by local authorities through non-commercial rates for 2019.","asker":"1464","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":1055,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 362 and 363 together.<\/p><p>The funding system for local authorities is complex, with\u00a0authorities deriving their income from a variety of sources.\u00a0 <\/p><p>In 2019, local authorities had\u00a0total revenue income of &euro;5.3billion.

The report draws on a very substantial body of scientific work led by NPWS in collaboration with external experts, working together over a period of six years. The assessments in the report help to inform important decisions around my Department&rsquo;s work programme.<\/p>  <p>  There are a number of priority actions that are being taken in my Department and across Government to improve the conservation status of estuaries, lagoons and tidal mudflats and sandflats, and other habitats and species that are protected by the European Union&rsquo;s Birds and Habitats Directives. <\/p>  <p>  The updated Prioritised Action Framework for the Implementation Birds and Habitats Directives was approved by Government in March this year and has been submitted to the European Commission in line with Article 8 of the Habitats Directive. <\/p>  <p>  With regard to coastal lagoons, water quality and hydrological issues are among the main pressures on these habitats. The main conservation measures required relate to the improvement of water quality in lagoon catchments and the restoration of hydrological processes, including once-off infrastructural measures to manage water regimes as well as ongoing measures to reduce nutrient inputs. While measures to improve water quality will continue to be required and delivered through the river basin planning process, specific targeted programmes will also be required, particularly for the large sedimentary lagoons of the south-east coast.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is co-funding a project with the Environmental Protection Agency\u00a0called CLEAR (Coastal Lagoons: Ecology and Restoration). This project will answer critical scientific questions about the ecological dynamics of our coastal lagoons, as well as a detailed plan for the restoration of Lady&rsquo;s Island Lake in Wexford, one of Ireland&rsquo;s largest, and proposed restoration methods that will be applicable to other sites. This project represents a critical step in mapping out what specific actions will be required to restore our coastal lagoons. It is due to report in 2022. <\/p>  <p>  With regard to estuaries and tidal mudflats and sandflats, my Department&rsquo;s recent reports have also concluded that eutrophication and damage to keystone marine communities are the key issues driving their conservation status. <\/p>  <p>  My Department is developing Ireland&rsquo;s next River Basin Management Plan (RBMP)\u00a02022-2027, a key tool for the implementation of the EU&rsquo;s Water Framework Directive and for the improvement of water quality in Ireland.

The General Scheme\u00a0has been informed by consultation with the relevant sectors likely to be impacted by its provisions. The shape of the Bill has been considered on a number of occasions by the Board of the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management (NDFEM).

However, acknowledging that some\u00a0households on the waiting list, who avail of HAP, have expectations that they would receive a more\u00a0traditional form of social housing support, Ministerial directions have issued to ensure that, should they so choose, HAP recipients can avail of a move to other forms of social housing support through a transfer list.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, local authorities are also directed that HAP recipients who apply to go on the transfer list should get full credit for the time they spent on the waiting list and be placed on the transfer list with no less favourable terms than if they had remained on the waiting list.<\/p>  <p>  Guidelines on inter-authority movement were issued to local authorities to facilitate the movement of HAP households from one local authority area to another in cases where a HAP tenant wishes to access rented accommodation, with HAP support, in another local authority area.

In September 2019, then Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Ms Katherine Zappone T.D., was appointed Special Envoy for Ireland&rsquo;s candidature for election to the UN Security Council for the 2021-2022 term.  This decision was taken in order to bolster Ireland&rsquo;s profile in the final months of the campaign and underlined the importance attached to our candidature across the whole of Government.  <\/p><p>During her nine months in this role, then Minister Zappone led twenty-five bilateral meetings during which our candidature was raised, mainly with Ministerial-level representatives of countries in which Ireland does not have resident Embassies.  These meetings took place in the margins of the UN General Assembly in September 2019, at the International Conference on Population and Development in Nairobi in November 2019, and in parallel with official engagements in New York in March 2020.<\/p><p>The role was additional to the then Minister&rsquo;s existing responsibilities and was not remunerated; as is normal for any person travelling on official business, associated travel expenses were covered. The appointment ended on Ireland&rsquo;s election to the Council in June 2020. <\/p><p>On 24 February 2021, during a conversation with the then Secretary General of my Department, I asked the Secretary General whether former Minister Zappone could support Ireland's team at the Permanent Mission to the UN in New York.  He advised me that he would reflect on it.  Several days later, the Secretary General informed me that the United States planned to appoint a Special Envoy to Advance the Human Rights of LGBTQI+ Persons. In that context, he raised the possibility of exploring whether a similar position for Ireland might add value to the existing work of the Department in this area. <\/p><p>I approached Ms. Zappone and asked if she would be interested in principle in assuming a position relating to LGBTI rights, should the Department develop such a role. She responded positively, at which point officials in my Department took the process forward.<\/p><p>The debate on human rights is increasingly polarised internationally and there is debate significant push back against the very definition of human rights and gender equality. Civil society space is shrinking in many countries; and the rights of LGBTI+ persons are being undermined.  As a result, many States that share Ireland&rsquo;s approach to human rights have appointed Special Envoys or Ambassadors at large with mandates in these areas.<\/p><p>In this context, officials in my Department developed a mandate for a Special Envoy role focused on freedom of opinion and expression, encompassing the human rights of LGBTI+ persons, civil society space, freedom of the media and freedom of association.  <\/p><p>It was envisaged that the Envoy would engage with peers across the EU and in other countries, and represent Ireland in targeted bilateral engagements and at specific international fora including the UN General Assembly&rsquo;s Third Committee; the Commission on the Status of Women; and the UN Human Rights Council.  It was also expected that the Envoy would support international advocacy initiatives around key events such as World Press Freedom Day; International Women&rsquo;s Day; Pride month; and International Day Against Homophobia, Transphobia and Biphobia. Supporting international aspects of Ireland&rsquo;s National LGBTI+ Inclusion Strategy would also have been a key element of the role.  The proposed remuneration was based on the midpoint of the Civil Service Principal Officer pay scale, excluding the two Long Service Increments. <\/p><p>The proposal to appoint former Minister Zappone as Special Envoy was approved by Government at a meeting of Cabinet on 27 July 2021. Ms Zappone declined the position on 4 August 2021.  <\/p><p>I can confirm that all records in relation to the appointment of former Minister Zappone as Special Envoy on Freedom of Opinion and Expression that are held by my Department, and by me, have been made publicly available on the Department&rsquo;s website since 6 September 2021.<\/p><p>I can also confirm that Ms Zappone did not hold any other formal or informal position in my Department during the lifetime of this Government.<\/p><p>Ireland currently has two Special Envoys. Mr. Tom Arnold is serving as Government Special Envoy on Food Systems, a role which was jointly proposed by the Departments of Foreign Affairs and Agriculture, Food and the Marine, and which is linked to preparations for the UN Food Systems Summit 2021 on 23 September next, and the Tokyo Nutrition for Growth Summit 2021 in December. Mr. Kenneth Thompson is serving as Special Envoy for francophone Africa and the Sahel, a role linked to Ireland&rsquo;s term on the Security Council. <\/p><p>Finally, I wish to state that my Department had no role in relation to organising or paying for the private event referred to by the Deputy. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021090900023#WRV01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Passport Services","counter":1177,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021090900023#WRV01900"},{"type":"question","counter":1178,"qnumday":405,"qnumall":"[41619\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021090900023#WRV02000","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"when a passport will issue in the case of a person (details supplied);

As I have stated before, ease of travel is vital to our economic relationships and for building connections across the Atlantic and  therefore ensuring that it can resume in a safe way is a priority for the Government. <\/p>  <p>  Last month the Taoiseach wrote directly to President Biden noting the disruptive impact that US travel restrictions have had, and sharing information about Ireland&rsquo;s successful and ongoing vaccination programme.\u00a0My Department also continues to engage with the US at the highest levels. I myself raised the question of resumption of travel between our two countries during my meeting with US National Security Advisor, Jake Sullivan, in May this year. Our Embassy in Washington D.C. continues to reach out to contacts in the US Administration and Department of State on the issue, emphasising the\u00a0impact of the travel restrictions on citizens in both countries, as well as the economic repercussions. Our Ambassador in Washington has written twice to the US Administration, including in recent weeks, urging them to ease the restrictions. My Department also has a very positive working relationship with the US Charg&eacute; d&rsquo;Affaires and her team at the US Embassy in Dublin and we continue to encourage them to process exceptions to their travel restrictions for those travelling to the US for essential reasons. <\/p>  <p>  At the EU level, following the EU-US summit in June, a joint EU-US Experts&rsquo; Working Group to exchange information and expertise to reinstate safe and sustainable travel between the EU and the United States was set up, and has met twice since then.

We take our legal responsibility in relation to Foreign Birth Registration very seriously and prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the processing time for these applications stood at 18 months.  This is due to the complex nature of Foreign Birth Registration applications and the very high volume of applications we received due to Brexit. At present, there are just over 31,000 applications in the Foreign Births Registration (FBR) system awaiting processing. <\/p>  <p>  During the COVID-19 Pandemic FBR application processing was paused to give priority to the provision of other priority services. Notably, we reassigned staff to the HSE for essential contact tracing; to the Department of Social Protection for the processing of essential PUP payments, and to support the Department of Health with quarantine issues. <\/p>  <p>  These emergency pandemic measures did not impact the provision of passports for essential reasons and we also continued to provide an emergency service for Foreign Birth Registration in cases of exceptional urgency, or where an applicant required the return of documents. As with many other areas of public service provision,  a backlog of applications has inevitably grown due to the COVID 19 disruptions of our normal processes.<\/p>  <p>  The Passport Service is very concerned about this backlog situation and are actively planning to resume processing FBR applications as soon as possible. We will be making a public announcement on specific dates in the coming weeks. My  Department is committed to allocating further resources to this service to assist with the high volume of applications when regular processing resumes with a focus on reducing turnaround times to pre COVID-19 levels by the end of 2021.  In the medium term, changes to the FBR process to increase efficiencies and improve the customer experience will be delivered under the next phase of my Department's Passport Reform Programme.<\/p>  <p>  In cases of exceptional urgency applicants may continue to contact the Passport Service directly using email address: travelemergency@dfat.ie. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021090900023#WRV06200","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1221,"content":"<p>Question No. 414 answered with Question No. 409.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Passport Services","counter":1222,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021090900023#WRV06400"},{"type":"question","counter":1223,"qnumday":415,"qnumall":"[41854\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021090900023#WRV06500","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the steps he is taking to address long delays in waiting for passport applications; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1567","askee":"1457"},{"type":"question","counter":1224,"qnumday":428,"qnumall":"[42124\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021090900023#WRV06600","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"his views on the delayed processing of passports (details supplied) and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1499","askee":"1457"},{"type":"question","counter":1225,"qnumday":448,"qnumall":"[42501\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021090900023#WRV06700","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the current turnaround times for new passport applications and passport renewals; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1625","askee":"1457"},{"type":"question","counter":1226,"qnumday":455,"qnumall":"[42639\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021090900023#WRV06800","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"when the passport express will open for applications; if the service will be able to provide the normal turnaround time for passports; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1567","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":1227,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 415, 428, 448 and 455 together.<\/p>  <p>The Passport Service has received nearly 500,000 applications in\u00a02021\u00a0to date, with approximately 110,000 under process.

The Agreements, as well as the principles and values underpinning them, are at the core of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to peace, reconciliation and prosperity on this island.<\/p>  <p>  The Good Friday Agreement addressed the constitutional status of Northern Ireland on the basis of the &lsquo;principle of consent&rsquo;. The Agreement recognised the legitimate aspiration to a United Ireland as well as that for Northern Ireland to remain part of the United Kingdom and affirmed the right of self-determination by the people of the island of Ireland, on the basis of consent, freely and concurrently given, North and South. This was also reflected in changes, by referendum, to the Constitution of Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  The Agreement put in place a framework which is made up of three strands, together representing the relationships that exist within and between the islands of Britain and Ireland. Strand One consists of the Northern Ireland Assembly and Executive; these institutions are the basis by which political parties in Northern Ireland share power.\u00a0Strand Two of the agreement saw the North South Ministerial Council established to develop cooperation and action within the island of Ireland, between the Northern Ireland Executive and Irish Government.\u00a0\u00a0Strand Three established the British-Irish Council and British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference to promote relations East-West between Ireland and Britain.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The agreement also looks at issues related to Citizenship; Rights, Safeguards and Equality of Opportunity; Decommissioning; Security; Policing and Justice and Prisoners.<\/p>  <p>  The Peace Process has succeeded over the last two decades in moving definitively beyond the violence of the Troubles. However, it is necessarily an ongoing process, requiring the continued active oversight and involvement of the two Governments as co-guarantors.\u00a0 Since the conclusion of the Good Friday Agreement in 1998, it has been necessary to pursue a series of successive further political and legal agreements to consolidate the peace settlement provided for in the GFA and to address crises of political confidence in Northern Ireland.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In 2005, the Independent Decommissioning Body confirmed that IRA decommissioning had taken place. In 2006, the St. Andrew's Agreement was published, which set out a path to full devolution of policing and justice and a stable power-sharing arrangement. In 2010, the signing of the Hillsborough Agreement allowed for the devolution of policing and justice powers to the Northern Ireland Assembly, which then began later that year.<\/p>  <p>  In 2014, the Stormont House Agreement was reached. The Stormont House Agreement envisaged the establishment of a new institutional framework for dealing with the past. Addressing the difficult legacy of the past remains an ongoing challenge at the core of the Peace Process, and as the Deputy will be aware, a process of intense engagement in currently underway with respect to legacy.<\/p>  <p>  Following the collapse of the Executive in 2017, there was a three year absence of the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement before the New Decade, New Approach agreement was reached and they were restored to operation. The North South Ministerial Council has begun its vital work again, with two plenaries and a range of sectoral meetings now having taken place. The Government is committed to working in support of the full implementation of the NDNA and our own commitments. We also look forward to enhanced roles for the British Irish Council and British Irish Intergovernmental Conference (BIIGC), as set out in the Programme for Government. A BIIGC took place on 24 June, with the next meeting planned for later this year. The first NDNA Implementation Review meeting took place on 11 January, and a second is planned in the weeks ahead.<\/p>  <p>  A Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland is a central provision of the GFA. An Ad-Hoc Assembly Committee has been established, and the Committee published its research paper on the &ldquo;Key Issues for a Bill of Rights&rdquo; in March 2020, and launched a public consultation in May. The Government remains firmly committed to the provision of a Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  All parties to the GFA recognised the importance of respect, understanding and tolerance in relation to linguistic diversity, which in Northern Ireland includes the Irish language, Ulster-Scots and the languages of the various ethnic communities.\u00a0 There is now a commitment in place from the British Government to legislate to implement the relevant provisions of the NDNA agreement if the Norther Ireland Assembly has not done so by October.\u00a0 \u00a0Progress has also been made regarding the Government&rsquo;s commitments supporting the Irish language in Northern Ireland, including the allocation of: &euro;3m as part of the commitment in Budget 2021 for Irish language broadcasting; &euro;1.8m over three years (2020-22) to support the Irish language in Northern Ireland; and an All Island expansion of existing Irish Language Network strategy.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Government continues to support the establishment of a dedicated structure for civic engagement by the Northern Ireland Executive as set out in the Good Friday Agreement under Strand One. In the NDNA agreement, it was agreed that the Compact Civic Advisory Panel would be reformed to propose the most appropriate model for civic engagement on specific issues. <\/p>  <p>The Government also continues to support the establishment of the North South Consultative Forum, as provided for under Strand Two of the GFA, and has worked to move the issue forward, submitting proposals to the Northern Ireland Executive for its consideration. We have also raised the issue at successive plenary meetings of the North South Ministerial Council.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021090900024#WRW01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Expenditure","counter":1245,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021090900024#WRW01100"},{"type":"question","counter":1246,"qnumday":426,"qnumall":"[42106\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021090900024#WRW01200","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the total amount of funding provided to date through his Department to UNESCO for its programme on comprehensive sexuality education; the countries in Africa that have been and will be supported by such funding; his plans to continue funding this UNESCO programme into the future and if so,  the amounts to be allocated; if his attention has been drawn to the actual content of the programme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1592","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":1247,"content":"<p>My Department has supported the UNESCO programme, Our Rights, Our Lives, Our Future (O3) since 2017, providing &euro;1,850,000 in funding to-date.

At an\u00a0emergency meeting of the Council on Afghanistan on 16 August, Ireland reiterated earlier calls on the Taliban to end its violent campaign, called for compliance with international humanitarian and human rights law and the protection of civilians, and highlighted the situation of women and girls in Afghanistan. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland worked intensively with other Council members on the adoption of Security Council Resolution 2593\/21 on 30 August. That Resolution strongly condemned the Kabul Airport attacks on 26 August, reaffirmed the importance of human rights, humanitarian assistance, and the need to allow safe passage. Language proposed by Ireland on the importance of ensuring the full, equal and meaningful participation of women in a negotiated political settlement is a key part of that Resolution and its adoption by the Council has sent a clear and united message to the Taliban.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  I will also be chairing a meeting of the Council on Afghanistan on 9 September. A key issue at that meeting will be the future role of the UN\u00a0Assistance Mission and how it can contribute to supporting the people of Afghanistan, ensuring humanitarian access, and protecting the rights of Afghan women and girls to education, healthcare, and participation in public life.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  I also participated in detailed discussions on Afghanistan with EU Foreign Ministers and EU Defence Ministers at our informal meetings in Slovenia on 2-3 September.\u00a0 EU Ministers agreed that engagement with any future Afghan government will be conditional on criteria including a peaceful and inclusive political settlement and respect for fundamental rights of all Afghans, particularly women and girls, and minorities. EU Council Conclusions outlining this position in more detail are likely to be adopted in the coming week.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  At national level, on 16 August I announced, with the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth and the Minister for Justice, that places would be allocated immediately to vulnerable Afghan nationals under the Refugee Protection Programme.

The most recent guidance for the education sector was published by the HSE in July 2021 and authored by the Civil Service Chief Medical Officer, Institute of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Public Health Medicine in HSE and Medmark Occupational Healthcare.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  As with all other guidelines around public health measures, my Department has been led by expert medical advice provided by the Government through the HSE and other relevant public bodies. The HSE Guidance for the education sector published in July 2021 represents the latest available advice.<\/p>  <p>On 30th   June, 2021, where the Occupational Health Service (OHS) i.e. Medmark categorised a teacher or SNA as &lsquo;Very High Risk&rsquo; at any time before or during the 2020\/21 school year, their &lsquo;COVID-19 Health Risk Categorisation Report&rsquo; expired on that date. For the 2021\/22 school year, having considered the HSE advice, the HSE Guidance for the education sector and information available on the OHS website, a teacher or SNA who believes they are at very high risk of serious illness from contracting COVID-19, must complete the online OHS COVID-19 Risk Assessment Questionnaire and submit it to the OHS.<\/p>  <p>  The COVID-19 health risk categorisation assessments are performed by a team of qualified and experienced specialists in occupational medicine. Available medical evidence, including reports from treating consultants as well as vaccination status of employees, are considered during the OHS COVID-19 health risk categorisation assessment process.<\/p>  <p>  A teacher or SNA who has been categorised by the OHS and considers that the OHS &lsquo;COVID-19 Health Risk Categorisation Report&rsquo; places them in an incorrect risk category, may request a review. The OHS will re-evaluate the medical evidence provided. The teacher or SNA may provide additional medical evidence as part of the review process. In a situation where the review outcome is that the COVID-19 health risk categorisation remains the same, a further review will only be undertaken, where additional medical evidence indicates there has been a change in the teacher or SNA&rsquo;s medical status or where there is a change in the HSE guidelines for the &lsquo;high risk&rsquo; group.<\/p>  <p>  As knowledge of COVID-19 has increased, some medical conditions that previously placed a teacher or SNA in the &lsquo;High Risk&rsquo; group now places them in the &lsquo;Normal Risk&rsquo; group. A teacher or SNA in the &lsquo;High Risk&rsquo; or Normal Risk&rsquo; group can attend the workplace where the school is implementing the COVID-19 Response Plan and the public health advice for schools. Where a teacher or SNA has been categorised as &lsquo;Very High Risk&rsquo; by the OHS, they will be facilitated to work from home.<\/p>  <p>  The COVID-19 Response Plan is designed to support employers and employees in putting measures in place that aim to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in the school environment.

published on 14th May, 2021 incorporates the current advice on Public Health measures and sets out the procedures required in  workplaces to prevent the spread of COVID-19. All employers are required to have an up to date COVID-19 Response Plan in place. The COVID-19 Response Plan details the policies and practices necessary for a school to implement the Government&rsquo;s &lsquo;Work Safely Protocol&rsquo;, so as to prevent the introduction and spread of COVID-19 in the school environment. The plan outlines the arrangements in place to ensure a safe workplace for all employees. There is an obligation on the employer to discuss the school&rsquo;s COVID-19 Response Plan with employees and ensure that all appropriate risk mitigation measures are clearly in place for their protection.  The employer has obligations under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 2005 to ensure the safety and welfare of staff at work. It is the duty of the employer to carry out a risk assessment to meet these obligations, including workplace pregnancy risk assessments.  The employer should also review existing risk assessments to consider any new risks that arise due to the school&rsquo;s COVID-19 Response Plan. <\/p>  <p>  The evidence available from the operation of schools during COVID-19 to date, shows that schools are low risk environments due to the infection prevention and control measures in place. My Department has been guided by Public Health as to the mitigation measures needed to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in our schools. Public Health has stated that the new variants of the disease do not change the infection prevention and control measures required in schools. The aim of all of the COVID-19 infection prevention and control measures that have been put in place for schools is to support schools to operate safely and prevent the introduction of COVID-19 and also the onward transmission of COVID-19 among the school community. These measures protect pupils, their parents and school staff and are very effective when adhered to. The provision of CO2 monitors for every school will also be an important tool in keeping our schools safe and in addition to the mitigation measures already in place, our staff and students can be confident of returning to safe environments in our schools. As has been the case throughout the pandemic, the reopening of schools for the 2021\/22 school year, will be carried out in close consultation with Public Health and the Education Partners.<\/p>  <p>  In February this year, my Department requested that medical specialists thoroughly assess and recommend guidelines for &lsquo;Very High Risk&rsquo; and also pregnant employees working in the education sector. At that time, my Department took a precautionary approach and instructed pregnant teachers and special needs assistants (SNAs) to work from home, pending the outcome of this review. The most recent guidance for the education sector was published by the HSE in July 2021 and authored by the Civil Service Chief Medical Officer, Institute of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Public Health Medicine in HSE and Medmark Occupational Healthcare.  <\/p>  <p>  In the particular case of advice around pregnant employees, this advice was prepared in consultation with the Institute of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, the national professional and training body for Obstetrics and Gynaecology in Ireland, as well as other medical and public health professionals.  <\/p>  <p>  The HSE guidance for the education sector confirm that pregnant teachers and SNAs can safely attend the workplace in school where all the infection prevention and control measures are in place by implementation of the School COVID-19 Response Plan. This is the case whether or not the pregnant teacher or SNA has been vaccinated. However, all pregnant teachers and SNAs should apply to the Occupational Health Service (OHS) before the end of their first trimester, so that their individual medical circumstances can be assessed in the context of COVID-19. Those with underlying medical conditions may be categorised as &lsquo;Very High Risk&rsquo; and be facilitated to work remotely i.e. work from home. For a pregnant teacher or SNA, from 14 weeks gestation and categorised as &lsquo;High Risk&rsquo; by the OHS who works in a special education setting, she may in certain circumstances be exposed to a higher risk of contracting COVID-19 and may be facilitated to work outside of the special education classroom.<\/p>  <p>  It is of course open to a pregnant teacher or SNA to discuss their individual medical concerns with their own medical team.  Where their treating consultant has concerns over their fitness to work due to a pregnancy-related illness, then the terms and conditions of the Sick Leave Scheme (pregnancy related illness provisions) may apply, outside of the very specific COVID-19 health risk categorisation assessment by the OHS referred to above. <\/p>  <p>  The COVID-19 health risk categorisation assessments are performed by a team of qualified and experienced specialists in occupational medicine. Available medical evidence, including reports from treating consultants as well as vaccination status of employees, are considered during the OHS COVID-19 health risk categorisation assessment process. <\/p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s Circular Letter 0042\/2021 details the current working arrangements and leave arrangements during the COVID-19 pandemic for teachers and SNAs employed in recognised primary and post primary schools. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021090900027#WRZ06700","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1436,"content":"<p>Question No. 499 answered with Question No. 498.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1437,"content":"<p>Question No. 500 answered with Question No. 498.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1439,"content":"<p>Question No. 501 answered with Question No. 498.<\/p>"},{"type":"question","counter":1441,"qnumday":502,"qnumall":"[41569\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021090900028#WRAA00400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the number of CO2 monitors that have been delivered to schools and or will be delivered in time for the new term; the number that have been ordered; the locations from which the monitors have been ordered; the cost of same; the scientific basis on which the number granted to each school are calculated; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1585","askee":"1582"},{"type":"question","counter":1442,"qnumday":503,"qnumall":"[41570\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021090900028#WRAA00500","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the systems in place to ensure each school receives the CO2 monitors it needs automatically; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1585","askee":"1582"},{"type":"question","counter":1443,"qnumday":504,"qnumall":"[41571\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021090900028#WRAA00600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if each school in the State will get a delivery and installation of CO2 monitors sufficient to their need; if not, the reason; the discussions she has had with schools in relation to same; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1585","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":1444,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 502 to 504, inclusive, together.<\/p><p>Managing ventilation is just one of a suite of public health measures in place to keep our schools safe.<\/p><p>My Department\u00a0 updated its guidance for schools on Practical Steps for the Deployment of Good Ventilation Practices in Schools.

My Department&rsquo;s Wellbeing Policy and Framework for practice has given recognition to the importance of promoting wellbeing in education.\u00a0 It outlines a comprehensive, whole-school approach to the promotion of wellbeing and positive mental health. It focuses on the whole school community, as well as groups and individual young people with identified needs.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) of my Department provides a comprehensive, school-based psychological service to all primary and post primary schools through the application of psychological theory and practice to support the wellbeing, academic, social and emotional development of all learners. NEPS also provides training to schools in programmes to reduce anxiety and promote coping and resilience in children and young people.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The curriculum plays an important role in teaching students about managing their wellbeing. All students commencing Junior Cycle from September 2017 onwards undertake the area of learning called Wellbeing. Wellbeing crosses the three years of Junior Cycle and builds on substantial work already taking place in schools in support of students&rsquo; wellbeing. When planning a Wellbeing Programme schools should consider the NCCA developed short courses in PE, SPHE, and CSPE. <\/p>  <p>  In Junior Cycle, six indicators&ndash;Active, Responsible, Connected, Resilient, Respected and Aware&ndash; have been identified as central to students&rsquo; wellbeing. Learning in SPHE provides learning opportunities designed to enhance each of these indicators thereby contributing significantly to the school&rsquo;s Wellbeing programme in Junior Cycle.<\/p>  <p>  In particular the SPHE short course Strand 4: My Mental Health focuses on building positive mental health, examining young people&rsquo;s experience of mental ill health and learning how to support themselves and others in challenging times. These are the result of widespread consultation with education partners to ensure that the courses address important, relevant and meaningful learning for young people in these subjects. Wellbeing is one of the principles that underpins Junior Cycle education and is reflected in a number of the statements of learning that are central to planning for the student&rsquo;s experience of and the evaluation of the school's Junior Cycle programme. \u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021090900028#WRAA03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Examinations","counter":1470,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021090900028#WRAA03300"},{"type":"question","counter":1471,"qnumday":514,"qnumall":"[41731\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021090900028#WRAA03400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"her views on correspondence (details supplied) regarding the leaving certificate in 2022; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1581","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":1472,"content":"<p>I am conscious that students who are due to take their Leaving Certificate examinations in 2022 have experienced a degree of disruption to their learning.<\/p>  <p>  On 30 June, the Advisory Group on Planning for State Examinations received an update in relation to the 2022 Leaving Certificate and Junior Cycle examinations. Following this, I announced that adjustments would be made to the 2022 examinations which are similar to those published in December 2020 in respect of Leaving Certificate 2021. <\/p>  <p>  The adjustments are outlined in Assessment Arrangements for Junior and Leaving Certificate 2022, which is available on www.gov.ie\/leavingcertificate. <\/p>  <p>  These adjustments will leave intact the familiar overall structure of the examinations, while incorporating additional choice for students in the examinations.<\/p>  <p>  The adjustments provide greater choice for candidates across a wide range of subjects. For example, in Leaving Certificate Biology, candidates in 2022 will be required to answer to answer five out of seven short questions in Section A, whereas previously five out of six such questions had to be answered.<\/p>  <p>  In a smaller number of subjects, e.g. Leaving Certificate Mathematics, Technology and Computer Science, candidates will be required to answer a reduced number of questions on the paper, but no change will be made to the examination duration.<\/p>  <p>  A summary advice note setting out the key curriculum and assessment arrangements for Leaving Certificate Applied Year 1 and Year 2 students in the 2021\/22 school year has also been published and is also available on www.gov.ie\/leavingcertificate. <\/p>  <p>  \u00a0The system of Calculated Grades which operated for Leaving Certificate 2020 was intended to be a once-off event in 2020 given the sudden and very challenging position at that time and the impossibility of running examinations in their traditional form safely.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  A decision was made by Government in February 2021 to offer a system of Accredited Grades to this year&rsquo;s Leaving Certificate students.\u00a0 The rationale for this was that, given the levels of disruption to learning experienced by current Leaving Certificate students during two significant and prolonged periods during their Senior Cycle education, it would have been unfair and unjust to require such students to sit traditional Leaving Certificate Examinations without offering an alternative or parallel process.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  While schools were closed as a result of Covid-19 from January 2021, a programme of remote learning was provided to all students. Students who were in fifth year were also prioritised for a return to school following the return of sixth year students. <\/p>  <p>  It is hoped that incoming sixth year students will be able to complete a full year of in-school tuition when they return to school at the start of the 2021\/22 school year, and will experience no further disruption to their learning as a result of Covid-19.<\/p>  <p>  It was also announced, on 30 June that the State Examinations Commission (SEC) will run an alternative set of Leaving Certificate Examinations in 2022, shortly following the main set of examinations.\u00a0 The SEC will set out the eligibility conditions for these examinations, which will be limited to certain students who are unable to sit the main set of examinations due to close family bereavement, COVID-19 illness during those examinations, and certain other categories of serious illness, to be clearly and strictly delineated.\u00a0 \u00a0 The SEC will issue further details regarding these examinations, with all arrangements guided by prevailing public health advice. There will also be further engagement with stakeholders in this matter.<\/p>  <p>  All schools have an additional allocation of Special Education Teaching (SET) hours that are specifically used to support the identified additional and special educational needs of students.\u00a0 The decisions made by senior management in the use of those hours should be underpinned by the principles laid out in the NEPS Continuum of Support, ensuring that the students with the greatest level of need receive the greatest level of support.\u00a0 \u00a0Senior leadership have autonomy to use SET hours in response to both identified and emerging needs of students.\u00a0 Following these principles schools can make responsive changes in provision for students with special educational needs that incorporate a variety of teaching approaches including, but not restricted to, for example; co-teaching, time bound small group withdrawal and intensive one to one support.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The Guidance and SEN departments in schools are also best placed to support students and families in applications for reasonable accommodations during state examinations (RACE).\u00a0 The RACE scheme is operated by the State Examinations Commission.

It is important that the school management authority requests parents to ensure that the school is made aware of any medical condition suffered by any pupils attending. Where the school is aware of potential difficulties that may arise as a consequence of a medical condition suffered by one or more pupils, it may be possible for the management authorities, working in conjunction with parents, teachers and children to put preventative measures in place to lessen the possibility of any difficulties arising or to ensure that, if a pupil suffers from an illness requiring, for example, the administration of medication, that appropriate treatment is available.<\/p>  <p>  The administration of medicines in primary schools is the subject of an agreement between the Irish National Teachers Organisation and the organisation representing school management at primary level. While this agreement specifies that no teacher can be required to administer medicine or drugs to pupils, it also sets out procedures that must be followed where a teacher or teachers agree to do so. The position is that either the parents of the child should make themselves available to administer medication as required, or where they wish the staff in the school to administer it, they should indemnify the school.<\/p>  <p>  My Department cannot direct any member of the Board of Management or the teaching staff of the school to administer medical treatment to pupils, action and procedures which are normally carried out by medical professionals such as doctors and nurses. <\/p>  <p>  Where a child requires adult assistance to assist in the administration of medicine and where the extent of assistance required would overly disrupt normal teaching time, SNA support may be allocated for this purpose.<\/p>  <p>  It is a matter for the Board of Management to ensure that SNAs are in a position to effectively meet the care needs of pupils for whom SNA support has been allocated in the school, when appointing an SNA. <\/p>  <p>  Where specific training is required, the Board of Management should liaise with the Health Service Executive (HSE) in order to ensure that the HSE provides guidance and training that enables the SNA to meet the care needs of the pupil in an appropriate manner.

The Expert Group recommended that the report be read in conjunction with advice issued by the Department of Education Practical Steps for the Deployment of Good Ventilation Practices in Schools. The Expert Sub Group report formed the basis for the most recent updating of the ventilation guidance for schools and included recommendations in relation to strengthening the message about the importance of good ventilation, the use of CO2 monitors and, where considered necessary, air cleaners. To support schools further to identify rooms which may have inadequate ventilation and to optimise comfort levels through a better understanding of the degree of window opening required in rooms, the Department have arranged for the provision to schools of a number of portable units (based on the size of each school). The use of CO2 monitors can provide a useful general indication that areas\/rooms within a building may not be adequately ventilated and can enable occupants to become familiar with the impact that activities, outdoor weather and window openings have on levels of good ventilation within a room. This information can be used to inform strategies for improving ventilation and in that regard my Department has funded the provision of over 35,000 portable CO2 monitors for schools at an estimated overall cost of circa &euro;4 million. The portable units can facilitate measurements in a wide range of locations in schools.<\/p><p>The use of CO2 monitors can provide a useful general indication that areas\/rooms within a building may not be adequately ventilated and can enable occupants to become familiar with the impact that activities, outdoor weather and window openings have on levels of good ventilation within a room.

The group was originally established to consider contingency arrangements for the 2020 Leaving Certificate and was reconstituted for the purposes of planning for the 2021 Leaving Certificate. The group includes representatives of students (Irish Second Level Students Union), parents (National Parents Councils), teachers (TUI and ASTI), school leadership and management bodies, the State Examinations Commission (SEC), the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science and the Department of Education, including the National Educational Psychological Service.<\/p>  <p>  In meetings held in April and May, this group discussed the Leaving Certificate 2022 examinations. <\/p>  <p>  On 30 June, the Advisory Group on Planning for State Examinations received an update in relation to the 2022 Leaving Certificate and Junior Cycle examinations. <\/p>  <p>  Following this meeting, I announced that adjustments would be made to the 2022 examinations which are similar to those published in December 2020 in respect of Leaving Certificate 2021. <\/p>  <p>  The adjustments are outlined in Assessment Arrangements for Junior and Leaving Certificate 2022, which is available on www.gov.ie\/leavingcertificate. <\/p>  <p>  These adjustments will leave intact the familiar overall structure of the examinations, while incorporating additional choice for students in the examinations.<\/p>  <p>  The adjustments provide greater choice for candidates across a wide range of subjects.<\/p>  <p>  A summary advice note setting out the key curriculum and assessment arrangements for Leaving Certificate Applied Year 1 and Year 2 students in the 2021\/22 school year has also been published and is also available on www.gov.ie\/leavingcertificate. <\/p>  <p>   The system of Calculated Grades which operated for Leaving Certificate 2020 was intended to be a once-off event in 2020 given the sudden and very challenging position at that time and the impossibility of running examinations in their traditional form safely.  <\/p>  <p>  A decision was made by Government in February 2021 to offer a system of Accredited Grades to this year&rsquo;s Leaving Certificate students.  The rationale for this was that, given the levels of disruption to learning experienced by current Leaving Certificate students during two significant and prolonged periods during their Senior Cycle education, it would have been unfair and unjust to require such students to sit traditional Leaving Certificate Examinations without offering an alternative or parallel process.  <\/p>  <p>  While schools were closed as a result of Covid-19 from January 2021, a programme of remote learning was provided to all students.

Their proposal is that a new boiler should be installed on its property and that the Department of Education should pay the full cost of this.  <\/p><p>The Deputy will appreciate that while my Department is willing to make reasonable accommodations in respect of the vent, my Department does not accept that it should carry the full cost of a new boiler house for the neighbour. <\/p><p>The Design Team is currently working on the completion of the Stage 2(b) report, for the school building project, which upon completion will be submitted to the Department for review.<\/p><p>My Department issued correspondence to the neighbour via their solicitor outlining that the proposal for a new boiler house is not acceptable as it goes much further than dealing with the issue of the air vent and requesting that they revert to the Department by 10<sup>th<\/sup>September with proposals in respect of vent issue only, which the Department will ask its Design Team to review and if necessary convene a meeting.  In tandem my Department asked the School&rsquo;s design team to also explore any other options in respect of the vent. The neighbour has recently reverted in correspondence via their solicitor seeking a meeting between both parties Design Teams to endeavour to find a workable solution. My Department is liaising with the School's Design Team to arrange this meeting in the near future. <\/p><p>The school building project has been delayed by both the right of way and the resolution of the vent issues. My Department has been in continuous engagement with the neighbouring property with a view to progressing the school building project. As the Deputy will appreciate the school building project will provide a new 16 Classroom School  and my Department is committed to progressing this project as quickly as possible.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021090900031#WRDD00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1601,"content":"<p>Question No. 563 answered with Question No. 562.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Transport","counter":1602,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021090900031#WRDD01000"},{"type":"question","counter":1603,"qnumday":564,"qnumall":"[42352\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021090900031#WRDD01100","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the estimated number of students who will not receive bus tickets due to no payment or medical card received before the deadline date, late application made after the deadline date or because the application numbers exceeded the number of seats available on the bus in the coming months; and the breakdown on these estimated figures by county.","asker":"1504","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":1604,"content":"<p>The School Transport Scheme is a significant operation managed by Bus &Eacute;ireann on behalf of the Department.

Any concern or allegation of a child protection nature, received by staff in my Department is dealt with in accordance with the Department&rsquo;s Procedures for responding to Child Protection Concerns which come to the attention of staff employed by the Department of Education. \u00a0<\/p><p>My Department has no powers to investigate child protection concerns. Under these procedures the Department does not make any judgment on the concerns which comes to its attention and ensures that the details of the concern reported to the Department are immediately passed on to the relevant authorities, i.e. Tusla-the Child and Family Agency and\/or An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as appropriate. My Department cannot guarantee confidentiality to complainants in such circumstances as the information received must be passed on to the relevant authorities for investigation, including any details of the person reporting the concern.<\/p><p>In that regard, details provided by the Deputy with this question have been passed to Tusla.  <b><\/b><\/p><p>The issuing, by my Department of revised Child Protection Procedures for Primary and Post-primary Schools in 2017 brought with it an extensive programme of professional development for teachers and school leaders. A fundamental principle of the Child Protection Procedures for Primary and Post-Primary Schools 2017 is that all schools must keep pupils\/students safe from harm while attending the school or while participating in school activities. <\/p><p>My Department plays an important role in the oversight of the child protection procedures for schools. The Inspectorate carries out a range of inspections in all recognised schools. Schools are selected for inclusion in the broader inspection programme using a range of factors and information. Although the Inspectorate has no role in the investigation of individual complaints about schools,\u00a0all correspondence is noted and it may, together with a range of other information, be considered by the Inspectorate in planning its inspection programme. The Inspectorate does not comment on its future planned inspection programme.<\/p><p>The child protection procedures for primary and post primary schools outline the obligations placed on boards of management, as employers, where an allegation of abuse is made against a member of school personnel. Chapter 7 of the procedures provides specific guidance to schools in relation to the reporting procedures for the concern as well as the protocols in relation to dealing with the employee. In a school context, the most important consideration to be taken into account is the protection of children, and their safety and well-being must be the priority. Each school authority also has a duty and responsibility, as an employer, in respect of its employees. \u00a0<\/p><p>Under the provisions of the Education Act 1998, the board of management is the body charged with the direct governance of a school. Section 24 of the Education Act 1998 provides that the appointment, suspension and dismissal of teachers is the responsibility of boards of management of recognised schools or, where the employer is a person other than a board, by that person. My Department does not have the legal powers to instruct a school to follow a particular course of action regarding individual complaint cases, or to investigate individual complaints. However, procedures have been agreed between management and unions and have been published by my Department to assist Boards of Management\/Schools. <\/p><p>In relation to how a parent might pursue a complaint to a school, whereas my Department provides funding and policy direction for schools, my Department, does not have the power to instruct schools to follow a particular course of direction with regard to individual complaint cases. \u00a0My Department's role is to clarify for parents and students how their grievances and complaints against schools can be progressed. <\/p><p>Where it is felt that there is cause for complaint, matters would normally be addressed to the individual teacher or school Principal as appropriate.\u00a0 If matters cannot be resolved at that level then a complaint can be addressed to the school&rsquo;s Board of Management.\u00a0 Where a school has a formal complaints procedure in place this should be followed in pursuing any complaint.<\/p><p>In addition responsibility for bullying in schools falls to the level of the individual school. \u00a0Each school has an Anti-Bullying Policy and Code of Behaviour (or similar titles) and these are ordinarily accessible on the schools website or should be available from the school.<\/p><p>Where a parent is of the view that a school's board of management has failed to investigate or adequately investigate their complaint, it is open to the parent to raise the matter with the Ombudsman for Children. The Office of the Ombudsman for Children may independently investigate complaints about schools recognised by my Department, provided the parent has firstly and fully followed the school's complaints procedures. The key criterion for any intervention by the Ombudsman for Children is that the administrative actions or non-actions of a school has, or, may have, adversely affected the child. \u00a0<\/p><p>The Teaching Council of Ireland also has power to investigate a complaint about a teacher and to conduct fitness to teach inquiries.\u00a0 Any person, including a member of the public, an employer or teacher may make a complaint about a registered teacher.The Teaching Council has a complaints facility that can be accessed in appropriate cases.

The purpose of this payment is to assist these households with their energy costs.  The allowance represents a contribution towards the energy costs of a household.  It is not intended to meet those costs in full.  Only one allowance is paid per household.<\/p>  <p>  The Fuel Allowance is an important measure that assists pensioners and other welfare dependent householders to address income deficiency, especially during the winter when a household faces increased heating needs.  The duration of the scheme is designed to coincide with the coldest periods of the year and it is for this reason the scheme runs from October to mid-April. <\/p>  <p>  In Budget 2021, the Government targeted one third of carbon tax revenues to go towards boosting the incomes of the poorest in our society.  Based on ESRI research, three key DSP payments were targeted for increases in the budget as a result - the Fuel Allowance, the Qualified Child Allowance and the Living Alone Allowance.

There is no automatic entitlement to a payment.

These include road, rail and ferry services provided by companies such as Bus &Aacute;tha Cliath, Bus &Eacute;ireann and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, as well as Luas and services provided by over 80 private transport operators.  There are currently approx. 1,005,000 customers with direct eligibility.  The estimated expenditure on free travel in 2021 is &euro;95 million.<\/p>  <p>  In general, access to a free travel pass for those aged under 66 is linked to a person being in receipt of certain primary Social Protection payments such as Disability Allowance, Invalidity Pension, Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, Blind Pension and Partial Capacity Benefit. <\/p>  <p>  While I am aware of the campaign by Epilepsy Ireland, extending the free travel scheme to people with epilepsy during the period in which they are disallowed from driving cannot be considered in isolation.  There are a range of disabilities and medical conditions that can prevent a person from holding a driving licence and to award a free travel pass to a person with any one of these conditions in isolation would immediately result in calls for all people who are not allowed to hold a driving licence because of their medical condition to receive the free travel pass and could result in challenges under the Equal Status Act.<\/p>  <p>  If the Free Travel scheme were to be extended to all people who are not allowed to drive due to their disability, regardless of whether they receive a qualifying payment, a medical assessment process would be required for all such applications, significantly changing the nature of the scheme and requiring additional administrative processes to be put in place in order to adjudicate eligibility.  Significant extra funding would also be required and, accordingly, it could only be considered in the context of overall budgetary negotiations. <\/p>  <p>  While consideration is always given to any requests to improve or extend eligibility to the free travel scheme, uncoupling the link between receipt of particular social welfare payments and eligibility for the free travel scheme would so fundamentally alter the scheme that it would move it away from being a social welfare measure to being a general transport initiative.  <\/p>  <p>  Under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme, my Department may award a travel supplement, where the circumstances of the particular case so warrant.  The supplement is intended to assist with ongoing or recurring travel costs that cannot be met from the client&rsquo;s own resources and are deemed to be necessary.

To this end, my Department will develop\u00a0a blended working policy based on the framework being developed by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and will aim to implement this policy in early 2022.<\/p><p>The position in relation to the relevant bodies under the aegis of my Department is as follows:<\/p><p>1.

As such, the yearly average, and banded payments, were used to calculate the rate of payment - otherwise people would have had to wait and contribute for a considerable number of years to achieve a reasonable pension payment in retirement.  The yearly average mechanism is set out in detail as part of the Operational Guidelines for State Pension Contributory published on the Department's web site at .<\/p><p>A policy to introduce the Total Contributions Approach (TCA) to pensions calculation was adopted by Government in the National Pensions Framework in 2010.  In January 2018 the Government agreed to a proposal that allowed pensioners affected by the September 2012 changes in rate bands to have their pension entitlement calculated by an interim &ldquo;Total Contributions Approach&rdquo; (TCA) which would include up to 20 years of a new HomeCaring credit.  This approach significantly benefited many people, particularly women, whose work history included an extended period of time outside the paid workplace, while raising families or in a caring role.  The interim TCA ensured that the totality of a person&rsquo;s social insurance contributions - as opposed to the timing of them - would determine their final pension outcome.<\/p><p>Those who reached state pension age after September 2012 had their pension entitlement reviewed under the interim TCA method with 56% of women reviewed receiving an increase while 24% of men reviewed also received an increase.  Those who have reached state pension age since January 2018 have had their pension entitlement assessed under yearly averaging and the interim TCA with the most beneficial payment being awarded to them.<\/p><p>As part of the Programme for Government, a Commission on Pensions was set up to look at sustainability and eligibility issues with the State Pension and the Social Insurance Fund.  More broadly, it has also been considering the issue of retirement ages in employment contracts and how the pension system can further accommodate carers, who are predominantly women.  The Commission will set out options for the Government to address issues such as qualifying age, contribution rates, total contributions and eligibility requirements.  The Commission formally submitted its report to me earlier this week. <\/p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021090900038#WRLL05300","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Community Employment Schemes","counter":2042,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021090900039#WRMM00200"},{"type":"question","counter":2043,"qnumday":721,"qnumall":"[42825\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021090900039#WRMM00300","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if a request to retain a person (details supplied) will be facilitated with particular reference to the fact that both employee and employer wish to maintain the status quo;

However, my Department is undertaking an extensive review of the Child Care Act 1991 and will examine foster care arrangements as part of this review. It will have regard to income support measures available to foster families generally.<\/p>  <p>  I acknowledge foster carers as the backbone of child care services. Foster care is the preferred option in Ireland for children who cannot live with their parents or guardians. Approximately 92% of children in care are looked after by foster carers. More than one quarter of these children are placed with relative foster carers.<\/p>  <p>  The foster care allowance is currently &euro;325 per week per child under 12 years of age and &euro;352 per week per child aged 12 years and over. This payment was protected during recent economic hardships and is tax-free. It is paid in respect of the child and provided in order to allow foster carers to meet all of the child's daily living needs, including food, clothing, basic travel, education costs and hobbies and sports activities. The allowance is not considered as means for social welfare purposes.<\/p>  <p>  Foster carers also receive a number of targeted supports to ensure they continue to function as a recognised and valued part of the alternative care system. Key elements of this support include a link social worker, access to training and support group meetings and the allocation of a social worker for each child in care. It is important that foster carers have access to specialist services to meet the child's identified needs. Respite care for children may be arranged if it is part of their care plan.<\/p>  <p>  Pre-assessment and ongoing training are compulsory for foster carers in order to equip them with the skills and knowledge to provide high quality care. Recognising the specific dynamics and the personal nature of relative care, Tusla addresses the training needs of relatives who are foster carers separately.

As a result, they are generally organised on a one-to-one or small group basis. <\/p>  <p>  A &euro;225m investment package was announced as part of the Government&rsquo;s National Recovery and Resilience Plan, which includes a significant skills package for upskilling and reskilling aimed at equipping workers whose jobs are unlikely to return, including a focus on digital skills transition and a new Green Skills Action programme at further education level.\u00a0 A research and innovation National Grand Challenges Programme has also been launched which will focus on the need for a transition to a climate neutral and clean economy as well as the challenges of digital transition.<\/p>  <p>  The Action Plan for Apprenticeship 2021-2025\u00a0launched on 19th April last sets out new ways of structuring, funding, and promoting apprenticeships to make apprenticeship accessible to employers and learners. The actions set out in the plan seek to deliver on a target of 10,000 apprenticeship registrations per annum by 2025. <\/p>  <p>  Government is committed under the Action Plan for Apprenticeship to working with employers to promote,\u00a0enable and support\u00a0the recruitment of apprentices.\u00a0 Measures to support employer engagement in apprenticeship across all sectors of the economy, particularly within the SME sector, will be integral to the delivery of the target of 10,000 new apprentice registrations per annum by 2025.\u00a0 These measures encompass\u00a0both financial and non-financial and will include an annual grant for employers not benefiting from the existing mechanism of State-funded craft apprentice training allowances for off-the-job training. This employer grant will be administered by the new National Apprenticeship Office (NAO) and the level of grant will be announced by year end. <\/p>  <p>  Green skills are the heart of the Government&rsquo;s post-Covid recovery and regeneration plans. Near Zero Energy Building (NZEB) and retrofit programmes are currently provided in Waterford Wexford ETB, Laois Offaly ETB and Mount Lucas National Construction Training Centre with work ongoing to establish a further three centres of excellence in Cork, Limerick Clare and Mayo Sligo Leitrim ETBs. <\/p>  <p>  At higher education level, in addition to core full time and part time programmes, funding is also provided under Springboard and the Human Capital Initiative for programmes which support the development of green skills, including professionals in areas such as Building Analysis and Climate Adaptation; Sustainable Building Technology and Retrofit, Conservation and Sustainability.\u00a0 \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Additional demand for skills to support the transformation to Low Carbon Economy are being identified through the ongoing EGFSN study &lsquo;Skills for the Low Carbon Economy&rsquo; which is due to be finalised in the coming period.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021090900043#WRQQ01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1493"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Grant Payments","counter":2258,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021090900043#WRQQ01400"},{"type":"question","counter":2259,"qnumday":795,"qnumall":"[41504\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021090900043#WRQQ01500","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the number of SUSI applications that were rejected on the basis that the pandemic unemployment payment brought their income over the threshold in each of the past 12 months.","asker":"1504","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","counter":2260,"content":"<p>The principal support provided by the Department in financial terms is the Student Grant Scheme.

All applications are assessed nationally with reference to the terms and conditions of the relevant student grant scheme. The terms and conditions of funding are applied impartially to all applicants.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Social Welfare (Covid-19) (Amendment) Act 2020 establishes the COVID-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment as a social insurance benefit scheme separate from other social protection statutory schemes including the Supplementary Welfare Allowance and Jobseeker Allowance and Jobseeker Benefit schemes. <\/p>  <p>  For student grant purposes the Covid-19 payment has been treated as reckonable income for the SUSI means assessment process since it was introduced in March 2020. This means that the Covid-19 payment is treated in a similar fashion to other Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection payments such as Jobseekers Benefit\/Allowance, thus ensuring a consistency of approach and an equitable treatment of students and their families in the SUSI means assessment process. <\/p>  <p>  However,\u00a0a very important\u00a0feature of the scheme that I would point\u00a0to is the change of circumstances provision. If a student or party to their application experiences a change in circumstances that is not a temporary change and is likely to continue for the foreseeable future, they can apply to SUSI to have their application assessed under the change in circumstances provision of the relevant Student Grant Scheme. The income of all parties to the application will be assessed or reassessed on current income and applicants may also be asked to provide evidence of same. <\/p>  <p>  Such\u00a0a change in circumstances would clearly include no longer being in receipt of a pandemic unemployment payment. Students will no longer receive the PUP from early September, in line with normal circumstances where students do not qualify for unemployment payments while at college.<\/p>  <p>  An\u00a0applicant\u00a0can request a review by contacting the SUSI Support Desk at 0761 087 874 or emailing\u00a0support@susi.ie.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The change of circumstances\u00a0provision is a well-established procedure and\u00a0it can also operate\u00a0at scale.\u00a0 For example,\u00a0over 10,000 applicants declared a change of circumstance in the 2020\/21 academic year and some 40% of these applications related to COVID-19. I am\u00a0confident that the application of this provision will continue to allow the scheme to be flexible and responsive to people's circumstances.<\/p>  <p>  Any student who believes his\/her student grant application has been assessed incorrectly may also avail of the opportunities to appeal to SUSI and subsequently to the independent Student Grants Appeals Board.<\/p>  <p>  Apart from the Student Grant Scheme, students in third-level institutions experiencing exceptional financial need can apply for support under the Student Assistance Fund. This Fund assists students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances. Details of this fund are available from the Access Office in the third level institution attended.

They comprise of a standard seven phase programme of alternating on-the-job and off-the-job phases.  The off-the-job training for these programmes is delivered in Training Centres, Institutes of Technology and Technological Universities. Given the practical nature of off-the-job training for craft apprentices, the shutdown of on-site learning activity in 2020 and 2021 had a significant impact on the ability of craft apprentices to progress through their course. <\/p>  <p>  In addition to the general activity surrounding a return to on-site learning across the further and higher education sector a number of specific actions were put in place to support craft apprentices to progress in their training in a timely manner:- <\/p>  <p>  - Craft apprentices were prioritised for a return to on-site learning on 8 March 2021.  <\/p>  <p>  - Delivery of off-the-job phases continued over the summer, subject to public health advice and with restricted numbers. This approach assisted institutions and providers in preparing and organising the safe return of larger numbers in the autumn.  <\/p>  <p>  - &euro;20m in capital funding has been provided to increase training capacity in the system with SOLAS and HEA allocating this to ETBs and HEIs. This will facilitate an additional 4,000 craft apprenticeship places, assisting significantly with the immediate backlog issues but also more broadly increase training capacity in the apprenticeship system as the sector caters for higher demand. <\/p>  <p>  - An additional &euro;12 million was allocated for 2021 to support additional classes and teaching capacity to ameliorate COVID-19 measures at higher education level (Phases 4 and 6). <\/p>  <p>  - A three-step plan to tackle the backlog in craft apprenticeship off-the-job training over the coming period by SOLAS and further and higher education providers is well developed. Step 1 of the plan includes an increase in the number of training workshops available across further and higher education from September 2021 onwards. Steps 2 and 3 involve tailored emergency approaches to accelerate the throughput of apprentices at Phases 2 and 6 for a designated period of time.<\/p>  <p>  - Phase 2 apprentice commence off-the-job training throughout the year. SOLAS are engaging with the ETBs to maximise and expand provision to clear the waiting lists for phase 2 training.<\/p>  <p>  - Phase 4 and 6 intakes are currently scheduled three time per year &ndash; September, January and April.

The Commission took the view that unreasonable interference caused by high trees or hedges was a matter in any particular case for tort law or more generally for planning or environmental law. <\/p>  <p>  Under our existing law, a person may be in a position to seek damages or an injunction requiring the cutting of boundary hedges or trees under the tort of nuisance.

Government policy restricts the availability of all hazardous fireworks to the general public. Licences under the Explosives Act are issued by\u00a0my Department only for the importation of fireworks which are to be used in organised displays conducted by professional and competent operators.<\/p>  <p>  Part 6 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006 gives An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na the power to make arrests in relation to the possession of unlicensed fireworks. An example of the penalties faced include a fine of up to &euro;10,000 and up to five years imprisonment if convicted of having fireworks in your possession with intent to sell or supply. Igniting fireworks or throwing an ignited firework at a person or property is also liable to the same severe penalty. These penalties demonstrate the seriousness attached to breaches of the legislation governing the importation and use of fireworks.<\/p>  <p>  I am aware of the distressing impact the improper use of fireworks has on our communities and\u00a0I share the concerns of the Deputies and of the\u00a0local communities affected. I know the fear and distress fireworks being set off\u00a0causes our elderly family members and neighbours and people with\u00a0sensory\u00a0challenges and other vulnerabilities. They also have a terrible impact\u00a0on pets and other animals and livestock. <\/p>  <p>  That is why every year as Halloween approaches, my Department runs a safety campaign aimed at ensuring the public is aware of the dangers of illegal fireworks and bonfires. Taking into account the issues arising and highlighted to me\u00a0last year, my officials are currently collaborating with a number of relevant bodies such as An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Dublin Fire Brigade, the Irish Society for the Prevent of Cruelty to Animals, as well as the local authorities around the country in order to ensure that our messaging for this year is clear, impactful and ready to be launched and rolled out before the end of this month. As always, this messaging will continue to be pushed out across a number of mediums including social media on a regular basis until early November. <\/p>  <p>  In addition to the awareness raising work undertaken by my Department in the run up to Halloween, additional efforts are made by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at this time of year to combat the illegal importation, sale and use of fireworks, which is known as Operation Tombola.<\/p>  <p>  Operation Tombola also focuses on preventing associated public disorder and anti-social behaviour through the incremental deployment of resources, including Garda Public Order Units to augment local plans as appropriate. The Garda Commissioner has informed me that under Operation Tombola, Assistant Commissioner (DMR) has already issued an instruction to each Chief Superintendent in the DMR\u00a0to put in place appropriate measures to prevent and detect the organised importation for sale of fireworks in the lead up to Halloween, 2021. <\/p>  <p>  The Assistant Commissioner (DMR) has\u00a0tasked each Chief Superintendent in the DMR to examine their policing requirements for the Halloween period and to effectively resource and implement their policing plans for this period.\u00a0 \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  I understand that each Chief Superintendent in the\u00a0DMR is in the process of engaging with relevant stakeholders including the\u00a0local authorities to identify, coordinate and implement an appropriate\u00a0multi-agency strategy for the Halloween period, as part of their policing plans and that the Assistant Commissioner (DMR)\u00a0has tasked Detective Superintendent, DMR Coordination and Tasking Unit, with ensuring open social\u00a0media is monitored for any information in connection with anti-social\u00a0behaviour and fireworks that may inform local Garda operations and\u00a0initiatives.\u00a0 \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the above measures, the Garda National Community Engagement Bureau have also developed a Halloween safety advice presentation that is aimed at parents\/guardians, and which is available for Garda&iacute; to use as part of the Community Policing Toolkit when engaging with community groups or watch schemes. This places emphasis on tips for safety around bonfires and fireworks, emphasising the illegality of the latter and explaining the distress that Halloween can cause to animals and the elderly. <\/p>  <p>  A revised primary schools programme has also been developed focussing on these areas and emphasises\u00a0that it is the job of the Garda&iacute; to keep children safe. Where it is not possible to deliver these presentations in person, an alternative proposes to use a safety video produced in partnership with Dublin Fire Brigade and Temple Street Children&rsquo;s Hospital, which informs children of the law in relation to fireworks and the dangers associated with them. It also provides fire safety advice and, with the help of the Garda Dogs Unit, it addresses the distress experienced by animals. Supporting posters and social media material are also available for download from the Community Policing Toolkit.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, I\u00a0believe that it is important to state that in addition to Part 6 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006 referenced above, there are a\u00a0number of strong legislative provisions available to Garda&iacute; to combat anti-social behaviour more generally which\u00a0include &ndash;<\/p>  <p>  - the Criminal Damage Act 1991;<\/p>  <p>  - Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994;<\/p>  <p>  - the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 2003; and<\/p>  <p>  - the Intoxicating Liquor Acts 2003 and 2008.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021090900049#WRWW02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Legislative Process","counter":2620,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021090900049#WRWW02200"},{"type":"question","counter":2621,"qnumday":917,"qnumall":"[42529\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021090900049#WRWW02300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"when the sex offenders (amendment) Bill will be published; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1603","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":2622,"content":"<p>The Sex Offenders (Amendment) Bill has completed\u00a0drafting and I intend to bring it to my Government colleagues for approval to publish in the coming weeks.<\/p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, the purpose of the Bill is to enhance current systems for the assessment and management of convicted sex offenders and to put those systems on a statutory footing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021090900049#WRWW02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1578"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Residency Permits","counter":2623,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021090900049#WRWW02500"},{"type":"question","counter":2624,"qnumday":918,"qnumall":"[42578\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021090900049#WRWW02600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the progress to date in the determination of an application for leave to remain in the case of a person (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":2625,"content":"<p>The immigration case of the person concerned was finalised on 29 October 2019.

Its work is supported by Divisional Drugs Units nationwide and by all Garda&iacute; working in local communities, while working closely with international law enforcement partners. <\/p><p>The National Drugs Strategy, &quot;Reducing Harm, Supporting Recovery - a health led response to drug and alcohol use in Ireland 2017-2025 &quot;, is unique among national drugs strategies across EU Member States in recognising the need to address drug-related debt intimidation at a community level.  <\/p><p>The Programme for Government, <i>Our Shared Future<\/i>, includes a commitment to support the Drug-Related Intimidation Reporting Programme. The programme, which was developed by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in partnership with the National Family Support Network (NFSN), responds to the needs of drug users and family members who may be subject to the threat of drug related intimidation, has been implemented on a national level since 2013. <\/p><p>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na regard drug-related intimidation as a hugely serious issue which impacts significantly on communities throughout Ireland. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na advise people to seek help and support from their local Garda&iacute;, even where a person has felt compelled to pay money to those who engage in drug related intimidation.<\/p><p>In dealing with any complaint of drug related intimidation, or advice sought in relation to this issue, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have the utmost regard to the safety and most effective means to afford the person or family subject to the threat the best level of security, advice and support. Confidentiality and security of the persons concerned are paramount for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na when dealing with reports under the programme.<\/p><p>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na deals with drug related intimidation in a confidential and secure manner. Insofar as possible, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na offers confidentiality and provides practical personal security and safety information and advice in relation to particular threats or instances of intimidation, along with information on appropriate drug support services for the individual in the family who is accruing drug debts, while also providing information regarding the process involved in making a formal complaint.  <\/p><p>The Deputy will also be aware of the new Youth Justice Strategy 2021-2027. This strategy includes a commitment to develop the work of the Garda Youth Diversion Projects (GYDPs) to include targeted work with &lsquo;harder-to-reach&rsquo; young people. This includes young people heavily involved in crime and anti-social behaviour, for whom there are little supports and interventions available in practice, unless they are before the courts, in which case they may be under the supervision of the Probation Service. The strategy also prioritises early intervention work, including with younger children who are assessed as being at serious risk. Both of these cohorts may include children at risk of recruitment by crime gangs.<\/p><p>The development of this work within the GYDP network will be supported by the Research Evidence into Policy, Programmes and Practice (REPPP) project at the School of Law in the University of Limerick (UL).  The REPPP project has led on the production of the &ldquo;Greentown Report&rdquo;, which studied the influence of criminal networks on children in Ireland, and was published in December 2016. The REPPP project is a strategic research partnership between UL and the Department of Justice. <\/p><p>The Greentown Report identifies crime networks as a separate and plausible risk factor underlying criminal offending by certain children. It outlines how the influence of criminal networks increases the level of offending by a small number of children and entraps them in offending situations.  <\/p><p>The Greentown Report recommended the design of a programme to include interventions with children and their families to help them withstand the influence of criminal networks. The REPPP project team implemented a bespoke process to produce a model for an Irish evidence-informed intervention programme. This new &ldquo;Greentown Programme&rdquo; has been designed with the input of leading international expertise on crime and criminal networks, together with Irish scientific, policy and practice expertise in child protection and welfare, drugs and community development. The programme is managed jointly between my Department, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the University of Limerick.<\/p><p>Pilot applications of the Greentown programme, developed by the REPPP project, commenced in two locations in 2020 and will run for three years. The learning from these pilots will then be incorporated into mainstream GYDP practice. This specially designed intervention programme was developed with international expert advice, to tackle coercive control of children by criminal groups which entraps them in offending situations. Funds are already available for the initial pilots from the Dormant Accounts Funds, with a total of &euro;4.2m allocated over three years.  <\/p><p>The implementation of the Greentown pilot programme is part of the strategic objectives of the Youth Justice Strategy 2021-2027. This implementation process began with the establishment of the Governance and Strategy Group, and the Youth Justice Oversight Group. Both groups are chaired by the Department of Justice, which will provide oversight arrangements for youth justice Initiatives, including the Greentown pilots, to ensure that there is a cohesive response in practice to the needs of particular cohorts of children and particular communities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021090900049#WRWW05100","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":2649,"content":"<p>Question No. 927 answered with Question No. 926.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Prison Service","counter":2650,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021090900049#WRWW05200"},{"type":"question","counter":2651,"qnumday":928,"qnumall":"[42632\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021090900049#WRWW05300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the situation regarding the calculation of pension entitlements for prison officers who joined the service since June 1995 and how their pension is integrated with the State social welfare pension; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1590","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":2652,"content":"<p>I am advised that the principal terms and conditions of employment with regard to revised salary scales and revised superannuation arrangements of Civil Servants hired between 6th April 1995 and 31st December 2012 are laid down in Department of Finance Circular 06\/1995: Revised social insurance status and conditions of service of certain civil servants.<\/p>  <p>  Civil Servants employed from January 2013 are members of what is known as the Single Scheme.

Should a nursing home be deemed to be non-compliant with the Regulations and the National Quality Standards, it may either fail to achieve or lose its registration status. In addition, the Chief Inspector has wide discretion in deciding whether to impose conditions of Registration on nursing homes.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Nursing Homes Expert Panel was established, on foot of a NPHET recommendation, to examine the complex issues surrounding the management of COVID-19 among this particularly vulnerable cohort. This Expert Panel report has added further to our knowledge and learning. This report clearly outlines the key protective measures that we must ensure are in place across our nursing homes. These actions are based on learning from our own and the international experience of COVID-19 to date. The report also recommends additional analysis and examination of the relevant public health and other data sets in order that further causal and protective factors for COVID-19 clusters are identified.  HIQA and the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) recently jointly published an &ldquo;Analysis of factors associated with outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 in nursing homes in Ireland&rdquo;, delivering on recommendation 6.7 of the Expert Panel report, to further the learning from the pandemic. Further data analysis work and learning will also continue, in line with other recommendations of the Expert Panel, although these have been affected by the recent cyberattack on the health system. Many of the short- and medium-term recommendations have already been implemented.<\/p>  <p>  Work to progress the recommendations of the Nursing Home Expert Panel report, particularly those recommendations requiring a priority focus in the response to COVID-19, is ongoing across all of the health agencies and stakeholders. Continued learning and understanding of progression of the disease in Ireland is an integral part of those recommendations.<\/p>  <p>  At a broader level, there has been significant and ongoing consideration of this impact since the start of the pandemic, with various examinations and development of reports with a focus on COVID-19, its impact on nursing homes and the pandemic learnings that can inform future policy, regulation and the model of care for older persons. There has been a very clear national commitment to continue to learn from the pandemic as the national and international understanding of the virus evolves, and where necessary to ensure that the public health-led approach evolves, as evidence and learning materialises. Findings of these reports confirm that the very infectious nature of COVID-19 makes it difficult to prevent and control in residential care settings. The reports produced nationally identify findings consistent with international evidence, which have highlighted that the probability of COVID-19 introduction into nursing home depends on the levels of the disease circulating in the community, with a higher risk associated with higher incidence rates in the community.<\/p>  <p>  While significant progress is being made in relation to the roll-out of the vaccination programme, and the current situation in nursing homes is broadly stable, the prevalence of the more transmissible Delta variant has rapidly increased in Ireland and this poses a significant risk, in particular to those who are not yet fully protected though vaccination.  It must be recognised that the pandemic has not concluded and at this time a priority focus of Government remains on the ongoing management of the COVID-19 response, to ensure that the positive gains now been experienced are preserved, and that those most vulnerable to the virus continue to be safeguarded, having regard to the residual risk. <\/p>  <p>  The Government is continuing to look at options which may be available to the State in relation to listening to the voices of those who have lost a loved one.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021090900051#WRYY03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1614"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Home Care Packages","counter":2742,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021090900051#WRYY03100"},{"type":"question","counter":2743,"qnumday":959,"qnumall":"[41431\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021090900051#WRYY03200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his plans to add additional funding to home support packages.","asker":"1498","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2744,"content":"<p>Home supports enable older people to remain in their own homes and communities, as well as facilitating timely discharge from hospital.

The Temporary Assistance Payment Scheme (TAPS) was established in April 2020 as a temporary, administrative measure to respond to the challenges being faced by the nursing home sector at the start of the pandemic. Up to &euro;134m for the Scheme was made available for 2020 and 2021.<\/p>  <p>  In broad terms, the Scheme has now substantially fulfilled its temporary purpose of providing financial support to nursing homes and residents to address COVID-19 and therefore phased withdrawal of support is appropriate. Standard Assistance Payments continue to be processed for costs incurred up to 30th June 2021. After this, in recognition of the residual risk presented by the virus, Minister Donnelly and I have agreed to the continued availability of the outbreak assistance element of the Scheme until the end of this year. This will ensure that contingency is available in the event of an outbreak.<\/p>  <p>  As the pandemic has continued, many further support measures for private and voluntary nursing homes have been made available through the Health Service Executive (HSE), including the provision of PPE on a no-cost basis, the implementation of serial testing, the support and engagement of COVID-19 response teams and public health teams, the temporary accommodation scheme for nursing home staff and further supports. Many of these supports will continue to be provided by the HSE for the foreseeable future.<\/p>  <p>  At the time of the Scheme&rsquo;s inception, the unprecedented nature of the emerging pandemic meant that it was necessary to put such measures in place. There has been substantial support in place to assist nursing homes to build their resilience and ensure that they are fully informed and prepared for continuing to manage COVID-19 and fulfil their legal obligation and duties to residents. The circumstances are now significantly changed, reflecting both the success of the vaccination programme along with the considerable opportunity for nursing homes, over the past 18 months with the various support measures, to learn and adapt their response to COVID-19. This is also the case for every health and non-health sector, and service providers across Ireland must similarly adapt their service model in line with the wider public health measures. <\/p>  <p>  Nursing homes were prioritised for vaccination, and the vast majority of residents and staff have now been vaccinated. Thankfully, notwithstanding the current epidemiological situation generally and the risks posed by the delta variant, the substantial positive vaccine effect is being seen in nursing homes with low numbers of cases reported. This is a markedly different scenario compared to turn of the year. All the relevant health agencies including the Department will continue to closely monitor the current situation to respond to any changes in the risk profile that may arise.  On the 27 July, I convened an interagency meeting with HIQA, the HSE and the Department to focus on the current situation and ongoing management of risk. The HSE and HIQA have confirmed that they continue to closely monitor the situation and that all the relevant supports, including the COVID-19 response teams, remain activated and engaged with nursing homes.<\/p>  <p>  The vaccination programme and other public health measures support the minimisation of and control the impact of COVID-19, with COVID-19 vaccines effective at reducing the risk of hospitalisation or severe disease. The disease will nevertheless remain part of our lives for the foreseeable future, in a manner similar to other common viruses and infections. Good infection prevention control will continue be necessary in controlling the spread of such illnesses. This should be a matter of course in all healthcare settings, as it has always been, and is supported by regulation and standards. The Health Protection Surveillance Centre will continue to monitor COVID-19 alongside other such illnesses and update public health guidance accordingly. At a point where the vast majority of residents and staff are vaccinated, outbreaks have declined significantly and where learning and preparedness, including at provider level, has had the opportunity to evolve in a supported way, the TAPS as a temporary administrative measure has fulfilled its primary purpose, within the parameters of its sanction. This end date of the Scheme was announced in October 2020.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021090900052#WRZZ01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1614"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic","counter":2792,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021090900052#WRZZ01200"},{"type":"question","counter":2793,"qnumday":975,"qnumall":"[41476\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021090900052#WRZZ01300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of persons who contracted Covid-19 in a hospital setting on a monthly basis since 1 March 2021.","asker":"1504","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2794,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021090900052#WRZZ01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"question","counter":2796,"qnumday":976,"qnumall":"[41477\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021090900052#WRZZ01600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of persons who tested positive for Covid-19 in a hospital setting during routine testing after admittance to hospital for a non-Covid-19 related illness or condition;

Reactogenicity occurred at a slightly higher frequency in these age groups compared to adults, but side effects from the vaccine were similar to those experienced by adults e.g. injection site pain, fatigue, headache. Vaccination in those 12-15 years is associated with short-lived, self-limited side effects. <\/p>  <p>  The National Immunisation Advisory Committee considered the benefits and risks to this age group of receiving a COVID-19 vaccine, as well as the short and longer-term impacts of SARS-CoV-2 infection on children and young people in this age group and recommended that vaccination be extended to those aged 12-15 years. COVID-19 infections in those aged 12-15 years are usually asymptomatic or mild. Hospitalisation rates, rates of ICU admission are very low and death is rare. This does not exclude the possibility of severe COVID-19 developing, even in the previously healthy child. The risk of hospitalisation is higher in those with underlying chronic medical conditions and can approach that of older adults with risk conditions. NIAC also considered other potential risk factors for children and young people aged 12-15 years as a result of contracting SARS-Cov-2 COVID-19 including Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) and long-COVID, as well as the psycho-social impact of COVID-19 on this age group. <\/p>  <p>  The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has recommended granting an extension of indication to both Comirnaty and Spikevax to include use in children aged 12 years and older and has concluded that the benefits of Comirnaty and Spikevax in children and young people in this age group outweigh the risks, in particular in those with conditions that increase the risk of severe COVID-19.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021090900054#WRBBB05400","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic","counter":2957,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021090900054#WRBBB05500"},{"type":"question","counter":2958,"qnumday":1030,"qnumall":"[41612\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021090900054#WRBBB05600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the illness rate, hospitalisation rate, ICU rate, long Covid rate and mortality rate per 100,000 for each age cohort from 12 years of age upwards in relation to Covid-19.","asker":"1504","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2959,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021090900054#WRBBB05700","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":2961,"content":"<p>Question No. 1031 answered with Question No. 1029.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Vaccination Programme","counter":2962,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021090900055#WRCCC00300"},{"type":"question","counter":2963,"qnumday":1032,"qnumall":"[41614\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021090900055#WRCCC00400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the system in Ireland to count and detail each side effect that occurs as a result of each Covid-19 vaccine delivered; the body that collects this information; and the details of the statistics collected.","asker":"1504","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2964,"content":"<p>The Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) operates the national adverse reaction reporting system, through which healthcare professionals and members of the public can notify a report of a suspected adverse reaction (ADR) to vaccines on a voluntary basis. <\/p><p>It is important to note that the HPRA receives reports based on suspicion that an adverse experience may be associated with vaccination.

The Expert Panel report, which was published in August 2020, has added further to our knowledge and learning. This report clearly outlines the key protective measures that we must ensure are in place across our nursing homes.

A National Taskforce, with representation from key stakeholders and agencies, has been established to develop a Framework for safe staffing and skill mix in long-term residential care settings for older persons.

Different approaches to the provision of personalised budgets are currently being piloted, and any decision to extend personalised budgets to a greater number of individuals, and the form that would take, will depend on the outcomes from the pilot project underway across all CHO areas and its evaluation.<\/p>  <p>  A purely cost-neutral approach would not involve additional expenditure in terms of the actual Personalised Budgets themselves. It is estimated that around 37,000 people receive either a residential or a day service, Personal Assistance or Home Support, at a cost of around &euro;1.95bn. Providing 540 Personalised Budgets could involve the conversion of approximately 1.5% of that element of the Disability Services to Personalised Budgets, or a redeployment of around &euro;30m of those funds. In a cost-neutral scenario, the ongoing costs of operating a Personalised Budget for the individual, such as dealing with matters like hiring, rosters, payroll administration, insurance, tax, and HR, would come from the individuals Personalised Budget.<\/p>  <p>  However realistically any widescale deployment of Personalised Budgets would entail some overhead costs to the HSE in terms of staff to support applicants through the application process, use of a standardised Assessment Tool to assess the support needs of the individual, and transition and set-up costs to develop new systems. International experience, and Irish experience to date, suggests that many applicants may not proceed to a Personalised Budget, if they consider that the benefits of a personalised budget arrangement may be outweighed by factors like the ongoing administration involved for themselves in organising such arrangements. To reach 540 Personal Budgets in operation would involve processing significantly greater numbers of requests as a number of people may decide to opt out at various stages along the path.<\/p>  <p>  Internationally, research across a number of jurisdictions suggests the uptake on Personalised Budgets is approximately 8%.<\/p>  <p>  Pending the conclusion and evaluation of the existing Personalised Budgets pilot programme, it is not possible to say with any accuracy what the overhead costs of a more widespread provision of this option would be. However, it is likely to involve a national programme office, plus dedicated staffing in each CHO area to support applicants through the application and transition process and carry out needs assessments; licensing for a national standard assessment tool and software, and training in the use of same; support around unbundling of current funding; and communication support including a website, Easy to Read materials and ISL interpretation. Preliminary estimates suggest that such overhead costs could be of the order of &euro;1.5m for a minimum national and local support service for supports to the applications process and making transitions to personal budgets, however the higher the volume of applications to reach a target 540 users, the higher those overheads would become.<\/p>  <p>  [1] Towards Personalised Budgets for People with a Disability in Ireland &ndash;

The Committee's recommendations are based on the prevalence of the relevant disease in Ireland and international best practice in relation to immunisation. It makes recommendations on vaccination policy to\u00a0my Department. The NIAC continues to revise recommendations to allow for the introduction of new vaccines in Ireland and to keep abreast of changes in the patterns of disease. Therefore, the immunisation schedule will continue to be amended over time.<\/p>  <p>  The ages at which vaccines are recommended in the immunisation schedule are chosen by the NIAC in order to give each child the best possible protection against vaccine preventable diseases. As the HPV vaccine is preventative it is intended to be administered, if possible, before a person becomes sexually active, that is, before a person is first exposed to HPV infection. Therefore, the gender-neutral HPV vaccination programme targets all girls and boys in first year of secondary school to provide maximum coverage. All vaccines administered through the School Immunisation Programme are provided free of charge.<\/p>  <p>  My Department will continue to be guided by NIAC's recommendations on any emerging evidence on this issue in the future.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that the schools-based immunisation programme for the 2019\/2020 academic year has been completed and the uptake rates for the HPV vaccine in that academic year are 82% for the first dose of the vaccine and 77% for the second dose. This is the highest uptake for the HPV vaccination programme since 2015\/2016 and is particularly encouraging because it was the first year that boys were included in the programme and it shows that the provision of vaccine in community clinics did not adversely affect the uptake.<\/p>  <p>  The programme for the academic year 2020\/2021 was paused during the first few months of 2021 due to school closures and redeployment of staff to the COVID-19 immunisation programme. The inputting of uptake information for the schools-based programme has also been delayed due to redeployment of administrative staff. However, Community Healthcare Organisations have reported that the vast majority of second level schools had their first dose of HPV vaccine delivered between October and December 2020.<\/p>  <p>  Anyone not in 1st year of secondary school or age equivalent in special schools or home schooled during the 2020\/2021 school year who wishes to get the HPV vaccine, must go to their GP or sexual health clinic and pay privately for the vaccine and its administration. This applies to everyone whether or not they have a medical card\/GP visit card, as it is outside of the HPV immunisation programme.<\/p>  <p>  The uptake rate for the first dose of the HPV vaccine, in the 2020\/2021 academic year, is 72% as of 17 August 2021, and this figure is expected to increase because data input on vaccine uptake is ongoing. The HSE expects the HPV vaccination programme for 2020\/2021 to be substantially complete before the start of the 2021\/2022 academic year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021090900061#WRJJJ00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"question","counter":3324,"qnumday":1152,"qnumall":"[41877\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021090900061#WRJJJ00600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the options available to a person who had a severe reaction to their first Covid-19 vaccine (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1623"},{"type":"question","counter":3325,"qnumday":1163,"qnumall":"[41905\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021090900061#WRJJJ00700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if a policy of exemption to the EU Digital COVID Certificate will be formulated and applied for persons who cannot be vaccinated for medical reasons or in cases of an adverse reaction to the first dose of a vaccine which medically prevents them from having the second dose given the option of having a Covid-19 test each time they wish to have a cup of coffee or a meal indoors is not practical, workable or affordable for them; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1585","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":3326,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1152 and 1163 together.<\/p><p>The EU Digital COVID Certificate is proof that a person has either been vaccinated against COVID-19 or received a negative COVID-19 test result or recovered from COVID-19 in the last 6 months.<\/p><p>While the EU Digital COVID Certificate initiative can support safe travel within the EU during the COVID-19 pandemic it is not a precondition for travel.<\/p><p>Individuals who have received one vaccination dose can request a certificate of this dose through the online Digital COVID Certificate portal<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021090900061#WRJJJ00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Service Executive","counter":3327,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021090900061#WRJJJ00900"},{"type":"question","counter":3328,"qnumday":1153,"qnumall":"[41879\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021090900061#WRJJJ01000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the total amount spent to date by the HSE in rebuilding systems after the cyber-attack; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1581","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":3329,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the deputy directly, as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021090900061#WRJJJ01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Waiting Lists","counter":3330,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021090900061#WRJJJ01200"},{"type":"question","counter":3331,"qnumday":1154,"qnumall":"[41880\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021090900061#WRJJJ01300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the average wait time for orthopaedic treatment nationally; the average waiting for orthopaedic treatment for County Mayo; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1501","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":3332,"content":"<p>It is recognised that waiting times for scheduled appointments and procedures have been impacted in the last eighteen months as a direct result of the COVID-19 pandemic and more recently as a result of the ransomware attack.

A major objective of the IBTS is to ensure that it always has the necessary programmes and procedures in place to protect both the recipients and the donors of blood and blood products. The IBTS constantly keeps all deferral policies under active review, in the light of scientific evidence, emerging infections and international evidence, to ensure the ongoing safety of blood and the products derived from it. <\/p>  <p>  The IBTS lifted its lifelong ban on men who have sex with men (MSM) from donating blood in January 2017, when the deferral policy was reduced to a period of one year following their last sexual encounter with a man.  My Department has established a post-implementation surveillance monitoring group, which is scheduled to meet later this week.  The group will assess the impact, if any, on the incidence of transfusion transmitted infections, following the change to donor deferral policies in 2017.  The output of this Group will contribute to the evidence base that can inform future decisions on proposed changes to deferral policies, including any future changes to MSM deferral policy.<\/p>  <p>  The IBTS established an independent &lsquo;Advisory Committee for Social Behaviours Review&rsquo; to review the evidence base for donor selection, deferral and exclusion in Ireland in relation to social behaviours that may increase the risk of acquiring specific blood-borne infections.

This evidence review included a review of relevant studies in relation to Ivermectin. <\/p><p>As confirmed by HIQA&rsquo;s COVID-19 Expert Advisory Group, , evidence regarding the effectiveness of pharmaceutical treatments intended for systemic use, must be subject to the highest standards of rigour. Where a pharmaceutical intervention is recommended in the absence of appropriate supportive evidence, there is a significant potential for harm to the patient. Whereas this risk of harm may be justified in certain circumstances (e.g. the intervention poses minimal risk, or the setting involves patients with high potential to gain due to almost certain risk of severe adverse consequences in absence of any intervention) this is less likely to be the case in the setting of mild disease, where a great number of otherwise well patients would potentially receive the intervention. <\/p><p>HIQA has also advised my Department that several international health technology assessment or guideline development organisations have specifically reviewed the evidence to date on ivermectin in COVID-19 and have cautioned or advised against the use of ivermectin outside the setting of clinical trials on the basis of the current evidence. HIQA has also advised that the pharmaceutical company MSD (Merck, USA), which holds a license in the USA for the use of ivermectin as an antiparasitic agent, on 4 February 2021 published a statement including the following: <\/p><p><i>&ldquo;<\/i>It is important to note that, to-date, our analysis has identified: <\/p> <blockquote> \tNo scientific basis for a potential therapeutic effect against COVID-19 from pre-clinical studies; <br \/><br \/>No meaningful evidence for clinical activity or clinical efficacy in patients with COVID-19 disease, and; <br \/><br \/>A concerning lack of safety data in the majority of studies.  <\/blockquote>  <p>We do not believe that the data available support the safety and efficacy of ivermectin beyond the doses and populations indicated in the regulatory agency-approved prescribing information.&rdquo; <\/p><p>Further research was undertaken by HIQA and updated advice was provided to the NPHET on 12 May: <i>COVID-19 - Interventions and health related factors that prevent infection or minimise progression to severe disease<\/i>. This document was subsequently published by HIQA on the 23 June 2021: <\/p><p> <\/p><p>One of the key findings of the review was that Ivermectin is not currently licensed for the treatment of COVID-19. From this evidence summary, there is currently insufficient information on whether it can be safely used to prevent or reduce the severity of COVID-19. Ivermectin should therefore not be used as prophylaxis outside well-designed, regulated clinical trials as the benefits and harms are not yet clear when taken in the context of COVID-19 treatment.<\/p><p>Low certainty or very low certainty evidence was identified in relation to a small number of interventions. However, HIQA noted the low quality of the evidence available including the high risk of bias, small sample sizes and short durations of follow-up, different trials and advised that results from these studies should not be used to inform decision-making with respect to effectiveness. <\/p><p>HIQA&rsquo;s overall finding was that there is currently insufficient evidence of either effectiveness or safety to support the use of any pharmaceutical intervention outside of well conducted, well-regulated clinical trials.

While significant progress was made in reducing waiting times from June 2020 onwards, the surge in Covid-19 cases in the first quarter of 2021 and the associated curtailment of acute hospital services, coupled with the ransomware attack of May 2021, has impacted waiting times. However, the HSE advise that acute services are now almost all fully restored to pre cyber-attack levels, and are operating in line with relevant Covid protocols.<\/p>  <p>  My Department, the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) are focusing on improving access to elective care in order to reduce waiting times for patients. These plans include increased use of private hospitals, funding weekend and evening work in public hospitals, funding &ldquo;see and treat&rdquo; services where minor procedures are provided at the same time as outpatient consultations, providing virtual clinics and increasing capacity in the public hospital system.<\/p>  <p>  An additional &euro;240 million has been provided in Budget 2021 for an access to care fund, &euro;210m of which has been allocated to the HSE and a further &euro;30m to the NTPF.

The Committee's recommendations are based on the prevalence of the relevant disease in Ireland and international best practices in relation to immunisation.

Following the recommendation for use of vaccines against COVID-19 by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and authorisation for use by the European Commission, the NIAC develops guidance for their use in Ireland which is contained in the Immunisation Guidelines for Ireland. These guidelines are continuously updated and include guidance on all new vaccines as they are approved for use in Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  You can read the guidelines at: www.hse.ie\/eng\/health\/immunisation\/hcpinfo\/guidelines\/covid19.pdf<\/p>  <p>  On the 28th of May, the EMA recommended an extension of the use of the Pfizer vaccine to include those aged 12 to 15 years.

The NIAC reviewed these findings and has recommended that vaccination be extended to those aged 12 -15 years, those in this age group will be offered an mRNA vaccination to protect themselves from COVID-19.

As additional people become eligible for vaccination certificates, certificates are automatically issued after the second vaccination. The Office of Government Chief Information Office (OGCIO) issues certificates based on underlying data provided by the HSE and private test providers. Of course there are a small percentage of the overall number who have yet to receive their vaccination certificates (less than 0.9 % of all those vaccinated to-date) related to data quality issues. The HSE has multiple data sources for vaccine data (e.g., vaccine portal, GPs, pharmacies, acute settings) and data quality is varied. Extensive data quality work has been undertaken by the HSE to ensure sufficient and fully accurate information is available to support both generation and issuing of the certificate to an individual. The HSE continues to work to resolve outstanding data quality issues in relation to vaccination in the coming weeks.<\/p>  <p>  As decided by Government, the Department of Health has mobilised a DCC contact centre at exceptional pace to manage the required workflows and communications to support citizens who may have queries in relation to Digital COVID Certificates for the purposes of travel. This has required an incredible effort across multiple government agencies to put in place the people, processes and technology required. An interim emergency line was put in place from 13th July in advance of the initial contact service going live on the 19th July given the level of public interest as soon as the first certificates began to issue through OGCIO.<\/p>  <p>  Due to unprecedented demand on the call centre over and above estimates of call centre demand based on an assessment of travel bookings and survey or insights data on travel intentions that Government or industry had access to, several enhancements were accelerated and put in place. The centre ramped up the number of call-handling agents over its initial weeks and stands at 86 agents since the 23rd August. Increased call handling technical capacity was also put in place through a second freephone number on 20th July.<\/p>  <p>  The call centre also introduced new additional service channels through the launch of online portals to provide additional channels to service queries from members of the public. A new online form to request Recovery certificates for eligible persons was released on 22 July. Following this a portal allowing for Vaccine Certificate Request, Vaccine Certificate Details Update and a Vaccine Status portal were launched on the 30th July. <\/p>  <p>  The Call Centre continues to work to improve the service and it is expected that a portal to allow citizens with incomplete citizen or vaccine information to provide this data will be launched very shortly to support the HSE gather outstanding data from members of the public who have yet to receive their certificates due to data quality issues. Once a person&rsquo;s identity and eligibility have been verified through this portal, a certificate can issue. Development work is also underway introduce webchat and a last portal to cater for certificate applicants for a DCC who are not resident within Ireland but may be resident on the island of Ireland and third countries.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021090900068#WRQQQ00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental

This guidance came into effect on 19 July. The public health advice is to restore visiting to near normal in terms of frequency of visits in those settings with a high level of vaccination of residents as quickly as possible, while also recognising the need to remain cautious as we continue to deal with the evolving risks associated with COVID-19.<\/p><p>The new guidance provides that:<\/p><p>- Providers should put in place the necessary measures to progress to more normalised visiting and visiting frequency as quickly as possible in line with public health guidance with no more than two visitors at any one time. <\/p><p>- Routine visiting will no longer need to be scheduled in advance. <\/p><p>- There is no requirement to have a list of nominated visitors. <\/p><p>- The duration of the visit should not be limited. <\/p><p>- Fewer restrictions will apply to residents going on outings or visits outside of the nursing home.<\/p><p>Nursing home providers are ultimately responsible for the safe care of their residents. In a broad sense, visits to nursing homes are governed by legislation under the Health Act 2007 (Care and Welfare of Residents in Designated Centres for Older People) Regulations 2013; regulation 11 provides that the nursing home should facilitate visiting and not restrict visiting except in circumstances such as the resident requesting same, or potential risk posed from visiting &ndash; this aligns with the risk assessments referred to in the visiting guidance.  The regulations also require that the nursing home has suitable facilities in place and available for residents to receive visits. It is the legal responsibility of each provider to assess the risks and mitigation measures associated with their service and how best to manage visits having regards to the specific circumstances that arise in relation to their service. The HPSC has developed public health guidance, mentioned above, to assist and support providers in this regard.<\/p><p>Notwithstanding the current positive epidemiological outlook and the cautious reopening of society, risks continue to remain and emergent risks such as variants of concern present ongoing challenges and the need for vigilance.

There has been a very clear national commitment to continue to learn from the pandemic as the national and international understanding of the virus evolves, and where necessary to ensure that the public health-led approach evolves, as evidence and learning materialises. Findings of these reports confirm that the very infectious nature of COVID-19 makes it difficult to prevent and control in residential care settings.

It must be recognised that the pandemic has not concluded and at this time a priority focus of Government remains on the ongoing management of the COVID-19 response, to ensure that the positive gains now been experienced are preserved, and that those most vulnerable to the virus continue to be safeguarded, having regard to the residual risk.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is continuing to look at options which may be available to the State in relation to listening to the voices of those who have lost a loved one.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021090900070#WRSSS00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1614"},{"type":"question","counter":3823,"qnumday":1333,"qnumall":"[42471\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021090900070#WRSSS00900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will provide a non-electronic alternative to the electronic passenger locator form to facilitate those who do not have access or an understanding of the technology involved; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1628","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":3824,"content":"<p>All passengers arriving into the state are required to complete an online COVID-19 Passenger Locator Form (PLF) in accordance with SI 45 of 2021.

To advance this, the Government is committed to establishing a new, statutory scheme for the financing and regulation of home-support services, which the Department of Health is currently developing.<\/p><p>Work is on-going within the Department to determine the optimal approach to the development of the new scheme within the broader context of the Sl&aacute;intecare reforms. This work encompasses the development of the regulatory framework for the new scheme; the examination of the options for the financing model for the scheme; and the development of a reformed model of service-delivery. <\/p><p>With the aim of ensuring that all service-users are provided with a standard, high-quality level of care which is safe, effective, and person-centred, it is envisaged that the regulatory framework will comprise (i) primary legislation for the licensing of public and private home support providers; (ii) minimum requirements (regulations); and HIQA National Standards for Home Support Services. <\/p><p>On 27 April 2021, Government gave approval to draft a General Scheme and Heads of a Bill to establish a licensing framework for home support providers. This is being progressed by the Department with a view to bringing it through the Houses of the Oireachtas at the earliest opportunity. It is expected that the primary legislation will give the Minister for Health the power to make regulations in respect of minimum requirements which will form the criteria against which a provider&rsquo;s eligibility to hold a licence will be determined. <\/p><p>In parallel to this, work is ongoing in relation to the development of a reformed model of service delivery for home support. Within this context, funding was secured in 2021 for the HSE to progress the roll-out of interRAI as the standard assessment tool for care-needs in the community; the pilot of a reformed model of service-delivery for home-support; and the establishment of a National Office for Home Support Services.<\/p><p>Mobilisation of the pilot of a reformed model of service-delivery is expected to commence in September, supported by the National Office. The pilot will deliver an additional 230,000 hours of home-support in four community healthcare network (CHN) sites over a six-month period. In addition, approximately 130 posts have been funded for the national rollout of the interRAI Ireland system, which the home-support pilot will test as the standard assessment tool for care-needs.<\/p><p>The <i>Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Strategy and Action Plan 2021&ndash;2023<\/i>commits to the advancement of the development of the new home-support scheme in 2021 and to the commencement of its implementation in 2022. While the new home-support scheme is under development, the Government is prioritising improving access to home-support services. As part of Budget 2021, funding for an additional 5 million hours of home-support was provided. This increased investment will contribute to meeting the <i>Programme for Government<\/i>commitment to providing equitable access to home-support services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021090900072#WRUUU05300","answer":true,"speaker":"1614"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":3985,"content":"<p>Question No. 1388 answered with Question No. 1387.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Aids and Appliances","counter":3986,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021090900072#WRUUU05500"},{"type":"question","counter":3987,"qnumday":1389,"qnumall":"[42726\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021090900072#WRUUU05600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when diabetics over the age of 21 years will receive Libre FreeStyle Sensors under the medical card, long-term illness or hardship scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1493","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":3988,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the deputy directly, as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021090900072#WRUUU05700","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Flexible Work Practices","counter":3989,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021090900072#WRUUU05800"},{"type":"question","counter":3990,"qnumday":1390,"qnumall":"[42759\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021090900072#WRUUU05900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the way in which his Department and public bodies and agencies under his remit are accommodating requests for persons to work from home.","asker":"1525","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":3991,"content":"<p>The public service, including my own Department and agencies under the aegis of my Department are currently working in line with Government COVID-19 guidance, which provides for home working to continue where possible.

Unfortunately, due COVID-19 restrictions I haven&rsquo;t been able to engage with people on the pierside.  In order to interact directly with members of coastal communities, during the month of May 2021, I held a series of virtual Townhall meetings with coastal communities around Ireland.  These virtual meetings allowed me to hear directly from those impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and Brexit and to hear their ideas about the future of their communities.<\/p>  <p>  At these meetings, I gave an overview of the key issues that have faced the Fishing Industry since I took office, namely Brexit and COVID-19.  I noted that the industry had worked with their counterparts in other Member States to assist in the development of a strong Irish position for EU negotiations. I also noted the additional burden on Ireland in respect of the transfer of quotas under the TCA which I am working to address. <\/p>  <p>  I also took the opportunity to acknowledge the work of the seafood sector throughout the disruptions caused by COVID-19.

I know too that afforestation\u00a0 is key to meeting our environmental objectives under the Climate Action Plan and in terms of biodiversity, as outlined in the Programme for Government.<\/p>  <p>  The delays that have arisen were caused by changes to law and relevant court judgements which have required us to radically amend our licencing procedures. To find solutions towards resolving these issues, as well as focussing on woodland creation, Project Woodland was initiated early in 2021. It comprises four working groups, each with an independent chair and with members drawn from forestry and eNGO stakeholders on the Forestry Policy Group. The Project Board, led by Secretary General of\u00a0the Department, meets regularly to monitor the progress of the working groups and a Project Manager has been assigned.<\/p>  <p>  As part of Project Woodland, a tender has recently issued to source legal and environmental expertise to carry out an in-depth review of the forestry licensing system. It will review the existing statutory framework for the licencing of forestry activities in relation to environmental and public participation obligations in order that practical advice can be provided to the Department on how to work more efficiently within the existing legal framework. <\/p>  <p>  The business systems analysis currently being undertaken by an independent systems analyst will interact with and run parallel with the regulatory review, so that best possible system improvements are delivered. <\/p>  <p>  Alongside Project Woodland, the Department continues to look at system improvements which will increase processing time. A recent improvement introduced in the preparation of the various Appropriate Assessment documents have allowed for output improvements. These improvements have been rolled out to forest road licences and will shortly apply to afforestation.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  On afforestation, forestry licences are valid for three years and at present there are 5,700ha of approved forestry ready to plant.\u00a0 The planting season normally runs from October to May annually.\u00a0 The Department has also assigned additional resources to afforestation licencing to increase output for the planting season this year.<\/p>  <p>In June this year, the Department issued 415 forestry licences. This output was interrupted in July and August by the introduction of a new requirement for public participation under SI 293\/2021, signed on 25th June\u00a0by the Minister for Housing Local Government and Heritage and which applies to all similar planning issues.\u00a0However, last week licences returned\u00a0 to expected levels with 110 new licences issued and we expect this increased output to continue through to the end of the year. <\/p>  <p>  In conclusion, I would like to reiterate my commitment to supporting the forest sector and to building on the recent progress, so that a continual improvement in delivery is achieved.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021090900081#WRDDDD03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1546"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Livestock Issues","counter":4454,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021090900081#WRDDDD03200"},{"type":"question","counter":4455,"qnumday":1553,"qnumall":"[42116\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021090900081#WRDDDD03300","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he will address a matter (details supplied) regarding stocking density and rates; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1487","askee":"1546"},{"type":"speech","counter":4456,"content":"<p>The Department has just completed a period of public consultation on the proposed draft interventions for Ireland&rsquo;s CAP Strategic Plan 2023-2027 and I have asked my officials to consider your comments as part of the development of the CAP Strategic Plan.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of relevant scheme proposals, the following should be noted: <\/p>  <p>  For the Areas Facing Natural Constraints (ANC) Scheme, it is proposed that the minimum stocking level requirement will remain at 0.15 livestock units per hectare.

There  is a proven link between TB infection in badgers and bovine TB.<\/p><p>Badger culling has been demonstrated to be highly effective in reducing the burden of bovine TB on Irish family farms for over 20 years. However, DAFM is currently committed to reducing badger culling in favour of badger vaccination which is more sustainable in the long term for both ecological and disease reasons, in line with the Programme for Government commitment. This is possible because badger vaccination has been demonstrated to be effective in reducing badger to badger TB transmission and not to be inferior to badger culling when introduced to areas with low badger densities and reduced prevalence of TB.<\/p><p>The current policy is to vaccinate badgers to prevent disease outbreaks and to cull badgers where necessary in response to outbreaks in areas where epidemiological investigations have demonstrated the link between badgers and TB breakdowns on cattle farms. Areas where badger culling may previously have taken place are being incorporated into the badger vaccination programme on an ongoing basis but only when any underlying disease spread to cattle from wildlife has been suppressed.<\/p><p>Since the commencement of badger vaccination in 2018, 19,079 Km2 of land has been switched to vaccination on a phased basis and this will continue. The scientific evidence for the efficacy of badger culling is well established and the evidence to support badger vaccination within the TB eradication scheme is being added to on an ongoing basis as additional research is published in peer reviewed scientific journals. DAFM is currently collaborating with University College Dublin and the University of Waginengen to validate the efficacy of vaccination in the field and to model where higher risks exist at a local farm level which will support better targeting of TB controls in future years.<\/p><p>As the level of badger vaccination increases, it is expected that there will be fewer wildlife driven TB outbreaks in cattle and thus less need for badger culling. It is likely, however, that some level of badger culling will remain necessary until TB levels have significantly reduced.<\/p><p>DAFM provides advice to farmers on how to reduce the risk of TB from wildlife which can be accessed at; <i>www.bovinetb.ie<\/i>.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021090900082#WREEEE00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1546"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Animal Welfare","counter":4485,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021090900082#WREEEE00500"},{"type":"question","counter":4486,"qnumday":1563,"qnumall":"[42209\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021090900082#WREEEE00600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the status of his plans for Teagasc to mainstream animal welfare considerations across its teaching and advisory services for farmers; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1592","askee":"1546"},{"type":"speech","counter":4487,"content":"<p>I have asked Teagasc, Ireland&rsquo;s Agricultural Training and Advisory body, to mainstream animal welfare considerations across its teaching and advisory services for farmers and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.<\/p>  <p>  Teagasc continues to provide well developed courses and training opportunities for the farming community with a strong emphasis on animal husbandry.

The fertiliser market is largely driven by global supply and demand and, while there are a number of factors influencing fertiliser price, the major driving factors for the current increase in prices are increased global demand driven by strong growth in agricultural commodity prices, rising production costs due to increased raw material and energy costs, and issues with supply for certain fertiliser products.<\/p>  <p>  No fertilisers are manufactured in Ireland, resulting in indigenous fertiliser companies being price-takers, dependent on global supply and demand and subject to Euro exchange rates against the US dollar and other currencies. <\/p>  <p>  Many farmers purchased their fertiliser earlier this year compared to previous years and were not exposed to recent price increases.

In tonnage terms, this means an increase from 191,843 tonnes to 298,299 tonnes &ndash; an increase of 106,456 tonnes for 2021. The Norwegian decision seeks to increase its share of the North Eastern Mackerel Stock from 22.5% to 35%. The Faroe Islands have since followed suit and also increased their unilateral share by 55%.<\/p>  <p>  Mackerel has been managed under a UN Coastal States Agreement that involved the EU, Norway and the Faroe Islands for the period 2014 to 2020. Iceland had refused to participate in the management agreement and the three parties to the agreement set aside a significant share of the share of the stock (15.6%) to cater for catches by Iceland as well as Greenland and Russia. For 2021, after Brexit and the UK departure from the EU, the parties involved agreed a global Total Allowable Catch level but were unable to agree on a new sharing arrangement.  Consequently, there is currently no Coastal States Agreement on Mackerel in place.  <\/p>  <p>  While the EU and the UK have an agreed framework for fisheries under the TCA and recently concluded an annual agreement on shared stocks for 2021, there is no such bilateral agreement between Norway (and Faroes) and the UK. This was the justification used by both of these countries for increasing their mackerel share.<\/p>  <p>  I have consistently made clear that this declaration by Norway and Faroes to hugely increase their mackerel quotas is a direct threat to the sustainability of the overall mackerel fishery and the future of the Irish pelagic fishing industry. There is no justification for this unilateral, opportunistic and unsustainable move.  Both countries are now doing what they have consistently criticised Iceland for doing over the past decade. This is all the more disappointing because it undermines the critically important arrangements for  joint management of mackerel by the Coastal States under the UN structure. As the scientific advice sets the sustainable level of fishing each year on mackerel, an increase by Norway means either the stock is overfished or other parties must take a smaller share. Neither option is acceptable.<\/p>  <p>  Under the EU \/UK Trade and Co-operation Agreement, there will be a 26% reduction in the Irish mackerel quota within the EU by 2026, with 60% of this reduction applied in 2021. Mackerel remains Irelands most important fishery with a quota for 2021 of 60,849 tonnes valued at approximately &euro;80m and it underpins the important Irish pelagic fish processing industry in the North West. Ireland is the largest Mackerel quota holder in the EU.  <\/p>  <p>  I have called on EU Commissioner Sinkevicius to reject completely this unilateral action by Norway to claim a much higher share of the mackerel stock.  I wrote to him to ask him to respond without delay to this provocative and irresponsible action and to pursue actions available to the European Commission to protect the important EU mackerel fleets and mackerel processing industry. It is vital that the EU Commissioner takes urgent steps to counteract this irresponsible action by Norway. Norway must understand that responsible partners do not get rewarded for such unacceptable action.<\/p>  <p>  Our mackerel fishers have already taken unacceptable cuts to their share of the mackerel stock under the EU\/UK TCA.  I am working with them to pursue all avenues to deliver a more equitable burden sharing within the EU.  I am very concerned that this action by Norway will add further uncertainty to the mackerel industry already trying to adjust to reduce quotas after Brexit.  <\/p>  <p>  Access to harbours is not covered under Coastal States Fisheries agreements.   Direct landings by non EU vessels are regulated under both North East Atlantic Fisheries Commission Port State Control rules and Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated (IUU) fisheries legislation.  Landings by Third country vessels can only take place in EU ports that have been designated specifically for this purpose and must fulfil all regulatory requirements including relevant documentation and prior notification.    Ireland currently has two fully designated ports &ndash; Killybegs, Co. Donegal, and Castletownbere, Co. Cork with five other designated ports for landings by Northern Ireland vessels.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021090900084#WRGGGG00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1546"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Harbours and Piers","counter":4610,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021090900084#WRGGGG00800"},{"type":"question","counter":4611,"qnumday":1604,"qnumall":"[43174\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021090900084#WRGGGG00900","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he will share the new report in relation to the recent review of the cost benefit analysis of the Deep Water Quay project for Ros an Mh&iacute;l harbour; the timeline for the next steps to advance the project; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1579","askee":"1546"},{"type":"speech","counter":4612,"content":"<p>Ros an Mh&iacute;l is one of six designated Fishery Harbour Centres owned, operated and maintained by the Department under statute.

Among the targeted actions delivered by the Taskforce and its member organisations were large telecommunications infrastructural works; the introduction of the Broadband Officer role to every local authority; amendments to regulations, policies and practices; a range of consumer information and consumer protection measures; and the establishment of strong and open lines of communication between the various State actors in the sector and with the telecommunications industry via IBEC. <\/p>  <p>  The Taskforce was the joint responsibility of my department and the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications.

The contribution of the Taskforce in meeting these commitments is undeniable.<\/p>  <p>  Following the completion of the three year work programme, a strong preference for the Taskforce to continue was expressed by members and by numerous other interested parties. Accordingly, officials at my department and the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications were tasked with drawing up recommendations for the future direction and composition of a refreshed Taskforce. Their recommendations are being reviewed at present. Once this review has completed, I will discuss options for the future of the Taskforce with my ministerial colleagues.<\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the completion of the Taskforce&rsquo;s work programme, I have continued to engage regularly with colleagues in Government, both national and local, with State agencies and regional development representatives and with commercial operators on a range of issues relevant to the development of rural connectivity.
