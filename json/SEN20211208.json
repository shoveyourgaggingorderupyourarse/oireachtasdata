I refer to the need for the Minister to make a statement on NAMA-controlled lands estimated at 426 ha with planning permission for housing and zoned residential use sufficient to build at least 20,000 new homes.  I wish to put on the record of the House that these figures were provided by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, in response to a parliamentary question tabled by Deputy &Oacute; Broin in the D&aacute;il.  The response indicates that some 63 acres of land under NAMA control with the potential for 2,745 housing units have planning permission.  That is a significant figure, and it is alarming to some extent, given that we have a housing crisis, but also given the role of NAMA and its connection with the State.  The reply suggests that South Dublin County Council has the largest parcel of land, comprising 15 ha, enough to accommodate 817 housing units.  I wish to acknowledge Deputy &Oacute; Broin for raising this issue.  He is on the housing committee with me.<\/p> <p>NAMA controls all of this land for approximately 20,000 houses.  That is really significant at a time when we have a housing crisis.  However, when one drills down into the figures relating to this landbank and its potential for housing development, one sees the majority of it is located in the areas of the four Dublin councils, namely, Dublin City Council, Fingal County Council, South Dublin County Council and D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council.  On top of that, there is Kildare County Council and Meath County Council.  It is significant.  To provide some figures in this regard: Dublin City Council has 94 ha with the potential for 7,400 housing units; Fingal County Council has 136 ha of land with the potential for 4,751 residential units; Kildare County Council has 370 ha with the potential for 1,340 housing units;  D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, where I live, has 7 ha with the potential for 720 housing units; and Wexford County Council has 15 ha with the potential for 436 residential units.  That is an exceptional amount of land.  There are other areas too.<\/p> <p>NAMA was created by the Government in 2009 to alleviate the pressures on Irish banks.  It did this by taking &euro;74 billion of risky property loans off the hands of the five banks, namely, AIB, Bank of Ireland, the Educational Building Society, the famous Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide.  What a mess those banks left and what a legacy and difficulty the then Government had.  It had no option.  I am not suggesting NAMA did not do the right thing or was not the right move.  It was the right move.  In fairness to NAMA, it has managed its portfolio and assets on behalf of the State exceptionally well.  There is sometimes a failure to acknowledge the significance of NAMA and the importance of its role.  We should remember that the financial banking crisis resulted from excessive, and in many cases inappropriate, lending for the property sector.  I  refer to the history of the crisis within the banks.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Victor Boyhan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2463\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2463&amp;amp;pid=VictorBoyhan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=08\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->There is also their connection to the property sector, greedy and excessive development and excessive borrowing for development to make vast profits.

The issue of housing and NAMA is always a matter for discussion and should regularly be discussed in the Seanad and D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  As the Senator rightly said, the taxpayer heavily invested in bailing out the banks originally.  As a preamble, the five banks the Senator mentioned that were bailed out and whose commercial loans were transferred to NAMA included Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide, which were subsequently liquidated by the State and the Houses of the Oireachtas some time ago.<\/p> <p>I want to clarify that the majority of the remaining land secured to NAMA does not have planning permission for housing and much of it is not currently suitable for residential development.  It is important that the commentary regarding the amount of residential units that NAMA can deliver is fully cognisant of the factual position regarding NAMA's remaining portfolio and the restrictions under which the agency operates.<\/p> <p>I am advised that NAMA debtors and receivers own an estimated 489 ha of land that is potentially suitable for residential development in Ireland between now and 2035.  There is quite a time period involved in which all this could take place.  At present, 63 ha of this land is under construction or has funding approved for construction.  Of the remaining land, 63 ha have planning permission and planning applications have been lodged in respect of 26 ha.  The remaining 337 ha do not yet have planning permission.<\/p> <p>NAMA is not hoarding land.  Since inception, NAMA debtors and receivers have sold or refinanced approximately 5,500 ha of residential zoned land with potential for 86,000 residential units, representing 71% of NAMA's original secured land bank.  However, the majority of this land did not have zoning or planning permission for housing.  Furthermore, NAMA is progressing delivery of residential units on all sites where it can, and has already facilitated the delivery of 22,500 new homes.  Many of the sites in NAMA's portfolio are simply not suitable for residential development at present owing to a lack of appropriate planning, zoning or essential infrastructure and services such as roads, water, sewerage and utilities.  The new taxes being introduced in the Finance Bill, which we discussed yesterday, deal with sites that have planning permission and are serviced and are capable of being built on.  A site with appropriate zoning may not have planning or services.  There may be no water or sewerage services and Irish Water may not be in a position to provide them in the short term.  Just because there is land in NAMA does not mean it is suitable for residential development in the short term.  Some of it may never be suitable for residential development.<\/p> <p>Of the approximately 22,000 units which NAMA has identified for residential delivery between now and 2035, there are 1,500 units under construction or with funding approved for construction and 1,200 units which have been granted planning permission for which NAMA funding is under consideration.  A further 1,500 units have been granted planning permission and will be sold or refinanced by NAMA debtors.  There are 3,900 units in the planning system, with planning either lodged or being prepared.<\/p> <p>The remaining land, with long-term potential of delivering 11,700 units have infrastructural needs, such as roads, water and sewerage, which will need to be addressed by local authorities and Irish Water.  Accordingly, much of the delivery potential of the remaining portfolio can only occur over the medium to long term.  Recognising this, NAMA aims to advance sites through the planning system to maximise the number of sites that are ready for future development.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021120800002#B00200","speaker":"1590"},{"type":"speech","time":1638959400,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for what was a comprehensive statement that has shone a light on many of the issues I have raised.

There is potential for the Land Development Agency to look at some of this or to work and collaborate with people involved in this land.  We must always remember what NAMA was set up for.

It is also important to state that commercial viability is becoming more challenging for developers throughout the sector.  Some sites that have planning permission in place are not viable to build on, and this is especially true for certain apartment blocks.  Under NAMA's legislation, commercial viability is the most important and relevant factor for NAMA-funded residential development.  This basically means that NAMA can only finance developments that are expected to yield a profit.  It was given a commercial mandate by this House, this Parliament and the European Commission on the strict basis that it would be a time-limited project.  This is why we were allowed to take the loans off the banks in the first place.<\/p> <p>The Senator is aware that what are often referred to as \"NAMA land\" or \"NAMA properties\" are not owned by NAMA.  NAMA owns only the loans.  The Senator is fully aware of this and I do not need to point it out.  Some people think NAMA owns the land and can do what it likes.  It only has ownership of the loans on those sites.  NAMA has been successful in achieving its mandate and ultimately it will have a commercial return of &euro;4.2 billion for the taxpayer, together with the delivery of all of the houses.

The Minister is very welcome to the House this morning.  The Minister knows, and he does not need me to tell him, that every farmer in the country is speaking about the price of fertiliser.  It has gone through the roof.  Recent figures I have seen show the price of urea has risen almost 80% in the past year.  The average price of all fertilisers has risen by 72%.  According to the World Bank, unfortunately, this is a trend that is set to continue.  This is very bad and worrying news for the farming community.  When coupled with a recent Teagasc report that predicts that farm incomes are set to decline by an average of 19% next year in all sectors, it is a worrying and troublesome time for the farming community.  As we all know, what is bad news for the farmer is ultimately bad news for the consumer because the results of this will be higher food prices.  This is something that affects us all.<\/p> <p>We are told the reason for this is the increasing price of natural gas throughout Europe.  Recently, I saw statistics that in the past year, the price of natural gas throughout Europe has risen by 441%.  This is a crazy figure.  This will be a serious problem for farmers.  In the meantime, it will also be a serious problem for the importers and suppliers of fertiliser to the farmers.  They will have difficulty in trying to source it.  If they do source it, the cost they will incur by importing it will have serious implications for them holding this type of funding.  A potential solution would have to involve the banks, as well as the farming community.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Robbie Gallagher:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2471\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2471&amp;amp;pid=RobbieGallagher&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=08\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> There is another solution that has been talked about, which is temporary.  The EU could set aside the anti-dumping charge on fertilisers, which we import from Trinidad and Tobago, the US and Russia, and perhaps that would result in an easement as well.  The Minister has been proactive in this case and he wrote to the EU some time ago looking to see what can be done.  We need a short-term solution.  Perhaps a more long-term solution could be found in a county such as the one in which I reside.  As the Minister will be aware, County Monaghan has a strong tradition of food production the mushroom, poultry and pig sectors.  The waste that those plants generate currently cost farmers between &euro;15 and &euro;16 per tonne to remove from their sites.  Perhaps if that particular product was dried, turned into pellets and some value added then that could be the future of fertiliser not just for ourselves in this country but for export.  One would imagine that option would be a much more environmentally friendly solution or substitute for fertiliser in the long run.  We should explore that option and I am interested in the Minister's comments on how we can explore the possibility of using the waste while solving a problem for the farming community.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021120800002#B00500","speaker":"1658","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638959400,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this issue.  He has his finger on the pulse regarding the importance of this issue for farmers and the fact that it will be a significant issue in the year ahead.  We have found that to be the case during the autumn.  There is no doubt that the situation has become more acute in terms of the inflation we are seeing and, indeed, it is going to be a significant factor for 2022.<\/p> <p>Ireland, as a member of the EU, supports an open, rules-based trading environment.   However, we recognise the need to ensure that agreed trade rules are applied uniformly with full transparency to ensure that wider commercial interests are maintained, and that EU industry is not unfairly disadvantaged as a result of third-country trade practices that might distort EU internal market dynamics, particularly referring to the issue of fertiliser, fertiliser tariffs, and anti-dumping tariffs and their role in pricing.  It is for that reason that the European Commission operates a comprehensive trade defence system that seeks to strike an appropriate balance between user and producer interests when there is clear evidence that trading practices in foreign jurisdictions are having a distorting effect within the Single Market. <\/p> <p>These trade defence instruments can include the application of duties on goods.  This is the case in a number of fertiliser products, specifically urea and ammonium nitrate, UAN, and ammonium nitrate, being imported into the EU from a number of third countries.  Anti-dumping fixed rate duties range from &euro;22.24 per tonne to &euro;42.47 per tonne.  These duties are imposed on UAN that originates from Russia, Trinidad and Tobago and the US.  As the latest measures were imposed in 2019, no full review of these measures is expected until 2024.<\/p> <p>Ammonium nitrate, which is a key ingredient in calcium ammonium nitrate, CAN, is one of the main types of fertiliser that are used by many Irish farmers.  Anti-dumping fixed rate duties range from &euro;28.78 per tonne to &euro;32.71 per tonne and are imposed on products that originate from Russia.  As the latest measures were imposed in 2020, no review of these measures is expected until 2025.  However, as provided for in EU regulations, an interim review can be initiated once the current measures have been in place for one year.<\/p> <p>As has been discussed in this House in the past month, it is quite clear that there has been a sharp increase in fertiliser prices over the past year, particularly in recent months as pointed out by the Senator.  I am very conscious of the impact that these price increases have had at farm level.  The fertiliser market is driven by global supply and demand with several factors that influence the price of fertilisers.  The major driving factors for the increase in prices over the recent period has been the increase in the price of raw material and the cost of energy production.  There is also protectionism by global players and issues with the supply of certain fertiliser products.<\/p> <p>The imposition of the anti-dumping tariffs from certain third countries is an additional, albeit secondary, factor when imported into the EU from these producing countries.  At the November meeting of the Agriculture and Fisheries Council, I raised the increasing challenge faced by farmers around fertiliser prices.  I called on the EU Commission to consider all options to ease the pressure on farmers at this time, including the question of whether the imposition of anti-dumping duties on fertiliser imports continues to be appropriate.  Indeed, I called for this matter to be examined as a priority.  Last week, I wrote to the EU Commissioner for Agriculture, Mr. Janusz Wojciechowski, asking him to finalise the Commission's examination of the tariffs.<\/p> <p>With fertiliser prices constituting such a high portion of farmers' expenditure, I am aware that the impact of rising fertiliser prices will very much have a negative effect on farmers' incomes.  Ireland will remain a fertiliser price-taker in this regard as no fertilisers are manufactured in Ireland, rather fertiliser companies blend a number of imported fertiliser products into different compositions that are suitable for agricultural use in Ireland.<\/p> <p>In line with the farm to fork strategy at European level, the climate action plan commits to a more targeted and reduced use of chemical nitrogen fertiliser over the time ahead, while maintaining the same level of grass produced through more use of multi-species sward and clover swards, for example.  I engage regularly with the farming organisations and have introduced a number of initiatives to support farmers to reduce their dependence on chemical fertiliser such as the planting of multi-species sward and introduced a support for that.  Recently, I also introduced a pilot soil sampling programme.  Additionally, I have asked Teagasc to develop a roadmap for farmers to reduce the use of chemical fertilisers on farms.  I expect to be able to publish this report before the end of next year.<\/p> <p>Finally, the Senator made a specific suggestion for the constituency of Cavan-Monaghan, which I will deal with in my further response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021120800002#C00200","speaker":"1546"},{"type":"speech","time":1638959400,"counter":18,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his comprehensive response.  He has been on the ball on this matter, which he demonstrated when he outlined his contacts with the EU.  I am sure that he understands and accepts that this is a serious matter.  This is a particularly worrying time for the farming community as the price of fertiliser is rocketing.  Ultimately, what is bad news for the farmer will end up being bad news for us all.  The long-term strategy is to reduce the use of fertiliser and nitrates, which is important and I understand that Teagasc is working on a long-term plan.  However, the most immediate problem needs an urgent response.  I have every confidence in the Minister that something positive will come from his negotiations with the EU.<\/p> <p>In conclusion, I look forward to his response to my suggestion concerning the waste generated by food production plants in County Monaghan.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021120800002#C00300","speaker":"1658"},{"type":"speech","time":1638959400,"counter":19,"content":"<p>The anti-dumping tariff ranges from &euro;28 per tonne to &euro;32 per tonne for CAN, which is now a smaller portion of the overall cost because fertiliser prices have rocketed.  At the start of this year the tariff was 10% of the price but because prices have rocketed the tariff is now a smaller portion.  Nonetheless, it is another cost for farmers and I am determined to address this issue at European level.  At national level, we have a lot of latent capacity in how efficiently we use organic fertiliser.  There is a particular supply in Cavan-Monaghan as it is a region that is at the beating heart of the poultry sector at a national level.  The constituency has significant pig, dairy and other sectors.  How we use that efficiently and ensure farmers seek to replace chemical fertilisers with a better use of organic fertilisers will be important and I have given the task to Teagasc.  Professor Frank O'Mara and his team are doing a lot work on how we can advise farmers to best use organic fertilisers in the time ahead, and how we can ensure that there is more collaboration between farm types so that the poultry sector, for example, can work with the livestock or tillage sectors to make the most use of such fertilisers.<\/p> <p>The Senator used a word that is often used when talking about organic fertiliser, which is \"waste\".  That is used in respect of the poultry sector.  That has been the terminology used over the years and we must change that around so people view waste as a valuable resource.  We must ensure that such waste is sought after and demanded by farmers because it is a powerful organic fertiliser, which we very much value.  I want lots of progress in this area over the course of this year and next.  That is a key way in which we can, hopefully, try to mitigate the very real pressure generated by chemical fertiliser prices.<\/p> <p>Finally, I again thank the Senator for raising this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021120800002#C00400","speaker":"1546"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"United Nations","time":1638959400,"counter":20,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021120800002#D00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1638959400,"counter":21,"content":"<p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it.  The context of the matter I raise today is that Ireland pays more than &euro;300 million per annum towards the cost of running the United Nations.  Within that framework of the United Nations, special rapporteurs are regularly appointed and given a remit to examine and report on a specific human rights matter of broad concern worldwide or a matter specific to a particular country.  Examples might include child poverty internationally or specific human rights abuses in a particular country or region.  These rapporteurs are appointed by the UN Human Rights Council and they are usually lawyers considered to be independent human rights experts.<\/p><p>According to the UN Human Rights Council, these rapporteurs undertake country visits, act on individual cases of reported violations by sending communications to states, seek information, contribute to the development of international human rights standards, engage in advocacy and so on.  These positions are unpaid and there are three-year mandates that can be renewed for a further three years.  As of last October, there were 58 such mandates.  Given the nature of this role, it is vital these rapporteurs carry out these tasks without fear or favour and are beholden to no master.  That is why the positions are unpaid and there is a code of conduct that applies to special rapporteurs binding them to &quot;objectivity and non-selectivity in the consideration of human rights issues, and the elimination of double standards and politicisation&quot;.<\/p><p>The reason this objectivity is demanded is very clear and obvious.  The conclusions these rapporteurs come to can have significant impacts on the position of the United Nations and the UN Human Rights Council on many controversial matters.  It can have a positive and negative impact on the reputations of individual member states and their governments.  There should not be any conflicts of interest, and this brings me to the matter I raise today.<\/p><p>Earlier this year, the European Centre for Law and Justice, ECLJ, a well-known and respected non-governmental organisation, NGO, based in Strasbourg, published a report indicating some shocking practices relating to these special rapporteurs.  Much of this information was in the public domain but it was gathered by the ECLJ as part of an exhaustive research process it conducted.  It found various private foundations, NGOs, state governments and private corporations are spending huge amounts to influence these special rapporteurs and, in some cases, to recruit them in the first place.  There were 121 special rapporteurs appointed between 2015 and 2019 and 37 of those received payments totalling $11 million outside any UN control from private foundations and NGOs, including the Ford Foundation, the Open Society Foundation of George Soros and other anonymous donors.<\/p><p>It is a matter of public record that the UN special rapporteur on extreme poverty, Mr. Philip Alston, was paid $600,000 by the Open Society Foundation in 2018 and 2019 alone through various grants and yet only declared $5,000 to the United Nations.  An Irish lawyer, Professor Fionnuala N&iacute; Aol&aacute;in, has held special rapporteur positions while concurrently being the chairperson of an Open Society Foundation project.  There are myriad other examples in the report of the European Centre for Law and Justice, which is available on its website.<\/p><p>It seems there has been widespread knowledge of these practices for many years but a culture of <i>omerta<\/i>seems to have grown, so the publication of the report has caused some stir.  The problem is this: the Open Society Foundations, the Ford Foundation and other such groups are not independent and disinterested actors when it comes to certain human rights issues.  They often have very particular positions on controversial matters such as marriage rights, the right to life, assisted suicide, religious freedom, religious ethos in education, transgender rights and so on.  They spend vast amounts in financing campaigns advancing those views.<\/p><p>Is the Government aware of the ECLJ report to which I have referred?  Is it aware of the allegations made about financial influence being exerted over the holders of such positions?  Has this Government made any representations in this regard?  Is the Irish Government ever consulted when it is proposed to appoint an Irish citizen as a special rapporteur?  What monitoring takes place within the Minister of State's Department on the operation of the United Nations Human Rights Council?  The Minister of State would surely agree we should insist on proper ethical standards, given Ireland pays more than &euro;300 million per annum towards the cost of running the UN.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021120800002#D00200","speaker":"1673"},{"type":"speech","time":1638959400,"counter":22,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Seanad&oacute;ir as ucht an t-&aacute;bhar seo a ard&uacute; inniu.  We believe the offices of the UN special rapporteurs receive adequate funding to allow them to implement their important mandates fully and in an independent manner.<\/p> <p>As the Senator will be well aware, respect for human rights and the promotion of human rights is, and will continue to be, a cornerstone of our foreign policy.  Ireland plays an active role in promoting and protecting human rights at the United Nations, primarily through our consistent engagement in the Human Rights Council in Geneva and at the Third Committee of the General Assembly in New York but also through our membership this term of the UN Security Council.<\/p> <p>The UN special procedures, including the special rapporteurs, independent experts and members of the working groups play a critical role in protecting and promoting human rights.  They are independent human rights experts with mandates to report and advise on human rights from a thematic or country-specific perspective.  The system of special procedures is a central element of the United Nations human rights machinery and covers all human rights, including civil, cultural, economic, political, and social.<\/p> <p>The independent status of the mandate holders is crucial for them to be able to fulfil their functions in an impartial manner as guided by the code of conduct adopted by the Human Rights Council.  It is a testament to the strength of civil society in Ireland that of 45 thematic and 13 country mandates, five prominent Irish experts are currently serving as special rapporteurs or working group members.  These are Ms Mary Lawlor, special rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders; Professor Fionnuala N&iacute; Aol&aacute;in, as mentioned by the Senator, who is doing very good work as special rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism; Ms Siobh&aacute;n Mullally, special rapporteur on trafficking in persons, especially in women and children; Mr. Gerard Quinn, special rapporteur on the rights of persons with disabilities; and Ms Anita Ramasastry, member of the working group on the issue of human rights and transnational corporations and other business enterprises.<\/p> <p>I am conscious that the international human rights system is facing a triple threat.  First, across the world we see growing evidence of conflict and abuses and violations of human rights.  In some countries we are seeing a pushback by states against the fundamental concept of universal human rights for all individuals.  Second, the Covid-19 pandemic has created additional challenges and, in particular, has severely restricted the opportunities for special rapporteurs to undertake essential country visits.  Third, the human rights system of the United Nations is severely underfunded, with the Office of the High Commissioner on Human Rights receiving only 3.7% of the budget we proportionately pay into that was mentioned by the Senator.<\/p> <p>Against this background, Ireland remains committed to supporting the independent mandate of the special rapporteurs and to protecting that mandate in the face of growing pressure from those countries and organisations that would seek to reduce their influence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021120800002#D00300","speaker":"1503"},{"type":"speech","time":1638959400,"counter":23,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his response and, of course, I agree with much of what he has said about the need for such special rapporteurs to receive adequate funding and the importance of their role.  I question whether they can be as independent as he says when it is a matter of public record, for example, that the Open Society Foundation donated $137,000 to Amnesty International to fund a pro-abortion campaign.  Should we not be concerned when organisations that campaign on such issues are making huge payments to supposedly independent special rapporteurs at the UN level.<\/p> <p>The Minister of State agrees that if he left office or the D&aacute;il in the morning, as a matter of law now there would need to be a decontamination period before he could take up advocacy in the private sector.  In a very similar way we could argue that, as occurred in the case of Professor N&iacute; Aol&aacute;in, there should be no question of a person being concurrently a chairperson and, I presume, in the pay of an Open Society Foundation project while also supposedly acting as an independent UN special rapporteur.  There is an apparent conflict of interest and the Minister of State's response to me, with all due respect to the Government, does not address it.<\/p> <p>I am interested in finding out whether the Government knows about the ECLJ report and if there is anything in the report that worries the Government.  Does the Government propose to look at it now in light of what I have brought up?  Is the Government consulted when it comes to the appointment of special rapporteurs from this country?

I appreciate his time.  I have submitted a Commencement matter to call for the publication of the Indecon report on disabilities.  The Minister of State will be aware that I was the Minister in 2018 when the Cabinet was good enough to give the money to do the research.  As with most of us, I can see daily that the social welfare supports on offer from the Department of Social Protection and various other Departments do not really cut the mustard when it comes to recognising the extra costs incurred by people with disabilities.  I am pleased, therefore, that we are welcoming this morning the publication of the report late last night and the statement from the Department of Social Protection.<\/p> <p>The aim of the report and research was to gain a better understanding of the costs faced by people with disabilities daily.  It is not just a question of money, although money is incredibly important and although we need to, and be seen to, put our money where our mouth is.  The additional costs are unaffordable to those with disabilities, as borne out by the research.  The research shows the genuine challenges associated with independent living and the risk of high poverty and social exclusion among people with a disability who are lucky enough to be able to live independently.  It shows that the increased payments, access to services and the provision of targeted grants programmes actually work, and it highlights the fact that the approach needs to be more targeted and effective.  It shows the difficulties faced by people with a disability in accessing employment and the significant challenge faced by employers who are willing to take on people with a disability in ensuring the process is smooth.  It also shows that additional supports are needed for those most in need.  Those who have a disability face the most deprivation.  We need to challenge and change our payments system and allowances to recognise that people have different kinds of disabilities and, therefore, different costs associated with living their normal lives.<\/p> <p>We need to recognise the loss of earnings and sacrifices of families who are offering care and support.  In many cases where a child is disabled, the parents have to stay at home.  In a significant number of families, parents, including elderly parents, care for an adult with a disability in the home.  The most important aspect of the report to me is its highlighting of the mistakes of the past in not making every scheme, support or service the State offers central to the individuals we are here to recognise and support.<\/p> <p>I welcome the publication of the report.  I was the person who had the privilege of ensuring it would feed into the practical changes in policy associated with the commitment in the programme for Government.  Therefore, I am genuinely dismayed that the report will be sent to a steering group, the national disability inclusion strategy steering group.  I mean no disrespect to the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Rabbitte, who has been doing incredible and mighty work in this area for the past 18 months.  The Taoiseach's office absolutely needs to take the lead and co-ordinate a coherent response across all Departments.  The Taoiseach is the only person who has the power and might to make sure every single Secretary General of a Department responsible for providing disability services and every single Minister will come together under a special Cabinet sub-committee to ensure there are quarterly reports related to the recommendations in the report and that everybody will be held to account.  This is not just about the Department of Social Protection although we absolutely need to see an increase in the budget next year for people with disabilities; it is also about a coherent Government response and living up to the commitment we made in the programme for Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021120800002#E01600","speaker":"1653"},{"type":"speech","time":1638959400,"counter":53,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Doherty for raising this issue and for all her work on it in her previous role.  The cost of disability is the extra cost faced by people with a disability in their day-to-day lives that others in society do not face.  This extra cost is a direct result of the person's disability and would not arise otherwise.<\/p> <p>Research conducted in Ireland and internationally over many years has shown that there can be significant costs associated with disability.  As the Senator is aware, to gain a better understanding of these costs the Department of Social Protection commissioned Indecon to conduct an independent cost-of-disability study.  The report was presented to the Cabinet and published yesterday, as the Senator has noted.<\/p> <p>The programme for Government commits the entire Government to use the research into the cost of disability to individuals and families to properly inform the direction of future policy.  The Senator mentioned the Minister of State responsible for disabilities, Deputy Rabbitte.  This matter of costs and disability allowances falls under the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Humphreys, at this juncture, but it is obviously a whole-of-government consideration.  The Minister, Deputy Humphreys, apologises for not being able to be here.<\/p> <p>This report confirms earlier studies that show that people with disabilities face significant additional living costs by comparison with people without disabilities.  While some of the costs are met by the State, further improvements cannot be delivered through income supports alone and require the broader perspective the Senator spoke about.  The research finds that costs vary across several dimensions, including age, the severity and nature of the disability, and household type.  There is no one single or typical cost of disability but, rather, a range of costs.  Indecon estimated this range, using both a costs-studies method and an equivalence approach.  The cost-studies method is based on over 4,734 responses to a survey of people with disabilities.  The equivalence approach applies econometric techniques to data from the annual survey of income and living conditions of the Central Statistics Office.<\/p> <p>Indecon, using both a direct-costs approach and an income-equivalence approach, estimated that the overall average annual cost of disability in Ireland ranges from &euro;9,482 per annum to &euro;11,734 per annum.  Additional costs of disability go across several areas of expenditure, including: housing; equipment, aids and appliances; mobility, transport and communications; medicines; care and assistance services; and additional living expenses.<\/p> <p>The report recommends that additional costs of disability should be based on a multifaceted approach involving increased cash payments, enhanced access to service provision, and specific targeted grant programmes.  The report also recommends that disability payment levels should reflect the very different costs that arise depending on the type and severity of disability.  Furthermore, the concentration of any additional supports should be targeted at those most in need and who face the greatest additional costs.  The report also highlights that increasing employment opportunities for people with disabilities should be a priority.<\/p> <p>This matter is significantly wider than the income-support system under the Minister for Social Protection, as implied by Senator Doherty, and it is clear that the solution will not be found in a specific income-support payment.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Thomas Byrne:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2203\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2203&amp;amp;pid=ThomasByrne&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=08\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The findings contained in the report have implications for many areas of public policy, including delivery of care, health, housing, education, transport and income supports.

The Government is keen to address the concerns raised by the people who live the daily reality of disability and it will use the results of this research to inform measures to address the issue of cost.  People with disabilities have widely differing needs and the extra costs of disability do not arise to the same extent in every case.  Basic standard income support is unlikely to address properly the costs incurred by those most severely limited by disability.  As we have said, measures should be based on a multifaceted approach.  The approach taken will be the one most suitable to improving the economic and social position of people with disabilities.  The Government has agreed that the national disability inclusion strategy steering group will consider it.  The group is chaired by the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, who has responsibility for disability across Government.  Actions taken across all Departments will be monitored bi-annually through the process.  The next meeting will take place on 15 December and Indecon will present the report to stakeholders.<\/p> <p>It is important to acknowledge that the Government is already taking or has committed to take many actions under the national disability inclusion strategy, Pathways to Work, the roadmap for social inclusion and Sl&aacute;intecare that will improve living standards and outcomes for people with disabilities.  As the Senator will probably agree, the Taoiseach has a track record of advocating for people with disabilities and getting involved in the minutiae of policy across a range of Departments, so I have no doubt he will be highly involved in this.  Although the group will be chaired by the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, the Taoiseach takes a very keen interest in disability issues and is keen to get results from this and the Government in that regard.  The Government will continue to take positive steps to ensure people with disabilities have the opportunity and the supports necessary to play a full part in society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021120800002#F00300","speaker":"1503"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1638959400,"counter":57,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 11.23 a.m. and resumed at 11.30 a.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"An tOrd Gn\u00f3 - Order of Business","time":1638959400,"counter":58,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021120800002#G00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1638959400,"counter":59,"content":"<p>The Order of Business is No. 1, Official Languages (Amendment) Bill 2019 - Report and Final Stages, to be taken at 1 p.m. and the proceedings thereon shall, if not previously concluded, to be brought to a conclusion at 3.30 p.m. by the putting of one question from the Chair which shall, in relation to amendments, include only those set down or accepted by the Government; No. 2, Houses of the Oireachtas Commission (Amendment) Bill 2021 - Second Stage, to be taken at 3.45 p.m. and to conclude no later than 5.15 p.m., with the time allocated to the opening remarks of the Minister not to exceed ten minutes, group spokespersons not to exceed seven minutes, all other Senators not to exceed four minutes and the Minister to be given no less than ten minutes to reply to the debate; No. 3, motion regarding the Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund Regulations 2021, to be taken at 5.30 p.m. and to conclude no later than 6.30 p.m., with the time allocated to the opening remarks of the Minister not to exceed six minutes, all other Senators not to exceed four minutes and the Minister to be given no less than six minutes to reply to the debate; and No. 88, motion 2, motion regarding the Antarctic Treaty, to be taken at 7 p.m., with the time allocated to this debate not to exceed two hours.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021120800002#G00200","speaker":"1642"},{"type":"speech","time":1638959400,"counter":60,"content":"<p>I second the Order of Business as proposed by Senator Chambers.  I wish to bring up a few issues today.  Under the Order of Business last week, I brought up the lack of garda&iacute; on the streets of Newbridge.  Making our streets safe and secure is a huge issue around the country.  When comparing three towns within the midlands; I mentioned that Portlaoise and Tullamore have 160 and 73 members of the Garda, respectively, while Newbridge has 44 garda&iacute;, of whom ten are in a regional unit and so effectively only has 34.  That is simply not good enough.  Twice I have tried to put this in as a Commencement matter, and I accept the Cathaoirleach's ruling that it cannot be put in for the Minister for Justice.  However, I attended a joint policing committee, JPC, meeting on Monday evening at which Garda Commissioner Drew Harris was present and while I put in that question twice, I did not get a response.  My point is we must have some type of forum where we can discuss and bring up issues around Garda numbers.  If we believe the people we are representing are not adequately served in terms of Garda numbers, we must have that facility.  We might possibly have the Minister here to have a debate about the general issue of keeping our streets safe and secure.  We talk about it quite a bit in terms of incidents that happen and violence on our streets.  If we do not have our streets lit by our local authorities, and Kildare County Council is at fault in Newbridge because some of the lighting is substandard, and if we do not have enough garda&iacute; on the beat, there is a serious problem. <\/p> <p>I also raise the serious lack of testing capacity at Punchestown Racecourse, which covers both north and south Kildare.  For example, a parent of a child who had symptoms of Covid contacted me. She was not comfortable returning her child to school until a negative PCR test was received, which is very responsible parenting and shows thinking of everybody within the community.  The parent monitored the website for a few days, waiting for an appointment, and nothing.  Portlaoise was also booked up.  The closest available appointment was quite a distance away, in Tullamore, a journey of more than an hour.  That is a long way to bring a sick child, but also is very difficult if somebody does not have private transport.  I have also heard reports of people being left queuing in the freezing cold with young children.  At the end of last week, County Kildare's 14-day Covid-19 incidence rate was above the national average.  The HSE needs to intervene and adequately resource our testing facilities, or possibly set up another testing facility in Newbridge in south Kildare, which is what it did before.  Our testing capacity needs to be increased.  We need to ensure that people who need a PCR test get one as quickly as possible.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021120800002#G00300","speaker":"1689"},{"type":"speech","time":1638959400,"counter":61,"content":"<p>On that Commencement matter, I regret that I had to rule it out of order.

While most of these children would not become seriously ill, the problem with them getting Covid is that they bring it home and bring it to vulnerable adults and older relations.  In some instances, they themselves would be vulnerable and in danger and of course, this also affects their teachers.  It is a very important advance and the key lies in vaccination.  It is important that Members welcome it.

This was a remarkable year in that we set legal limits and targets, and there will be a carbon budget in each Department.  This House should have a debate soon on the minutia, the practical solutions.  I wish to offer three practical solutions.  As with the co-operative model of old, we should have a wind turbine in each community.  Communities should be urged to do it as it would provide their own energy supply which could be fed into the grid through which they might even make money for their communities.  It would introduce them to the concept of the green agenda, climate change, etc., which is important.<\/p><p>First-time car purchasers should get a significant reduction in VRT if they buy electric.  If they start with an electric car, they will buy into the concept and will never leave an electric car.  They will also feel ownership of the climate change agenda.<\/p><p>Each farm in the country has a few non-arable acres not in use.  That should be planted, as was the case with a little shelter belt which would be a carbon sink.  We should incentivise farmers to do that as a priority.  I commend those three recommendations to the House and in that context, I call for a debate on the minutia.  As we have now set the targets, let us get on with doing it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021120800002#G00500","speaker":"1692","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638959400,"counter":64,"content":"<p>The concerns I had that the proposed three-year review of the 2018 abortion legislation would not be impartial have only grown since hearing what the Minister for Health had to say this morning.  From the outset he continued to speak of his concern about widening access to abortion.  When the official from the Department of Health spoke about the supposedly independent chair this morning, she stressed the need for a candidate with an approach of sexual and reproductive rights.  This has been a consistent byword for pro-choice or pro-abortion, whichever one wishes to call it.  The use by the official, Ms Luddy in this case, of that term raises concern in me and in many other people about whether there will be any independence at all.<\/p><p>The Government and perhaps this House might not mind being reminded that in 2018 we removed a constitutional right to life for the unborn child, but we did not create a constitutional right to abortion.  The Constitution now states that &quot;Provision may be made by law for the regulation of termination of pregnancy&quot;.  It follows from that that any independent review of the legislation should hear impartially about whether the law ought to be restricted or extended.  Given the major increase in the number of abortions that have taken place since the legislation was introduced, there is a very strong case to be made for modifications of the law, for example, in the direction of precautionary pain relief for late-term abortion situations and indeed promoting alternatives to abortion.<\/p><p>There is no evidence that the Government has any respect for that point of view.  From what was said at the committee this morning there is no evidence that it has any interest in having a genuinely independent chair.  That is a disgrace and people need to raise their voices about it.<\/p><p>On another human rights matter, the United States and Australia are now calling for a diplomatic boycott of the Winter Olympics in Beijing.  I know that our Minister will not be present, but our Government needs to be much stronger in coming out in favour of a full diplomatic boycott.  That means no officials from our State turning up.  It also means that the Olympic Federation of Ireland should not be represented.  I do not want to deny the small number of athletes we have their chance to compete for Olympic glory, but in the circumstances they should not do so under an Irish flag.  What is the Government's position?  Normally, it is happy to follow the lead of a Democratic Administration in the United States.  America is leading the way on this one; will Ireland follow?  Along with other Senators I wrote to the chair of the Olympic Federation of Ireland last year expressing our concern.  We did not even get a response from the then chair, Sarah Keane.  Will the Government show any interest in pursuing the matter further?  <\/p><p>The <i>Service Central des Courses et Jeux<\/i>, which is the branch of the police in France that deals with cheating and abuses in racing and competition, recently arrested several racehorse trainers and vets.  Does anything like that ever happen in Ireland?  The Cathaoirleach introduced a very interesting initiative to allow the Chairs of committees to appear before this House.  I ask that the Chairman of the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and Marine, Deputy Cahill, would appear before us to discuss that committee's recently completed report into horse racing in Ireland.  It raises issues about the need for protocols to prevent doping in horse racing but also issues about the governance of the very body responsible for integrity in the sport, the Irish Horse Racing Regulatory Board.<\/p><p>I am conscious that I have gone over time and I thank you for allowing me, a Chathaoirligh.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021120800002#H00200","speaker":"1673"},{"type":"speech","time":1638959400,"counter":65,"content":"<p>I wish to clarify for the Senator that the concept is to invite a committee Chair to appear before the House about six months after such a report is published.

We are reviewing laws that have already been enacted.  That is the difference.<\/p><p>I wish to raise the issue of animal welfare and live exports which have been raised by members of the animal welfare policy group in my own party.  Significant concerns were raised this week about the <i>Finola M<\/i>vessel which was travelling from Ireland to Libya with livestock on board when it got caught in the middle of Storm Barra.  A vessel of this size should not be travelling with livestock onboard in wind speeds greater than 6 knots.  The wind speed actually got to 30 knots with waves peaking at 24 ft. with animals on board.  This is of major concern.  It has now docked.  Having done more investigation since these reports were brought to me, I have ascertained that there was no vet on board.  Vets are not on board these vessels at the moment due to the pandemic.  We need to ensure that these animals have correct veterinary protection at the very least.  It is outrageous to have animals on these vessels for ten days or two weeks.  We need to re-examine the live exports of animals over long distances if we really value our animal husbandry.<\/p><p>I welcome the decision by the Minister for Education to provide &euro;50 million on high-efficiency particulate absorbing, HEPA, filters.  Last week when the Minister was in the House, I said that the report from March had indicated that many schools would benefit from HEPA filters.  These filtration systems are well worth the money for the air quality they provide.  Quite apart from us being in the middle of a pandemic, they help those with asthma.  I welcome that the Minister has taken on board the concerns of teachers and parents about mask wearing.  My concern was that a small child does not always make decisions.  We need to ensure they are getting access to an education irrespective of whether their parents are for or against mask wearing.  We need to convey the message that vaccination and mask wearing are all good things, but let us also ensure that every child gets an education.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021120800002#H00400","speaker":"1693"},{"type":"speech","time":1638959400,"counter":67,"content":"<p>I commend and thank the front-line workers in the emergency services and across statutory agencies who have been out during Storm Barra and no doubt will be out again, unfortunately, over the rest of the winter dealing with adverse weather events.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Niall &Oacute; Donnghaile:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2477\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2477&amp;amp;pid=NiallODonnghaile&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=08\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->While acknowledging and thanking them for their work is important, we might give some thought across the Chamber to how we might do an item of work that would support those on the front line.

Under that strategy it is planned to more than 100,000 homes over the next 15 years, of which at least one third will be social homes.  It is planned that high-quality social and affordable homes for families and workers will be built in record-breaking numbers.  We, as Members of the Seanad, should call for Ministers, North and South, to engage through the North-South Ministerial  Council to learn about best practice and how to effectively deal with the housing crisis.<\/p><p>The Minister for Further and Higher Education, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, was in Derry last week for a series of engagements on North-South co-operation in the field of further and higher education and third-level education.  It is an important area of work that often gets overlooked in terms of its development.  It was encouraging to hear that from the Minister and the Government.

While what will be will be in terms of the committee, we should ensure particular emphasis is given to the issue of Brexit in this Chamber and we keep a watching brief on that issue.  The Minister has been very good in facilitating our requests for statements.  In the context of everything else that is going on, we should ensure we do not take our eye off the ball on this issue.

I was disappointed that in the discussion at the Joint Committee on Health today the Minister indicated the policy of the Act would not be reviewed only the operations of the Act.  The operations of abortion rights are always contested worldwide.  I certainly do not think the women of Ireland will be happy that women are being left behind.  We fought for the rights of women in the North and will continue to fight for them and for the women who are travelling and being left behind by the operation of the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act 2018.  People will not be happy that the review will be simply limited to the operations of the Act.<\/p> <p>I want to raise with the Deputy Leader the issue of a housing co-operative and housing supply in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  Last week, councillors in D&uacute;n Laoghaire got word that a contractor has pulled out of a contract to build 42 houses.  Under the model of housing co-operatives, eight people were due to buy those houses as well as a housing association, Co-Operative Housing Ireland, which is taking over the other units.  It is very disappointing at this late stage when the contractor was meant to be turning sod and to be on-site before Christmas that it has pulled out.  This is a problem.  It is important to have a debate on housing.  Targets are set in Rebuilding Ireland.  If we cannot get a contractor to build a simple development of 42 housing units in D&uacute;n Laoghaire that has been planned and worked on for three years, I do not know how the housing targets that have been set to address our housing crisis will be met.<\/p> <p>I want to raise an local issue.  Over the weekend the Dublin Flea Market announced it was closing and ceasing operations.  I have known about this for a number of months having worked with those involved in it alongside Councillor Claire Byrne to try to find a place for it operate, but it is still very disappointing.  Not only did the flea market have a place for Dubliners to come and pull together, it provided an essential microenterprise space for people to chance their arm and set up a business.  Many successful businesses have grown from the flea market.  As somebody who comes from Newmarket in Dublin 8 and attended the flea market for many years from when it first started in the depths of the recession, it is very disappointing we could not find a solution and a space for it.  The loss of market spaces to the city is great.  I particularly want to mention Sharon Greene who was driving force behind it.  I express my thanks to Sharon, Aisling, Luca and Dave for all they created in the ten years we have had the Dublin Flea Market.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021120800002#J00200","speaker":"1672"},{"type":"speech","time":1638959400,"counter":70,"content":"<p>I very much welcome the approval by An Bord Plean&aacute;la yesterday for the Galway city outer ring road.  This has been long promised for Galway, going back decades at this stage.  It is frightening that every other city, Cork, Limerick, Waterford, Dublin and smaller areas and towns have developed their road network, yet we have been left in the ha&rsquo;penny place.  Traffic is such an issue in Galway city that when representatives of American and European companies have come to invest in the city they have opted to establish their companies in Limerick or Cork, mainly due to the traffic congestion.  That is a fact.  The lack of a bypass has damaged the local economy significantly.  As a public representative I would have no problem in promoting in public transport and cycling, but Galway city's population will increase to 130,000 by 2040.  Our road network is incapable of handling the current volume of traffic not to mention when the population growth will be taken into account.  That has shown to be the case during the past 20 years.  Galway&rsquo;s current poor road infrastructure is a disservice to the people of the region, a major threat to the regional economy and it is a considerable risk to the future development of the capital of the west, as the Deputy Leader will know the city.  Not alone does it not serve Galway city it does not serve the 40,000 people based in Connemara.  The road is part of the programme for Government.

The ring road is pivotal.  I made a submission to the oral hearing at the time.  In August 2020, I  wrote to An Bord Plean&aacute;la asking it to re-establish the oral hearing in order to conclude it, it having been suspended due to the Covid-19 pandemic.  Thankfully, it did that and the oral hearing was concluded towards the end of 2020.  The ring road is vital to the long-term infrastructural needs of the city and county, for proper growth and development of the city and county, for access to Connemara and tourism, and to increase the potential of companies to set up and establish in Galway city .  If CEOs of multinationals arrive into Dublin Airport, Shannon Airport or Ireland West Airport Knock, get to the outskirts of Galway city and then spend an hour travelling to the city before they get to parts of Connemara, how can we expect them to establish in the city?  This is a momentous decision for Galway as the regional capital of the west.  I hope the Government will pursue and conclude this project and bring it to construction.  The previous Fine Gael-Independent Government agreed this at Cabinet in October 2018.  Some &euro;588 million was committed to it at that stage.  I hope and expect this Government will not be found wanting in progressing this plan.

I find it slightly ironic that Senator Pauline O'Reilly talked about animal welfare straight after talking about abortion and had no thought for the welfare of the unborn.  There are legitimate concerns that the Government's three-year review of the new abortion laws will be a missed opportunity.  To date, the Minister for Health has met only with abortion-supporting groups about the process.  The public are entitled to better than a pretend public consultation process that has all the appearance of listening to people's concerns but is nothing more than a public relations exercise with a prearranged outcome.  The Minister must demonstrate by his actions that he is not listening just to one side of the debate.  The three-year review must look at Ireland's spiralling abortion rate as a priority and at other troubling effects of the new law such as the fact that no protocols are in place on how to care for babies who survive late-term abortions.  In the first two years of the new law coming into effect in 2019, 13,243 abortions took place.  That is a massive 70% increase in the number of abortions in two years.  The Government's three-year review is an opportunity to scrutinise what has happened and ask some really hard questions about the new law and the changes that are needed.  The recent finding by Am&aacute;rach Research that 89% of the public support women being offered information about alternatives before proceeding with an abortion is welcome.  Another important finding from the recently published Am&aacute;rach poll is that 77% of the public support an amendment to the abortion law to ensure that babies who survive late-term abortions are given medical and palliative care and not left to die alone.  The Government has already acknowledged that it is aware of the UCC study that pointed to the fact that babies have survived the abortion procedure under the new law and have been left to die unaided.  One in three people voted for abortion in 2018.  The recent Am&aacute;rach polls show that the overwhelming majority of the public backs proposals to be put forward by the pro-life movement as part of the three-year review.  The Government needs to acknowledge this support and invite pro-life representatives into the decision-making process rather than shutting them out, as is currently the case.  I hope the chair who will be appointed next year will take pro-life views into consideration.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021120800002#K00100","speaker":"1664"},{"type":"speech","time":1638959400,"counter":73,"content":"<p>I wish to return to an issue on which my colleague, Senator Gallagher, had a Commencement matter this morning, for which the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy McConalogue, was in the House.  I compliment the Minister, who has been doing a lot of work on this.  I refer to the spiralling cost of fertiliser for farmers.  While we all want to promote organic fertilisers and ensure we do all this type of work in a more environmentally friendly way, the fact is that farmers cannot produce food without using some nitrogen.  I do not know how many people are aware of this, but most fertilisers farmers use have doubled in price since last year, mainly due to global gas prices, which is outside our control.  Two of the fertilisers farmers use a lot are calcium ammonium nitrate, CAN, which contains 27% nitrogen, and urea.  Both those fertilisers have doubled in price.  It is just not possible for many farmers to purchase fertilisers any more.  If you take into consideration the fact that 60% of grass growth occurs before the month of May, you can see that the time span here is very short.  There is one thing that can be done.  There are tariffs on fertilisers imported from outside the EU.  We have been looking - I know the Minister has been looking at this as well - at getting those tariffs reduced if at all possible, even for a short period, in order to bring down the price of fertilisers.  If the farmers cannot produce the food, in a very short space of time we could find ourselves having food shortages.

Having the flood relief scheme in Bantry brought forward is a massive issue for the town.  You cannot realistically have viable, thriving trade if the town will be flooded continuously.  Four floods in 18 months is unbelievable.  Having talked to the traders this morning, I understand they have never seen such a prolonged flood in the history of the town.  We have a huge issue in making sure that infrastructure and towns such as Bantry will be protected from storms coming in.  <\/p> <p>A debate is required with the Minister of State with responsibility for the OPW about how he hopes to progress these schemes.  They are very important.  Flood defence schemes in particular need to be progressed.  We have seen changes in weather patterns and storms come in regularly.  Unless we bring forward and streamline these proposals, towns such as Bantry will still be flooded every time a southwesterly gale comes in with a storm.  It was unfair on the entire peninsula and the entire community that one of the major towns, if not the biggest town, of that part of the world was totally closed up yesterday because of a flood.  This has a huge impact on the entire business community and on society itself.  We therefore need an urgent debate in these Houses about how we can fast-track these projects.  We cannot have them held up for decades because of planning issues.  A debate with the Minister of State with responsibility for this issue would be very important.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021120800002#K00300","speaker":"1666"},{"type":"speech","time":1638959400,"counter":75,"content":"<p>I have to raise the issue of University Hospital Limerick once again, regrettably.  The number on trolleys in the hospital yesterday was 83; on Monday it was 82.  Some 3,500 people have been treated on trolleys in the hospital in the past three months alone.  A 96-bed unit is planned.  From a meeting on Friday, I gather that a tender for that is still open and that the earliest - it is a very optimistic \"earliest\" - that that 96-bed unit will be ready is July 2023.  What are the people of Limerick expected to do in the meantime?  This crisis at University Hospital Limerick has been with us for over a decade.  It has got progressively worse year after year.  I am calling for an urgent debate and an intervention by the Government.  There is something fundamentally wrong when things continue to get worse and worse at this hospital.  The morale of staff is at an all-time low.  People dread the prospect of having to go into the hospital.  The chaos there should be thought of in the context of the Omicron variant, God forbid, because we know that the number of Omicron cases is doubling in Britain every day.  How on earth is University Hospital Limerick supposed to cope when it has people crowded in hallways day after day, week after week?  This has been an ongoing failure - it is Government failure, let me be clear - for over a decade, and something fundamental has to change.  In the previous Seanad I called for a ministerial intervention to see what else could be done because right now nothing is being done for people in Limerick.  We have the prospect, God forbid, of a really challenging January.  The numbers get worse week on week, month on month, and there is no plan that will work that is in place, which is not good enough.  We need to see a step change, and it has to come from the Government, to challenge the ongoing crisis in University Hospital Limerick.  The people of Limerick have suffered enough.  I will finish with the question I asked earlier.  What are the people of Limerick expected to do until 2023?  By the way, that 96-bed unit represents only 48 new beds.  The others are replacement beds.  That is only a quarter of what we need.  University Hospital Limerick is 200 beds short.  After all this investment, we will still be three quarters short of where we need to be.  It is a disgraceful record for this Government and preceding Governments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021120800002#K00400","speaker":"1660"},{"type":"speech","time":1638959400,"counter":76,"content":"<p>I welcome the announcement of the completion of the review of the national childcare scheme by the Minister with responsibility for children.

I do so acknowledging we have a very successful vaccination programme, through which a million people have had their third shot or booster.  It is inexcusable and unconscionable that people would not turn up for a vaccine and they should inform HSE personnel as to why they do not come, if they are not coming.  There is also a need for members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to be prioritised in that vaccination programme.  They are front-line workers at the coalface, with high visibility in our high streets and on our roads in advance of Christmas.  I ask that we have a debate on the vaccination programme.

There was a briefing in the past hour.  I would say it is hot off the presses but, alas, the campaign is about an ongoing issue.  It is the Respect for SNAs campaign, which aims to highlight the value and role of special needs assistants.  This is following up on the Department of Education's refusal of a new union claim for a new minimum qualification for SNAs.  This has not been altered since the introduction of the childcare assistance scheme in 1979.<\/p> <p>The campaign is to gain recognition and respect for the role of SNAs by establishing a qualification for new entrants to the job that reflects the complexities of the role.  The Department has not committed to any timescale yet, nor does it accept that a level 6 qualification is desirable, preferring instead to leave the decision to individual schools.  This puts Ireland out of step with international standards for the qualifications required from an SNA.  I do not even need to go into some of the work SNAs do, such as PEG feeding, hoisting, taking an enormous amount of care, and sometimes facing abuse, aggression or frustration.  Sometimes they are just a safety blanket for kids.  These points were all read out at the briefing today.<\/p> <p>I ask that Members support the Respect for SNAs campaign and take it back to their political parties.  It is important we all have awareness of the complex role of SNAs in supporting students and that we encourage people to engage and learn about the work of SNAs.

It was announced by the Ministers, Nichola Mallon, MLA, and Deputy Eamon Ryan on 29 November.  I did not speak on it last week because of the whole mica situation.  I did not want to blur the lines.  I very much want to emphasise that this review is now taking place.  I thank the two Ministers for the input they have had and wish to put on record some of the conditions they have set in respect of the review.  The press release states that the strategic review of the rail network on the island of Ireland will examine improving sustainable connectivity to the major cities, enhancing regional accessibility, including the north west, which is very significant for us in the north west, and supporting balanced regional development while considering the potential to increase rail freight.  The strategic rail review reflects an Irish Government commitment under the New Decade, New Approach agreement.  It also recognises the will and input of the shared island unit and the Taoiseach's desire to have rail connectivity in the north west.<\/p><p>When I say the north west I am talking to those who are involved in that north west city status area of Donegal, Tyrone and Derry.

This is for the first time providing a real opportunity for the people of all the north west to bring back rail connectivity with the potential for speed rail between Derry and Belfast.

The programme is going to support strategic tourism, transport businesses, Irish-based inbound agents, attractions and activity providers, and tourism accommodation providers.  It will build on a five-phase &euro;55 million tourism business continuity scheme that was administered by F&aacute;ilte Ireland in 2021 and will be again next year.  This is a very significant scheme for all of those businesses that have been impacted by the travel restrictions.<\/p> <p>Yesterday when the T&aacute;naiste was in the Chamber, I was contacted by numerous businesses across Tipperary.  I brought the suggestion to the floor yesterday when the T&aacute;naiste was here that we should reintroduce this scheme which was very successful in 2021.  The businesses in Tipperary I have been speaking to have lost over 90% of their business in 2021.  All the calls they are receiving now over recent weeks, since the decisions we have made in terms of travel restrictions, have been about cancellations and tours that are going to be cancelled.  The restrictions we have made on hospitality have an end date of 9 January, which we hope will be met.

Senator O'Loughlin kicked off today's Order of Business and raised once again the issue of Garda numbers in Kildare compared with areas of similar population size in the State.  I note that the Senator has expressed frustration that she has no forum in which to raise this matter.  I understand that the Cathaoirleach has attempted to facilitate that.  It is only right and proper that the Senator has a forum to raise those issues, which she said again this morning.  Senator O'Loughlin also spoke about testing capacity and in particular PCR testing for the community that she represents.<\/p><p>Senator Joe O'Reilly welcomed the NIAC approval for vaccines for 5- to 11-year-olds.  The Senator reiterated his belief that vaccines are one of the major tools and the key to fighting this pandemic.  The Senator also spoke about climate and made three specific suggestions, which are proposed practical solutions for how we can bring the community on board.  The Senator suggested: wind turbines in every local community that would be owned by the community; a reduction in vehicle registration tax for first-time electric vehicle purchasers; and an incentive for farmers to create carbon sinks on their land.  The Senator has requested a debate in the Seanad around those types of practical solutions for the climate agenda.<\/p><p>Senator Mullen raised the issue of the review of the  Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act, as did Senator Keogan and others.  We obviously come from very different places on this issue but I will also always defend the Senators' right, and the right of others, to have their views heard and properly listened to and respected.  I do so because we want the same in return on other issues.  It is an important part of the democratic process.  I am very conscious that it may be decades down the line when we revisit this again in the same way, but things could also turn around.  I am very conscious that we should always be respectful.  I take on board the Senator's comments on the need for the review to be impartial and objective.  I want that too.  I want it to be a legitimate review that has credibility, which is very important.  I take on board the comments of the Senator about the chair and for that person to be somebody who is respected by all sides.  This is such a contentious issue that I do not believe everybody will ever be happy, no matter what way it is done.  To have legitimacy and credibility, every effort must be made to ensure that all views are respected and heard.  While the Senator may not agree, I believe we tried to do the best we could at the Oireachtas Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution, which at times was contested heavily.  The committee held some very strong debates.<\/p><p>Senator Mullen also raised the prospect of a diplomatic boycott of the Beijing Olympics and that the United States of America and Australia have already moved to do so.  My personal view is that we should do so.  I believe that the vast majority of Members of this House would agree with that.  Certainly, this is a message we should send from those in agreement in this Chamber, to the powers that be, that this would happen.  I note that our Minister of State with responsibility for sport, Deputy Chambers, will not be attending, nor will his officials.  That is not in any way to cast aspersions on any of the athletes competing.  That is separate issue.  Of course we want our athletes to have the opportunity to compete at the highest levels.<\/p><p>Senator Mullen also raised the issue of cheating in horse racing.  I share the Senator's concerns.  It is a huge industry here and we are aware that a lot of money is involved.  Because of this, there are many interested stakeholders when it comes to that issue.  It is important however, that we ask the tough questions.  If certain practices are happening in other countries, we need to make sure they are not happening in Ireland.  It is possible, of course, but we just do not know.  I do not know the answers to all of that.  It is an interesting request to invite the committee chairperson here but as the Cathaoirleach has pointed out, it is not quite in line with our process around inviting chairpersons to the House.  It is open to any Member of this House to attend the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and Marine to ask those questions directly to the chairman, Deputy Jackie Cahill.  I am sure he would facilitate that.<\/p><p>Senator Pauline O'Reilly raised the issue of live exports and the transportation of livestock to locations that would be considered long distance.  She particularly referenced the <i>Finola M<\/i>vessel.  The Senator painted a harrowing picture.  I am not sure what I can offer the Senator in terms of information.  It must have been a very distressing journey for those animals to travel those distances in those conditions with no vet on board.  Assuming that what the Senator has put on the record of the House is accurate and correct, I would share concerns for those animals and their welfare, and the fact that there was no veterinary support on the vessel.  One must ask if the persons involved in that type of transportation, and particularly in that situation, have an appropriate level of concern for the animals?  Many people would feel that is not the case.  While there is big money in live exports, animal welfare should always be the top priority when we engage in this type of trade.  Senator Pauline O'Reilly also welcomed the announcement by the Minister for Education, Deputy Foley, of the &euro;50 million for HEPA filters.<\/p><p>Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile spoke on a number of issues.  The Senator spoke on the housing supply strategy, which was published in Northern Ireland this morning, and the commitment to build one third of social homes out of 100,000 units.  This sounds very ambitious and I wish them well.  The Senator also spoke of the need to have better cross-Border engagement through the North-South Ministerial Council on the issue of housing.  If we can learn best practice and get advice and tips from each other, then why would we not do that?  That is a fair suggestion.  Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile also referred to the recent visit to Derry by the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris.  The Senator asked for a debate on cross-Border education in the space of higher education.<\/p><p>Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile also raised the imminent publication of the final report of the Seanad Special Select Committee on the Withdrawal of the UK from the EU, of which I am the Chairperson.  Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile is a member of that committee, as are a number of our Seanad colleagues.  We will publish our final report tomorrow.  It will be a virtual report and all Members are welcome to attend at 12 noon tomorrow.  I thank all of the Senators for their work.  I give the Senator a commitment that of course we will have a debate on the report.  It will not be possible to do this before the end of this term, because we only have next week.  At the earliest opportunity in the new term we will have a debate on the report as published.  Six months following publication, as we have decided, we will invite the Minister back to the Chamber to give an update to the House on how the recommendations in the report are being implemented.<\/p><p>Senator Moynihan expressed her view on the review of the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act and to express her commitment to safe, legal access for all women in the State.  The Senator also expressed her disappointment that the review of the Act is simply on the operation of the Act and not the policy within the Act.<\/p><p>Senator Moynihan also spoke about a specific issue regarding D&uacute;n Laoghaire and a housing co-operative where the contractor has pulled out.  I do not have the full details on that issue but I note the Senator's comments.  The Senator also spoke about the Dublin Flea Market, which has not been able to find a home.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Lisa Chambers:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2449\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2449&amp;amp;pid=LisaChambers&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=08\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Senator Moynihan is a Dubliner and I can understand how upsetting it is for people in the locality to lose that.

It is a shame that it was not facilitated in continuing.<\/p><p>Senator Crowe rose to welcome, finally, the approval by An Bord Plean&aacute;la of the Galway city outer ring road, as did Senator Kyne.  I can say, with first-hand experience, having lived in Galway for many years, how terrible and bad the traffic is there.  I would even go as far as saying that it is worse than Cork.  The traffic in Galway has gone beyond that; it is terrible.  The city is choked and people cannot get or out of it.  We know, from dealing with the business community in the western region, of the problems.  Business owners, particularly those who are located in the business parks around the edge of Galway city, are telling us that they cannot expand, get staff or take on new contracts.  It is having a devastating impact on the city's growth and potential for new jobs and attracting forward inward investment.  The approval is really welcome.  Getting the planning was the first step; now it has to be built.  It is a little way off, but there is funding there to do it.  It is a positive day for the city.  I recall, even going back ten years, that there was talk of different environmental concerns.  The difficulty was that although people agreed with addressing the environmental issues, no progress was made.  It has taken far too long to get to this point, but it is a welcome day for people living in Galway and for those who travel to Galway for work, as many in people in Mayo, Roscommon, Clare and the surrounding counties do.<\/p><p>Senator Keogan raised the review of abortion legislation announced by the Minister for Health.  The Senator made some comments that I feel are appropriate to address directly.  She said that it the review is a pretend public consultation process.  I must reject that comment.  She said that the outcome is prearranged.  Again, I reject that assertion.  It is not prearranged.  She stated that there have been more than 13,000 abortions in the past two years, representing a 70% increase.  She has probably not taken into account the fact that many of those women travelled to undergo abortions.  Those abortions happened, but happened in a different jurisdiction, that being the point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021120800002#M00300","speaker":"1642","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638959400,"counter":85,"content":"<p>Well said.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021120800002#N00200","speaker":"1660"},{"type":"speech","time":1638959400,"counter":86,"content":"<p>The Senator also said that a third of people voted for abortion.  Actually, more than 66% of our citizens voted to remove the eighth amendment.  That is the factual position.  That amounts to two thirds of the country.  However, I agree with the Senator that the views of people with a pro-life position need to be facilitated, should be given a space to be articulated and should be respected.  We must do everything that we can to ensure that the review is done in a respectful and balanced way, and that it is credible and legitimate.  I agree with her on that point.<\/p> <p>Senator Murphy raised the increased cost of fertilisers for farmers.  He put some stark figures on the record of the House regarding a doubling of the price of some of those fertilisers.  Farmers have had a very difficult period.  They are trying to adjust to the climate agenda and they are doing a good job on that front.  They have also been dealing with very volatile weather conditions in the past number of years, which has made things more difficult, and now they are facing this price increase.  It is certainly something for the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine to take on board.  Perhaps it can do more detailed work on the issue on behalf of the farming community.<\/p> <p>Senator Lombard referred to planning issues and the fast-tracking of particular projects.  In particular, he raised the issue of the flooding scheme for Bantry.  There have been four floods in that area in the past 18 months, which is a lot for any community to cope with.  I agree with his comments.  The Taoiseach has announced a complete overhaul and review of the planning process.  He is due to receive a report on it before the end of next year.  It is a huge undertaking and has never been done.  The idea and the aim of the review is to try to speed up the planning applications and processes to deliver those flooding schemes and other schemes for communities such as those in Bantry.<\/p> <p>Senator Gavan once again raised the issue of University Hospital Limerick and the difficult situation that patients face there.  The numbers on trolleys are far greater than they should be.  We should not have anybody on trolleys.  It might happen in the case of one or two people, but anything in excess of 80 or 90 on a daily basis is a huge number.  I extend my support and solidarity to the staff working in the hospital, in particular.  It must be so difficult for them.  I welcome that there has been investment to try to deliver the 96-bed unit and other supports.  However, I appreciate that it has not alleviated the issues there at the moment.  It is a significant investment.  I am not going to comment in great detail on the issue because I am not a public representative for the area.  Senator Gavan and others have far more knowledge of the issue.  We must consider step-down facilities, home care packages, the fair deal scheme and all the factors that cause people to take up beds in hospitals.  If we can get people out sooner, it should help alleviate the problem.  I agree that something has to be done urgently.  I think 2023 is a long time to ask people to wait for the issue to be resolved.<\/p> <p>Senator Fitzpatrick welcomed the national childcare scheme announced by the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth yesterday.  It was a significant announcement.  We have been talking about this for a long time.  As I said yesterday, it is a start and a plan.  Now we need to deliver it.  We need to deliver a reduction in fees for parents, better pay and conditions for the workers and to ensure access is universal.  The childcare fees that parents are paying currently are unsustainable.  As the Senator pointed out, the fees are a barrier to people, predominantly women, from entering the workplace and getting back to work.  They cannot afford to go back to work, which should never be the case.  She also welcomed the acceptance of preliminary business case for the DART+ programme to extend greater commuter services in those areas.<\/p> <p>Senator Buttimer requested a debate on the review of the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act 2018.  I agree with that.  We hope to have a debate on the issue in the Chamber at the earliest opportunity.  It is unlikely to happen before the end of term because we only have next week.  Similarly, I am not sure we can deliver on the Senator's the request to get the Minister in to the House by next week, but we can try.  It could be early next year. The vaccination programme will continue well into next year.  That will give us an opportunity to see how the winter goes, have that debate with the Minister and get an update for the House.  We will certainly have a debate on the review of the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act 2018.<\/p> <p>Senator Hoey alerted Members to the F&oacute;rsa Respect for SNAs campaign.  SNAs are seeking recognition of their qualifications, a minimum qualification standard, a recognition of the work they do and also the level of responsibility attached to the work they do.  I agree with her comments on the work SNAs do, the variety of work they do and the responsibility they have to deal with on a daily basis.  Every child's needs are so different.  We ask a lot of our SNAs.  They are not getting the respect that they need and the acknowledgement of the work that they do currently.  We previously addressed issues around childcare workers.  We now know that the correct term for them is \"early years educators\".  We must carry out a similar campaign for SNAs.  We must ensure that they are given the respect that they deserve.<\/p> <p>Senator Blaney raised the issue of the railway strategic review announced by the Minister for Transport and the Northern Ireland Minister for Infrastructure in recent days.  He highlighted the role that the shared island unit plays in connecting the island and made a call to those in the north west, in particular, in counties Donegal, Tyrone and Derry, to engage with the railway strategic review.  Connection on the island is most important.  The review will examine other rail connections throughout the country and the western rail corridor will be part of that.<\/p> <p>Senator Ahearn welcomed the &euro;15 million in funding announced by the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media for the tourism business continuity programme.  The Senator is correct that it is effectively a pre-emptive strike in acknowledgement that 2022 is probably not going to be year that we had hoped it would be for the tourism sector and for all those small businesses that sustain communities throughout the country.  I think of my own county of Mayo.  Many tourism businesses are finding it difficult and are not feeling as positive about next year.  However, domestic tourism has been good in many of those areas.  The extra boost, which is a significant sum, will go a long way towards helping those businesses survive next year and ensuring that they are around and can continue to create and maintain employment in those communities.<\/p> <p>Senator Malcolm Byrne concluded by welcoming the &euro;36 million in the regional airports funding for Shannon and Cork airports.  He placed on the record of the House some stark figures, including a reduction in passenger numbers at Shannon Airport, which I was not aware of, from 1.5 million to 300,000.  That is a huge drop in numbers for the airport.  Of course, Shannon Airport is hugely important to the strategic development of the mid-west and to all the counties feeding into that.  I hope that that money will go a long way towards maintaining the airport for the year ahead, allowing it to keep its staff and grow the passenger numbers back to what they were.  The Senator also raised the issue of the abuse of front-line workers when they are asking people to comply with public health guidelines.  All Members will join with the Senator in asserting that such abhorrent behaviour is unacceptable.  We have a whole new appreciation for our front-line workers after the past year and a half.  Any abuse of those workers when they are just trying to do their job to protect the public, is unacceptable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021120800002#N00300","speaker":"1642"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1638959400,"counter":87,"content":"<p>Order of Business agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1638959400,"counter":88,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 12.40 p.m. and resumed at 1 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Bille na dTeangacha Oifigi&uacute;la (Leas&uacute;), 2019: An Tuarasc&aacute;il agus an Ch&eacute;im Dheiridh - Official Languages (Amendment) Act 2019: Report and Final Stages","time":1638959400,"counter":90,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021120800002#Q00200"},{"type":"speech","time":1638959400,"counter":91,"content":"<p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it, an Teachta Chambers, chuig an Seanad um thr&aacute;thn&oacute;na.
