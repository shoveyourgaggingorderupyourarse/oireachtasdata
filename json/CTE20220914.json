On 28 February, the legal requirement for mask-wearing in all settings was removed.  However, it is still good practice to continue to use face coverings, particularly in crowded areas.  The service encourages all members of the parliamentary community to wear face masks when moving around the campus or in close proximity to others.<\/p> <p>  Witnesses giving evidence from within the parliamentary precincts are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they give to the committee.

Never was it more important to get the opportunity to address the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  I sincerely thank them all for attending today.  We have made a submission and committee members will have gone through it, so I will not go through it word for word.  I have been involved in farming politics for ten to 12 years and never before has our industry been under such scrutiny.  We are facing climate change and there is a perception out there that is there is not a cap.  It is fair to say that directly, there is not a cap at this point in time, even though my colleague, John Enright, and I sit on the Food Vision beef and sheep group, as well as the Food Vision dairy group.  Time will tell as regards a cap.<\/p> <p>  There is a huge challenge out there and it is upon us without much consultation, which is the nitrates, the nitrates derogation and the nitrates action programme.  There is a perception out there that this may affect some large farmers.  However, the reality is that it affects the family farm model.  There is the model that is used by some of larger institutions, such as Bord Bia or Ornua to promote and advertise our products right around the globe.<\/p> <p>  At the outset, I give the committee an example of a 30 ha farm with 84 cows, which is the average-sized farm.  By the time this presentation is finished, they could find themselves back with 62 cows.  For many young and middle-aged farmers, that may be the difference between being viable and not.  That is the challenge that is there for us.  If it undermines the viability of our family farm model, over a short period of time, it will ultimately undermine the viability of our industry at a processing level.  It will cause severe economic carnage for many family farms.  <\/p> <p>  Water quality is very often mentioned.  One would think that the farmer had no cognisance about or interest in water quality.  However, the reality is that farmers, whether they are dairy or otherwise, are more dependent on water quality not just than most people, but than anyone.<\/p> <p>  We have invested heavily in slurry storage in recent years.  We have invested in low-emissions slurry spreaders.  There is ongoing investment into and huge uptake in the use of protected urea.  Our State advisory service, Teagasc, has strongly indicated that it will take between 18 and 24 months for a change in practice in order to deliver results.  That relates to the message that we want to drive home here today, which is that we need time for the change in practice in order to deliver results.  Unfortunately, there seems to be one regulation after another in that regard.  The opportunity of time is not afforded to the industry.  <\/p> <p>  I mentioned earlier that climate change is here and that we are involved in the Food Vision dairy group and the Food Vision beef and sheep group.  There is an opportunity to embrace new technologies that can deliver from an emissions perspective, but also from a nitrates perspective.  The nitrates regulations are upon us here and now, it is fair to say, without consultation with the farm bodies.  The most disappointing thing for me as a farm leader was that we took a delegation to Brussels to meet with officials of the agri-environmental group, the Directorate-General for Environment.  The message that seemed to come from Ireland was that we need to target intensive farmers.  It was hugely disappointing that Irish men or women would say that.  Some of our most intensive farmers are our family farm models.  They have modest holdings that need to be intensive in order for them to make a living, because the margin had been eroded.  Change is coming with the chemical fertiliser sales and register and the reductions in fertiliser use, both of which help our water quality and our opportunity from a nitrates perspective.  However, we need those 18 to 24 months of time.  When it comes to farmer supports, most recently, we have seen in the agri-climate rural environment scheme, ACRES, that a 1990s payment in an era where inflation has eroded farmer margins is not at all attractive to commercial farmers, irrespective of whether they are in the area of dairy or beef.<\/p> <p>  One of the greatest threats of all to the dairy industry is cow banding.  If a cow weighs approximately 6,500 kg, a farmer with a 30 ha farm will have to reduce his or her numbers significantly by approximately 14 or thereabouts.  That is hugely challenging and undermining.  On the issue of the potential reduction from 250 kg to 220 kg, what exactly will that carry in the catchment area?  If the harbour in Waterford is in bother does that mean that Tipperary, Kilkenny, Waterford, Laois, Carlow and Kildare will be all affected?  These are the questions that have not been answered, even though the regulation is on its way.<\/p> <p>  There is a whole challenge around eutrophication.  How much of it comes from agriculture and how much of it comes from elsewhere?  That is a challenge that is out there, as are the effects that this is likely to have on our industry.  We have given various different examples throughout the presentation, but the two changes, which are the cow banding and the potential move down to 220 kg will see that 30 ha farmer actually reducing his or her cow numbers by 22.  That is a 26% reduction.  That is huge at a time when farmers have invested heavily, borrowed heavily with the potential to make their payments.  This will be the difference between farmers making a financial payment or not.  I guarantee the committee, just as night follows day, that farm organisations will be back here in four , five and six years&rsquo; time with financial pressures on farms as a result of these.  That is why the challenge is out there for us all, and indeed for this committee in particular, to drive home the message that we need time to deliver the changes that have been implemented at farm level.<\/p> <p>  Another example of restraint and restriction is the slurry export rules and the volume has to double in order to remain within the same query.  Do the nitrogen and the phosphorus double in the tank over a period of time?  Did I miss something on New Years Day?  I do not say that lightly, because it is a huge issue.  What is necessary, and we have looked for this at the Food Vision group on dairy, is that an economic assessment should be carried out on the impact on farm families and, indeed, the wider rural and national economy as a result of these changes.  We need to see proper supports in place, including a meaningful ACRES scheme, because the solutions are within.  Yet, the more farmers that can be brought into an agri-environmental scheme in a meaningful way, the better.  We look forward to a question-and-answer session, but the issue here is the survival of the intensive, modest family farm unit that is severely undermined by this nitrates change.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022091400002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat McCormack"},{"type":"speech","time":1663110000,"counter":8,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses to the committee.  It is important that they bring up this timely issue regarding the nitrates action plan and how it could have a huge impact on rural Ireland in particular.  Mr. McCormack mentioned banding.  The nitrates issue comes down to several issues, namely, that we will potentially reduce our nitrates by 250 kg to 220 kg, which will take a rotation out of the majority of farms.  That will have a huge affect on the stocking rate of the majority of farms.  There was a debate a few months ago regarding climate change and where we will be regarding potentially reducing stock numbers.  If this goes wrong, this will be a cull on the national herd.  That is effectively what will happen if banding comes in, as well as the reduction of the nitrates action plan, which will bring nitrogen down to 220 kg.  Throughout the country, that reduction on dairy herds will see anything up to 15% of the herd being wiped away.<\/p><p>Dairy farmers throughout the entire country could see up to 15% of their herds wiped out between now and 2025.  The timelines are crucial.  <\/p><p> I am interested in the witnesses' interactions with the Department.  There have been major changes in the Department over the past six to eight months.  Are they happy with the level of information they are receiving regarding, for example, the volume of organic nitrogen being used?  Are they happy with the statement that is issued on a six-monthly basis?  It was issued yesterday for the first time.  Are they happy that the farming community has been kept informed of these issues and has enough information for this year?  I have a great fear that we do not have enough information on nitrates, given that the figures were only published yesterday.  <\/p><p> I am also interested in the future.  We have had industrial levels of investment in production.  If we were to have a 15% cut in the national herd, which is potentially what is required, do the witnesses believe the stainless steel industry will stand still, with nothing happening?  Has there been investment in manufacturing plants that might not get enough raw materials to do its job?  <\/p><p> The most important point made today is on the economic impact this will have on the entire rural economy.  In a town such as Bandon, or any other town in rural Ireland, the economic effect could be enormous.  We need to get a figure for what it could mean for rural Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022091400002#B00300","speaker":"1666","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1663110000,"counter":10,"content":"<p>The Senator made a lot of interesting points.  The reduction from 250 kg to 220 kg of nitrogen per hectare will have a significant impact.  Farmers will either have to destock or shorten their grazing season somehow, which would be hugely frustrating.  We are renowned as the best in the world for growing grass and the length of our grazing season has a significant part to play in the promotion of our products as we move forward.  The figures for organic nitrogen were published yesterday, which is far too late in the year.  They should be issued at least on a quarterly, if not monthly, basis to give farmers an indication of where they are.<br\/><br\/><font color=\"#212529\">  The Senator mentioned stainless steel.  There is a huge fear that we will have unutilised or under-utilised stainless steel.  That will create inefficiencies at processor level and will undermine our competitiveness on export markets.  The growth in exports from the agricultural sector had a significant part to play in the past decade, in particular, in bringing this country out of recession.  There were opportunities for expansion in the dairy sector with the abolition of quotas and that drove a huge stimulus in the rural economy from a construction and service-provider perspective.  There was huge demand among young people to study agricultural courses.  While in 2022-23 those agricultural courses will be filled, the same level of demand was not evident, and that has to be a concern and an indication of where we are going.  <\/font><br\/><br\/><font color=\"#212529\">  The Senator asked about the Department and the level of interaction.  We have never made a secret of the fact that we were not happy with the level of interaction and consultation on the nitrates regulations.  Key personnel changes were made in the Department at a critical time in the context of fighting this country's cause.  Experienced heads and people who had been around the block and who had been out interacting with farmers and farm organisations were moved from the nitrates area at a critical time.  If I was in management, that is not a move I would have made.  Perhaps my colleagues would like to comment further.<\/font><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022091400002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat McCormack"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1663110000,"counter":11,"content":"<p>The Senator asked some excellent questions.  The shock is that farmers could receive letters this time next year telling them that they will have to reduce their herds by up to 26%.  That will depend on water quality results for this year and next year.  The water quality results are normally released in July but for some reason, the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, has not released them yet.  Here we are, in the middle of September and we have no idea where water quality trends have gone for 2021.  This time next year we will be getting water quality results for 2022 and if there is a significant change in either direction, a decision will be made, sent to Europe and will come back to farmers by the end of next year.  Farmers could end up getting letters in November or December next year telling them they have to destock by 26% by 1 January 2025.  It is not like this is way out in the distance; it is critically close.<\/p> <p>  As our president said, we are not happy with the volume of information on banding coming from the Department.  At the moment we are not certain which band any of us, as farmers, will fit into because the banding system is based on 2021 and 2022 stocking rates versus the volume of milk produced on a holding.  We are still seeking clarity on which cows will be counted in that system but we cannot get that.  We cannot even establish which band we would have fitted into for the past three years or for this year and the previous two.  There is huge uncertainty.  People are not sure where they are going or what they are doing, yet they are being asked to make huge investment decisions on their farms and co-operatives are making huge investments on their behalf as well.  <\/p> <p>  The Senator mentioned an excess of stainless steel.  The issue, as our president has said numerous times, is that farmers have spent huge amounts to be compliant with regulations but those regulations keep changing every year.  We have banding this year and we have cuts in the nitrogen allowance this year that are going to have a significant effect.  The number of cows in the country could be cut by between 15% and 20%, as the Senator suggested and which is probably pretty accurate.  Not only have farmers made investments on their own farms that will have to be paid for from fewer cows and less milk, but the co-operatives have also spent money on behalf of farmers that will have to be recouped from a smaller milk pool.  There is a double-whammy coming if the number of cows in the country is cut and the production of milk is reduced.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022091400002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Denis Drennan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1663110000,"counter":12,"content":"<p>To add a few points to that, we have members who are milking cows and supplying milk to their local co-operatives today.  Next November or December when they are drying off their cows, it will be decided whether they are going to be in band 2 or band 3 and that will have a very serious impact on the number of cows they have.  People need to realise that this is the first time ever that dairy farmers are going to be forced to reduce stock numbers.  In a lot of cases, these are very sustainable farmers.  They can produce the grass for the number of cows they have in a very sustainable way but a decision has been taken that effectively completely undermines their ability to earn a living from farming.  These are farmers with between 40 and 70 cows.  People have a notion in their heads that derogation farmers are all very larger farmers but that is not the case.  A large number of them have between 50 and 70 cows on small holdings and the derogation is critical if they are to continue in business.  If they have to reduce cow numbers by between 10% and 25%, that is it for them; they are gone.  I am not sure the politicians realise that, to be quite honest.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022091400002#C00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Enright"},{"type":"speech","time":1663110000,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I welcome our guests.

As committee members, we have the benefit of seeing in advance the statements from departmental officials who will be before the committee later and they say quite the opposite.  They say that we are going in the wrong direction currently.  Previously they have said to this committee that we are not going to meet our obligations under the EU water framework directive, which has been in place for more than 30 years.  What would the witnesses say to that?  I am getting a sense that they see a slow glide path here but a glide path that would take the dairy sector way beyond the directive target of 2027, which is the end date for all our watercourses and water bodies to achieve a \"good\" water quality standard.

The effort should be mostly towards ensuring farmers get a fair price and if they did then they would not need to have such high stocking rates on their farms, would not need to be applying so much nitrogen on their land and then we would not have the knock-on effect of the polluted rivers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022091400002#D01500","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1663110000,"counter":30,"content":"<p>I will take that one.

We need to keep dairy farms at the level Mr. McCormack talked about, which is between 80 and 100 cows for a family farm.

For the purpose of my questions I will play devil's advocate.  Assuming this new banding is in and we have the worst case scenario, more needs to be done to highlight the consequences, not just for the farmers involved.  Does the ICMSA have any idea of the impact the final result - if it is as we seem to be picking up this evening - will have on small rural economies off the farm, including hardware shops and suppliers?  There would be a serious knock-on there but do the witnesses have any idea what the effect would be?<\/p> <p>  Along that line and again playing devil's advocate, the solution to a decrease in cow numbers is to increase land.  If enough farmers who will be caught by this took that approach, where would that land come from and what other sectors would the dairy demand for land effect, be it forestry, tillage or farmers in other sectors?  Has the ICMSA gone as far as pinpointing how this can have a ripple effect beyond the people it directly affects?  Does the ICMSA have any information on that?<\/p> <p>  The ICMSA is aware of the following point because it is its business.  A lot of milk is coming over the Border for processing and rivers and watercourses along the Border do not know any border.  Is there a possibility that the co-operatives or processors in the South could be on an uneven playing field?  What similar conditions are being implemented in the North or are there any changes?  Could we end up with a situation where the co-operatives or processors could fill the vacuum that would be created if there was a reduction in cows here with milk from the North?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022091400002#F01300","speaker":"1651"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1663110000,"counter":97,"content":"<p>I will make an attempt at answering some of those questions and my colleagues can come in as they wish.  It is hard to quantify the wider rural effect because that could change on an ongoing basis.  In answering Deputy Fitzmaurice I said the herd was maturing and that it would bring more and more people into the loop from the perspective of having 106 cows or more in their herds.  In effect, that could provide the industry with an ongoing cull, which would be a huge issue.  It would particularly undermine those processors who have invested substantially in stainless steel in recent years and find themselves still paying for it.  They would find themselves particularly vulnerable if they are not getting the milk and it could bring into question the viability of some of our processors.  That would have a hugely detrimental effect on our rural towns and villages because in the vast majority of cases where they are fortunate enough to have a dairy processor near them it is probably the best employer they can have and it is the heartbeat of that rural area.  If the heart is turned off there is little life left.<\/p> <p>  The availability of land is a huge issue and there is the potential for farmers to go down that avenue but the opportunities are very slim.  If it was to happen there would be a significant impact for other farmers.  The Senator mentioned forestry and there is huge ambition among this Government for afforestation but with nitrates and the single farm payment, as it was in olden times, it is very hard to see those targets being met with this level of regulation.  The Senator mentioned cross-Border issues and he said that water knows no bounds.

Our president gave the example in his opening address of Waterford harbour.  If the wastewater treatment plant in Waterford city was spewing, if there is no nitrogen or phosphorus recovery in that plant, as it releases the water into Waterford harbour, the phosphorus coming from humans in the city is released into the estuary.

When the plant in Dublin is fully upgraded it will have nitrogen and phosphorus recovery but it will not be anywhere else in Ireland.  Phosphorus is so water soluble that what we think is clean water being discharged from municipal wastewater treatment plants is heavily laced with phosphorus.

For the most part, it has been shown that the broad public recognise that we need to produce good quality food, that Ireland is good at doing that, and that any climate action measures need to be taken in the context of the global situations we will face.  There is a lot of empathy and support for the farming community.<\/p> <p>  When it comes to water quality, things are a little different.  We cannot blame the Brazilians for poor water quality in Ireland.  If watercourses are polluted, then the source is here.  It is important to say that the source is not always farmers but in the context of the nitrates directive and our ambition, shared by almost everybody in the country, to have the most pristine watercourses possible, where do the representatives see actions being taken when it can be shown that individual farms are contributing to deterioration of those water sources?  What is the best approach to be taken to address those issues recognising, as I said, that it is not always farmers who are responsible?

The availability of 40% support under that scheme, or 60% support for the young farmer, can make a difference for young farmers in particular and for any farmer.  That is a major issue.  I am glad that the Deputy acknowledged in his remarks that there are other sources of contamination.  We just had that discussion.  We need to play our part and we are certainly prepared to be part of the solution.  The move to low-emissions slurry spreading and protected urea, in particular the way it was embraced in 2022 was, as I said, something nobody really understood in 2018.

I am joined by my colleague, Dr. Marie Archbold, who is a water policy adviser with the Department and co-chair of the nitrates expert group.  The Department has policy responsibility for the implementation of the nitrates directive and the water framework directive and associated water directives.  We work closely with our colleagues in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine on these nitrates issues and all water quality issues.  Both Departments benefit from expert support provided by Teagasc and the Environmental Protection Agency through the nitrates expert group.<\/p> <p>  On water quality, simply put, nutrient levels are too high in many of our water bodies.  The draft river basin management plan, based on data from the EPA, links agricultural pressures to 1,000 water bodies out of a total of 4,842 water bodies.  That is an increase of 223 over the previous period.  In contrast, the number of water bodies impacted by urban wastewater is 208, which has decreased by 83 since the previous cycle.  This excess of nitrogen and phosphorus compounds accelerates the growth of algae, causing an undesirable change in the natural ecology and lowering oxygen levels in waterways.  This reduces biodiversity as fewer species can tolerate this change.  Algal blooms impact on wildlife, drinking water and swimming areas.  Excess nitrogen can cause health issues in drinking water supplies.<\/p> <p>  As a result of these trends in water quality as shown in the water quality monitoring programme, Ireland is required to take additional measures and reinforce existing measures sufficient to reduce water pollution and to prevent further such pollution.  Part of this response is the fifth nitrates action programme.  The programme includes several strengthened and new requirements.  These requirements have been developed following stakeholder dialogue and three separate periods of public consultation.  The key measures include changes to chemical fertiliser allowances, livestock excretion rate bands and expanded closed periods.  My colleagues from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine will provide further details on those individual measures.  In addition, there will be an interim review of the entire programme after two years and a review of local authorities&rsquo; agricultural inspection programmes.<\/p> <p>  On the derogations, the directive sets a universal limit of 170 kg of nitrogen per hectare per annum.  Where a member state can demonstrate that a higher limit will not lead to higher pollution, the Commission may adopt an implementing decision, a derogation, that allows higher maximum limits of nitrogen subject to adherence to additional conditions.  A derogation does not exempt Ireland from any of the directive&rsquo;s water quality objectives.  Ireland recently successfully secured a derogation for the period from March 2022 until December 2025.  The only three other areas in Europe that currently benefit from a derogation are Denmark, until the middle of 2024; Northern Ireland, until the end of 2022; and the Flanders region of Belgium, until December 2022.  The Netherlands is currently in the process of renewing its derogation and, going by recent media reports, this will be a three-year phase-out of its derogation, although that has yet to be decided.<\/p> <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s current derogation comes with conditions that include an interim review that must include a water quality assessment that compares 2021 and 2022 data.  This is to be conducted by June 2023.  If the assessment shows that we have eutrophic water bodies, risk of eutrophic water bodies or water bodies with increasing trends or exceeding an average of 50 mg of nitrate per litre over three years, then farms in the catchment areas feeding these monitoring points will face a cut in the derogation limit from the current 250 kg to 220 kg of nitrogen per hectare.<\/p> <p>  In conclusion, to protect water there needs to be a broad acceptance of and adherence to good agricultural practice requirements.  Ireland is simply not going to maintain the current derogation facility in its current format if recent water quality trends are not addressed and shown to have been addressed by a change in water quality data.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022091400002#L00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Flynn"},{"type":"speech","time":1663110000,"counter":160,"content":"<p>I call Mr. Callanan from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022091400002#L00300","speaker":"1611"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1663110000,"counter":161,"content":"<p>I am grateful for the invitation to speak with the committee on the topic of Ireland&rsquo;s nitrates action programme and nitrates derogation.  My colleague, Bernard Harris, joins me here for this discussion and we hope we can address any questions members may have.<\/p> <p>  As set out by our colleagues in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine works closely with other Departments to ensure a coherent approach to meeting agriculture's commitments to the environmental challenges of climate, air, water and biodiversity.  Agriculture has a significant role to play in meeting environmental targets.  Existing water protection measures must continue to be implemented and accelerated but, nonetheless, new measures will also be necessary.  The strong support and work being delivered by farmers to address our environmental issues must also be acknowledged.<\/p> <p>  Ireland's nitrates action programme is the key regulatory framework by which farmers support the objectives of the water framework directive, WFD, but it is not the only mechanism to support farmers.  Support is available through our targeted agricultural mechanisation scheme, TAMS, and its support for infrastructure, actions to support water quality in our agri-environment schemes and investment in the agricultural sustainability support and advisory programme, ASSAP, as well as research and monitoring, for example, through the agricultural catchments programme, ACP.<\/p> <p>  In supporting the work to improve water quality, both Departments have committed to renew the ASSAP, which works directly with farmers, industry and advisory services to protect and deliver improvements in water quality.  It must be noted that industry has provided additional resources to the programme, which sets a clear intention of the ambition to reduce the impact of agriculture on the environment.  From the Department&rsquo;s perspective, the agricultural sector is committed to stabilising and improving water quality.  The review of the nitrates action programme provided a timely opportunity to review the impact of agriculture on our water environment and support agricultural ambition to stabilise and improve water quality while seeking as many co-benefits for climate, air and biodiversity as possible.<\/p> <p>  Specifically on water quality, our waters are under increasing pressure.  The EPA has reported that almost half of our water bodies are not in satisfactory condition.  The most significant pressures on water are from excessive nutrients, namely, phosphorus and nitrogen, and agricultural activities contribute significantly to those losses.  From a policy perspective and by way of policy response, Ireland has been a leader in the EU in protecting the environment through strong regulation that includes both nitrogen and phosphorus, unlike most other EU member states.  As mentioned earlier, our Department is working closely with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage in the delivery of a new nitrates action programme and related agri-environment policy measures.  This has built strong relationships to collectively develop a cohesive policy response in delivering and implementing policy on water to coincide with the delivery of Ireland's next river basin management plan.  Both Departments are also working closely with the Environmental Protection Agency on an ongoing basis in reviewing water quality, monitoring water quality trends and investigating and understanding the pressures from nutrients, pesticides and sediment loss from agriculture.<\/p> <p>  The fifth nitrates action programme process conducted a broad public consultation and held discussions with key stakeholders, including farm organisations and non-governmental organisations.  Ireland's fifth nitrates action programme contains a number of measures for the protection of the environment.<\/p><p>These include new requirements for slurry and soiled water storage and management, revised livestock excretion rates, new controls on chemical fertiliser, a chemical fertiliser database, green cover on tillage ground, new requirements on grazing land management, a commitment to review compliance and assurance activities by local authorities, and enforcement by local authorities.<\/p><p> The Department is also responsible for operating Ireland's derogation.  The Commission approved Ireland's derogation in early 2022 and the terms of the decision were presented at a meeting to the EU Nitrates Committee on 11 March 2022.  Member states voted to approve Ireland's nitrates derogation until 31 December 2025.  Ireland's nitrates derogation was transposed into Irish legislation through SI 393 of 2022 on 29 July 2022.<\/p><p> Additionally, in securing a nitrates derogation for Ireland, the commission introduced additional conditionality to its approval such that an interim review must be undertaken in mid-2023 to include an assessment of water quality results for a defined period to include 2021 and 2022.  This review will be considered and the terms of reference will be developed in due course.  It is important always to recognise that the derogation is provided on the basis that it is a derogation to the baseline commitment of 170 kg of organic nitrogen per hectare, not a derogation from the objectives of the water framework directive.  Key scientific criteria must be presented before a derogation can be sought, which, from an Irish perspective, includes a long growing season and crops with high nitrogen demand, among other criteria.  Ireland easily satisfies these conditions.  However, it should also be recognised that in the process of securing a derogation, it falls to the Commission to propose a vote of the committee of member states provided they are satisfied with our action programme.  As was said by my colleague, only four countries have sought to avail of this facility.<\/p><p> In implementing the derogation, farmers availing of the facility must carry out additional actions, including the likes of a farm nutrient plan, training and using low-emission technology.  It is important that the long term viability of the derogation be secured through the achievement of the requirements to secure good water-status outcomes.<\/p><p> If in developing the mid-term review next year, and when the assessment is complete, key criteria following the water quality assessment process are not met, there is a risk that the stocking rate equivalent of 250 kg of nitrogen per hectare, currently approved under our derogation, may be reduced to 220 kg of nitrogen per hectare from 2024 onwards in some areas.<\/p><p> In order to guide this assessment, and following on from the initial assessment completed as part of the fifth nitrates action programme review, Teagasc has again been asked to review and model the impact of potential measures and the impact of reducing the stocking rate limit to 220 kg of nitrogen per hectare.  This work is to conclude shortly.  <\/p><p> Ireland's grass-based model provides many environmental benefits, and our farmers and industry have structured its development around this.  While it is acknowledged that more needs to be done to reduce the agricultural impact on the environment, a strong regulation provides the bedrock to achieving this.  We are on the right path to achieving environmental sustainability while balancing the economic and social aspects.  I thank the members for their attention and time this evening.  We will be happy to take any questions from them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022091400002#L00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Bill Callanan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663110000,"counter":163,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses.

We were listening to the previous discussions with the ICMSA.  To clarify, the monitoring data used for the nitrates directive are slightly different from those used for the water framework directive in that monitoring points have been specifically picked under the nitrates directive to reflect agricultural land use.  Essentially, they have been designed to try to rule out what the Deputy is talking about, namely all the other land-use impacts, including from sewage, hydromorphology and sediment.  That removes the question being asked.  One will find that the issue of the estuaries is not really considered in the nitrates directive monitoring dataset; it is focused primarily on river water bodies.  Again, that removes the issue that was spoken about, namely that of the Waterford estuary.

Regarding TAMS, the simple reality is that under the regulations on the availability of support under CAP someone has to be at the regulatory standard as set.  Therefore, we are precluded from bringing him or her up to that standard.  That has been the case for some time and it is something that I have raised with Commission officials.  The Deputy is right about the opportunity to bring someone up to standard.  Looking at it from the point of view of fairness, though, those who are compliant should not have their eligibility for TAMS diminished by others who are not compliant accessing it.  The Deputy's understanding of the situation is the case, and it is based on clear guidance regarding the implementation of CAP.  There is a requirement.  Take trailing shoe technology as an example.  We were aware of the absence of a grant for one year after that technology's introduction as a minimum requirement for derogation farmers.  In terms of the use of derogations, there are additional requirements placed on farmers.  When that is done through legislation, it precludes them after a period of grant aid.  This is a matter that we consider in terms of proportionality and speed.<\/p> <p>  I have worked in this area for some time and my vision is that the derogation has to be on a sustainable footing.  People are criticising the actions that we are introducing in respect of the derogation, but they are being introduced to avoid the reality or suggestion that the derogation is associated with poor water quality or negative trends.  This is about taking the right steps to secure the derogation over the long term.  The question of whether to apply is a political issue and I cannot answer for future Governments, given that it is a decision for the Government, but it is important that we have in place the bedrock of guidance to farmers about what actions need to be taken to ensure that water quality is on the right trend and the derogation is not negatively impacting water quality.  This means asking farmers to do more.<\/p> <p>  I have been in this area since 2010 and we have undertaken four reviews, including an interim review.  We are asking more of derogation farmers now.  I accept that some of our requests are challenging, but experience has taught me that most farmers will ask us what they need to do to get this right, given how important the derogation is to them.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the derogation on nitrates, I will point to a couple of matters.  The directive identifies a limit of manure applied, not present, on a farm.  As such, the derogation is available to a farmer who has a higher stocking rate in terms of moving manures or who has additional land.  Under the directive, a derogation is available based on four specific criteria.  I will not cite them, but they are based on a long growing season &ndash; in other words, whether a farm needs that nitrogen in the system in light of its capacity &ndash; the nitrification of soils, rainfall, etc.  There are specific conditions that make one eligible to apply.  From an Irish perspective and having presented on the tables, we have a growing season of 270 or 280 days, which is different than continental Europe's.  Our availing of the derogation is happening in a different circumstance than that of many European countries where animals are permanently housed, there is cropping, which dilutes stocking rates, and so on.

The checks are not universal, but we perform checks comparing single farm payments versus farms' animal identification and movement, AIM, data, that is, their livestock, in respect of every farm in the country.

In the two lower bands, there is not a major change from the existing 89 kg per hectare, so for those categories there is not as big a change compared with the top-end band.  Certainly, if farmers are thinking of trying to manage their herd profile out of that band, I do not believe there is a need in respect of certain breeds to which people might allude and which are required to generate that.  We have plenty of capacity within our own breeding programmes to pick animals that ensure fertility, longevity and a focus on milk solids, which is available under the structure that has been put in place.  Farmers are paid on milk solids to increase the solids as a percentage of the volume of milk produced.  All those things were factored into our consideration as to how to structure this while minimising the negative aspects and recognising where the majority are at.  I accept that it is hard in respect of the 15% in the high category.  The science justifies the numbers associated with that, but the structure we have put in place has minimised the number in that category and created an opportunity to focus on improving solids, etc., within farmers' profiles, which is what they get paid for, over litres.

That is just normal.  I would question, though, because of the availability of the option of exporting slurry or taking additional land or temporary grazing, opportunities that are there in respect of which I would not anticipate that the immediate reaction would be to cull.  Having said that, unproductive cows etc. on the farm are maybe a different issue.  It is not my figure, but I know, for example, that one of the artificial insemination, AI, companies, which is an expert in that field, has said that 10% to 15% of dairy cows were not covering their cost of production.

With the majority of these animals that hit the 15%, it will take, if not one, two breeding seasons to bring them back down into band two.  That is a significant change.  Does Mr. Callanan think they would need time to change their farming practices or their breeding profile?  The witnesses know themselves.  The animals that are in calf at the moment are probably not in line with the nitrates directive.  Next spring they definitely will be, but at the moment that work has not begun.  I just question the idea that there will not be a cull.  In places such as Barryroe, in west Cork, they are maximised out.  The majority of the herds are only 80 cows each.  The majority of farmers there are all dairy farmers.  There is no room to expand in respect of any other land becoming available.  The majority of them would be in that category.

From the person who met the Commission, where the request came around banding, it was a simple ask: have you no big or small cows in Ireland?  Why are they all the same?  The approach, therefore, was to evaluate the impact scientifically.  Essentially, banding equalises scientifically the impact of those cows based on 170 kg or 250 kg.

What we learned from that was that because it was structured in such a way that there was variety of farming and soil types, it can give good indications.  The translation of that into practical support for farmers is through the ASSAP.  Effectively this is using and building awareness among individual farmers by having identified, using EPA data, where this programme should be rolled out first.  There are about 120 areas.  It uses those learnings and brings farmers to programmes such as the ASSAP.  I am not sure of the particular value.  It is expensive, costing more than &euro;2 million a year to run it.  We do it at a far higher standard than is required just for the reporting under the nitrates directive.  We have much more data from it so it is a tremendous source.

For example, with the national farm survey Teagasc has always been very sensitive and careful about its use because that is dependent on full engagement based on anonymity for farmers.

At the previous session, a very strong claim was made about wastewater.  It has been addressed already but I will give the officials an opportunity to address it again.  It was claimed that urban wastewater might be significantly contributing to the water quality issues we have.  I am hearing that is the case to a certain extent but agricultural practices are responsible to a greater extent and, therefore, the fifth nitrates action programme is necessary.  The programme is necessary because the deterioration in water quality obviously presents a risk to the environment and water courses, but also a risk to agriculture.  It is certainly not good for the Irish agriculture sector if the country gets a label as having polluted water.  Our guests will probably agree with that.  I commend the efforts of everybody to try to turn this around.<\/p> <p>  We should be alarmed because we are hearing today from officials in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, as we have heard previously, that we are probably way off course as regards our commitments under the EU water framework directive to restore our water quality to satisfactory conditions by 2027.  That is only five years away.  The industry lobby does not have much of a mind to that.  It would say we should go there gently and slowly.  If we adopt that approach, it will certainly not take us there by 2027.  We simply have to find a way of restoring our water quality to meet our EU obligations, notwithstanding that we also want better water quality for many good reasons.  <\/p> <p>  My principal question is, given the likelihood that we will not achieve the obligations set out in the water framework directive and given that all the nitrates action programmes to date have not been effective, where do we go from here?  The fifth nitrates programme is even more demanding for farmers because previous programmes have not been effective and because it is more demanding, we probably have less confidence that this programme will be effective.  We all need to be reassured that we really are turning the tanker around.  I am interested in the witnesses' views on the role of enforcement.  It was planned that 5% of farms would be inspected and I understand that figure will increase to 10% in this programme.  Is that enough?  Even if we are monitoring 10% of farms, are we really capturing the problem?<\/p> <p>  A strong claim was made by our previous guests that it will take between 18 and 24 months to see a change in water quality based on the programme.<\/p><p>I would like the experts from the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, in particular, to comment on that.  I have dipped into the issue and have done some research.  From what I have read, I understand that we can see results very quickly from changing certain practices, particularly with regard to the nitrate levels in the water.  I would like to give the experts from the Department the opportunity to address that claim that was made very strongly by the representatives of the ICMSA in the previous session.  <\/p><p> I wish to raise the issue of the rhetoric around the family farm.  Perhaps the officials from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine have picked up on it.  It was mentioned by Deputy Fitzmaurice, who has left now.  Indeed, I believe Mr. Callanan himself said that farms are family farms.  Do we need a proper definition of the term?  We need to have an honest discussion here.  If we are using that kind of emotive language, and saying that family farms are under threat because of the nitrates action programme, it is really not helpful.  The reality is that a small number of farmers are derogation farmers, and I absolutely accept that most of those are not the problem.  I find the rhetoric unhelpful.  Perhaps there is an argument for really defining the term.  While we do want to have a sustainable sector and to support family farms, we need to be very clear about what that means.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022091400002#Q01900","speaker":"1594","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1663110000,"counter":252,"content":"<p>The Deputy asked quite a few questions there.  If I do not get to them all, he can pick me up on it.  First, the Deputy asked about alignment between us and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  There is a very close working relationship between us and our colleagues in agriculture.  We work very closely, particularly on nitrates, and also on the CAP strategic plan, the water framework directive and a whole load of these issues.  There is certainly common interest on all of those matters, so I have no issue with that.  I hope my colleagues do not have issues either.<\/p> <p>  On the contributions, in our river basin management plan we break the country down into water bodies, which includes different aspects of rivers, lakes and groundwater.  We have attributed sources of pollution that are causing issues, and causing those water bodies not to meet the status requirements, to 11 different causes of which agriculture is just one.  We are able to disaggregate the causes.  I will not go through them all  but agriculture, hydromorphology, which is the shape and the flow in rivers forestry, urban wastewater and urban runoff are the top ones of those 11.  Agriculture is 1,000 out of the 4,842, followed by hydromorphology, then forestry, then urban wastewater.  We have better data now than we have ever had before.  We are able to disaggregate those causes.  It is not the case that there is one issue and one cause.  It is usually contributory from each of the causes.  We have better data now, which is largely and almost entirely down to the work of the EPA and local authorities in terms of that analysis.  Now, as policymakers, we have better information than we have ever had before.<\/p> <p>  On the 2027 target, it is certainly a very challenging date.  It is essentially around the corner.  It is a challenge right across Europe.  We are talking about a water framework directive from 2000 and a nitrates directive from 1991.  These are not new issues.  The Deputy talked about the effectiveness of each programme.  I would not be perhaps quite as pessimistic as the Deputy was in his question.  There has been a contribution on effectiveness from past programmes.  I think we certainly would be in a much worse situation had we not had that continual strengthening of programmes and even the midterm reviews of those programmes that we spoke about earlier.  I believe the fifth nitrates action programme is a very good programme.  We were here around this time last year and I would make the same comments again.  It is really about adherence to the programme.  We can send out inspectors and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine can send out inspectors, but we cannot be everywhere.  There needs to be support, adherence and acceptance that these rules are for the collective good among the farming industry itself and the industry that those farmers are supplying.<\/p> <p>  There are three layers of enforcement.  Local authorities are out doing the general nitrates enforcement.  Every single farmer in the country has to adhere to those general rules.  A stricter set of conditions applies to the derogation for farmers, which our colleagues in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine look at.  There is a joint programme between our Department and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  Part of the fifth nitrates action programme is an improvement in the local authority enforcement and work through the EPA and local authorities to use risk profiling and targeting into those areas of contribution to really get the most out of the resources that will be available in that area.  There is a set target as to how many derogation farms have to be inspected.  The same target does not apply to the general farming population.  The EPA is in the process of putting together a risk-based enforcement plan that will cover that.  That covers enforcement.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned a period of 18 to 24 months.  We are essentially talking about how long it will take to improve water quality.  It will vary.  For phosphorous, because it can adhere to the particles in the soil, it can take many years for the system to readjust once the source load has changed.  With nitrates it tends to be a more linear and quicker response, but it is still very much dependent on the local geology and soil type.  I might refer to Dr. Archbold to say more on that.  If we think about the chain that is needed, the policy needs to be changed, that needs to be implemented, there needs to be a response in the water and that needs to be measured.  There is a distance there.  The previous contributors mentioned a period of 18 to 24 months.  It is not an unreasonable point to make.  In some cases it can take some time to show up in the environment and then to be captured by monitoring.   It is a process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022091400002#R00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Flynn"},{"type":"speech","time":1663110000,"counter":253,"content":"<p>Can it be quicker?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022091400002#R00300","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1663110000,"counter":254,"content":"<p>It can be quicker in some situations, absolutely.

If nitrogen gets into those areas, we will see a response very quickly.  On the other side, looking at phosphorous, it usually flows overland in poorly-draining soils.  After a flood or a rainfall event, one might see a response very quickly in the river, in terms of the concentrations going up.  The response is based on the pathway, the soil type and the geology, as Mr. Flynn mentioned.  On the response time, in terms of the chemistry, we can see it very quickly, but the response of the biology, which is another part of the assessment that is required as part of this review, can be slower.  Also, it is monitored a lot less frequently, every three years.  That monitoring lag is another problem.  As I said, the chemical response can be very quick, but the biological response is probably the slowest to track.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022091400002#R00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Marie Archbold"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1663110000,"counter":256,"content":"<p>Just to comment on the derogation inspections, in our fourth nitrates action programme we committed to undertake inspections of 5% of approved applicants under the scheme.

That was not at our request.<\/p> <p>  We work across Departments in our engagements.  An example of that can be seen in our existing agri-environment scheme.  We used mapping from the EPA on water quality as a determinant for priority entry to agri-environment schemes.  Entrants to those schemes are required to pick actions appropriate to water quality.  The current green low-carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS, was based on engagement with the likes of the EPA and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  That engagement is there.<\/p> <p>  There are other examples in the forthcoming CAP strategic plan.  A significant amount has been set aside to address the impact of water quality as a joint commitment.  Provisions in respect of water are influenced by the food vision report, which identified the ambition of the industry.  That was called out in the achievement of regular standards in water.  Even Mr. Tom Arnold has spoken in the media about the importance of us, as a collective industry, in supporting his overall objectives.  Those considerations and their importance influence our approach.<\/p> <p>  Senator Lombard, who has left, asked about derogation.  He may not be aware that the manager of the ACP, whom I happen to know quite well, has always said that derogation farmers are the first to attend meetings he holds.  They are the first to engage and to understand.  He said the reality of their engagement with the environment is stark.  They ask what they need to do.  In our management of the derogation, we brought in a mid-term review in 2019 to look at what needed to be done.  My experience of farmers is that they are very engaged.  There are undoubtedly issues that are challenging in their introduction but the general direction has been towards farmers asking what they need to do.  They are receptive to being honestly and openly advised in that respect.

We must deliver on water quality if we want to contribute to its long-term viability.  The vast majority of farmers would accept that.  In respect of the continuation of the derogation, we must do what it takes to ensure it is contributing to the overall requirements of the water framework directive.  That is what I would say to those who have invested.  They are putting in place the systems, in respect of storage, etc., to ensure they can be compliant to better use manure.  We have seen evidence of that, particularly this year with the high price of fertiliser.  Farmers are happy to have invested in storage to ensure they can use slurry at the right time because rather than managing a tank, they are managing their manure.  That is the way I would describe it.  This is an investment.  Our objective should be to show leadership in this area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022091400002#S00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Bill Callanan"},{"type":"speech","time":1663110000,"counter":266,"content":"<p>The rest of my questions may have been asked.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022091400002#S01000","speaker":"1613"},{"type":"speech","time":1663110000,"counter":267,"content":"<p>I am a sucker farmer and much of the terminology referring to cow banding and so on does not come naturally to me.  On the testing scenario, I cannot get my head around how we can identify bad spots or what is causing pollution.  That was the case going back to the first question from Deputy Fitzmaurice.  Perhaps it is my own lack of comprehension.  Perhaps we could get a breakdown in writing.  If I were reading it, I might be able to get my head around it more easily.  From what I have heard and observed, the words \"profiling\" and \"modelling\" have come up a lot.  It frightens me that decisions being made that are going to affect farmers in such a severe way are based on some of the figures that were given to us earlier by the ICMSA.<\/p><p>We do not have the EPA figures this year, yet we are going gung-ho for the changes to the derogation.  Has there been any indication from any of the testing, modelling or risk profiling that low-emission slurry spreading, or the use of protected urea, which have become almost sacrosanct over the last couple of years, have caused a change on any of the farms we are talking about today?  Are we going for another stick to beat farmers with without knowing whether what they have been doing to date has made any change?  Is the same modelling and risk-profiling being done on industry, roads, slurry or sewage treatment plants as is being done with the perceived run-off from the farm?  That is more a matter for the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  Why did the nitrogen value in a cubic metre of slurry change from 5 kg to 2.4 kg?  Did we have it wrong before?  That will have a serious effect on the people who are trying to meet the targets that are being set for slurry exportation.  They will have to export twice as much to stand still.  It seems like a serious change.  Why did it change?<\/p><p> As I said to the ICMSA, being a devil's advocate and looking at the worst-case scenario, taking its submission verbatim and its numbers for herd reduction as being correct, what compensation will be available for people who are servicing loans, trying to live a life and who have invested a lot in a business?  If it comes to that, there has to be a just transition and some form of compensation.  What compensation would be available if a farmer comes to a point where the only way he can meet these targets is through a reduction?  As Deputy Fitzmaurice rightly said, there is not much more land available these days.  The exporting of slurry will have to be doubled for these farmers to stay where they are because of the change of value.  As was said about them coming to the meetings first, they are the first people to embrace science and technology.  Any farmer who has benefited from a derogation has it almost down to a fine art.  I do not see the wriggle room for further improvement to meet these targets that the witnesses seem to think they have.  If the only way to do it is through herd reduction, what compensation will there be?  They have to be compensated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022091400002#S01100","speaker":"1651","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663110000,"counter":269,"content":"<p>The compensation matter is a different policy issue to that of derogations, so the witnesses can leave the compensation issue.

It is principally done through ammonia compliance, to which the dairy sector has to contribute too and was the driver of our inclusion of it as a requirement for farmers with a derogation.<\/p> <p>  Protected urea is a climate change mitigation in terms of reducing greenhouse gas emissions associated with it.  It is not a major game changer with regard to water quality because the number of nitrates lost from the system is based on the amount applied, uptake and various different things, but the protection and volume of nitrogen applied does not change.

Overall, however, the 89 kg, the 106 kg, etc. is all calculated annually based on what the animals eat and the nitrogen content of that material.  A factor is also taken out for maintenance in this respect, and this then generates an excretion factor as well.  There is a formula concerning how this value is calculated and, as I understand the situation, this is a Europe-wide approach.  Therefore, if we consider our typical bands now, and we take the existing 106 kg level, there are many production systems that are much higher.

The process commenced at the same time.  They have certainly not agreed.  It is important that we are not compared to the Dutch, because the water quality issue is just phenomenally different.  Considering our average nitrate levels, Dr. Archbold identified that we are in the top third in that respect.  Regarding nitrates, we might have 1% or 2% at over 50 mg of our national monitoring level, whereas in the Dutch situation - and I know this because I did a presentation at the same time some years ago - it is certainly north of 50%.  Therefore, the Netherlands has a fundamentally different challenge with the intensity in this regard.  I describe the comparison by saying it is a country the size of Munster that has the same size of dairy herd, but with double the production.  The Netherlands also has ten times the number of pigs and a huge horticultural sector.  The total value of agricultural exports from that country was &euro;60 billion annually versus our &euro;13.5 billion.  It is just a different scale of intensity, so therefore these are not comparable contexts.<\/p> <p>  This still goes back to the situation, however, that we negotiate with the European Commission concerning our next action programme.  It must be satisfied before it will propose a vote to member states.  It will not just do that automatically.  In my experience, the process will be undergone and then the European Commission will say that it is happy with the programme being put in place by Ireland.  This was conveyed at the beginning of the meeting in respect of there having been long and arduous discussions and, ultimately, the European Commission decided it was comfortable that Ireland had put a robust action programme on the table.  Such an outcome then undoubtedly influences voting positions.

This Bill aims to give effect to the EU representative actions directive by creating a new civil litigation mechanism by which a qualified entity may act as a claimant party on behalf of consumers who have opted into a representative action against a trader in the High Court.  The Bill also creates a mechanism whereby an organisation which represents the collective interests of consumers may apply to the Minister to be designated as a qualified entity to bring a representative action in Ireland or in other EU member states.<\/p> <p>  The new law is a response to recent mass consumer rights breaches by private companies.<\/p><p>It will allow for several cross-border qualified entities to come together to represent EU consumers where they have been harmed by the same alleged infringement which has been caused by the same trader in several member states.  Today we are pleased to have the opportunity to consider these matters further with representatives of various bodies.  I welcome Mr. Philip Andrews from the Law Society of Ireland, who is a partner in McCann Fitzgerald with responsibility for EU, anti-trust and telecoms.  He is a member of the Law Society's business law committee.  I understand that Ms Aleksandra Pruska of McCann Fitzgerald may also be joining us.  I also welcome the chairperson of the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC, Mr Jeremy Godfrey.  He is joined by Mr. Kevin O'Brien, who is a member of the CCPC; Ms S&iacute;ona Ryan, who is the CCPC's director of policy and international; and Mr. Robert Dunne, who is the CCPC's deputy director of legal services.  I also welcome the chairperson of the Consumer Association of Ireland, CAI, Mr. Michael Kilcoyne, who is attending remotely.  He is joined by Mr. Raymond O'Rourke, who is the vice chairperson of the CAI; and Mr. Dermott Jewell, who is the CAI's policy and council adviser.<\/p><p> Before we begin, I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practices of the Houses as regards references that witnesses make to another person in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses who are physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected pursuant to both the Constitution and statute by absolute privilege.

The Law Society welcomes the opportunity to contribute to the committee's scrutiny of the general scheme.  I am a member of the business law committee of the Law Society of Ireland.  I am a practising Irish solicitor in the area of EU competition, trade and regulating markets.  My practice is mainly advisory and I do not regularly litigate cases.  I am therefore not an expert in litigation procedure.  I wish to extend apologies on behalf of Ms Aleksandra Pruska who is unable to attend today for health reasons.<br\/><br\/>I will set out some background and then talk about three specific points with regard to the general scheme.  As I am sure is well-known to members, in 2005 the Law Reform Commission, LRC, conducted a review of the law regarding multi-party litigation and reached a preliminary conclusion that the Irish legal system &quot;lacks a comprehensive procedure that would tackle class claims in a uniform and consistent fashion&quot;.  An LRC report on foot of that assessment which was issued later in 2005 recommended that a formal procedural structure for collective redress be established.  Following the introduction of a Private Members' Bill on multi-party actions, MPAs, the then Minister for Justice and Equality referred the question of the introduction of an MPA procedure in the Irish legal system to the review of the administration of civil justice review group, established in 2017 and chaired by the then president of the High Court, Mr. Justice Peter Kelly.<br\/><br\/>In January 2018 the European Commission published a report and study on collective redress mechanisms in member states.  The report and study found that Ireland was an outlier among EU member states because Ireland had &quot;no dedicated mechanism for bringing collective claims in Ireland&quot;.  It continued:<\/p> <blockquote> \tRather, mass claims are dealt with under the general rules of civil procedure which only allow for collective claims in very limited circumstances. <\/blockquote> <p>A 2020 report on foot of the work of the administration of civil justice review group, which I will call the Kelly group, concluded that in addition to EU Directive No. 1828 on representative actions, there was a further rationale for the introduction of a new and more comprehensive MPA procedure to accommodate mass claims.  More specifically, while acknowledging the importance of public law redress mechanisms like those provided for in EU Directive No. 1828, the Kelly report concluded that in addition it seemed clear that there was an objective need to legislate for a comprehensive MPA procedure in Ireland.<\/p><p>In SPV <i>v<\/i>. HSBC, then Chief Justice Clarke stated, in 2018, that: <\/p><blockquote>\tI remain very concerned that there are cases where persons or entities have suffered from wrongdoing but where those persons or entities are unable effectively to vindicate their rights because of the cost of going to court.  That is a problem to which solutions require to be found.  It does seem to me that this is an issue to which the legislature should give urgent consideration.   <\/blockquote><p>While the Law Society welcomes the directive and general scheme, it would support broader and carefully-balanced reforms that implement the recommendations of the LRC and the Kelly report.  It would be important that those reforms are carefully balanced to facilitate small-harm class actions while preventing excessive litigation.<br\/><br\/>I will give one US example.  In the US, courts have generally applied a very lenient standard for certification of class actions.  An example is a recent class action lawsuit from May 2022, Chimienti <i>v<\/i>. Wendy&rsquo;s International, in a New York district court in which the plaintiff seeks compensatory damages, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, punitive damages and injunctive relief for alleged misrepresentations and omissions because &ldquo;Wendy&rsquo;s advertises its burgers to make it appear that the burgers are substantially larger in size than the actual burger served to customers&rdquo;.  The lawsuit goes on to claim that &ldquo;the beef patties used for its advertisements are not fully cooked to make it appear that they are approximately 15-20% larger than the beef patties that are actually served to customers&rdquo;.  The claim is brought by the plaintiff &ldquo;on his own behalf and on behalf of all other persons or entities who purchased an overstated Wendy&rsquo;s menu item&rdquo;, so it is really an opt-out system there.  It is estimated that many thousands of new class actions are filed each year in the US federal and state courts.  According to one authoritative source, &ldquo;A putative class action takes no more than a single named plaintiff and a filing fee typically of several hundred US dollars&rdquo;.<br\/><br\/>I will now turn to the general heads and our three comments.  EU Directive 2020\/1828 sets minimum standards only.  It requires member states to put in place, at a minimum, at least one procedural mechanism to enable consumer organisations, called &ldquo;qualified entities&rdquo;, to commence representative actions on behalf of consumers.  Notably, under the directive and the general scheme, only qualified entities, not individual consumers, can bring representative actions.  Many, if not most, member states are expected to go beyond the minimum requirements, or already do so.<br\/><br\/>A key purpose of the directive is to enable, consistent with Article 38 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU, representative actions to ensure a high level of consumer protection.  That is in recital 4 of the directive.  To that end, the directive requires member states to implement, at a minimum, a type of collective representative action involving a qualified entity, but it is not a purpose of the directive to require that representative actions can only be taken by qualified entities.<br\/><br\/>Under subsection (1) in head 5 - application, the general scheme states that &ldquo;a representative action may be only brought before the court by a qualified entity designated by the Minister for the purposes of bringing a domestic representative action&rdquo;.  A question arises as to why head 5(1), appears to suggest that only collective actions by qualified entities are permitted in Irish law.  By explicit inclusion of the word &ldquo;only&quot;, a question arises as to whether a limitation is incorporated into the Irish legislation that may have unintended consequences.  Could this approach prevent organic emergence of representation actions in common law?  Ireland currently has a relatively restricted regime for collective action, including by reference to other EU member states, as well as other common law jurisdictions such as the UK.  A legislative provision that limited private-party rights to take collective or multiparty actions in such a way could also run counter to recommendations of the LRC and the calls for legislative reform by the Judiciary.

My colleagues and I welcome the opportunity to provide our views on the general scheme.  I am the chairperson of the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC, and I am joined by Ms S&iacute;ona Ryan, who is director of our policy and international division.<br\/><br\/>The CCPC welcomes the general scheme, which will establish a system for representative actions in Ireland and will ultimately lead to the improvement of consumer access to justice and redress.  Redress is a very important aspect of consumer protection.  When things go wrong, consumers must be confident that traders will provide them with appropriate remedies such as compensation, repair, replacement, price reduction, contract termination or refund of the price paid.  The CCPC therefore strongly believes all consumers should have access to fair and timely dispute resolution and redress mechanisms.  One mechanism for achieving redress is enforcement action taken by public bodies.  Another is legal action taken by consumers themselves.  Where consumers have suffered as a result of a trader failing to uphold their rights, a public body such as the CCPC or a sector regulator can take enforcement action, using its legal powers to investigate and seek sanctions.  Enforcement action can result in penalties, orders to come into compliance and, in some cases, compensation for affected consumers.<br\/><br\/>Individual consumers can take legal action against a trader in the small claims court for amounts under &euro;2,000 and in the higher courts for larger amounts.  In some cases, individual consumers may also be able to avail of alternative dispute resolution; for example, by making a complaint to a sector ombudsman or a sector regulator.  This Bill will introduce another mechanism for consumers to take legal action.  It allows for representative actions to be taken on behalf of multiple affected consumers.  This will apply when a trader has failed to uphold rights derived from EU consumer law, both general consumer law and a range of other laws that protect consumer interests.  The Bill will allow both for injunctions and for compensation and will apply both to domestic and to cross-border actions.  Irish consumers will be able to join representative actions taken in other member states and <i>vice versa<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>This Bill transposes the EU representative actions directive, and the general scheme of the Bill closely follows the requirements of the directive.  We have only a few comments on the detail of the general scheme.  First, we welcome the criteria for designation of qualified entities who can take representative actions on behalf of affected consumers.  These criteria follow the directive and will ensure consumers&rsquo; interests are placed at the heart of all representative actions.<br\/><br\/>Second, we consider that qualified entities should be free to make independent decisions about which cases to pursue, based on their own criteria, such as the prospects of success, the scale of consumer detriment and whether they have the resources and expertise needed.  This is implicit in the general scheme and it will be important the final legislation does not constrain the independence of qualified entities in this regard.<br\/><br\/>Third, we welcome the provision for the Minister to facilitate co-operation and sharing of best practice among qualified entities.  Co-operation and sharing of best practice among entities interested in becoming qualified entities prior to designation will also be useful, and public bodies such as the CCPC may have a role in sharing experience with qualified entities or bodies seeking designation.  However, this does not necessarily need to be explicitly referenced in the Bill.<br\/><br\/>While the Bill will enable representative actions to be taken, there are a number of complementary measures that will determine how the mechanisms in the Bill operate in practice.  For example, the general scheme contemplates that courts could make rules on matters such as admissibility, evidence and the means of appeal.  Any such rules could set important criteria for representative actions, such as the minimum number of consumers affected and how similar their claims must be.<br\/><br\/>The CCPC also considers it would be useful for the courts to provide for fast-tracking of representative actions, both to provide faster redress when an action succeeds and to minimise the costs that are inevitably incurred when an action is prolonged.<\/p><p> The availability of funding for qualified entities will be crucial to their success.  The CCPC welcomes the possibility of removing court fees payable by qualified entities taking a representative action.  We note, however, that such fees are not likely to be material in the overall cost of a representative action.  The ancient prohibitions on champerty and maintenance remain in place in Ireland, despite having been abolished in most other common law jurisdictions.  These prohibitions will severely limit the ability of qualified entities to fund representative actions.  The CCPC therefore welcomes the recommendation in the 2020 Review of the Administration of Civil Justice, led by Mr. Justice Peter Kelly, that the rules on funding of litigation should be modernised.<\/p><p> At the committee's previous hearing on the Bill, there was some discussion on which types of body might become qualified entities.  The CCPC's view is that the interests of consumers are best served if they have the option of civil society bodies taking representative actions on their behalf in addition to public bodies taking enforcement actions against traders who breach consumer law.  Having these two options available will mean that consumers will be able to take matters into their own hands if a public body decides not to pursue a particular case for any reason.<\/p><p> I will end with some remarks on the CCPC's role in helping consumers to secure redress.  First, we will use the enhanced enforcement powers contained in the Consumer Rights Bill to secure redress for consumers in cases in which there is substantial or widespread consumer detriment.  These new enforcement powers mean we will be able to require traders to provide refunds, price reductions or similar remedies if they fail to deliver goods or services or if those goods or services are faulty or otherwise do not conform with the consumer contract.  Second, we will continue to advocate improvements to the small claims court procedure and a rise in the ceiling for claims.  Last year there were only 2,134 claims submitted through the small claims procedure, indicating that many consumers find that the process does not meet their needs.  Third, we will share expertise and collaborate with civil society bodies that are interested in becoming qualified entities to help them to develop the capacity to take on this role.  Fourth, we will consider how the CCPC's role in securing redress for consumers could evolve in the light of our experience using our new powers and once we know whether other bodies have secured designation as qualified entities.<\/p><p> The CCPC welcomes the general scheme of the Bill and the introduction of representative actions in Ireland.  The CCPC believes that representative actions for the protection of collective interests of consumers will complement the soon-to-be-expanded role of the CCPC and other public bodies in securing redress for consumers.  It will allow for more efficient cross-European redress in cases of mass harm and provides a further incentive to traders to comply with consumer protection law.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022091400002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jeremy Godfrey","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663110000,"counter":330,"content":"<p>Thank you, Mr. Godfrey.

Since 2004, the CAI has been lobbying for consumers to have the benefit of access to justice by means of collective action in a court whereby, rather than 1,000 consumers taking 1,000 cases to court, a qualified entity such as the CAI would take one case on behalf of those 1,000 consumers affected.  This is already effectively operational in other member states of the European Union.  Our engagement was significantly extended through our membership of BEUC, the Brussels organisation of consumer associations in the EU.  As a result, we are now, 18 years on, with collective redress demanded by the European Commission to be implemented by December and operational by June 2023 in every member state.<\/p> <p>  The draft Bill provides the template for Ireland's mechanism.

We have some points about specific items and we drill down quite specifically into various parts of the Bill.  I hope Deputies and Senators will be happy with the detail, rather than just broad brush strokes, that I will put forward.<\/p><p>Head 16(1) transposes the conditions laid down in Article 4(3) of Directive (EU) 2020\/1828 on the designation of an organisation as a qualified entity for the purposes of taking domestic or cross-border representative actions; in particular that the entity should be an association with the primary aim of protecting the interests of consumers.  The specifics of the designation process will be dealt with under future ministerial regulations, as referenced in head 16(2).<br\/><br\/>We are concerned that additional conditions could be introduced, as seems to be asked by the Law Society even here today, militating against the Consumers Association of Ireland, the only existing consumer NGO in Ireland, from applying to be a qualified entity.  Will those regulations be in place by the time this directive is to be operational on 25 June 2023? <br\/><br\/>The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is the designated authority to inform the European Commission of designated qualified entities.  What happens if it does not designate a body?  If it does not, Irish consumers will be left without their statutory rights under this directive.  What is the response of Oireachtas Members?<br\/><br\/>With regard to funding for qualified entities, head 7(3) states that, aside from an entry fee placed on an individual consumer to be a party to the representative action, &quot;any costs incurred in the bringing of a representative action for redress shall be borne by the qualified entity and not the consumers represented by it&quot;.  Head 20 clarifies that the head 7(3) fee should be a modest fee to be determined by the Minister, but how will this be determined?  Will it be determined via the proposed ministerial regulations or another regulation?<br\/><br\/>Head 4 states that all representative actions for redress or an injunctive measure will be taken via the High Court under new superior court rules.  Have these rules been adopted and will they be in place by 25 June 2023?  We all know that commencing legal proceedings in the High Court is not cheap and, yet, the Bill ignores the administrative costs that will be demanded of a qualified entity, that is, a consumer association, to commence a representative action. <br\/><br\/>Head 3(4) notes that the Minister for Justice may make regulations to provide for the removal of fees payable to the court by parties bringing representative actions under the Act.  This certainly would be of benefit to the qualified entity and, yet, as with other issues such as the superior court rules and ministerial regulations, we in the CAI are waiting to see if the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment or the Minister for Justice is truly on the side of the Irish consumer.<br\/><br\/>The CAI suggests that even if such measures were introduced, the legislation places considerable administrative burdens on the qualified entity, such as the provision of information about representative actions online, transparency as to the funding of the qualified entity to avoid conflicts of interest and interactions with consumers prior to commencement of a representative action.  In that case, the qualified entity would need to have a well-resourced office with staff to complete the task of instigating representative actions.<br\/><br\/>Without some form of funding from the Government or co-operative assistance from the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC, as mentioned in its presentation, possibly by means of a memorandum of understanding, the CAI is doubtful if this directive will be fully enacted in Ireland for the benefit of Irish consumers.<br\/><br\/>I highlight Articles 20(1) and (2) of directive.  Article 20 specifically states - this is not in the preamble - that:<\/p><blockquote>\tMember States shall take measures aiming to ensure that the costs of the proceedings related to representative actions do not prevent qualified entities from effectively exercising their right to seek the measures referred to in Article 7. <\/blockquote><p>Article 7 refers to representative actions.  The measures referred to in paragraph 1 may, for example, take the form of public funding, including structural support for qualified entities, limitation of applicable court or administrative fees, or access to legal aid.  <br\/><br\/>This issue is not mentioned at all in the Bill before the committee and therefore means that the Government does not seem serious about fully transposing Directive (EU) 2020\/1828, taking into account all the additional issues mentioned that still have to be enacted via ministerial regulations and changes to superior court rules.  Are the Deputies and Senators happy, as Oireachtas Members, to potentially see Irish consumers unable to avail of their statutory consumer rights under the directive as of 25 June 2023 due to these anomalies?<br\/><br\/>I will mention the issue regarding a minimum number of consumers.  Members will understand that preambles are really the philosophy behind the legislation.  They do not have to be transposed.  Preamble 12 of the directive notes that it is up to member states to lay down rules on various issues relating to representatives actions, such as &quot;to decide on the required degree of similarity of individual claims or the minimum number of consumers concerned by a representative action for redress measures in order for the case to be admitted to be heard as a representative action.&quot;.<\/p><p>The CAI does not regard these important matters to be covered by the Bill.  Will they also be an issue for ministerial regulations?<br\/><br\/>The last item I will mention is the length of prior consultation.  Head 10(5) states that prior to a qualified entity bringing an action before the courts seeking an injunctive measure:<\/p><blockquote>\tthe qualified entity must first seek to enter into consultations with the trader concerned with the express purpose of having the trader cease the infringement referred to in section 6 of this Act. <\/blockquote><p>This is a reasonably correct transposition of the directive, but the CAI would point out that one very important matter has been omitted in the wording of this section of the Bill.  Paragraph (41) of the preamble to the directive states:<\/p><blockquote>\tWhere Member States have established that there should be prior consultation, a deadline of two weeks after the request for consultation is received should be set, after which, if the infringement has not ceased, the applicant should be entitled to immediately bring a representative action for an injunctive measure before the competent court or administrative authority.  Such requirements could also apply to representative actions for redress measures, in accordance with national law. <\/blockquote><p>This is a crucial issue that must be amended in the Bill; otherwise, the prior consultation could be a means to entirely undermine the consumer representative action by obstructive lengthy consultations, whether by solicitors, lawyers or traders, thereby making the injunctive measure of little use if finally agreed to by the court.  Injunctive measures need to be introduced in a quick and timely fashion, as understood by Preamble (41).<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022091400002#F00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Raymond O'Rourke","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1663110000,"counter":338,"content":"<p>The CAI would like to note that in previous submissions to the Department of Justice and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, it was opposed to any form of US-style class-action collective-redress procedure being introduced in Ireland, as seems to have been envisaged in the Multi-Party Actions Bill 2017.

Beyond that, the cost of advising every consumer in an opt-in situation that a case is about to be taken and ensuring they all know and understand what the case is, are able to register, get in touch in person with an entity 24-7, as required, and not just a website, and be updated on progress is quite significant.

My understanding is that model would not be possible in Ireland at the moment.  The question of how to reform champerty and maintenance is very much on the table.  It was recommended by the Kelly report.  It is a matter for the Department of Justice in the first instance to consider that and come forward with proposals, rather than it being a matter for the Department that has the policy area for this Bill.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy raised a couple of other matters.  As well as representative actions, there is always the role of public bodies in taking enforcement to achieve consumer redress.  There are 60 pieces of European legislation in the annexe.  There are 20 public bodies in Ireland responsible for enforcing that legislation, with varied powers.  For example, last month ComReg achieved an outcome of &euro;2 million in compensation having to be paid by Vodafone to customers in the context of a breach of the specific rules of the telecoms regulation.  Another limb of serving customers is to look at the enforcement powers those 20 public bodies have so that they can use those powers to get enforcement.

This directive has come from Europe and we are part of the EU and must implement it in some ways.  Dare I say it, it is a bit like a spurious Brexit way of doing it - a case of we have a different legal system and we will just do it our own way and give consumers their rights in that way.  The consumers' rights are highlighted in this.  I know, as does the Deputy having been a Minister in this area, that it is minimum harmonisation.  It is full harmonisation in the food area.  Minimum harmonisation has always been in the area of consumers because the Swedes do things and the UK used to do things much more strongly than other countries and, therefore, there had to be this balance.  Regarding getting a balance, it is a bit of a cop-out to say our legal system is different from that of everybody else.

The former Chief Justice, therefore, said that this would need to be changed by the Legislature.  At the same time, it is also clear that the Irish courts, particularly in the context of more recent judicial appointments, are taking a more activist view on what might be permissible in respect of funding.  I refer the committee to the 2022 case of Atlas GP Limited <i>v<\/i>. Kelly &amp;amp; Ors.  In her judgment, Ms Justice Egan said: &quot;The range of interests and relationships which may justify the provision of funding is not closed and is properly the subject of development by the common law&quot;.  She also noted that the law in this field has undergone, and will undergo, considerable development.  Regarding the Law Society's position, I apologise if I have said it wrong, but we are in favour of the Bill.  It seems to us to be a good step, but we think the legislation could go further.  Our view simply reiterates what was previously set out in the LRC report and endorsed by the Kelly report, which is to give consumers direct access to collective, multiparty actions for themselves.<br\/><br\/>That brings me to the Deputy's question on the opt-out system.  My understanding is that the UK, even if it is not a member state of the EU anymore, has a possibility for opt-out in the context of its competition appeal tribunal.  The benefit of that opt-out system, and there is one, is that many of these cases may be settled, and a settlement is generally better in that it avoids the litigation costs.  If an opt-out class action case is settled, then the entire action has been settled.  It does have that efficiency option.<\/p><p>If an opt-in action is settled, there may still be others remaining outside of that tent that will come after you again.  There are benefits and arguments on either front.  However, it is clear in the heads that the Department is going for the opt-in process.<\/p><p> I cannot say I know anything about the funding in Quebec.  I know the funding in the UK is significant third-party funding.

The example I used in my paper was to illustrate the challenges in getting the balance right.  The Wendy's case has been held up as a pin-up of excessive and abusive shakedown-type litigation in which the harm is imperceptibly low.  At the same time, it is also being held up as a case where a food lawyer sought to vindicate the rights of those who had been injured.  The Law Society is saying we should not rush into anything because law has a tendency to evolve beyond its original intention.  A cautious approach is not necessarily a bad one.  At the same time, I reiterate the possibility of implementing the reforms spoken about and reflected in a Private Members' Bill, which are also reasonably cautious and balanced.

Last weekend Aer Lingus obviously had some difficulties at the airport.  That is covered under EU legislation and maybe the airline will compensate people in the correct way, but there could be people who will not be compensated correctly.  That is something I would hope a certain number of consumers would come forward about and there would be a representative action.  I am aware the issue is that such an action could go the High Court, so you are immediately into a very difficult area.  Possibly, however, even just taking representative action involving so many consumers or whatever would make the trader, in this case Aer Lingus, negotiate because it does not want to go down this route and will instead put its hands up and say \"Yes\".

Parties can go to an administrative court and have a little ruling and then they go to the other court about compensation or whatever.

The annex refers to 60 pieces of legislation and they are all different.  As they all involve different public bodies, one answer probably does not apply to all of the pieces of legislation.  Broadly speaking, when enforcement action is taken, sometimes the trader concerned settles the case.  As part of that settlement, the trader might agree to pay compensation to all the affected consumers, which means there is no need for follow-on action.  In other cases, there might be enforcement action.  It can be the case that the obligation is to pay compensation.  I refer, for example, to statutory amounts of compensation for delayed flights.  The consumer rights Bill proposes to introduce a requirement for refunds in some circumstances, or price reductions in appropriate circumstances.  If a trader is not complying with those obligations, the enforcement action can order them to comply with those obligations.  It is all quite complicated because there are different enforcement mechanisms for different pieces of legislation.<\/p><p>An order to comply with an obligation to pay compensation might obviate the need for follow-on class action.

I will begin by briefly outlining the economic and budgetary context for the budget.  This is a challenging and deeply uncertain period for our economy.  Over the past several years, we have found ourselves facing a series of shocks, including Brexit, a pandemic and the consequences of a war.  The pandemic that dominated our lives for two years has receded, and I think it is important we do not lose sight of the fact that, even with the challenges we are facing, we have recovered with remarkable speed and strength.  The strength of the recovery is driven by two factors: the resilience of the Irish people and the success of the budgetary and economic policy of the Government over the past two years.  During the pandemic, the Government made available resources in the region of one fifth of national income to protect households, businesses and our health throughout the crisis.  That was the appropriate response, and it laid the foundation for a robust and broad recovery.<\/p> <p>  For a brief period at the start of this year, the prospects for the economy appeared to be bright.  However, we are now confronting the consequences of the war on Ukraine.  It has changed the economic situation and outlook, with this being most evident in the changes in energy and commodity pricing.  The reduction in purchasing power that has taken place due to this change in pricing will dampen consumer spend over the coming quarters, with the risk of increased uncertainty and weaker external demand affecting investment decisions by employers.  As a result, my Department is revising its projection for growth in our economy next year in the budget.  We will make a downward revision, which I will confirm today fortnight.  However, there are many positive signs in our economy.  Due to the reasons I outlined, our jobs market has made a remarkable recovery over the past two years, with 2.5 million people in employment in the second quarter, the highest level on record, and an unemployment rate of 4.3% recorded in August.  We are, therefore, facing into these challenges from a good starting point.<\/p> <p>  However, it is also clear that the cost of living is the most immediate and urgent challenge facing our country, households and businesses.  Of course, it is not the only issue that we will have to contend with.  That is why the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and I have said that budget 2023 will focus on the cost of living, with further interventions aimed to help.  However, I emphasise to the committee that in drafting this budget we do have a particular responsibility to strike a balance.  We have to provide help to those who need it, but without making inflationary problems here at home even worse.  As a Government, we have an important role to play in limiting the impact of the current price shock.  We know that.  However, as we have seen from many other countries, there are limits to what any one Government can do to address the effects of global pressures outside of our direct control.   As we remember from the 1970s and other points, trying to respond back and overreacting to some of the challenges of inflation can result in far bigger and more structural problems in the longer term. <\/p> <p>  I will now turn to the fiscal position, as it currently stands.  At the end of last month, tax revenues stood at almost &euro;50 billion, up by more than &euro;10 billion on the same period last year.  Income tax continues to perform well, and reflects the resilience of our labour market and the success of Government policy.  The strong performance of VAT receipts confirms the rebound in consumer spending once public health restrictions were lifted.  However, it should be noted that much of the surge in tax revenue that we have seen take place across the year is due to particular increases in corporate tax, which amounted to nearly &euro;12 billion to end of August.  My officials expect these receipts to top &euro;20 billion this year.  This is an enormous figure.  To put it in context, a decade ago receipts from the corporate sector amounted to approximately &euro;4 billion.  These receipts are a reflection of our success, but, as the Government and the committee will recall, I have frequently warned that this is an extremely unreliable revenue stream that could be volatile in the future.  The surge in corporate tax revenues is concentrated among a small handful of firms.  To put it bluntly, the future growth of corporate tax receipts is not a one-way bet.  Positive headline figures can, as a result, serve to obscure real challenges and vulnerabilities in our public finances in the medium term.<\/p><p>With this in mind, my Department last week published a range of corporate tax loss methodologies, and we will publish an alternative measure of the fiscal position that includes estimates of windfall corporation tax receipts.<\/p><p> In the summer economic statement, the Government set out our parameters for the budgetary strategy for 2023.  Our total budget package for next year stands at &euro;6.7 billion.  As the Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, and I have confirmed, a set of one-off measures will be provided this year.  One of my main objectives in this budget will be to do what I can to try to help workers so that they do not find themselves in a position where they pay more income tax solely because of wage changes.  For future years, we will stay within the parameters of the medium-term budgetary strategy set out last year.  However, the Government believes that the parameters outlined earlier this year are appropriate, given the significant change in pricing.<\/p><p> This is a challenging time.  We have once again found ourselves facing an unforeseen economic shock.  We in government are very much aware that many are struggling to make ends meet as we approach a difficult winter.  However, there are also reasons for hope.  Employment is now at record levels and our public finances are back on the road to sustainability, giving us the ability in this budget to help on a significant scale with the cost of living challenge.  We have shown time and again over the past two years that we will act when necessary to protect households and businesses to the extent that we believe is affordable and sustainable and does not create other risks in future.  We will aim to continue with this approach in the forthcoming budget.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022091400002#A00300","speaker":"1558","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663110000,"counter":417,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for affording the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, and me the opportunity to meet it as part of its pre-budget scrutiny process.  Since we last appeared before the committee in July, there have been a number of developments that impact on our budgetary considerations.<\/p> <p>  As inflation continues to rise in the short term, my Government colleagues and I are cognisant of the financial impact and strain that this places on people, businesses and wider society.  Consequently, we have deployed a number of measures over the past year to reduce the inflationary burden on households.  Budget 2022 set out a &euro;1.2 billion package of expenditure measures across a range of sectors to assist with the cost of living pressures.  These measures included increases in weekly social protection payments, the fuel allowance and the working family payment, social and affordable housing funding, health affordability measures, and enhanced student and childcare supports.  Since December 2021, more than &euro;500 million of additional expenditure measures have been put in place to support citizens facing increased costs.  These included the electricity credit of &euro;200 for all domestic account holders, a 20% average fare reduction for public transport services until the end of this year and additional fuel allowance payments, just to name a few examples.<\/p> <p>  The Government is committed to continue doing its part to assist households and businesses in the face of a rising cost of living.  This is the key objective framing budget discussions.  The urgency of this task underpinned the Government's decision to bring forward budget day to 27 September.  We will seek to ease the burden for lower and middle-income families in particular who are facing difficult choices.  As ever, we will balance the need to provide supports while ensuring that we do not add to inflationary pressures.  Discussions are now under way as part of the Estimates process to introduce targeted, impactful measures capable of timely implementation, including in quarter 4 of this year.  A comprehensive package will be announced on 27 September.<\/p> <p>  A vital piece of the jigsaw for budget 2023 is public sector pay, which accounts for one third of total current expenditure.  I am pleased that proposals have now been agreed to extend the current public service pay agreement, Building Momentum, to the end of 2023.  Of course, it is subject to ratification, which we do not take for granted.  Subject to that approval, the proposals will see a 3% increase in pay for public sector workers backdated to 2 February 2022, a 2% increase from 1 March 2023 and a further 1.5%, or a minimum increase of &euro;750, from 1 October 2023.  This is in addition to the 1% increase provided on 1 February of this year and the further 1%, or &euro;500, due on 1 October 2022 that were agreed under the original Building Momentum agreement.  In total, the adjustments provided for in 2022 amount to 5% for the majority of public servants.<\/p> <p>  I believe that the proposed pay increases strike the right balance between providing a deal that is fair to public servants in the midst of cost-of-living challenges and one that is sustainable and affordable for the taxpayer.  It is important to invest in our public service workforce to attract and retain the staff we need to deliver quality front-line services for a growing population.  If the proposed agreement is ratified, it will enable the Government to move quickly to alleviate some of the impact of inflation on our public service workers as well as secure industrial peace.  Under the proposed agreement, the benefits for those on lower levels of pay will again be higher than the headline percentage increases.<\/p> <p>  I will reiterate the Government&rsquo;s budget 2023 strategy, as discussed at this committee in July.  The budget will see an expenditure ceiling of &euro;90.3 billion and core spending next year will reach &euro;85.8 billion.  This significant overall level of resources will enable continued investment in the quality of life in Ireland and support a strong, fair and equal society into the future.  As set out in the summer economic statement, this will provide for an expenditure budgetary package of &euro;5.7 billion over 2022 and 2023.  This is an increase of &euro;1.7 billion relative to what was originally provided for in the medium-term expenditure strategy.  This temporary adjustment balances the need to protect core public services while ensuring that budgetary policy does not become part of the inflation problem.  It is important to ensure that our approach is responsive to the challenging economic environment that many face but also fiscally sustainable.<\/p> <p>  Approximately 3% of the core current expenditure base will be available to meet existing levels of service.  This includes continued investment in the public sector workforce, as set out in existing Building Momentum pay deal, as the delivery mechanism for a wide range of critical services; funding for demographic developments, including supporting a growing population and the changing profile of our citizens; and the full-year impact of measures from budget 2022, which are being implemented on a phased basis.<\/p> <p>  Capital expenditure will increase by a further &euro;800 million next year.  Overall core capital investment will reach some &euro;11.7 billion in 2023, with an additional &euro;200 million as part of the national recovery and resilience plan.  This represents an increase of 7%, which in line with the National Development Plan 2021-2030.  This funding will provide for vital investment across sectors such as health, education and transport while also delivering progress towards our ambitious climate goals.  The remaining amount - some &euro;2.7 billion - will be available for new current expenditure measures across 2022 and 2023.  The recently proposed extension to the Building Momentum public sector pay deal will account for approximately &euro;1.4 billion of this amount, comprising pay and associated pension costs.<\/p> <p>  Other new measures, such as social protection supports and other Government commitments in respect of housing, education, health and so on, will be announced on budget day.  As always, this will require appropriate prioritisation of the numerous demands across a range of sectors.<\/p> <p>  The Government is providing &euro;4.5 billion in non-core expenditure for temporary measures.  This approach facilitates responsive fiscal policy, which can provide supports to key emerging issues while protecting day-to-day expenditure and investment.  This expenditure will provide humanitarian supports for displaced persons arriving from Ukraine, more limited Covid-19 provision in respect of the continued response to the effects of the pandemic, and enable us to respond to Brexit.<\/p> <p>  Each year on budget day, attention is primarily focused on new current expenditure measures and increases in funding that are necessary to maintain existing levels of service.  While these changes in expenditure are important, the vast majority of public expenditure supports the provision of ongoing current expenditure and capital investment.<\/p><p>It is important to keep sight of the totality of public spending and ensure that the overall level of expenditure remains affordable over the longer term and delivers sustainable improvements in public services and infrastructure.  The Mid-Year Expenditure Report 2022, published by my Department in July, provides further detail on the different processes for effective measurement of outcomes.  These processes, including the well-being framework, green, equality and gender budgeting, and the spending review processes are examples of how we can improve the evidence base to support ongoing improvements in public services.<\/p><p> In less than two weeks' time I will bring forward a spending package, and the Minister, Deputy Donohoe will bring forward a taxation package, that seek to address the inflationary challenges we are now facing while also providing for investment in our economy, our public services and our critical public infrastructure.  The budget will balance the need to provide supports to the most vulnerable now with investing in the future of our economy and our society.  While fiscal policy must be responsive, we must maintain a focus on long-term priorities, investing in quality of life in Ireland through our public services. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022091400002#B00200","speaker":"1459","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663110000,"counter":419,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister, Deputy McGrath and the Minister, Deputy Donohoe for their opening statements.

They always make themselves open and available to the Committee on Budgetary Oversight, for which we are very grateful.  I know it is an obligation but it is always good to see them here.<\/p> <p>  Returning to what Deputy Doherty said, his notion that we may have under-budgeted for the Ukrainian situation is like suggesting that Covid is out of the way.  We need to be very prudent and cautious on that.  Last week, when the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, IFAC, the Nevin Economic Research Institute, IBEC and the ESRI were before the committee, I made the point that none of them, in giving a background or context to the budgetary preparations, mentioned the weaponising of energy by Russia as a result of the invasion of Ukraine.  It is important to note that this provides the bulk of the context of the energy price increases and cost-of-living challenges that we face.  We need to keep making that connection for the public.  Once that connection is lost, so too will be the solidarity built up around welcoming refugees and accommodating, schooling and employing them.  There are up to 50,000 Ukrainian refugees and reflecting the very generous response by Irish people and the solidarity they have shown is very important.  The weaponising of energy by Russia is central to everything we are discussing today.<\/p> <p>  I congratulate both Ministers on the employment figures.  The recovery of the economy and the manner in which the Government dealt with Covid can be understated and forgotten about because there is such a tumult and a complexity of issues facing the world.  They should not be forgotten.  I came from a Webnet event for women held in Tallaght today.  Of 180 participants, 104 are now self-employed having started up businesses.  The initiative is supported by the Government and the EU.  This is just a snapshot of some of the incredible things that are taking place.  Unemployment has been eliminated and is at its lowest level ever.<\/p> <p>  This leads me to a point I want to make to the Minister for Finance.  Some businesses are doing exceptionally well.  There is a facility for gift tax.  There is an opportunity in the budget, which I mentioned to my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  Businesses have contacted me and some of them can afford to assist employees through the cost-of-living crisis.  The tax-free limit on gifts is &euro;500.  If businesses want to make a once-off gift to their staff at Christmas or in the run-up to it, we should encourage that where possible.  These are not cash gifts and they would have to be spent in particular areas.  I ask the Minister for Finance to look favourably on this proposal as it would allow successful companies, which do not need to be large, to show largesse to their employees.<\/p> <p>  On fuel prices, petrol has come down from a height of &euro;2.18 to &euro;1.83 per litre, which is the price I saw on my way to Mullingar recently.  The Government is committed to the supports that were implemented on petrol and diesel until the end of October.  What is the Minister's thinking on that now? <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022091400002#D01000","speaker":"1572"},{"type":"speech","time":1663110000,"counter":455,"content":"<p>I will give consideration to the point the Deputy raised.

The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and I are discussing these matters with our party leaders and we will draw that discussion to a close in a couple of weeks.

The electricity bill for December 2020 and January 2021 was &euro;350.  A letter has been written indicating that the energy bill for December 2022 and January 2023, based on the cost of purchasing the energy from the fuel provider, could be up to &euro;1,400.

A large hotel in the country faces an increase in its energy bill up to &euro;809,000 over a ten month period, which is simply unsustainable.  We all have examples of that.

They raised many examples across the country of three-fold, four-fold and even five-fold increases in energy costs for businesses, which are out of line with even the steep increases that households have had to endure.  I think that is partly due to the nature of the contracts and the arrangements that they have in place with their providers.  Once they come out of contract, they are faced with a hefty increase in the per unit charge.  All I can say at this remove is that we are deeply conscious of the impact of that extraordinary energy inflation on businesses.  They are also facing rising costs across a number of other areas.  The most severe and impactful increase is undoubtedly in relation to energy prices.<\/p> <p>  The Minister, Deputy Donohoe, outlined the progress that we have made on jobs, which the Deputy has acknowledged.

I am advocating for them, so that notice and attention is given to the fact that they may have received a certain amount which would have covered the cost in a normal year, but the increase in energy costs is eating into their daily running costs, and I ask the Minister to take account of that.  This Government has been exceptional in its sports capital investment and I am thinking of such projects.

All of these costs have increased.  It puts pressure on what we call ELS, or protecting existing levels of service.  We have made provision for 3%.  Line Departments are now presenting their estimates of what actual costs will be next year based on the level of inflation.  We have to work through all of that in the best way that we possibly can.

We all wish them well in their endeavours over the next couple of weeks.  I have a couple of pieces of advice from somebody who was around.  I was not a Member of this House in the 1970s.  A strange thing that happened with energy in the 1970s was that the supply slowed to nothing.  There were queues at garages all over the country.  People borrowed cans to collect fuel and so on.  It was totally unsatisfactory.  The point I am making is that the situation needs to be monitored carefully to ensure that we do not find ourselves back in that situation.<\/p> <p>  Another matter requires constant attention.  In an inflationary situation, I accept that it is necessary to support the economy, but paying the household bills cannot go on forever.  It will not work and has never worked before.  I will debate that subject with anybody.  I am not suggesting that it is the intention, but I am saying that care needs to be taken.  It is like a merry-go-round.  Once one gets on that merry-go-round, one cannot get off except under special circumstances.<\/p> <p>  The last point I want to make is that the Ministers will get advice from every quarter, including from all around the table here.  We will advise the Ministers about how they should proceed.  I have heard some advice from the Commission on Taxation and Welfare in the last couple of weeks.  If the Ministers want to make themselves really unpopular, follow that lead.  People in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s paid interest rates of 17% or 18% on their mortgages, tried to educate their kids at the same time, paid tax at the high rates, and bailed out their kids when they did not have a deposit for a house in the 1990s, then found themselves under threat of eviction after all that.<\/p><p>My advice, for what it is worth, is that if the Ministers want to become unpopular with people in that age group and their sons and daughters, by all means they should penalise them for doing what they did when they did - for providing themselves with homes they hope to hand over to their kids.  For the State to intervene and grab what it can, even though taxation was paid on all those salaries and borrowings, is not advisable.  I thank the Chairperson for letting me in and my learned colleague can and no doubt will take over where I left off.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022091400002#E01200","speaker":"1584","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663110000,"counter":470,"content":"<p>Would the Ministers like to respond to any of that of are they happy for me to move back to Deputy O'Donnell?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022091400002#F00200","speaker":"1559"},{"type":"speech","time":1663110000,"counter":471,"content":"<p>I will make a brief response to the points aimed at me.  I confirmed earlier today at a public event where I launched the report of the Commission on Taxation and Welfare that I will not be bringing to the Government proposals in relation to inheritance.  I have made that clear.  I respect and recognise the work that the commission has done.  It is a 500-page report containing over 100 recommendations and plenty of things with which I am confident Deputy Durkan would agree, but it needs proper time to evaluate and discuss it.  I am well aware of the equity issues and the matters the Deputy referred to.  I want to give him a clear indication in relation to that.<\/p> <p>  The Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, and I are keenly aware of the need to be able to fund what we are doing beyond a month or two and into the years to come.  That is a big factor in our thinking regarding what we do in the time ahead, while also recognising there are many people who need help at the moment.  The note of optimism I would strike concerns where we were during Covid and the range and breadth of the support programmes we had in place.  So many times it looked unlikely that we would ever not have an EWSS, PUP or Covid restrictions support scheme.  They are all gone now because we were able to make the right decision on the size of the programmes when they were needed and then get out of them at the right time, which we could stand over.  I believe we will get to the same point with our measures but it is a difficult journey for people, given how hard it is at the moment.  That is why we want to help.  <\/p> <p>  The Government is very aware of the question of supply.  In the coming days, the Government statement on energy security will be published for public consultation and feedback.  We are taking steps in the interim to fortify ourselves against the challenges.  That is why it is excellent news that the European Commission has confirmed that gas storage facilities for the EU as a whole are above 80%, where they would be normally.  That is an exceptional achievement by the European Union and its member states in the context of the threat made against us earlier in the year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022091400002#F00300","speaker":"1558"},{"type":"speech","time":1663110000,"counter":472,"content":"<p>The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, IFAC, was before us last week.  I am stealing the same question I asked then.  IFAC estimated that the Government's revenue for 2022 will be &euro;3.5 billion higher than forecast in the July summer economic statement.  It stated that a surplus of &euro;4.5 billion for 2022 is achievable, whereas the summer economic statement projected a surplus of &euro;1.2 billion.  That is a differential of &euro;3.3 billion.  The Minister for Finance referred to parameters under the summer economic statement.  What latitude does that &euro;3.3 billion differential provide to the Ministers, in framing the budget, for once-off measures in 2022?  The Minister for Finance said there is &euro;3.7 billion unallocated from the continuity fund this year.  Some of that will go towards overspend in various Departments.  There is &euro;3.3 billion, effectively of corporation tax receipts, which are questionable in terms of their certainty into the future.<\/p> <p>  I am talking about targeting for energy costs.  We have businesses, such as supermarkets and hotels, across the range getting excessive bills.  They are up three and four times.  Households are having the same issue.  What level of the &euro;3.7 million that is currently unspent do the Ministers see being available to them, on top of the &euro;3.3. billion in unexpected corporation tax, to provide once-off measures?  It is about framing a budget.  The &euro;3.3 billion on top of the &euro;6.7 billion announced to date in the summer economic statement comes to around &euro;10 billion.  We are in a wartime situation with energy costs.  What scope does that &euro;3.3 billion provide the Ministers for once-off measures in 2022?  What will be the total once-off measures in 2022?

The Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, and I are committed to sticking inside the parameters we have announced.

First, I wish to compliment both Ministers on the forthright way in which they are dealing with the problems we have.  We are not that far away from the budget and there seems to be a hell of a lot of stuff that still has to be resolved and measured out to see where we are going to land on the day of the budget.  Budget day is the week after next; it is fast approaching.<\/p> <p>  In dealing with an economic environment in which we are not so sure where we are going in terms of cost of living and energy security, there are few things I would really ask the Government to ensure.  In the event that the Government is thinking of increasing pensions and benefits for older people and those on fixed incomes, the income threshold for benefits like medical cards should also increase in line with this in order that we do not end up giving increases that push people outside of the market where they will perhaps not be able to hold on to a medical card, GP visit card or those kinds of things.  Likewise with the fuel allowance and other good supports that are in place, again, it is important that we reflect that the thresholds for people to qualify for these added benefits should also increase alongside the increases we expect will be given in order that we do not rule people out of getting benefits such as fuel allowance.  That is very important.<\/p> <p>  The other very important area in the context of the cost-of-living crisis we have at the moment is the fact that that for people with disabilities, the expense of their disability has been costed.  The additional cost of living with a disability without any other supports is up to &euro;10,000 to &euro;12,000 per annum as stated in the Indecon report.  No matter what is going on, it is high time that we actually start the process of recognising this by giving people with disabilities the money to deal with the additional cost of living with their disability.  It is very important that we start that process.  I am not saying the Government can put in &euro;12,000 for every person with a disability in year 1.  However, we need to recognise it and start a scheme in order that incrementally over the next five to ten years, we actually do something to support these people with disabilities.  Those are two issues with regard to people on fixed incomes.<\/p> <p>  There is another area about which I have a concern, the magnitude of which is enormous; it is frightening, really.  We talk about the cost of doing business and the cost of products increasing.  Take the small rural shops and pubs that have fridges and freezers or whatever else.  Their energy prices have absolutely gone through the roof.  My concern is that we need to give them something like a Covid-19 support now that will give them life support until they get over this energy crisis and things settle down.  I have seen it in every shop I have gone into and heard it from every retailer and small business or family business owner to whom I have spoken.  They are horrified at the types of energy bills they are getting at the moment.  The bills are absolutely frightening.  They do not know how they are going to cope throughout the winter.  Something we have to take on board as well are the small businesspeople who have no other income.  They are trying to make a living and also trying to provide a service within a rural area.  We need to do something for them.<\/p><p>In the context of the fact that energy Ministers will make a decision by the end of the month on what will happen, and we are talking about forming a budget, I believe that within the next two months we should have another budgetary intervention by the Government, once it sees what is coming from Europe.  It is important that that money and support is given out as quickly as we can give it.  It is important that we do not think this budget will be the full stop on all of this.  We have to watch the game as it is being played out over the next 12 months and then maybe consider other direct interventions that will be required.  I ask for comment on that.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022091400002#G01400","speaker":"1482","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663110000,"counter":501,"content":"<p>On the freak budgetary interventions, we have not even completed this budget, as the Deputy knows.

The Minister has made the point, and I fully agree with him, that if we get an EU-wide measure that we are able to opt in to, we will then use that money to fund measures that will help households and businesses.  We are a little away from that at present.  I do not want to create a sense that when the Government brings forward this budget in a week and a half's time, we will then have new, different and additional measures a few weeks later.

All I can do is acknowledge the points he has made, one of which is that an increase in income because of a Government decision in the budget to increase a particular payment should not result in somebody losing an important secondary benefit.  That is an important point made by the Deputy, which I acknowledge.  It will be considered over the course of finalising the budget.  He also quite understandably raised the issue facing people who have a disability, namely, the additional cost involved in living with a disability.  Again, that is something we are very conscious of.  The Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Humphreys, and the Minister of State at the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy Rabbitte, are very keen to improve services and, where possible, to improve incomes for people who have a disability.<\/p> <p>  I echo the point the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, made around businesses.  We acknowledge the scale of the challenge for many.  We know that it raises very serious viability challenges for some though not for all.  We have come across countless examples in recent weeks where the scale of the increase has been eye-watering and will quickly put many of those businesses in real trouble.  We will do our very best to respond through the budget, while acknowledging there are always limitations to what we can do, especially bearing in mind that nobody can predict with any degree of certainty how long this period of very elevated energy prices will continue.  I agree with the point the Minister made.  We are focused on this budget, which has two parts.  It includes the normal budget for next year that will allow us to do some good things even though, on the expenditure side, when we take out all the pre-commitments, the increase in the public capital programme, and the public service pay deal that I hope will be ratified, the scope for new initiatives and new measures is quite limited.  It is tight on the core side for next year.  That is another reason we will do the best we can in the context of the package in quarter 4 to assist those who are most in need and to assist businesses too.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022091400002#H00500","speaker":"1459"},{"type":"speech","time":1663110000,"counter":505,"content":"<p>The Minister, Deputy McGrath, is right that according to his Department's calculations and commitments, as again enunciated in his opening contribution, it is fair to say that expenditure on new measures next year comes in at approximately &euro;1.3 billion in the plan, if that is accurate.

However, it is still a &euro;5 billion increase in core expenditure for next year.  The fact that a large share of it is already accounted for is because of decisions we have already made, including to prioritise a public capital investment programme and to have a national development plan, NDP, envelope next year of approximately &euro;12 billion.  That is a very conscious, deliberate decision by the Government that will do many good things throughout the country, in building schools, healthcare facilities, public transport, roads and so on.<\/p> <p>  It is also a function of the fact that the level of inflation we have means delivering public services has become more expensive, as I said.

The Minister is on record as saying that.<\/p> <p>  We are approaching, at least technical, full employment.  Nobody could have envisaged that this time two years ago.  It would be churlish of me not to recognise the impact the measures, formulated by the Government and endorsed by the Oireachtas, have had in supporting business and people in work at an unprecedentedly difficult time for our country and globally.  That is recognised.  We are approaching full employment.  There are risks over the next period that have been articulated by other colleagues.  We all know, and the Ministers know as constituency Deputies as well as senior Ministers, the impact the energy crisis is having on the very viability of some businesses that would be otherwise viable.  I had a conversation with a small hospitality sector business owner last week who told me that his energy bills are now exceeding his rent costs.  That puts things in perspective.  We all accept significant initiatives need to be taken by the Government to try to assist businesses through this very difficult process, though of course with conditions attached.<\/p> <p>  I put a question to Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment officials last week regarding any analysis that may have been done around the sectors or sub-sectors of the economy that might be especially at risk and the number of jobs that may be involved.<\/p><p>There are approximately 120,000 jobs involved in energy intensive businesses, especially those in the heavy manufacturing space that rely on gas.  Some of those jobs may be very vulnerable.  We know that a significant Government programme was signed off by the European Commission on 11 August.  This will be operated by the State agencies to assist some of those companies into the future.  While it is all well and good assisting companies to meet their ever-rising energy bills, in truth it involves burning through cash to keep the show on the road.  That means energy companies always get paid.  In considering how to use our resources smartly, I will return to a hobbyhorse of mine, that is, the need for a form of German-style short-time working scheme that we could take from the shelf, customise, tailor and target at industries that are experiencing crises.  That is something that needs to be considered again.  It may well be the case that some intensive users of energy in highly skilled sectors of the manufacturing sector of our economy will require support to furlough workers at this difficult time.  This is a crisis we could not have foreseen.<\/p><p> I will give an example.  There is an employer in my constituency named Premier Periclase.  It is based in Drogheda and is involved in heavy manufacturing.  It manufactures magnesium-based products and has an old manufacturing facility on the banks of the River Boyne.  The company has initiated redundancy notices to almost 40 of its 45 staff.  It came out of examinership at the end of May confident that once it transitioned from a reliance on gas to renewables, which was its plan post examinership, it would become a viable company that may even diversify over the next few years and continue to retain its skilled engineers, electricians, fitters and general operatives.  The company's gas and energy bills are running &euro;5 million ahead of what was anticipated in May.  There are finite supports the State can provide to an industry such as that but one of the measures that could be introduced is a furlough or wage support scheme for businesses such as Premier Periclase to help them with their labour costs during this difficult period.  Instead we are going to see almost 40 skilled workers laid off.  Some of them may never work again because the sectors in which they work may no longer exist this time next year or in two years.  I plead with the Ministers to seriously consider in an urgent fashion the introduction of a form of short-time working scheme to help assist companies such as Premier Periclase and sectors such as theirs with their costs over the next period of time because once those jobs are gone, they will not come back.  We need to focus in a laser-like fashion on supporting industries and sectors such as the one I have mentioned because otherwise they will be gone.  That could be a smart investment of what I accept are limited public funds at this difficult time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022091400002#H01000","speaker":"1599","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663110000,"counter":511,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising that matter.

The Deputy has raised a particular example.  It is always deeply regrettable when people are given notice like that.  I hope it will not materialise in that particular case.  We can only restate our understanding and acknowledgement that for many businesses, the situation is serious.  We know that some businesses have the capacity to absorb the additional costs.  Some businesses have been trading well, are highly profitable and can afford the cost of the significant hikes in energy prices.  However, other businesses are still recovering after the pandemic.  Some of those businesses were not able to trade for part of the past two years and simply do not have the necessary reserves.  One of the guiding principles that the Minister for Finance, myself and the rest of the Government used over that time was to help businesses that were otherwise viable.  It was a challenge of an altogether different nature, as the Minister for Finance has outlined.  There will be a response from Government.  We are considering all of the issues the Deputy and his colleagues have raised in the context of the challenges facing businesses at the moment.  We will make the final decisions in the coming days.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022091400002#J00400","speaker":"1459"},{"type":"speech","time":1663110000,"counter":514,"content":"<p>The Minister appears to have indicated that the Government has not fully made its decisions on an additional package that may be made available to address the cost-of-living crisis we are facing.  I will make a suggestion to him for when he is considering what the Government is going to do.  To my mind, and the minds of a considerable number of people, it is worrying when he constantly repeats the mantra that we cannot fully protect people against this cost-of-living crisis.  It is a constant mantra.  It is not acceptable to continue to use that mantra to prepare people and condition them for the hit they are facing as we head into the winter.  It is simply not acceptable that pensioners, people with families and people who have done nothing wrong will not have the money to heat their homes.  They will have to turn off the heat.  They will not have the money to provide hot water to have showers or to pay essential bills, particularly at a time when we are seeing the very companies that produce the energy making incredible profits.  It is morally unacceptable that those companies can continue to make profits while ordinary people suffer in an unacceptable way.  Whatever solutions the Government comes up with must address that point.<\/p> <p>  Our view is that the Government should control the prices to make them affordable.  There should be some recognition in the face of the unprecedented crisis we are now seeing that a privatised and for-profit energy sector is not capable of dealing with the sort of situation we are now facing.  It is incapable of doing so.  The evidence is piling up.  The EU is now talking about windfall taxes.  It was not talking about them a while ago.  Only the loony left was talking about windfall taxes but now the EU is considering them.  States are starting to control prices.  That idea was dismissed when it was proposed by some of us a year ago.  States are starting to talk about renationalising the energy sector.  Some states are doing that.  These are the sorts of things we need.  The Government must start to think outside the box, reject previously held convictions about markets and rethink the whole thing in the face of this crisis.  We must guarantee that vulnerable people who have done nothing wrong are not going to suffer.  We must stop the profiteering.  We must also consider whether to take our energy supply, a basic need for people, under the control of the State, where it is run on a not-for-profit basis.  Is the Government even considering those things?  I think it should.<\/p> <p>  I note that corporate tax receipts for last year amounted to &euro;15 billion.  The Government is projecting &euro;20 billion in corporate tax receipts this year.  I know we do not have the returns yet but the Ministers must have a projected figure for what that means in terms of the increased profits that are being made by the corporate sector.  There could not be a 33% increase in corporate tax receipts unless there is a corresponding increase in the level of profits.  When other people are seriously suffering, a bonanza of profits is being enjoyed, which is reflected in our corporate tax receipts.<\/p><p>Would it not be fair and just to use the huge surge being seen in profits and the additional corporate tax revenues to shield people against the cost-of-living crisis?  The Minister for Finance will say that these are vulnerable tax heads, we might not have the money in a year or two and so on.  However, one-off payments could be made to shield people against the costs.<\/p><p> There are also other things the Government could do.  As well as a cost-of living crisis, we have a massive housing crisis.  Would it not be a good investment to use those additional revenues to buy up a lot of the property out there at the moment?  Rather than let international investors buy up the newly constructed houses, the State could buy them and avoid spending huge amounts of money on the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, and the housing assistance payment or HAP scheme.  Would it not be a good use of the additional revenues the Government has to use them to deliver public and affordable housing for the people who need it?<\/p><p> Would it not be a good use of that money for the State to provide a scheme to insulate homes on a massive scale and reduce energy costs?  Would it not be a good investment, one that is not dependent on ongoing current expenditure, to invest in areas such as public transport infrastructure, including more buses for rural Ireland and new routes?  Would these not be the types of measures the Government could take with these additional revenues?  They would be sensible investments in the medium and long term that would make a real difference in the short term with regard to the cost-of-living and housing crises that people are faced with.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022091400002#J00500","speaker":"1478","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663110000,"counter":516,"content":"<p>I see a real contradiction in what Deputy Boyd Barrett has said.

On one hand, he sees the corporate sector as being the cause of the many challenges we are facing while, on the other, he is all too happy and willing to spend the taxes we are collecting from them.

We recognise the commitment we have to them and we will do our best to discharge it in the budget.

Both the Minister and I have acknowledged that if very large levels of profit are being made for reasons that are beyond the control of a firm and that firm is going to enjoy super-normal profits, it would not be fair that it should enjoy those profits while other firms go out of business.

I very much appreciate their efforts.  I value the Ministers' engagement, which is always very forthcoming.  I know they are obliged to be forthcoming but we appreciate it and I am thankful for it.<\/p> <p>  These are unprecedented times.  One of the issues I will home in on is business.  Both Ministers are extremely committed to small businesses and SMEs throughout the country because they are the backbone of employment.  In smaller and more rural areas in particular, the people who create a job for themselves or one, two or ten others in the community are the backbone of society.  They are really hurting and finding life extremely difficult.<\/p> <p>  A reporter for a local newspaper in County Kerry who is doing a story on the effects of energy costs on businesses asked me today how businesses are being affected and how they are managing.  Obviously I left out the medical side because nothing was worse than the loss of life during Covid, as we all readily acknowledged, but I am being hard-nosed about this in talking about business.  From a business point of view, I truthfully believe that energy costs are worse.  Through the efforts of the Minister for Finance and his officials and the good work of the Government in supporting small business, doors were kept open.  Even though the doors were shut during Covid, the Government handled the situation in such a way that businesses were financially supported and could open their doors when the rules and regulations allowed them to do so.  Now we find that the doors are open, businesses are operating, as they are entitled to do, and open for business, but the costs are so enormous that they do not have the benefit of the Government supports and are really struggling.  The Ministers know this but I feel I must say it.  What is happening now, from a business point of view, is worse than Covid because we do not have the back-up of the Government.<\/p> <p>  I look forward to seeing what measures the Government will put in place.  I do not believe the measures will be enough.  I am not being negative when I say that because everyone knows I am not that way.  I am not criticising the budget before I know what it contains but I find it hard to envisage how the Government will be able to do for small business now what was done for them during Covid.  I hope I am proved wrong and the Minister will be the saviour small business needs in terms of addressing the energy costs encountered by shopkeepers, hairdressers, and the owners of beauty salons, small engineering works and so on.<\/p><p>We hear about the issue of declaring interests.  I have a small shop myself, so I see it myself.  The bills that were &euro;1,500 or &euro;2,000 every eight weeks are now &euro;9,500.  One can deal with that once or twice, but when one has to contend with that and sees it go nowhere but up, one would wonder if it is possible to keep the business open.  The people I represent tell me that they are more fearful than ever before.<\/p><p> I have another matter to put to the Ministers.  I was grateful that the rates review that was being carried out a couple of years ago was, rightly, deferred because of Covid.  It is now going ahead.  The local authorities are rolling it out for every business and rateable properly.  It is not being looked at with a view to reducing the rates but with a view to increasing them.  I do not think, in the times we are in, that it is a good time to tell people in small businesses that their rates are going up.  It is the exact opposite.  We should look at deferring this.  I humbly ask the Ministers, on behalf of the businesspeople in Kerry, to please not touch the rates.  I am sure other people around the country would say exactly the same thing.  People will not be able to afford the rates.  Kerry County Council and its finance department, as the Ministers know, is excellent at its job.  I know that local authorities can look at inability to pay case by case.  Unfortunately, many businesses will be unable to pay.  Rather than pursuing a rates increase, I ask the Ministers to look at that.  I know they might say it is outside their sphere, but if the people in charge of the Department of Finance cannot look at that in a sensible way, then who else can?<\/p><p> The Ministers have often heard me talk about mum's purse.  One could be the Minister for Finance, be over in Europe and doing everything in the world, but if Mrs. Murphy or Mrs. Sullivan's purse is not in order on a Friday evening and she cannot manage the bills or run her house, then everything else is in serious trouble too.  Unfortunately, mum's purse is at breaking point because there is nothing in it.  During Covid, the Government was good at trying to support all those circumstances.  Unfortunately, a bag of coal for Christmas is now &euro;40 or &euro;45.  It is fine to tell people to retrofit their home and that the Government will give them a big grant, but I know nobody with &euro;30,000 or &euro;40,000 under the bed to produce to retrofit their home.<\/p><p> While I hate telling the Ministers this, though it is a fact, the majority of businesses installing solar energy are doing so without the grant.  One might say it is insane to leave a grant of 20% or 30% on the table, but I will tell the Ministers why that happens.  One of the first things that has to be done is an energy audit, which costs between &euro;10,000 and &euro;12,000.  The Government might say that it will provide grant aid of 50% or maybe a bit less.  It is telling businesses to get a big bundle of paper.  They will have to provide &euro;10,000 or &euro;12,000 and the Government will give them &euro;5,000 or &euro;6,000.  The paperwork will delay the project by nine months.  Every eight weeks, one has to pay an energy bill of between &euro;9,000 and &euro;12,000.  People are better off, by hook or by crook, to go ahead and put up the solar panels without the benefit of the grant.  A grant should not be set up that way.  It should be more user-friendly and easier to get.<\/p><p> The buzzword of the Government seems to be that it has to do its part for the environment and rightly so, but there is no good reason, by now, for every roof in Ireland not to have solar panels.  The Government is not actually serious about that.  I do not like telling the Ministers that, but it is a fact.  Talk to the people who are installing the systems and who want to have these systems.  They will say that it is not working because the bureaucracy involved in getting the grants is turning off households.  The energy audits and so on are just not practical for businesses.  That is why so few take this up.  If one was up in the sky looking down at roofs in Ireland, every farm building should be covered in solar panels.  Every day when the weather is at all fair, we should have between 70% and 80% of our energy coming from solar.  Even on a bad, cloudy day, we should be self-sufficient to the tune of 20% to 30% coming from the sky.  We are not.  What has been done so far is like a spit in the ocean.  I would like the Ministers to work on those things.<\/p><p> I express my hope that the budget will do meaningful things.  Regarding what has happened in the past, there was much talk about the &euro;200 that people got off their ESB bill.  I respect it very much.  The &euro;200 was a lot of money in the week when it came out of people's accounts.  Many bad weeks have come and gone both before and after that.  We want to see more of those meaningful measures.  I am fearful for older people who, in many instances, can only hope to heat their homes this winter through what they buy, whether it is timber, coal or turf, if they are allowed to do so.  One can call those homes energy inefficient, but they cannot be made efficient and, in those people's lifetimes, they probably will not be able to change in the way the Ministers might like them to change.  These are the types of problems we have.<\/p><p> I will finish like I always do.  I thank the Ministers for the work they are doing.  I acknowledge the people in the Department of Finance who work behind the scenes.  As a small businessperson, compared with someone running the finances of the country, it is all relative.  It is like running a bigger business and trying to do everything the right way.  It is the same in a small business.  One tries to pay the bills, to do things right and to keep one's nose clean.  That is what the Ministers are trying to do on a larger scale.

I thank Deputy Healy-Rae for coming in and making that contribution.  The measures that we will announce the week after next will be meaningful.  I am sure they will not satisfy everybody and that we will not be able to meet every need and ambition.  We will try to focus on what really matters in the budget, which is the basics and looking after people to make sure that they can get by and can meet unavoidable day-to-day costs.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy raised a number of issues relating to businesses.  A number of colleagues raised those issues over the course of the meeting.  Both the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, and I are in close contact with businesses, both representative bodies and individual business owners in our constituency and nationally.  Our colleagues in our respective parties and across the House come to us all the time and share the kinds of example that Deputy Healy-Rae highlighted from his personal circumstances.  We are aware of the issue and the worry.  It is not just about the bills that have been received but what is to come.  Nobody can predict with any degree of certainty how long this is going to last or how much worse it might get.  The Government has to calibrate its response with incomplete information.  It has to do so based on the facts that it has at this time, while also trying to safeguard the bigger picture of public finances and making sure that we keep them in safe territory.  The economic environment has changed, as I am sure the Deputy is well aware.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Healy-Rae raised a few issues about rateable valuation, which I will pass on to the Minister, Deputy O'Brien.<\/p><p>There are two levers relating to the rates bill.  One is the rates struck by the local authority, and then there is the valuation which is set.  Deputy Healy-Rae raised an issue about revaluation.  We will take on board the points the Deputy made about grant schemes for retrofitting.  A lot of money has been made available for retrofitting to support businesses and households.  We would like to see the support rolled out more quickly.  There is a capacity issue with the number of contractors available in the sector.  We are addressing that through the provision of more apprenticeships, skills, training and so on to try to build up that capacity, because there is significant work ahead of us.  Even when we get through the current point in the energy price cycle, this phase of work will last for many years.<\/p><p> The Deputy raised the issue of solar energy.  We have work to do in that area.  We should acknowledge that we in Ireland, along with Denmark, are among the world leaders in onshore wind energy.  There will be more offshore wind in future.  I take the point about solar energy.<\/p><p> Deputy Healy-Rae concluded on the matter of older people.  They get particularly concerned when they see the bills coming their way.  Many have extra needs and need to be looked after.  We will do our best on budget day to respond to that level of need, while acknowledging and being honest and straight with people that we will not be able to do everything.  We can help a lot.  We will do that in two weeks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022091400002#L00300","speaker":"1459","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663110000,"counter":532,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Michael Healy-Rae for the points he raised.  I know he has an understanding of the real world, especially small businesses.  Like the Minister, Deputy McGrath, I have been approached directly by businesses, which have sent me pictures of their bills.  I fully understand the challenge that is developing and the need to respond to it.  I agree with everything the Minister, Deputy McGrath, has said on that.  I will add two points to that.  I say this to Deputy Healy-Rae with respect and the same honesty with which he has spoken to me.<\/p> <p>  The first point I would respectfully make is that if the benchmark for whenever the Government tries to help the economy is what we did during Covid, we will run out of money.  The Covid pandemic was an extraordinary and, I hope, please God, a once-in-a-generation experience in which people could not leave their home.  I know the Deputy understands this because I heard him speak about it in the D&aacute;il and he has raised what that meant for businesses with me for two years.  A set of things came together that, please God, none of us will ever have to confront again.  We had to do things at such a scale because of the terrible harm it would do to people's health and what would happen to the basic functioning of businesses and our economy if we did not intervene.  It cannot be the benchmark the Government is compared with every time we have to intervene again.  If the Government is asked to take that approach, in all honesty, the people who will suffer in the years to come are the people who Deputy Healy-Rae is representing, because the public finances will not be able to afford it, our debt will go up, and we know what happens after that.<\/p> <p>  We will do all that we can to help to make a difference.  The Minister, Deputy McGrath, used the phrase \"incomplete information\".  We do not know for how long this situation could continue and what else could be around the corner.  We have to temper what we are doing with that in mind.  I ask the Deputy to consider that, every time we have to respond to a shock, if the Deputy expects us to do what we did during Covid, we will quickly have bigger trouble on our hands.  We are trying to manage that.<\/p> <p>  I take the point about solar panels.  We will have to look at that.  The job of the State and whoever is in government is not just to find money to make solar panels cheaper but to find money to keep hospitals running and to respond to all the other needs the Deputy is referring to.  As much as we want to make things that we value affordable, at the same time the Government cannot do everything.  Few people understand that better than Deputy Healy-Rae, because of his background and the fact there is a big business community in Kerry that understands what is going on in the world.  I fully understand the challenge many are facing, but I hope the Deputy will appreciate my candour in asking him to consider other risks.  If we are requested to intervene as we did during Covid in every economic shock, we will face an economic shock of our own making at some point soon.  None of us want to be in that position.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022091400002#M00200","speaker":"1558"},{"type":"speech","time":1663110000,"counter":533,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis na hAir&iacute; as teacht os comhair an choiste ar&iacute;s.

The issue with speaking two hours after the meeting started is that many of the questions I had have been asked.  I will start with a different angle, with a question for an Aire, an Teachta McGrath, about media reports regarding the Department of Health maybe needing a bailout.

Will it be done through a Supplementary Estimate?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022091400002#M00300","speaker":"1579"},{"type":"speech","time":1663110000,"counter":534,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Farrell.  I acknowledge she has been here since the beginning of the meeting, which we appreciate.  Health expenditure is a challenging and complex area, as she knows.  There is a close working relationship between the officials in my Department, the Department of Health and the HSE.  There is a dedicated group, the health budget oversight group, which meets regularly to tease out these issues and make sure there is ongoing communication and good co-operation relating to the management of health expenditure.  It is such a large area of our overall expenditure.  The allocation in 2022 is &euro;22.2 billion, with a further &euro;200 million held in reserve.  A particular challenge we face in respect of health expenditure relates to Covid-19.  The Deputy will recall the wave of the Omicron variant we had at the beginning of the year, which would not have been envisaged on budget day last year.  That led to significant budget-related expenditure that went above and beyond what was allocated to health on budget day in respect of Covid.  That is the first issue.  There is an overrun relating to Covid-related expenditure.  We are working through that issue with our colleagues in the Department of Health as part of the Estimates process.<\/p> <p>  On the non-Covid side, we are analysing overall core expenditure.  We have made much progress with beds and adding capacity to the system.  Thousands of staff have been recruited.  The Department of Health has received sanction for the recruitment of a number of staff beyond that.  We are working through the budgetary implications of that at the moment.  To add complexity to that, there are other measures that would not have been funded on budget day which we will have to fund, such as measures relating to the recognition payment.  There are health-related costs associated with looking after the displaced people who came here from Ukraine.  We decided on an expanded flu vaccination programme.  As part of the Building Momentum agreement, we honoured our commitment regarding the Haddington Road hours.  Given the scale of the workforce for which the Department of Health has responsibility, it had to make provision for significant expenditure relating to that agreement.  There are many different moving parts, but the Covid cost will be more than was provided for originally, with a need for additional expenditure.  We are working through core spending at the moment and assessing the need for a Supplementary Estimate in the coming weeks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022091400002#M00400","speaker":"1459"},{"type":"speech","time":1663110000,"counter":535,"content":"<p>If one were to believe media reports, which I have no reason not to believe, it is a significant sum of money.<\/p><p>I do not have that much time so I will move on to another topic.

I also wanted to ask if the Minister has decided what to do in regard to the rainy day fund and if so, how much it will be.  If he has the information perhaps the Minister will answer that as well, if he wants to respond to me.<\/p><p> The other question I had relates to the amount of warehoused tax debt that arose during Covid.  Has the Department done any analysis on the outstanding amounts and how they are being impacted by the current energy crisis?<\/p><p> Following on what Teachta Healy-Rae said, we have all been speaking to local businesses in our area about the different strains they are experiencing.

It is not the case that there is a Government agreement in place regarding the scale of measures for this year and that money is going to be set aside for the future challenges, but we are not telling people; it is that we are working on all of this at the moment.  The decisions will be made just before the budget and we will announce them at that point.<\/p> <p>  In response to the question on debt warehousing, the total amount of money at the end of August was &euro;1.3 billion in VAT and &euro;1.2 billion in employer PAYE.  We have &euro;2.5 billion in those two tax heads and a further &euro;200 million across other taxes, bringing the total value to &euro;2.7 billion.  Some 78,000 individual businesses are currently availing of the option.  As of now, I have received no advice or guidance that there is added difficulty at the moment in settling that.  For businesses that may be looking in, which are concerned about their ability to pay us, I would advise them to engage fully with the Revenue Commissioners on it because they will collect the money on a case-by-case basis in a way that also respects the viability and continuation of employers and companies.  That is why I have shied away from a single plan for all, because I accept there is a need for differentiated treatments depending on the status of various taxpayers.

We are very concerned about the effect of the current inflation cycle on older people.  People on fixed incomes are extremely vulnerable.  Will the Government commit to introducing a cap on energy prices or a windfall tax and using the proceeds to increase the eligibility for fuel allowance and to fund energy upgrades specifically for older people?  The previous speaker, who is sitting beside me, Deputy Canney, asked about the fuel allowance but I did not hear the response.  I would welcome some clarity on the issue.<\/p> <p>  The T&aacute;naiste said today that there are a number of items in the taxation commission report, which are straight out of the Sinn F&eacute;in manifesto, and they will not happen under this Government.

I will address some of those points and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, will respond to the Deputy as well.<\/p> <p>  In the course of our pre-budget discussions, we have met a wide range of stakeholders, including groups representing older people.  We are two practising politicians who have been elected like Deputy Ryan and we are very much in touch with our constituents and the elderly members of our community.  We very much appreciate that many of them are worried, especially about inflation, the cost of living, energy bills and so on.  We have given a commitment to many of the Deputy's colleagues this evening that we will do the very best we can to support them.  We will be making a contribution and helping them to get through this period in the best way we possibly can.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Ryan raised a number of issues relating to capping energy prices.  It is a complex area but in Ireland we have many electricity providers who do not generate electricity.  They purchase it on the wholesale markets and the price they pay is indeterminate.  We do not know what price they will end up paying and if we put a cap on the price that they can charge the consumer, many of those businesses may well go bust and go out of business.  We need to think through very carefully the consequences of the solutions that we are bringing forward because it seems to me that such a proposal does sign the taxpayer up to an unlimited liability for pledging to bridge that gap, whatever it may be, but it is undetermined what the amount will be.<\/p> <p>  We are working with our EU partners on a windfall tax.  We expect movement in the coming weeks on excess revenues being earned by non-gas electricity generators.  That is an issue which may well impact on those generating electricity through wind power.  There may well be additional revenues for Ireland in that respect.  There is also a proposal for a solidarity contribution from primary producers of fossil fuel.  As I understand it, there is only one such provider in Ireland but, again, that may yield revenue for Ireland.  We have given a commitment that any additional revenues that we receive from those sources will be used to help people and businesses over the period ahead.<\/p> <p>  On the specific issue of fuel allowance, it is - as with all other social welfare schemes - under consideration.  It is being reviewed and we will make a final decision close to budget day.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022091400002#N00800","speaker":"1459"},{"type":"speech","time":1663110000,"counter":544,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

I do not accept that.  The cause of where we are at the moment is a war and it is rippling through the world and the global economy.  As to whether I believe there are firms making more profit than they should be because they have seen no change to their costs but the price at which they are selling has gone up, yes, there are very high levels of profit being made there.

While we have spoken a lot this year about targeted measures, which I very much support, some universal measures have a particular impact.  The research tells us that they might be paid more to women or used in a particular way.  Rather than having only targeted measures in the budget, can we expect to see that recognised in an uplift across the board, particularly in respect of payments that have stagnated since 2008?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022091400002#O01400","speaker":"1559"},{"type":"speech","time":1663110000,"counter":559,"content":"<p>The Chairman has asked a very good question.  We are very conscious that the kind of inflation that is being experienced impacts on everyone.  That is why it will involve a combination of measures, some of which will be targeted.  We have made progress in recent years in reducing inequality and poverty.  Even at times when it was not possible, for example, to increase the weekly core social welfare rates some good work was done through those very targeted measures such as qualified child dependant allowance payments and, in the case of people living alone, through the living alone payment.  We will examine all of those but we recognise that there are certain payments that have a universal characteristic to them which will also play a role in getting that overall balance right.  We will be very conscious of the need to protect the lowest income groups or lowest income deciles but we know that everyone is impacted, not in the same way and not evenly, by what we are experiencing at the moment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022091400002#O01500","speaker":"1459"},{"type":"speech","time":1663110000,"counter":560,"content":"<p>Yes, absolutely.

The invitation specifically refers to the committee's wish to discuss recently announced proposed service changes to branches, but we are of course happy to consider any areas the committee wishes to cover that also affect the bank, our customers and the wider economy.<\/p> <p>  With me representing AIB are Mr. Jim O'Keeffe, managing director of retail banking, Ms Helen Dooley, group general counsel, and Mr. Adrian Moynihan, director of group transformation.<\/p><p>I will begin by addressing the controversy that arose in July regarding AIB&rsquo;s proposal to remove cash services from 70 of our branches.  That announcement caused widespread public upset.  We abandoned the plan within three days of its publication but today I again acknowledge the alarm it caused and reiterate our regret. <br\/><br\/>It is very important from AIB&rsquo;s perspective that we clearly explain our position and this forum provides us with an opportunity to do so.  Given that the way in which customers manage their financial affairs is rapidly evolving, it is incumbent on the bank to map out coherent strategies in response to those changes.  AIB&rsquo;s original decision to remove cash and reshape its services in 70 branches was based on a genuine effort to futureproof the viability of our branch network, keeping our 170 branches open nationwide while ensuring that our customers could continue to access cash services in their communities through our expanded partnership with An Post.  This, we believed, would provide a resilient, cost-sustainable network into the future as customers&rsquo; banking requirements continue to develop and, in the process, generate revenue for An Post.  <br\/><br\/>A great deal has been written and said about the bank&rsquo;s decision and it is imperative that we illustrate the reasoning behind it.  The Covid-19 pandemic had accelerated the decline of cash usage and visits to bank branches and had triggered a dramatic increase in customers&rsquo; adoption of digital banking services.  In AIB&rsquo;s case, from 2019 to 2022, there was a 35% reduction in the number of customer transactions completed in our branches.  Transaction volumes involving our tellers fell from 9.9 million in 2019 to a forecast 5.8 million overall this year.  The figures for transactions at our cash and cheque lodgement, CCL, facilities almost halved from 14 million in that three-year period to 7.7 million.  ATM transactions fell from 15.4 million in 2019 to an estimated 12 million for all of 2022.  Meanwhile, daily digital interactions increased to 2.9 million, compared to 35,000 customer branch visits.  Customer preferences have in fact been changing since 2014.  For example, that year over 19 million cheques were issued, but this number would fall to 8.7 million by 2020.  This trend is irrevocable and it is going to influence the services required in the traditional model of the local branch.  Against that backdrop and determined to keep our branches open in the community, we proceeded to further develop our relationship with An Post on the basis that the complementary service would allow our customers to continue to access the vast majority of bank services in any of the country&rsquo;s 920 post offices.  We genuinely believed that the &quot;AIB at An Post&rdquo; model, together with our digital banking options, were sufficient to meet our customers&rsquo; cash needs and expectations.<br\/><br\/>We were proven wrong in that belief and underappreciated the huge value that customers continue to attach to the presence of a fully-serviced local branch.  Although digital platforms are perfectly sufficient for much of our customer base, it is clear that many also want continued accessibility to cash, cheque and lodgement services, as well as on-site support for larger and sometimes complicated transactions.  We are witnessing a transformational shift towards an increasingly digital economy.  We are in transition, but as I said on the day of our interim results at the end of July, AIB moved way too far, way too fast in proposing to withdraw cash facilities at 70 of our branches.  I hope that our prompt withdrawal of the plan and assurances that the <i>status quo<\/i>remains have fully quelled customers&rsquo; anxiety.  We will retain Ireland&rsquo;s largest branch network, providing all existing services. The changes proposed in July are off the agenda.<br\/><br\/>What is not off the agenda, however, is the maintenance of our close connection to our customers and our communities.  The geographic scale of our network ensures that there is an AIB branch in 95% of the locations that Ulster Bank and KBC are leaving.  These branches are staffed by our people who understand customers&rsquo; needs at a very local level and who can provide tailored advice and support.  The primacy of customers&rsquo; interests is central to our success.  It is incumbent on the business to meet their expectations so that they can enjoy peace of mind that their finances are being looked after safely and professionally.<br\/><br\/>I do not have to remind this committee that a well-functioning and secure banking system capable of withstanding shock is of vital importance to our customers and the economy at any time.  This is particularly the case in the present moment when we are all dealing with the consequences of the protracted global pandemic and now the impact of the human tragedy and economic upheaval inflicted by the war in Ukraine.  We are acutely aware of the effects of rising inflation and the cost-of-living crisis being experienced by so many of our customers.<\/p><p> As I mentioned earlier, AIB Group reported a positive set of financial results for the first six months of the year, signalling the bank&rsquo;s ongoing capacity to support the Irish economy.  For example, we were in a position to fund &euro;5.4 billion in new loan finance from January to June this year, representing a 20% increase on the performance in the prior year period.<\/p><p> As one of Ireland's pillar banks with 2.8 million customers, which is a number that is growing very rapidly now, AIB is intrinsically linked to the Irish economy.  Over the past decade, the bank's balance sheet has been transformed with the ratio of loans to deposits falling from around 130% to 60% so we now have a surplus of resources, and a massively reduced exposure to bad loans, due to the large amount of restructuring and customer solutions implemented over the past decade.  Our strong balance sheet, capital strength and the consolidation of a growth strategy that closed off a number of customer product gaps means we have a reshaped business, delivering improved returns and capacity to make the necessary investment in our physical and technological infrastructure.  The bank is now very well positioned to adapt to economic strains and the challenges that lie ahead.  In addition, that financial capability allows us to provide extensive support for Ireland&rsquo;s major infrastructural needs, including housing and meeting the country's onerous emissions targets.<\/p><p> Meanwhile the exit of Ulster Bank and KBC from the market, which triggered the mass migration of customers in search of a new financial relationship, means that by half year the bank had opened more than 205,000 bank accounts, which represents a 110% increase on the same period last year.  We expect the figures to peak through this month and into October.  Facilitating the smooth arrival of new customers involved the continued recruitment of 700 temporary staff, and our continued investment in our digital capabilities means that approximately 70% of personal customers can now open a new bank account digitally.<\/p><p> In April, when AIB last met this committee we outlined our capacity and readiness to welcome customers from the departing banks.  Our 170 branch locations and three contact centres have been resourced in order to reduce call and branch appointment waiting times.   A customer now waits an average of four minutes for a response from our contact centre and 12 days for an appointment with a member of branch staff in order to open new accounts.  Support for vulnerable customers through the change process is supplemented with a dedicated helpline in addition to one-to-one service.<\/p><p>The unprecedented transition of almost 1 million current and deposit accounts, involving many millions of direct debits and standing orders, involves huge disruption for customers.  However, given the levels of investment in personnel and technology that we are making, we will minimise customers&rsquo; problems in transitioning to their new financial arrangements.<\/p><p> Finally, I again thank the committee for the opportunity to address a number of important questions.  The banking system is changing.  Customers are moving in ever-growing numbers from a reliance on the service of traditional market players, which are banks, An Post and credit unions, to a combination of digital, card usage and electronic fund transfers.  In the midst of the transition consumers continue to use cash.  The future banking landscape will include new entrants, business models and technologies that will further challenge the incumbents so we must invest in all of the skills, expertise and infrastructure required to compete.  To date, new entrants to the market are smaller in scale with far lower cost bases than the traditional banks.  However, in the final analysis the customer and staff relationship is the lifeblood of AIB's business and, regardless of the radical changes occurring across the banking landscape, we will endeavour to provide the services that ensure that this is protected.  We are very happy to answer questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022091400002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Colin Hunt","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663110000,"counter":587,"content":"<p>I thank the chief executive and call Deputy Barry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022091400002#C00200","speaker":"1496"},{"type":"speech","time":1663110000,"counter":588,"content":"<p>I have a question for whoever wishes to answer.

It is to counter a significant increase in reported price inflation across much of the world.  The rate increases are designed to encourage saving and discourage borrowing as a means of reducing inflation pressures.  Banks are an essential part of the monetary policy transmission system.<\/p> <p>  In respect of what is currently happening in terms of rate increases, at the start of this year no one could have envisaged the number of rate increases that seem likely over the year.  As was said, there was a rate move of 50 basis points, 0.5%.  We responded to that by not increasing rates where we have discretion in terms of borrowing and by eliminating negative interest rates on the deposit side.  In terms of the shape of our mortgage book, which accounts for more than half of the lending book of AIB Group, approximately 52% of that is fixed.  An increase in variable rates at any point in time will not impact on those borrowers.  Approximately less than 20% are tracker rates and the residual, nearly 30%, are on standard variable rates.  Substantial work done has been done in recent years to increase the range of products available to customers to give them real choice in what product they want to use when borrowing for a mortgage.

Dr. Hunt mentioned in his opening statement that there was an underappreciation.  Are there any other areas where the public mood, or more importantly, the mood of AIB customers has also been underappreciated?  He said this was a miscalculation.

We reversed course within three days of the initial proposal having been made.  I regret that we caused concern and alarm for our customers.  I heard our customers loud and clear.  I heard with a volume I have never heard before.  What we were trying to do was to do something fundamentally different.  There are financial institutions across the world that are significantly reducing the size of their branch footprint, but we wanted to do something different, which was to remain fully embedded in the communities we serve.  I have said on numerous occasions that the best brand ambassadors we have are the people who serve on the front line.  We underappreciated the importance of cash.  We heard the message; we got it loud and clear.  We made the reversal and this is now settled business.  I think on the morning of our results I said that we moved way too far, way too fast.  I continue to believe that we got ahead of our customers.  I think it is inevitable that banking is going to look different in 2030 from today.  There is an inexorable move towards an increasingly digital offering, but we are not going to get ahead of our customers again.

Dr. Hunt has been very open with his regret in that regard, but surely this could have been foreseen.  What level of preparation was put in to engage with customers that this was on the horizon, namely, genuinely working with customers rather than trying to sell them things, trying to convince them that banking is changing and that AIB wants to bring them along to modernise and provide them with a better product and service but also to future-proof the model of banking?  There must have been a serious gap in the preparation for this move that led not only to the seismic size of the backlash, but such a quick reversal.  What work has been done by the bank to realise why this mistake was made and how can Dr. Hunt ensure that it will not be made in other areas or, indeed, related areas?  He said, rightly, that there will be less demand for cash services in branches, but there are people who need to be brought along in the process to embrace digital.

The big strength of our institution is that we have 2.8 million customers.  We are not in the business of transactions.  We are in the business of relationships because they are core to the way we view ourselves and the way we view our importance in the country.  The lesson for us arising from this matter is that we cannot get too far ahead of our customers.  We cannot damage that relationship by getting too far ahead of them too quickly.  That is the big lesson from the experience of those few days in July.  A huge amount of work over many months went into preparing for this.  We worked hard with An Post on an agreement to increase significantly the range of services that we offer through its offices around the country.  We have 170 branches.  An Post has 920 post offices and we were transforming the volume of services that we were planning to offer through them.  No shortage of analysis went into this.  No shortage of data were considered when we were building this proposal.  When it was launched, however, it became abundantly clear extraordinarily quickly that the customers did not want this.  Once that became clear, we set about reversing our position.  It took three days to go through governance, which accounts for the delay between the decision being announced and it being reversed.  However, we corrected the mistake as quickly as we could.

We saw in June the concerns around the question of compound versus simple interest.  It is worth noting that those concerns were raised in this committee in June 2021.  Yet, they were still having to be unpacked going into the summer of 2022.  This is a question of what is listened to.  We talk about what was not recognised.  These things have been flagged widely and issues have even been flagged in this committee.<\/p> <p>  I will raise the issue of the other decision, which is the one on which I will probably focus because I think the other ruling has already been unpacked quite substantially, and that is the question of that decision process leading to the proposal for the closure of a number of banks and the shift to digital services.<\/p><p>In June 2021, when the committee met AIB, I and other members asked whether excessive emphasis was being placed on the figures for digital transactions taking place during the Covid-19 pandemic and whether there had been a proper estimate of the extent to which those transactions were taking place digitally not as a matter of preference but of medical necessity.  In addition, a large number of financial activities relating to banks had been placed in suspension.  We specifically highlighted the need for AIB to recalculate what it was framing as the preference of customers and to give a proper weighting to Covid.  What mechanisms will AIB have in place to respond at an earlier point to questions, issues and concerns that are flagged by customers, trade unions or Oireachtas Members?  Since that meeting in June 2021, it seems there was no shift in how AIB acted and made decisions in the six to eight months thereafter on the basis of concerns that had been well flagged a year previously.<\/p><p> Dr. Hunt stated the necessary transition would still happen.  I am a little concerned that this matter is being viewed as a public relations failure, rather than a failure to meaningfully consider the needs of Irish society.  In that context, 42% of people in Ireland have below average digital skills and more than half of those aged between 65 and 74 have never used the Internet.  Those figures are a reality check.<\/p><p> Financial abuse affects older people and people with disabilities in particular.  The idea of not being able to directly access a local bank branch or cash payments affects and exacerbates vulnerability to financial abuse.<\/p><p> What is happening with regard to AIB's internal mechanisms for listening better and assessing specific issues of financial vulnerability that have been exposed?  The digital transition is simply not happening at pace.  It is not simply a matter that it needed to be promoted quicker.  It is that it is not where a large section of the population is at.<\/p><p> I attended a briefing by the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC, today and one of the issues it spoke about was banking and related equality issues.  In that context, given that the State is the largest shareholder in AIB, it strikes me that if this decision had been equality-proofed, it certainly would have highlighted issues such as the digital divide, the vulnerability of particular persons to economic abuse and its implications for financial independence.  Is there equality screening in place?  Has AIB looked at some of the tools that have been developed under the public duty for equality and human rights to see how it could apply them to its major policy decisions?  Will that be taken on board going forward?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022091400002#J01500","speaker":"1662","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1663110000,"counter":652,"content":"<p>On the Senator's point on access to branches, the proposal was all about maintaining access to branches while removing cash services from them.

The key message we got was that there is a significant cohort of customers that want to have continuing access to cash.

Any programme, including the programme we referred to, takes into account the steps we would need to take with vulnerable customers.  To give a sense of that, already this year, in terms of customers who would be in need of support in that way, outside of ordinary support, we have recorded something in the region of 2,500 customers that we have assisted.  That is where we would pick up on various regulations or guidance, in terms of how it is being built in.  There is a very heavy training programme for all of our staff at the front end to ensure that people can identify customers with vulnerability.

I have highlighted that just over 40% of the population lack basic digital skills.  That is a very significant cohort of persons.

Let me finish on the key point of interest rates.  Just like in the time of Covid, AIB&rsquo;s customers are under huge pressure now.  I note the fact the previous interest rate hike of 50 basis points was not passed on by the bank, and I think that was the right decision.  It was asked earlier, but the bank's profits were &euro;477 million in the first half of the financial year, its new lending increased by 20%, its total income increased by 8%, its net interest income increased by 2% and its balance sheet was further de-risked with a further reduction in non-performing loans, NPLs, which is welcome.  I spoke earlier in regard to the decision or the driving force behind Dr. Hunt and the board, although I do not support some of those decisions on the selling off of NPLs.  That said, AIB is in a strong position in the time ahead.  It has increased its market share in the mortgage market, given the exit, it has grown its personal customer base and, in March, it announced it is going to start to pay back &euro;213 million to shareholders through dividend payments and share buyback schemes.  Is it not the time to again stand with AIB&rsquo;s customers, recognising that its costs of funds are quite low, that it is not paying any interest at all on deposits at the moment, or I do not think so, and it is funding most of its lending from deposits?

We are aware of the market, the sector that the banks are in and the pressures that are there.  There is a drive to push people online a lot of time, and that is across much of the retail sector.  We see it in our main streets, where many of shops are not there anymore.  I am sure that the same applies to the banks, as there are costs involved there as well.<\/p> <p>  In my own constituency of Wicklow, especially in the more rural parts in the south and in the west, we have seen the on-street banking provision completely gutted.  Bank of Ireland branches have closed down and AIB in Blessington has reduced its services.  A certain level of banking services should be provided to an acceptable standard and level for a population or geographical area.  If we leave it to each of the individual players to say, &ldquo;It is not for us, we are pulling out&rdquo;, then there would be nothing there at all.  It creates a void in huge geographical areas, as well as a real difficulty for people.  Should there be some set standard that sets out the amount of banking services that shall be provided in a certain geographical population area?  While those might not be in the form of permanent, on-street retail, they could be, for example, mobile or monthly.  There should be the same level of service but there might not be the same frequency of provision of that service.  Does Dr. Hunt understand where I am coming from?<\/p><p>I do.  The industry as a whole is going through an extraordinary volume of change at the moment.  I am not going to give free advertising to competitors by giving names of companies that are providing banking services but it is coming in multiple forms.  There are digital-only banks and non-bank lenders, which all have an exclusively digital way of interacting with their customers.  Right across the industry, not only in Ireland but globally, there is an ongoing move to reduce the number of branches.  As I said earlier, we want to do something different.  We look at the network and the physical presence we have as a distinguishing feature.  We have the biggest network in the country and we will continue to have the biggest network in the country.  This proposal was never about reducing our physical presence because we think that is a distinguishing feature.  We think it is important from a competitive perspective because it shows we are there and embedded.  Our staff live in the community.  They are members of the local GAA club, golf club or whatever.  They are actually living in these communities.  For us, that is very important.  This was never about us reducing our physical footprint.

While I thank them for reversing their decision, I do not thank them for thinking of it because it would have stripped bank branches, such as those in Kenmare, Cahersiveen, Dingle, Castleisland and Killorglin of cash.  It was a ridiculous idea and it frightened the living daylights out of ordinary, country people in those glens and valleys around Kerry.  It was reprehensible to think that people from Valentia Island would have to come into Killarney and Tralee, which are 55 or 60 miles away.  People were outraged that this may have been the scenario they were facing into the future for the rest of their days.<\/p> <p>  I am glad that on that Friday, Deputies Mattie McGrath, Michael Collins and I visited the AIB headquarters in Molesworth Street and I have no hesitation in saying that we were prepared to stay there for a long time.  Had the decision did not come through and had there been no change, we maybe would still be there today.  People and entities make mistakes.  I heard Dr. Hunt saying on a number of times on the radio that in his time, he will not go back to that idea.  I ask him to make that commitment before members at this important Oireachtas committee and to again give that undertaking to those people who were going to be affected by this idea to strip the bank branches of cash.  What kind of a bank do you have?  Do you have a pub with no beer?  A bank branch with no cash certainly would not serve the people who I represent and who I know across the length and breadth of the county that I represent.  It was a scandalous idea.  That is the first thing that I ask Dr. Hunt to commit to here today, that is, to say he will not go back to that idea while he is in charge.  I hope that for that reason alone, he will be charge for quite a while.  <\/p> <p>  The other question I have to ask relates to the fact that the people bailed out the banks ten or 12 years ago, as did the Government.  As I understand it, the Government has a 70% share in AIB today.  How long before the decision the bank came out with was made or before it was publicly announced did the Government know about it?  I ask this because the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, said he was blindsided by it.  The media came out the following day to say the issue had been resolved but that the Government had been aware of it for a considerable amount of time before the announcement had been made.  Was the Minister blindsided or did he show a blind eye to it?  There is no shadow of a doubt that it would help Revenue&rsquo;s case to collect more revenue, if everything was transparent.  If, for example, you bought a box of matches, it should show in a document somewhere that you bought that box of matches.<\/p><p>The worry I have is how much involvement the Government had in that decision.

I see no extra staff hired or looked for in branches like Kilgarvan, Kenmare or Sneem.  One person operates those post offices and in O'Briens in Glenflesk, and they do their best to manage the work they have to do with the pensions and different things.  No extra staff, equipment or anything was put into those post offices that I know about.  I am amazed to hear all this talk about the partnership with the post office because we have been fighting since I was elected and before that to get more services into the post offices and yet we have seen Departments telling people to go to their bank with their requests, instead of going to the post office.  We have been fighting against that and have been looking for more services to be put in post offices but I have seen no improvement early this year, late last year or at any time during the summer in staff, personnel or equipment in the post offices.

The only problem with this is that it has a human cost.  The debate society has to have on this is bigger than AIB.  Many people are living more isolated lifestyles than even before.  I am talking about people who no longer have a post office or pub to go to and who have no Garda station or bank in their village any more.  These people are not talking to people from one day to the next.  There is also a significant increase in the incidence of mental health issues in society.

Another element to this is that Ireland is also undergoing a spatial crisis.  The capital is overheating and the commuter belt is sprawling into Ulster, Connacht and Munster, with all of the focus on the capital, while regional towns and villages are emptying out.  There are towns in my constituency where you could play hurling on the main street at midday because everybody is commuting out of them.  The economic heart and soul of these towns is being ripped apart not just by the closing of banks, but by the closing of all of the other facilities.  The closure of banks is a part of that jigsaw as regards creating energy.  If you live in Athboy, you have to travel to Navan or Mullingar to do your banking.  People are therefore not going into Athboy.  They will not get their hair cut there and will not go to the pub for a pint or to the restaurant for a sandwich and so on.  There are major problems in this regard.  I would like the question of breathing new life into towns and cities in the country to be at the front and centre of Dr. Hunt's bank's corporate responsibilities to ensure that these towns and cities remain viable.<\/p> <p>  The other element in all of this is the lack of competition. One of the reasons banks can get away with closing banks or reducing cash facilities is that we have an enormous banking crisis.  There is now very little competition.  The banking system is concentrated in so few hands that AIB is operating as an oligopoly.  I studied economics in UCD, and the current situation is very close to an oligopoly market.  That means that suppliers have enormous power.  The banks can dictate most of the interactions they have with customers and those customers simply have to take it.  There is great inertia with regard to changing banks.  There are 500,000 Ulster Bank and KBC accounts still open.  Those banks are leaving the market.  That shows how inertia affects the banking market.  The bank has to take into consideration the very great power it has.  That power was given to it by the State because the State specifically set up a pillar bank system that gave the banks market control and market share and created an imbalance between the banks and their customers.  That is not AIB's fault but the fault of the Government for allowing it to happen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022091400002#EE00500","speaker":"1504"},{"type":"speech","time":1663110000,"counter":887,"content":"<p>What is the Deputy's question?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022091400002#EE00600","speaker":"1496"},{"type":"speech","time":1663110000,"counter":888,"content":"<p>My question relates to creating more competition.  Would AIB support the development of local public banking?  Part of this relates to getting cash circulating in these small towns.

How can AIB help with the circulation of cash in towns and villages around the country?

A rolling bank visiting for a few hours a week is not good enough.  Credit is the lifeblood of small businesses.  How can more credit be circulated in small towns and villages?<\/p><p> I will ask one final question.  The bank's fees have been massive for the last while because of low interest rates.  Given that interest rates are increasing, will it be cutting fees for users?  The bank has not increased its interest rate recently.

I am joined by my colleagues, Ms Susan Russell, who is the director of retail Ireland, and Ms Aoife Leonard, who is the interim director of distribution, digital, strategy and operations.<\/p> <p>  Over the past decade, the way in which consumers and businesses bank has been changing rapidly.  As a full-service retail bank, Bank of Ireland has been responding to this change in a range of ways.  Today, we serve our customers through a mix of branch, digital and telephone banking services, along with a network of mobile advisers who can meet customers at a time and place that suits them.  I will briefly set out further information in respect of these services and then we will be happy to take the committee's questions.<\/p> <p>  Bank of Ireland has an extensive nationwide network of 169 branches in Ireland.  We recognise the importance of cash services to customers and communities in all parts of Ireland and we offer cash services at all our branches.  Over 2022 and 2023, we will invest &euro;13 million in upgrades and improvements to this network.  In common with banks in many other markets, we have also seen a considerable change in branch usage.  Between 2017 and 2022, in-branch transactions declined by approximately 54%.  As a result of changing customer preferences, last year we made the first significant change to our branch network in almost a decade with the closure of 88 branches.  As we discussed with the committee in March 2021, that decision was not taken lightly but reflected that we had reached a tipping point in customer preference between online and offline banking.<\/p> <p>  However, while making these changes, we also agreed a new partnership with An Post.  This partnership maintained and significantly expanded access to local services including cash services.  Our customers can now access a range of banking services, including cash lodgment and withdrawal and cheque lodgment, at more than 900 post office locations across Ireland.  Over 90% of our branch transactions can be handled through the post office network and this partnership has resulted in more than 830,000 Bank of Ireland transactions at post offices since September 2021.<\/p> <p>  Regarding digital banking, Bank of Ireland&rsquo;s mobile banking app remains by far the most popular way for customers to manage their banking, with 1.4 million customers now using the app.  We have seen a 36% growth in mobile traffic over the past 12 months.  We have also seen a significant increase in contactless payments, with transaction volumes having increased by 125% over the last three years.  In the first six months of 2019, our customers tapped more than 70 million times, spending more than &euro;890 million.  In the first six months of this year, this had grown to more than 161 million taps, spending more than &euro;2.6 billion.<\/p> <p>  Customers can access many different products online, with over 30 personal products available digitally, spanning all popular product types including accounts, cards, mortgages, and insurance.  Some 94% of all applications for everyday banking products are now received digitally.  We continue to improve our digital offering to support customers opening accounts or to apply for loans as quickly and efficiently as possible.  For example, as Ireland&rsquo;s largest lender to the agricultural sector, today, approximately 80% of our agricultural loans are applied for online or over the phone with approvals made within 48 hours in 70% of cases.<\/p> <p>  Our contact centres are central to our customer service operations since they are the hub for all telephone banking services.  We employ 950 contact centre staff across our network.  In August, calls to our main banking lines were answered, on average, in less than one minute. We always strive to serve customers as quickly as possible and we continually invest in our systems, processes and people to ensure we can do this.<\/p><p>We have also seen customer preferences change, with more requests to meet customers at their home or business.  This is why we developed our network of over 630 mobile advisers, across mortgages and business banking, who are available to meet business and personal customers at locations that suit their needs.  This also includes our bank at work team, which provides a range of services in workplaces across the country.<\/p><p> There will, of course, always be some customers who need additional support.  Our vulnerable customer unit is a centre of expertise within the bank and provides support to customers and their families who find themselves in vulnerable circumstances or situations, including age-related or cognitive impairment, financial abuse, addiction or illness.  In 2021, this unit supported 6,000 customers with a range of issues.<\/p><p> We have previously discussed with the committee the unprecedented change which is under way in Irish banking at present.  In response, we have scaled up to support customers switching banks with an additional 655 resources across our opening and operations teams, contact centre teams, and mobile support teams.  This has helped Bank of Ireland to open the same number of personal current accounts in the first six months of 2022 as it did in the whole of 2021.<\/p><p> We are also strongly supporting Ukrainians who need banking services, including providing guidance on transferring assets and assisting in the account opening process.  We have hired more than 30 people, over half of whom are themselves displaced from Ukraine due to the Russian invasion, to support Ukrainian refugees to open accounts.  Bank of Ireland has opened more than 4,000 accounts to date for displaced Ukrainians.<\/p><p> We will continue to offer a range of ways to bank through branch, digital and contact centres, and through the post office network.  We will also continue to invest in our services and innovate to keep pace with changing customer preferences.  As a full-service retail bank, with a 239-year heritage, we are committed to serving the needs of our customers and the Irish economy for the long term.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022091400002#TT00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gavin Kelly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663110000,"counter":923,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses.

Unless the customer wants to give money to Bank of Ireland for the craic, is there any sound financial reason why a person should have a mortgage at a variable rate with Mr. Kelly&rsquo;s bank, when there are significant savings to be made?  I say that because we know that this happens in insurance, in mortgages and elsewhere, where people, unfortunately, have a fear of moving or even of moving products and all that involves.  Mr. Kelly&rsquo;s bank is exploiting that fear deliberately.  I put it to Mr. Kelly very clearly that his bank is doing this consciously because there is no financial reason in this world why a person should be with Bank of Ireland on a variable mortgage when one can get the same product from other competitors at nearly 1.5% less, which will save that person thousands of euro.  A person with a loan-to-value mortgage of &euro;200,000 with Bank of Ireland over a 20-year period would save over &euro;1,500 per year if he or she were with AIB.  Over the lifetime of the mortgage, that person would probably save &euro;30,000.

That is the reason, is it not?  It is just profiteering.  We have got you, you are likely to not move from us and we know the inertia in banking, so why would we offer something that would reduce our profitability when what we want is to capture Deputy Durkan?  Is that not it, plain and simple?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022091400002#ZZ00200","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1663110000,"counter":1027,"content":"<p>As I said, we keep our options open-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022091400002#ZZ00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gavin Kelly"},{"type":"speech","time":1663110000,"counter":1028,"content":"<p>Under review.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022091400002#ZZ00400","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1663110000,"counter":1029,"content":"<p>Under review.

I happen to be a customer, by coincidence, having changed like a lot of other people did from one of the banks leaving the country.<\/p><p>I watched the ads about the transition from one bank to another and how smooth it is, but it is not.  That is the answer to that question.  It is just a humdrum, long drawn out year's work to get the account in a bank that is leaving the country closed and the new account set up.  It took me the guts of a year and even then I had to threaten legal action because they just would not go away.  I am not blaming our guests for that but I have the following observation.  Business is all about competition and if you are the same as the others, as far as the customer is concerned, then there is a limit to what you can ever do.  Thus, while it might be convenient for the banks to have this brotherly love, no competition and if you do such and such a thing we will do something else that will not affect you, that does not gain any business.  There is nothing for a potential customer there.  Previous speakers talked about the potential customers versus the existing customers.  It would be a good thing for the bank, between now and the next time it is before the committee, to look at the points raised by Deputy Doherty and see to what extent, if any, it could incorporate them into its <i>modus operandi<\/i>.  It would be important, and far better than all the ads.  If the bank compared the cost it might be more cost-effective than the ads as well.  That is my summation because I have always had a suspicion of ads, what they mean and what they tell you they do.  I am aware there is a consistency about the expenditure the bank could not have in other areas and all that kind of thing but the fact of the matter is we are in the competition business.<\/p><p>The other thing I want to talk about is the importance of the customer.  There is not a great deal of importance any more in having customers in this country and particularly with the banks in general.  That was seen by the way the personalised counter service that was available all over the country disappeared overnight.  Of course it saves money but it loses money as well.  There is no question in the world about it.  There were lending institutions that give that a personal touch and that appealed to the customer on the basis the customer is an important person.  There is no alternative to that.  Nothing can replace the customer feeling when they go into a lending institution that they are welcome there, that they are going to the people they always went to on their own street in their own town and that they do not have to go anywhere else.  I would like the bank to muse on that.<\/p><p> A useful advertisement to employ would be to offer to restore the ATM that was seized from the Houses of the Oireachtas in the middle of the Covid lockdown.  I deemed that at the time to be a prelude to something else, namely, closing more of them down throughout the country, and that happened.  It would be an advertisement.  The excuse we were given at the time was that the ATM was not making money.  Not everything is about making money, and not everything one does in a banking system is about making money.  Some of it is about public relations and the degree to which the customer, or potential customer, is impressed by the way an institution does business.<\/p><p> In response the previous questioner, Mr. Kelly mentioned 2017 and 2020.  The later was the most awful time in this country that ever was.  There was nobody going anywhere; they were forbidden to move.  Everybody who could was using the electronic system.  It worked but it was not always ideal for some people, for reasons that are established.  That is one for our guests from the bank.  The bank is in competition with others, so let us see.  Incidentally, it was said about the closure of the machine here that there were no people using it.  I was often at it when there was a queue of customers.  Whether the people who put it there were blindsided or whatever, I do not what the reason was but this is the Parliament and it was an important ATM.  There are many customers in here - a captive audience - and it would be appreciated by them.  There is something in lieu of advertising.<\/p><p> Before I go, I should mention that I, like the Chairman, had lots of interaction with Bank of Ireland during and after the crash.  I am not saying this out of peevishness in the context of the witnesses who were before us earlier, but I was always treated with respect.  Bank of Ireland staff at national and regional level were extremely courteous and helpful.  They did everything they could to set up a situation and resolve the thing for the customer, with one exception.  That was the bank's former chief executive, who has now gone elsewhere.  He made a famous speech that immediately threw many of the customers I was dealing with into appalling fear they were about to be evicted from their homes and so forth.  Tragically, some took their lives.  It was a sad thing but it happened.  The moral of that is simple, namely, nobody in that kind of position should ever loosely use their situation to drum up custom or improve their lot.  They should think about the customer, and especially vulnerable customers, of which there were many up and down the country.<\/p><p> I will conclude by giving my thanks to those who were thoughtful, who listened and who tried to do something about the situation that developed.  There were not many who did but the people I met in the Bank of Ireland did.  They went to a lot of trouble to make alternative arrangements for people throughout the country.  I am not only talking about this part of the country, but places all over the country.  I did not always see that coming from other quarters.  I thank the Chairman; I must attend another meeting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022091400002#ZZ00700","speaker":"1584","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663110000,"counter":1033,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022091400002#AAA00200","speaker":"1496"},{"type":"speech","time":1663110000,"counter":1034,"content":"<p>Do not forget the ATM.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022091400002#AAA00300","speaker":"1584"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1663110000,"counter":1035,"content":"<p>I appreciate the Deputy's comments, particularly in respect of our staff.

Has he ever been there during the Willie Clancy Summer School?  Has he any idea that the impact of taking the bank out of Miltown Malbay has had?  There is a post office there and the people who run it are excellent, progressive people.  Inevitably, however, post offices close at a particular time.  Even the supermarkets have ATMs, but they close at a particular time.  One cannot lodge money at a supermarket.  ATMs are very constrained in how much money they give out.  Does Mr. Kelly have any idea why on earth anybody from a town like Miltown Malbay, Tulla or Kilkee would have any goodwill towards Bank of Ireland, given what it has done?  It closed the branch but it left the branch in Ennistymon open, which is down the road.  I put it to Mr. Kelly that the reason Bank of Ireland left the Ennistymon branch open but closed the branch in Miltown Malbay was because there is an AIB branch in Ennistymon and it had a competitor.  Its customers had somewhere else to go in the case of people who lived in Ennistymon but they do not in the case of the people who live in Miltown Malbay.

This was not reached lightly.  As I said, we looked at our footprint across the entire country.  We wanted to ensure that we provided a service across every county, including in County Clare.  We also support that with the post office, which is important for us because there are 900 post offices that can give access to cash to customers.  As I said earlier, we saw a change.  We had not altered our branch network in any shape or form for well over ten or 15 years before that, but we did reach a tipping point last year in terms of customer usage.

Because he gave his evidence here, I am putting it on the record of the committee that we had that discussion and that I have sought a meeting.  I know there is a legal position, a court order and so on, but in cases like this, every avenue has to be exhausted by the bank from a humanity and compassion perspective relative to his circumstances and given that he wants to resolve it.  The matter needs to be taken back out of the hands of solicitors and looked at again to see what can be done.  The fact there is a court order means there are other avenues which are not open to him.  He probably made a mistake earlier in being a lay litigant.  He missed a few appropriate legal points and opportunities to present his case to the courts.

If I bring it forward to this year, we have added approximately 250 staff to our front-line services, such as branches and customer-facing operational areas.  We have also added another 120 staff to our contact centre this year.  As Mr. Crowley said, the Ulster Bank staff will come over to the branches.  Not only are we maintaining the services they had, but we are adding some additional services.  Some of those branches close for lunch, etc.  We will look at supplementing the staff in those branches as well to make sure we are giving an adequate service to those communities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022091400002#KKK00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Patrick Farrell"},{"type":"speech","time":1663110000,"counter":1178,"content":"<p>I would like to move on to the issue of mortgages.

PTSB must ensure that the bank has, at all times, the customers' interests first and foremost.  That particular interest is what keeps the banking system, and every business, going.  There is a tendency nowadays to become less personal in all businesses.  There are a number of places that we, as the customer, ring up and we either do not get an answer or they will tell us that they will ring us back, in which case they might, or we might have to ring for an hour.  It is not unusual now to ring a public office and ring for an hour, be cut off and have to start the process all over again.  It infuriates people.<\/p> <p>  Another point I wish to make is that we live in a very competitive world.  It is important that not all the banks sing the same tune at the same time.  There will be some areas in which they will have to in respect of reserves and so on and so forth.  However, it is up to the banks themselves to show the potential customers that they are aware of their existence, and that they are willing to encourage them<\/p> <p>  The customer is the sole root cause for the existence of businesses.  If interest is lost in the customer, then the whole thing closes down.  From what I can see, PTSB is recognising what needs to be done.  I hope it continues.  There were customers in danger.  In most cases, they have moved on or the loans have been sold on, whether they were endangered loans or bad loans, as the case may be.  There are still customers out there who are suffering as a result of the banking crash.  I would emphasise the necessity, at all times, to be conscious of the need to help them out in any way possible, and not to cut them adrift and let them fend for themselves.  I have not listed PTSB for any misdemeanours in that area, but I have listed other banks, and I have told them so.  At the same time, we have all complimented those who have recognised the situation as it was for the customer. <\/p> <p>  Finally, a lot of people will spend a lot of time advertising.  The best advertisement is a satisfied customer.  No advertising is needed after that.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022091400002#LLL00100","speaker":"1584"},{"type":"speech","time":1663110000,"counter":1198,"content":"<p>Mr. Farrell mentioned that 20% of PTSB customers are on tracker mortgages.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022091400002#LLL00200","speaker":"1518"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1663110000,"counter":1199,"content":"<p>It is 28%.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022091400002#LLL00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Patrick Farrell"},{"type":"speech","time":1663110000,"counter":1200,"content":"<p>They are obviously in a good place.

Their mortgages are going to cost them more, immediately, because they are suddenly on a fixed rate.

When is the optimal time for those people to come off a tracker mortgage and get a fixed rate?

A diverse, vibrant and independent media sector is essential for wider society, democracy, cultural development and our social cohesion.  Our media enlightens and educates us and facilitates discourse and debate.  Its content is a reflection of our society.  It is a showcase for our unique culture and heritage and it has the capacity to maintain community bonds.  This has never been more clearly demonstrated, and needed, than it was in recent years.  However, it is a sector that is undergoing profound change.  The Government recognises this and it committed in the programme for Government to establish the Future of Media Commission with a remit to examine how media should serve Irish society, how well the current system meets these goals and what changes ought to be made to improve media in Ireland in the future.  The commission's timely recommendations will inform the framework to help the Government to achieve this.<\/p> <p>  The insights the commission's report offers and its recommendations will feed into Government policy and directly impact the future of media in Ireland for the next ten years and beyond.  The Government accepted in principle 49 of the commission's 50 recommendations, demonstrating how committed the Government is to supporting the media sector as it transitions to new economic models.  With regard to the recommendation to replace the TV licence with a fully Exchequer-funded model, the Government decided that in these challenging economic times, we must balance the needs of the country and economy as a whole.  Our decision not to accept this recommendation was based on more than purely economic reasoning.  We must also ensure the continued independence of media and it is vital that we maintain a link between the creation and consumption of media content.<\/p> <p>  The Government recognises the need to reform the current funding model to ensure it provides for the new realities the sector faces and, importantly, is sustainable.  I have already set up a technical working group that will report to me in November with practical steps to improve the TV licence system to make it fairer and more efficient and sustainable.  A cornerstone of the commission's report and recommendations is a regulator with a wider remit to address the shift in media consumption - a media commission.  The Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill, which is progressing through the Oireachtas, provides for the establishment of such a new media regulator, Coimisi&uacute;n na Me&aacute;n.  A media regulator must now go beyond broadcasting, and an coimisi&uacute;n will replace the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI, and have a broader role in relation to media as well as online safety.  It will thereby provide the regulatory and developmental framework to implement the commission's report.<\/p> <p>  Two of the initial commissioner roles - the broadcasting commissioner and the media development commissioner - will play a significant role in delivering on the Government's implementation of the Future of Media Commission report.  To help Coimisi&uacute;n na Me&aacute;n hit the ground running, I secured funding in budget 2022 to enable an early establishment of the new body and competitions to fill commissioner posts are in train.<\/p> <p>  Another key recommendation from the commission is that the broadcasting fund be replaced by a new media fund, with six proposed new schemes added to the existing sound and vision and archiving schemes.  While the new fund will need to be underpinned by legislation, I have asked that two schemes be prioritised for development and roll-out in 2023 on a pilot basis.  These are the local democracy scheme, which will aim to ensure local media can keep the public informed on areas such as regional health forums, joint policing committees and local authorities, and the courts reporting scheme, which will enable improved reporting from local, regional and national courts.<\/p> <p>  The reform of the licence fee, together with the implementation of the commission's accepted recommendations will enable RT&Eacute; to build on its strengths as our national broadcaster.<\/p><p>Through digital innovation and strategic planning, and with the support of NewERA and Coimisi&uacute;n na Me&aacute;n, RT&Eacute; will further develop its mission to educate, entertain and enrich the lives of our people in a digital era.<\/p><p> Tugaim t&uacute;s &aacute;ite don Ghaeilge chomh maith ar leibh&eacute;al pearsanta agus gairmi&uacute;il.  TG4 fulfils a vital role in supporting the Irish language, sport and culture in an innovative way and I was pleased to provide TG4 with additional funding of &euro;4.2 million in budget 2022, building on a substantial increase in 2021, and leaving TG4 better funded than ever before.  This has enabled TG4 to continue its innovative approach, extend its reach, support the development of quality content, and highlight key cultural and sporting events and festivals.  I very much support the commission&rsquo;s recommendation that Coimisi&uacute;n na Me&aacute;n conduct a comprehensive review of the provision of Irish language services.  Coimisi&uacute;n na Me&aacute;n will work with stakeholders to find synergies and build co-operation throughout the sector.<\/p><p> Coimisi&uacute;n na Me&aacute;n will continue and expand on BAI&rsquo;s sustainability network to further promote sustainability in the wider media sector.  I will also be asking an coimisi&uacute;n to prioritise the development of new gender equality and equality, diversity and inclusion, EDI, standards for the sector to ensure greater representation and content that reflects Irish society today.  The recommended diversity and inclusion strategy for sports broadcasting and reporting will help us showcase more diverse sports across multiple platforms.<\/p><p> I strongly welcome the commission&rsquo;s recommendation to develop a national counter disinformation strategy.  My Department will lead on the strategy&rsquo;s development in the coming months.  We will work with the Irish hub of the European Digital Media Observatory, industry stakeholders, and with the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s Department, which is overseeing the Digital Services Act.<\/p><p> The commission was well briefed on the challenges facing the print sector.  The expanded media fund will directly benefit the print sector, especially local media.  The proposed local democracy and court reporting schemes I referred to will directly benefit the print sector, in particular local and regional outlets.  The commission has also recommended a consideration of indirect taxation measures for the sector, and there will be engagement on this matter in the context of the implementation process.  The commission&rsquo;s recommendations will also benefit the radio sector in the years ahead, both from the widening of the sound and vision scheme to support news content, and from new media fund schemes, such as the media access and training scheme, the community media scheme and digital transformation scheme.<\/p><p> The implementation group established by the Government has now commenced its work with the initial task of developing a detailed implementation strategy, which I intend to bring to the Government in November.  I will also receive a report from the newly established technical working group on proposals to reform the TV licence system this November.  Together with the establishment of Coimisi&uacute;n na Me&aacute;n, this will enable the Government to deliver on its commitment to develop a framework to support our media sector for the next decade and beyond.<\/p><p> Mar a d&uacute;irt m&eacute; cheana, aithn&iacute;onn an Rialtas an g&aacute; at&aacute; le hathchomhaireamh a dh&eacute;anamh ar an m&uacute;nla maoinithe reatha chun a chinnti&uacute; go nd&eacute;anfaidh s&eacute; sol&aacute;thar d&rsquo;earn&aacute;il na me&aacute;n cumars&aacute;ide amach anseo.

The commission also considered potential challenges associated with other funding models.  As I said, the Government believes that maintaining a direct link between broadcasters and the public is important and reforming the TV licence fee system to make it more equitable and sustainable is the right action to take.  There are two reasons; it is about keeping a distance while also considering the context of where we are right now, in challenging times.<\/p> <p>  The Government is not ignoring the commission's recommendations; on the contrary, as Professor MacCraith said at the launch, we have agreed to accept and implement 49 of the 50 recommendations.  We absolutely recognise the fundamental societal value of public service content.  Irish media has served us extraordinarily well, which we have seen in recent years.  However, all funding models are challenging, as the commissioner said, and I believe any new or reformed funding model should retain and build on existing revenues given our current situation, which is from the direct sale of TV licences.  That provides an important, direct link between broadcasters and the public.  It would also reduce the burden on the Exchequer compared with a model based fully on taxation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2022091400002#C00600","speaker":"1471"},{"type":"speech","time":1663110000,"counter":1304,"content":"<p>The basis of my question still stands.

The Minister also referred to the independence of media, but let us look at Nordic countries.  The committee had recommended the Norwegian method of funding, in which they have maintained their media independence which is crucial.<\/p> <p>  Given that it was supposed to be a long-term plan for public service media and for the future, it seems bizarre that the one recommendation that was the cornerstone of commissioning the report in the first instance was not accepted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2022091400002#C00700","speaker":"1497"},{"type":"speech","time":1663110000,"counter":1305,"content":"<p>The system needs to be more equitable, and it will involve a long-term plan.

We need to minimise the risk of actual or even perceived political interference in media independence that could arise in a system in which public service media is fully dependent on Exchequer funding, and that was our concern.  The report of the commission states that there is no perfect funding model, and that all funding models are challenging, as I said.

They have been extremely helpful in formulating discourse on this very important topic.<\/p> <p> With regard to the technical group the Minister has established, the basic principles of providing news have not changed substantially in hundreds of years.  I refer to the work reporters do in ascertaining basic information, reporting on it and then conveying it to the public.  What has changed is how we access that news not just in terms of broadcast media, but also print media.  What all of the media organisations are struggling with is the revenue streams that underpin that or the lack thereof.  Notwithstanding the work that is going on and which the technical group is doing, is the Minister worried about the future of media, both broadcast and print media - and national and regional newspaper editors are going to be in the audiovisual room tomorrow, which is something I will address in a moment - as a viable commercial enterprise?  I ask her that in the context of the Government's decision that directly intervening, abolishing the TV licence fee and providing direct Exchequer funding might result in a perception of political interference in the media sector, whether such interference is real or not.  There is a fear that, notwithstanding any reform of the TV licence fee, it will not meet the funding requirements of RT&Eacute;.

On the broader context, I believe that the 49 recommendations that have been accepted in principle by Government and the work that has been done on the reform of the TV licence will put us in a good place.  The establishment by the Government of the Future of Media Commission was a recognition that something had to change.  As the Senator has said, it has to do with how people now access media.  I will point to the media fund.  The commission recommended additional funding of &euro;15 million for the new media fund.  The detail of that additional funding will be agreed in the context of the budgetary negotiations.  I have already engaged with the Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath's Department in that regard.  The introduction of this new media fund will be a significant step towards the support that, as the Senator has said, is needed to allow the media to continue in their vital role, which we all recognise.  This is also very true at local and regional levels as well.  I refer to local radio and local newspapers.  I have asked that priority be given to the roll-out of two of the schemes, the local democracy and court reporting schemes.  All of us, and especially those of us who come from rural Ireland, know how important such reporting is, whether on radio or in print.  I have asked that work be done on that.  I expect that the new Coimisi&uacute;n na Me&aacute;n will be in a position to commence these schemes in 2023.  The work will start with the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI.  That will ensure reporting on the joint policing committees, the regional health forums, our local authorities and so on.

It is continuing to go in one direction.  On top of that, there is also the hit to its commercial revenue streams, which are being gobbled up by other platforms.  When RT&Eacute; launched its autumn schedule this year, the point was made that, unless stability was brought to funding streams, the high quality of internal productions could not be guaranteed.  By the way, the Future of Media Commission itself said that the system is broken.  RT&Eacute; has also said that.  The funding system is broken.  The Minister has established a technical group to see how to fix that.  Notwithstanding that, entities sometimes die.

I support the commission's recommendation to designate RT&Eacute; as a body to be supported by NewERA under the National Treasury Management Agency Act 1990.  This will guarantee independent oversight of RT&Eacute;'s finances.  The Future of Media Commission also saw an enhanced role for Coimisi&uacute;n na Me&aacute;n in setting targets for RT&Eacute; and monitoring how well RT&Eacute; achieves these targets.

Many young people are accessing an app to download their news through RT&Eacute; News Now, Sky News or whatever, where they might be paying the provider but are paying nothing to the State.

I had the amazing experience of going into a local shop here in the city centre and asking for a newspaper only to be told they do not stock them any more.  It is frightening.

It is a regret.<\/p> <p>  I will also come to the defence of the recommendation that has been made on general Exchequer funding.  The issue of independence has been raised many times over the years when it comes to general funding of RT&Eacute; or public service broadcasting through general taxation.  The Department of Social Protection, through the household benefit package, already covers TV licences for 483,000 homes at a cost of &euro;70 million.  That is approximately 31% of TV licence revenues.  There is no suggestion of interference when we take that into account.  TG4 has always been funded by general taxation from the Exchequer.  As there is never any suggestion of interference when we think about TG4, I do not accept the argument of interference a whole lot.<\/p> <p>  There is also the benefit general taxation would have in producing prosecutions.  In 2020, there were 9,555 summons.  Approximately 4,000 of those cases went to court.  Those prosecutions - what a waste of everyone's time - would be done away with through general taxation.<\/p><p>While I know An Post needs the money, those costs would probably not be in the mix through general taxation.  It is important that we come to its defence that.  Funding RT&Eacute; through general taxation is a good suggestion.<\/p><p> The Minister has said that reform of the television licence together with the accepted recommendations will enable RT&Eacute; to build on its strengths.  How much of the gap will be filled?  RT&Eacute; reckons that the loss through no-television homes is &euro;35 million along with an evasion loss of &euro;30 million.

As the Senator said, RT&Eacute;'s funding comes mainly from the television licence, but TG4 is now funded directly by the Exchequer.

We recently saw a report on how something like 100-odd managers earn more than &euro;100,000 per year in that organisation.  That would not compare to any other business or organisation.<\/p> <p>  There was also a recommendation regarding sport, which is welcome.  Since the 2020 campaign, which the committee has discussed previously, there has been more reporting on women's sport and reporting by women commentators in recent years, even the women's international soccer team.  We are only starting to show these sports on various forms of media.<\/p> <p>  Other active sports out there get little coverage, however.  We need to look at that.  The report mentions sports such as swimming, running and cycling.  We want to make a more active population who are invested in sport.  We need to see more alternative sports on our media and not just concentrate on the three main national governing body sports.  That is very positive.  I do not have any further comments.  I will listen to the Minister's comments and I might come back in again shortly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2022091400002#G00300","speaker":"1639"},{"type":"speech","time":1663110000,"counter":1348,"content":"<p>The issue the Senator raised regarding the Houses of the Oireachtas reporters is a matter for the Houses of the Oireachtas Service.  It may be something he could ask a colleague on the commission to raise.  I take his point on distribution, although that is probably for the businesses to engage on.  He referred to salaries in RT&Eacute;.  That is an operational matter and, therefore, it would not be inappropriate for me to say anything on that.  Has RT&Eacute; not engaged with the committee on this issue?<\/p> <p>  The Senator raised the recommendation on sport, which I know he has a genuine interest in from our engagement in the Seanad.  There are some fantastic recommendations to take away the traditional focus and exploit modern technology to showcase a greater variety of sports across multiple formats and feature people with disabilities or minority sports.  Coimisi&uacute;n na me&aacute;n, when it is set up, will work with the media organisations, Sport Ireland and the Federation of Irish Sport to develop a strategy to promote diversity and gender equality, and examine making sport-related equality, diversity and inclusion, EDI, standards a condition of receiving grants from public funding.  I strongly believe we need to create more opportunities to showcase greater diversity in sport in Ireland.  I am in full agreement with the Senator on that.

We have to really take this seriously.<\/p><p>We have to make a big commitment to ensure that our media outlets are allowed to continue, that they are not weakened by running after advertisements all the time and that they are given the space to allow journalists to be journalists and report on what is important.  They are the most important people we come across when we talk about democracy.  We have voices here but we must have that outlet for the media and journalists.  As discussed by Senator Cassells, <i>The Sunday Times <\/i>let 11 senior journalists go over the summer.  That is frightening but it comes down to money and sustainability.  Those types of outlets are trusted media outlets.  They are the media outlets on which people depend and rely upon, and that they read and know as being objective and balanced.  President Von der Leyen talked about outside influences.  It has been happening for years.  Europe has not taken that seriously.  We have not taken that seriously as individual countries.  I hope that not only by her recognition of that today but by talking about putting money into that now, we are beginning to wake up and smell the coffee about how we and the public are being influenced by fake news and so forth.  We have a big opportunity.  I encourage the Minister to continue the work she is doing in grasping that.<\/p><p>I thank commission members who made these 50 recommendations, all of which, as Senator Carrigy said, we came up with in our own reports.

I encourage her and her officials to attend, if possible, as it is important.<\/p><p>NewsBrands Ireland has asked for a cut in VAT.  I advocate for that because I have seen the critical role played by my local newspapers, <i>The Anglo-Celt<\/i>and <i>The Northern Standard<\/i>, in local communities.  I know how difficult it is for local newspapers to have a section dedicated to chasing after advertisements and the fragile position of journalists so we should do anything that we can to provide support.  NewsBrands Ireland has asked for a cut in VAT so it can fund the digitalisation of its outlets, and I support its call.  I ask the Minister to please use her influence on the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and the Minister for Finance as we come up to the budget to secure a cut in VAT.<\/p><p>I wish to raise an issue with the Minister as it is important that we lead from the front.  I agree with my colleagues here today that we had a very good department within the Oireachtas that reported on what was being talked about in committees, the D&aacute;il and the Seanad, and reported with great forensic detail to <i>The Anglo-Celt<\/i>, the <i>Dundalk Democrat, The Northern Standard<\/i>and all other newspapers.  That service provided fresh and hot-off-the-press news and content.  Even though I know this matter is not part of the remit of the Minister's Department, I will ask the clerk to the committee to research how this decision was reached.  We must lead by example and this is our opportunity to find out what happened to those journalists, where did they go and why was the decision made because it does not bode well for the fact that we are all saying here that journalism and the trusted outlets are so important.  I do not believe that reporting happens in the same way that it did in the past.  There is a media and communications outlet within the Oireachtas campus but I think we have missed an opportunity.  I ask the clerk to conduct research on how we can tease out whether the right decision was made and analyse how we might move forward.  Do my colleagues support my suggestion?

Twenty years ago, you could purchase either a licence for a black and white television or a colour television.  The vast majority of people opted to buy the licence for a black and white television because it was cheaper.

Currently we have an electric vehicle, EV, grant.  However, stock has become a real issue.  Drivers with older vehicles cannot source an electric vehicle.  If the operator changes vehicle in the short term due to end of vehicle life, the vehicle purchased may not meet the criteria for the EV grant.  We have requested a common-sense approach, leaving operators in existing vehicles until EVs become available.  We have written to the Minister for Transport with this request and so far received no reply.<\/p><p> It is our view the sector needs to be incorporated into the public transport system.  Taxis are the only 365-days-per-year, 24-hour, door-to-door transport service.  This would lead to inclusion at large-scale events, resulting in temporary taxi stands and set-down and drop-off facilities.  Currently large venues throughout Dublin have no taxi stands or set-down or drop-off areas resulting in operators not offering their services at the venues.  Difficulties with parking and the threat of being fined are some of the reasons operators quoted.  Dublin City Council's lack of engagement with the taxi sector at major public events needs to be addressed.<\/p><p> Tiom&aacute;na&iacute; Tacsa&iacute; na h&Eacute;ireann resigned its seat on the taxi advisory committee, TAC, during the early months of the pandemic.  It is our view the sector should be in a negotiation position as opposed to an advisory position with the Department of Transport.  We requested changes to the committee subsequent to our resignation but all were refused.  Many of the proposals we submitted to the Department and the TAC were not adopted.  The TAC needs to be disbanded for a national transport forum that allows all bodies that provide public transport to input positively to the transport system of Ireland.<\/p><p> Currently licences are non-transferable except on the death of the licence holder.  Up until this decision, a taxi operator saw his or her licence as a business with the opportunity to build a small business to be shared or passed on to a suitable family member and, therefore, bringing younger generations into the sector.  As this is no longer possible until after death, many drivers see the licence as a way of earning a weekly wage and do not see it as a small-business opportunity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022091400002#A00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. David McGuinness","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1663110000,"counter":1378,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and the committee for inviting me.  I am a representative of the Taxi Alliance of Ireland, operating in County Tipperary and I have worked in the industry for nearly 30 years.  I will bring some of the issues forward to the Chairman.<\/p> <p>  There are a large number of illegal operators throughout the country.  In the past 12 months, we have had success in catching some of these individuals with the help of the Garda and National Transport Authority, NTA, enforcement officers.  However, many of these illegal operators continue to work as the Garda and the NTA do not have the resources to catch all of them.  One way to resolve this issue is the establishment of a transport police with the powers to deal with this issue and the resources to deal with this problem on a permanent basis.  In order for more people to join the taxi industry, especially in rural Ireland, these illegal operators need to be dealt with immediately before we lose more drivers.  For example, a person was caught six months ago, taken to court and prosecuted, got a &euro;200 fine and was operating the night after.  That has to be stopped.<\/p> <p>  Another issue I will bring to the attention of the committee is the buy-back of taxi plates.  We need to make this process easier to engage in to recruit more taxi drivers to the industry, .  At present, if a driver retires or leaves the industry, the driver cannot transfer his or her small public service vehicle, SPSV, plate to another individual.  If a transfer of plate and other business areas such as phone and cars were easier, it would entice people to join the industry.<\/p> <p>  To provide more SPSV operators available for closing time of pubs and nightclubs, we need to get the committee to consider asking the Licensed Vintners Association to come forward with a proposal to stagger the closing times of these establishments.  This would reduce the number of people looking for taxis all at once at peak times on the weekends.  It would also reduce stress on taxi drivers trying to provide a service as they can become overwhelmed with people trying to get taxis at those peak times.<\/p> <p>  The Taxi Alliance of Ireland is a voluntary organisation to help the SPSV industry for urban and rural Ireland.  We want to our industry to be as professional as any other industry in our country.  The committee should feel free to ask me any issues about the above issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022091400002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kevin Barrett"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1663110000,"counter":1379,"content":"<p>I ask that the committee forgive me if some of this is repetitive because we all have the same problems.  The National Private Hire and Taxi Association, NPHTA, has met many Members of Parliament in recent times and we have made presentations, including in the audiovisual room, to try to get the extension of vehicle age limits.  We are here today to highlight these ongoing issues within our industry, which are impacting on the high professional standards set over previous years.<\/p> <p>  A total of 5,000 drivers are facing hardship and stress and the possibility of being forced out of our industry because of vehicle age limits.  This would mean longer wait times for the public if even a small percentage of these people leave the industry.  While work volumes have surged over previous months, especially at nighttime, many drivers are not in a position to borrow large sums to invest in a new electric vehicle - that is if they can find one.  There are many challenges with the grant scheme and we would like a discussion on how to make it more accessible to drivers.  We have had no input to the present process.<\/p> <p>  Used car costs have increased 60% according to car magazines.  Fuel costs have reached an all time high.  Service costs have risen and use of cashless payments mean less take-home pay for drivers, despite the recent fare increase.  Taxi drivers are facing the same cost-of-living challenges that all other sectors face.  These conditions are screaming out for a further extension of age limits to allow drivers time to recoup losses and build a financial footing to move forward with a newer vehicle, preferably an electric one.  Extension of age limits would not, and should not, lower standards.<\/p> <p>  A driver with terminal illness or maybe a stroke is not allowed transfer his or her licence and must keep it active, meaning he or she must be fully licensed  and insured, which obviously incurs costs at a time of no income.  The driver is possibly dying and it may happen over a period of days, weeks, months or even years.  Why can this licence holder not transfer the licence before death?  If a licence goes into inactive status it cannot be inherited.  An inherited licence must be availed of within nine months.  This is a time of mourning and should be extended to at least 12 months.<\/p> <p>  All taxis have to do a national car test, NCT, once or sometimes twice per year.  They then must wait 48 hours before returning to the same test centre to have the taxi-suitability test carried out by the same person in the same place.  This should be done at the same time and, therefore, cut down time and expense for drivers.  It could all be done in one visit.<\/p> <p>  Security of drivers is a continuous concern.  The NPHTA, for years, has requested a garda liaison officer to work with representative bodies.  Our requests continue to go unheard.  The NTA should also be considering providing drivers with security systems and advice.  Assaults on drivers are common in our workplace.  When has the NTA ever taken a case on behalf of a taxi driver?  Generally drivers just have to suck it up.<\/p> <p>  Passenger security should remain a priority of law makers.  Strict vetting of entrants, while this could be quicker, should not be overlooked and possibly even be strengthened.  Some legislative changes are being considered at present, but it would help if there were marshalled, better-located and properly-lit taxi ranks with CCTV monitoring.  This could be considered.<\/p><p>An example is College Green, which is right beside the Temple Bar area.  Rideshare, Uber-style, by unlicensed drivers should not be entertained.  The safety record for this type of service shows thousands of sexual assaults by unvetted drivers who provided this service.  Passenger demands must be discussed in the context of what passenger expectations are, how overall transport policy needs to be adapted and that pub opening and closing times also need to be adapted.  Free access to the Dublin Port tunnel should be considered as a benefit to passengers and the environment.<br\/><br\/>We recently heard about arrangements for the Garth Brooks concert.  We contacted the NTA to ask what provision had been made for taxis and the response was that the coach parking and pick-up points were outside the Garda cordon and located approximately 25 minutes' walk from the stadium.  We were told taxis would not be allowed inside the Garda cordon and that we could operate as normal.  This highlights the lack of consideration planners have given to our sector.  Taxis continue to be overlooked.  No major events should be allowed to take place unless SPSVs are considered as part of the transport planning.<br\/><br\/>In recent years, thousands of drivers have protested against the Taxi Advisory Committee, TAC, which continues to fail drivers.  Throughout Covid it was never proactive only reactive.  It took our appearance before the Covid committee to get some supports.  Despite the fact that minutes are now being published, the committee is far from transparent.  Lots of the matters I outlined - those that truly affect taxi drivers - should have been discussed and presented to the Minister for future support.  It is as if nothing happened in the past two years.  Our association believes representatives of taxi drivers should regularly meet the Minister and the NTA to promote better public transport services.  Transport providers should have a forum in which to present to policymakers.<br\/><br\/>I read in <i>The<\/i><i>Sunday Times<\/i>newspaper that the Government is to help with the challenges of the cost of living and is considering financial subsidies, grants and loans to small businesses.  Taxi drivers have been overlooked in the past.  Our major operating costs are insurance and purchasing a vehicle, which includes VRT and VAT.  The NPHTA has partnered with Zego to keep insurance costs down for our members.  Along with the vehicle age change, this is the area in which a financial intervention would be most beneficial.  I ask members not to overlook us again.  I would welcome questions from members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022091400002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Waldron","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663110000,"counter":1381,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Waldron.

We probably have at least 15 illegal operators in a region with a radius of approximately 30 miles.  We have had four prosecutions in the past six months and those four people who were prosecuted were back out operating the night after.  They are prosecuted in court.  A big factor we need to cure the situation is that insurance companies need to be notified.  When people are convicted in court, the insurance companies need to be notified.  That is a big factor.  People are taken to court and then also being given fines of &euro;200 and &euro;300.  They are back out the night after working and earning that again.  There has to be something.  The courts have to be changed and the fine system has to be changed.  Put a minimum fine of &euro;3,000 or &euro;4,000 in place.  That certainly hits them in the pocket.<\/p> <p>  As for the biggest factor we have, while we have enforcement officers coming down from Dublin to do a job on these illegal operators, it is impossible to get the enforcement officers here constantly.  Going back 15 or 20 years ago, we had the local public service vehicle, PSV, officer who dealt with these issues.  He called to these illegal operators and gave them ultimatums to stop, or else.  Something has to be done.  We need transport police who can deal with these issues and have the powers to deal with these issues.  The enforcement officers only have so much power.  There are many ways to try to improve it.  If these illegal operators can be taken out then it entices other guys to get into the industry and provides more taxis.  Nobody is going to get into the industry when all these illegal operators are working and taking the bread and butter from the guys who are working.

I know most of the lads from over the years, having been a transport spokesperson in this House for a good number of years.  It is that perennial issue.  They are back year after year with problems as they arise.  It seems, rightly or wrongly, that there is not a proper structure in place to assist the industry.  It is seen from a regulatory perspective.  If the NTA, which is looking at the drivers as licence holders, it is all about making sure they reached the standards and do not do what they should not do.  However, to hell with the rest of it and they should get on and do it themselves.  That may have worked at a time.  We have to treat the industry differently.  We have to recognise that the taxi industry, to use the term across the board, is an integral part of our public transport system.  If we took the same approach to trains, trams and the Luas, we would not have a decent public transport system.  We have to integrate taxis, to use the term across small public sector vehicles, and find a way to ensure there is an agency or agent within the State apparatus.<\/p><p>I am not talking about setting up another quango.  I am talking about establishing an office for taxi development or public service vehicle development.  It seems ludicrous to me that taxi drivers are being messed around.  I mean grants sound great and people may think they can benefit from them but one cannot get a car so there is no joined-up thinking.  I am sure the Chairman will be familiar with the carbon reduction efforts by the State to meet our targets and we have various energy agencies.  I am familiar with the Tipperary Energy Agency and I know that Mr. Barrett is from Tipperary but I am not.

We can also make recommendations to the Department.  We can bring others in and challenge them on issues so at least we take things further.  As I have seen over the years, there is nothing to help and promote the taxi industry.  Taxi drivers are individual licenceholders.  There must be competition although there is not really when all of the limits are set.  How can we ensure that the industry is around in ten or 15 years' time if the Government policy is to reduce the number of cars on the roads?<\/p> <p>  A modal shift has been sought for decades in terms of the amount of public transport, of which the taxi industry is an integral part.  We are reducing public transport fees on buses and we have to increase taxi fares because otherwise the industry is not sustainable.  I have a different approach because I believe that we should make it easier and cheaper for taxis to operate but with State support and not making things more expensive, so that we keep the price of taxi fares down for punters.  We have talked about this issue elsewhere and the delegation mentioned that the hotel industry is part of the talking shop.  The hotels are pricing themselves out of the market with what they are at and only very wealthy people can now afford them.  At present Garth Books has a series of concerts and people want to attend them in Dublin.  The taxi drivers help concert goers to get to the venue after people have travelled by train or parked their cars somewhere.  People are deciding to return home after the concerts because it is cheaper for four or five people to get someone to drive them up from County Clare, for example, than stay in a hotel but such a situation is crazy.  We have got to look at the future sustainability and viability of the taxi business, and everything should be on the table. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022091400002#F00900","speaker":"1655"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1663110000,"counter":1488,"content":"<p>We must make driving taxis viable in order to attract young people in Ireland to the industry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022091400002#F01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Alan Cooley"},{"type":"speech","time":1663110000,"counter":1489,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022091400002#F01100","speaker":"1655"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1663110000,"counter":1490,"content":"<p>I was a member of the taxi advisory committee for five years.

I am not saying that we do not need regulation; we do but alongside regulation, we need an element of the State agencies to be examining how to protect and preserve the sector.

It is important to have the opportunity to air the issues.  It is very clear from the contributions we have heard that there are fundamental problems with the voice of taxi drivers being heard in the industry and being central to the development of the industry.  That is something that has been repeated and it will be central to a lot of what we raise with the NTA and on which we need to see reform in the time ahead.  I encourage the witnesses to develop their own thinking and proposals on what an alternative to the TAC would look like.  In the context of a number of comments, a long-standing proposal is included in the programme for Government for a public transport forum.  Is that something that the witnesses would like to see and what might that look like?<\/p> <p>  The bigger issue I want to raise relates to the viability of the sector.  I see an incredible contradiction within the system relating to the EV grants.  On the one hand, the Government is saying that it wants a green transition, it wants the taxi industry to go green and it is putting &euro;15 million per year into this.  Problems have been identified with that, as outlined by the witnesses.  At the same time, there will be a cliff edge in 2023 whereby thousands of vehicles are going to be hit by the nine-year rule and, as a consequence, individual drivers will be left to decide whether to get another petrol or diesel vehicle to tide them over in the meantime or to exit the industry all together.  That scenario has been spelled out to the NTA and the Minister by myself and others.  We have outlined that scenario to them and what they say in response is, \"Don't panic\".  They say they are looking at it, a fare increase was introduced recently, a recruitment campaign is ongoing and that will solve the problem.  That is what the NTA will say to us again next week and I want to ask our guests, as industry representatives, what they say to that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022091400002#G00600","speaker":"1507"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1663110000,"counter":1511,"content":"<p>I will take the first question on the increase in people coming into the market and applying for licences.  I asked what age groups were involved and they said students were coming into the market.  I asked if they were really telling me that students were going to get a loan to enter the market.  They want to push students straight into the rental market.  That is their first option.  Students are not going to be single licence holders but are going into the rental market, where they are under pressure.  In terms of getting new people to take up licences and do tests, even when they do the tests, they are looking at a three- to four-month wait to get their licence.  That is just another example of the lack of joined up thinking in the NTA.<\/p> <p>  The transfer of taxi licences is so important.  The transfer of licences from people who are exiting the market is crucial.  They have a car, a sign, a meter and a licence.  It is so simple and is basically down to a question of clerical administration.  If someone is leaving our industry, it should be easy for him or her to transfer the vehicle and the meter to somebody else and then it would only be a matter of weeks to have thousands of vehicles on the road.  We have people who have had cars in their driveways for years, since the start of the pandemic.  We reckon that 3,500 drivers have exited the industry because of the rules and regulations and the fact that licences cannot be transferred.  The system is totally inflexible.

I seek clarification about a time I came in on a late-night flight at Dublin Airport and there were no taxis in the rank.  Taxis kept passing me by but I could not get anybody to stop.

To clarify, what is the situation in that regard?  If people arriving at the airport, particularly foreigners coming to our country, need a taxi late at night but see this thing happening whereby the taxi rank is empty because everybody has gone out and all these taxis are spinning through the airport, dropping people off but not being allowed to come around and collect people again, it is ludicrous.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022091400002#H03600","speaker":"1609"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1663110000,"counter":1570,"content":"<p>Was the Deputy at a taxi rank?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022091400002#H03700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Philip Egan"},{"type":"speech","time":1663110000,"counter":1571,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022091400002#H03800","speaker":"1609"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1663110000,"counter":1572,"content":"<p>Was the Deputy at terminal 1 or terminal 2, as a matter of curiosity?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022091400002#H03900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Waldron"},{"type":"speech","time":1663110000,"counter":1573,"content":"<p>Terminal 2.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022091400002#H04000","speaker":"1609"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1663110000,"counter":1574,"content":"<p>We are in a holding area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022091400002#H04100","nonspeaker":"Mr. James Maguire"},{"type":"speech","time":1663110000,"counter":1575,"content":"<p>The taxi driver told me the day after, when I made an inquiry, that when taxi drivers come in, they can only make-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022091400002#H04200","speaker":"1609"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1663110000,"counter":1576,"content":"<p>Can I just say that over the past two and half years or so, the DAA has refused to speak to the representative bodies on various issues throughout the airport.

Indeed, things have been done that have driven people out of the industry and have made it an unattractive option.  Would the witnesses say - because I would - that if it follows that the taxi sector should be taken seriously as an integral part of an integrated public transport system that is vital for all sorts of things, including taking people to hospital, serving those with disabilities, getting people to school in certain situations, tourism and all the other roles that drivers play, it would also follow that there should be subsidies for taxi drivers in a properly regulated and run industry?  Every other part of public transport is subsidised to ensure that it is there.  Should there not be some sort of subsidies as part of a properly regulated industry?  Similarly, the absolutely wrong way to go would be to introduce Uber, which is the opposite of that.

One of the apps costs the customer &euro;3 more than walking to a taxi stand.  Pushing people only in one direction is not good for the industry or for the customer.  Many taxi drivers will not use the app because of the cost of the commission that the app companies charge.  Some 15% is a huge commission.  Many customers have used the same taxi stands for years because they feel comfortable with the drivers at those stands.  If the policy of pushing everybody to use the app is part of the overall strategy for the industry, by removing the taxi stands from the transport hubs, one would inconvenience the public and make it more expensive for them.  When people order a taxi on an app, the taxi has to drive to them, so that is environmentally unfriendly too.

A person can get &euro;25,000 in grants for that vehicle.  To buy the car, he or she has to borrow the total cost of the car because the grant does not come until three months after the car has been approved.  The process can take approximately three weeks.  Taxi drivers have to scrap their vehicle, meaning that they could be off the road for three weeks while waiting to collect their EV and get it licensed for the road.<\/p><p>Various issues need to be addressed.  The Department of Transport has referred to microfinance, which only lends up to &euro;25,000.  I cannot buy half an ID.4.  There are issues as regards process.  Nobody is saying the electric vehicle grant is not a good thing.  It is a good thing and most associations appreciate it.  We would like more, but we are moving positively towards it.

We need to work together on it.  We have never been included in the process.

I am not a member of this committee but I was keen to come in.<\/p> <p>  I am a Cork Deputy and my knowledge of the situation relates primarily to the Cork taxi committee but many of the issues that have come up today are one and the same.  The point about taxis being public service vehicles is key, as is the fact that they are not recognised adequately, or sometimes at all, by the NTA as a part of the public transport network.  Taxis are also key enablers of other parts of public transport.  Three out of every four times I travel to Dublin I do so by train.  If a taxi was not available, I would probably drive there.  If I did not have a taxi to get me from my home to the train station, that realistically means that I do not get a train at that hour of the morning.  Taxis are key enablers.  They enable people to get buses, trains and all the rest of it.  They are a key connection.  Taxis are also a key part of public transport by way of serving hospitals, elderly people and all the things that taxi drivers and, indeed, school transport do during the day.  Many people just think of taxis in terms of late hours on a Saturday night.  Taxis work 24-7 doing crucial work to support people.  It is time the NTA recognised that.  Reform and an improved replacement for the taxi advisory committee needs to be a key part of that so that taxi drivers feel they have a real say in it.<\/p> <p>  Many of the questions have already been asked.  I missed the part around transferability, which is a big part of the ask at present.  The point about the nine- or ten-year rule has been well made.  It is illogical.  If a car is roadworthy, it is roadworthy and that is all.  Of course, it has to be roadworthy.  That is essential but, once it is roadworthy, why should there be a higher standard for taxis than anything else?<\/p> <p>  My other question is on school transport.  I have spoken to taxi drivers who say that the tendering process to serve school transport routes, typically in respect of children's special educational needs, is too onerous and complex, and is just not worth a taxi driver's while.  That is why it is sometimes not possible to get a taxi and needs are not being met.  Many taxi drivers do great work in that regard but sometimes the incentives are just not there for taxi drivers to apply for these routes.  I ask for comment on that.<\/p> <p>  What is now crucial, and I will try to come in when NTA representatives next appear before the committee, is that there is a far better service.  When we talk about public transport generally, one issue is that taxi drivers are not adequately consulted but even when we talk about taxis themselves, very often other interests, whether these are hospitality or some of the big apps, have as much say as taxi drivers, which is not right either.  It is vitally important the committee has proper teeth and is fully representative of taxi drivers.<\/p> <p>  My two questions relate to school transport and transferability.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022091400002#O00300","speaker":"1460"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1663110000,"counter":1822,"content":"<p>I will answer on the taxi advisory committee.  I joined that committee a month ago.  The first observation I made related to two representatives on it.  One was from a taxi app group, which I thought was a vested interest that really should not be on the taxi advisory committee, because any decisions would help that group to make money off the back of taxi drivers.  The second representative was from what is probably the largest rental vehicle company in Dublin.  I again observed at the meeting that new applicants into the industry were kind of being pushed into the rental industry.  The committee was ready-made for the taxi rental company and the taxi sharing app company, who are making money off taxi drivers and not helping them, to be there sitting at the table.  They will make money on commission obviously, which is extra commission at present.  That was my one observation regarding the taxi advisory committee, that is, that it is basically stacked up against the driver.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022091400002#O00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Alan Cooley"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1663110000,"counter":1823,"content":"<p>The process to get on the panel for school transport is very detailed.  Bus &Eacute;ireann falls down in the sense that if it made such transport more accessible, more taxi drivers would be able to help it out.  The process is very onerous and there is a lot to it.  Maybe if some sort of department was set up to assist drivers to enrol in it, that would be a positive.  There are drivers who would like to do that type of work.  Many drivers do it presently, but many more could do so.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of transferability the Deputy mentioned, and some of the other driver representatives have also mentioned this, as I said earlier, a driver with terminal illness, or even a stroke, has to keep his or her taxi active during all that time and has to be dead before somebody can take over the ownership of his or her licence.  Why should people who are 80 years of age and have spent 20, 30, 40 or 50 years in the business, built up clientele quite well and have a ready-made business they want to hand over, maybe to a son or daughter, or sell to somebody for that matter because that driver has earned it, not be allowed do that?  Such drivers are not allowed do that at present.  The only way a licence can be taken over is through inheritance.

We face a cliff edge on 1 January, when up to almost 4,000 taxis may not continue or, if they do, might do so at a level where it is not sustainable.  In effect, what the representatives are looking for, dare I say, is a form of derogation for cars up to 15 years old to allow drivers a transitional period in which to transition to EV cars.

That has to be stressed when the representation from the NTA comes before the committee.  The age rule has to be extended to 15 years.  It covers a lot of things.  It avoids the complication of the EV grants because if you get an EV grant and your licence is due on 31 December, your licence goes out of date, which disbars you from taking up that grant.  It should be remembered that there are buses and coaches from 2004 out there.  They all go for DOE tests, and when they pass those tests they are safer.  They have seat belts.

How does the numbering system work?  It is almost the same now for people who get taxis because the taxis pass them on the street, the Free Now branding is on some of them and they are not quite sure how to interface with the taxi when they get in.

E-scooters and rental bikes are fine, but coming out of a pub or nightclub at 1.30 a.m. people are not going to get e-scooters home.  On a rainy winter's night it is the taxi we have always gone home in.  It is the safest and the quickest way home and keeps you dry until you get to bed.  They need to be protected.
