However, committees are encouraged to take a gradual approach to this change.  Members and witnesses have the option to attend meetings in the relevant committee room or online through Microsoft Teams.  Those attending the committee rooms and its environs should continue to sanitise and wash their hands properly, be respectful of other people's physical space where possible, and practise good respiratory etiquette.  If those attending the meeting have any Covid-19 symptoms, no matter how mild, they should not attend in the committee room.  Members and all in attendance are asked to exercise personal responsibility in protecting themselves and others from the risk of contracting Covid-19.  Members who are required to participate in the meeting remotely must do so from within the Leinster House complex, as they are well aware.<\/p> <p>  Apologies have been received from Senator Garvey and Deputy Shanahan.<\/p> <p>  Today's meeting is to discuss the general scheme of the representative actions for the protection of the collective interests of consumers Bill 2022.  This Bill aims to give effect to the EU representative actions directive by creating a new civil litigation mechanism by which a qualified entity may act as a claimant party on behalf of consumers who have opted into a representative action against a trader in the High Court.  The Bill also creates a mechanism whereby an organisation which represents the collective interests of consumers may apply to the Minister to be designated as a qualified entity to bring a representative action in Ireland or in other EU member states.<\/p> <p>  The new law is a response to recent mass consumer rights breaches by private companies.<\/p><p>It will allow for several cross-border qualified entities to come together to represent EU consumers where they have been harmed by the same alleged infringement which has been caused by the same trader in several member states.  Today we are pleased to have the opportunity to consider these matters further with representatives of various bodies.  I welcome Mr. Philip Andrews from the Law Society of Ireland, who is a partner in McCann Fitzgerald with responsibility for EU, anti-trust and telecoms.  He is a member of the Law Society's business law committee.  I understand that Ms Aleksandra Pruska of McCann Fitzgerald may also be joining us.  I also welcome the chairperson of the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC, Mr Jeremy Godfrey.  He is joined by Mr. Kevin O'Brien, who is a member of the CCPC; Ms S&iacute;ona Ryan, who is the CCPC's director of policy and international; and Mr. Robert Dunne, who is the CCPC's deputy director of legal services.  I also welcome the chairperson of the Consumer Association of Ireland, CAI, Mr. Michael Kilcoyne, who is attending remotely.  He is joined by Mr. Raymond O'Rourke, who is the vice chairperson of the CAI; and Mr. Dermott Jewell, who is the CAI's policy and council adviser.<\/p><p> Before we begin, I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practices of the Houses as regards references that witnesses make to another person in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses who are physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected pursuant to both the Constitution and statute by absolute privilege.  Witnesses are again reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.<\/p><p> The opening statements from the three organisations have been circulated to members.  To commence consideration of the matter today, I invite Mr. Philip Andrews to make his opening statement on behalf of the Law Society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022091400002#B00100","speaker":"1509","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1663110000,"counter":7,"content":"<p>I thank the Cathaoirleach, the Teachta&iacute; D&aacute;la and the Seanad&oacute;ir&iacute; for the opportunity to discuss the general scheme of the Bill.  The Law Society welcomes the opportunity to contribute to the committee's scrutiny of the general scheme.  I am a member of the business law committee of the Law Society of Ireland.  I am a practising Irish solicitor in the area of EU competition, trade and regulating markets.  My practice is mainly advisory and I do not regularly litigate cases.  I am therefore not an expert in litigation procedure.  I wish to extend apologies on behalf of Ms Aleksandra Pruska who is unable to attend today for health reasons.<br\/><br\/>I will set out some background and then talk about three specific points with regard to the general scheme.  As I am sure is well-known to members, in 2005 the Law Reform Commission, LRC, conducted a review of the law regarding multi-party litigation and reached a preliminary conclusion that the Irish legal system &quot;lacks a comprehensive procedure that would tackle class claims in a uniform and consistent fashion&quot;.  An LRC report on foot of that assessment which was issued later in 2005 recommended that a formal procedural structure for collective redress be established.  Following the introduction of a Private Members' Bill on multi-party actions, MPAs, the then Minister for Justice and Equality referred the question of the introduction of an MPA procedure in the Irish legal system to the review of the administration of civil justice review group, established in 2017 and chaired by the then president of the High Court, Mr. Justice Peter Kelly.<br\/><br\/>In January 2018 the European Commission published a report and study on collective redress mechanisms in member states.  The report and study found that Ireland was an outlier among EU member states because Ireland had &quot;no dedicated mechanism for bringing collective claims in Ireland&quot;.  It continued:<\/p> <blockquote> \tRather, mass claims are dealt with under the general rules of civil procedure which only allow for collective claims in very limited circumstances. <\/blockquote> <p>A 2020 report on foot of the work of the administration of civil justice review group, which I will call the Kelly group, concluded that in addition to EU Directive No. 1828 on representative actions, there was a further rationale for the introduction of a new and more comprehensive MPA procedure to accommodate mass claims.  More specifically, while acknowledging the importance of public law redress mechanisms like those provided for in EU Directive No. 1828, the Kelly report concluded that in addition it seemed clear that there was an objective need to legislate for a comprehensive MPA procedure in Ireland.<\/p><p>In SPV <i>v<\/i>. HSBC, then Chief Justice Clarke stated, in 2018, that: <\/p><blockquote>\tI remain very concerned that there are cases where persons or entities have suffered from wrongdoing but where those persons or entities are unable effectively to vindicate their rights because of the cost of going to court.  That is a problem to which solutions require to be found.  It does seem to me that this is an issue to which the legislature should give urgent consideration.   <\/blockquote><p>While the Law Society welcomes the directive and general scheme, it would support broader and carefully-balanced reforms that implement the recommendations of the LRC and the Kelly report.  It would be important that those reforms are carefully balanced to facilitate small-harm class actions while preventing excessive litigation.<br\/><br\/>I will give one US example.  In the US, courts have generally applied a very lenient standard for certification of class actions.  An example is a recent class action lawsuit from May 2022, Chimienti <i>v<\/i>. Wendy&rsquo;s International, in a New York district court in which the plaintiff seeks compensatory damages, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, punitive damages and injunctive relief for alleged misrepresentations and omissions because &ldquo;Wendy&rsquo;s advertises its burgers to make it appear that the burgers are substantially larger in size than the actual burger served to customers&rdquo;.  The lawsuit goes on to claim that &ldquo;the beef patties used for its advertisements are not fully cooked to make it appear that they are approximately 15-20% larger than the beef patties that are actually served to customers&rdquo;.  The claim is brought by the plaintiff &ldquo;on his own behalf and on behalf of all other persons or entities who purchased an overstated Wendy&rsquo;s menu item&rdquo;, so it is really an opt-out system there.  It is estimated that many thousands of new class actions are filed each year in the US federal and state courts.  According to one authoritative source, &ldquo;A putative class action takes no more than a single named plaintiff and a filing fee typically of several hundred US dollars&rdquo;.<br\/><br\/>I will now turn to the general heads and our three comments.  EU Directive 2020\/1828 sets minimum standards only.  It requires member states to put in place, at a minimum, at least one procedural mechanism to enable consumer organisations, called &ldquo;qualified entities&rdquo;, to commence representative actions on behalf of consumers.  Notably, under the directive and the general scheme, only qualified entities, not individual consumers, can bring representative actions.  Many, if not most, member states are expected to go beyond the minimum requirements, or already do so.<br\/><br\/>A key purpose of the directive is to enable, consistent with Article 38 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU, representative actions to ensure a high level of consumer protection.  That is in recital 4 of the directive.  To that end, the directive requires member states to implement, at a minimum, a type of collective representative action involving a qualified entity, but it is not a purpose of the directive to require that representative actions can only be taken by qualified entities.<br\/><br\/>Under subsection (1) in head 5 - application, the general scheme states that &ldquo;a representative action may be only brought before the court by a qualified entity designated by the Minister for the purposes of bringing a domestic representative action&rdquo;.  A question arises as to why head 5(1), appears to suggest that only collective actions by qualified entities are permitted in Irish law.  By explicit inclusion of the word &ldquo;only&quot;, a question arises as to whether a limitation is incorporated into the Irish legislation that may have unintended consequences.  Could this approach prevent organic emergence of representation actions in common law?  Ireland currently has a relatively restricted regime for collective action, including by reference to other EU member states, as well as other common law jurisdictions such as the UK.  A legislative provision that limited private-party rights to take collective or multiparty actions in such a way could also run counter to recommendations of the LRC and the calls for legislative reform by the Judiciary.

My colleagues and I welcome the opportunity to provide our views on the general scheme.  I am the chairperson of the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC, and I am joined by Ms S&iacute;ona Ryan, who is director of our policy and international division.<br\/><br\/>The CCPC welcomes the general scheme, which will establish a system for representative actions in Ireland and will ultimately lead to the improvement of consumer access to justice and redress.  Redress is a very important aspect of consumer protection.  When things go wrong, consumers must be confident that traders will provide them with appropriate remedies such as compensation, repair, replacement, price reduction, contract termination or refund of the price paid.  The CCPC therefore strongly believes all consumers should have access to fair and timely dispute resolution and redress mechanisms.  One mechanism for achieving redress is enforcement action taken by public bodies.  Another is legal action taken by consumers themselves.  Where consumers have suffered as a result of a trader failing to uphold their rights, a public body such as the CCPC or a sector regulator can take enforcement action, using its legal powers to investigate and seek sanctions.  Enforcement action can result in penalties, orders to come into compliance and, in some cases, compensation for affected consumers.<br\/><br\/>Individual consumers can take legal action against a trader in the small claims court for amounts under &euro;2,000 and in the higher courts for larger amounts.  In some cases, individual consumers may also be able to avail of alternative dispute resolution; for example, by making a complaint to a sector ombudsman or a sector regulator.  This Bill will introduce another mechanism for consumers to take legal action.  It allows for representative actions to be taken on behalf of multiple affected consumers.  This will apply when a trader has failed to uphold rights derived from EU consumer law, both general consumer law and a range of other laws that protect consumer interests.  The Bill will allow both for injunctions and for compensation and will apply both to domestic and to cross-border actions.  Irish consumers will be able to join representative actions taken in other member states and <i>vice versa<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>This Bill transposes the EU representative actions directive, and the general scheme of the Bill closely follows the requirements of the directive.  We have only a few comments on the detail of the general scheme.  First, we welcome the criteria for designation of qualified entities who can take representative actions on behalf of affected consumers.  These criteria follow the directive and will ensure consumers&rsquo; interests are placed at the heart of all representative actions.<br\/><br\/>Second, we consider that qualified entities should be free to make independent decisions about which cases to pursue, based on their own criteria, such as the prospects of success, the scale of consumer detriment and whether they have the resources and expertise needed.  This is implicit in the general scheme and it will be important the final legislation does not constrain the independence of qualified entities in this regard.<br\/><br\/>Third, we welcome the provision for the Minister to facilitate co-operation and sharing of best practice among qualified entities.  Co-operation and sharing of best practice among entities interested in becoming qualified entities prior to designation will also be useful, and public bodies such as the CCPC may have a role in sharing experience with qualified entities or bodies seeking designation.  However, this does not necessarily need to be explicitly referenced in the Bill.<br\/><br\/>While the Bill will enable representative actions to be taken, there are a number of complementary measures that will determine how the mechanisms in the Bill operate in practice.  For example, the general scheme contemplates that courts could make rules on matters such as admissibility, evidence and the means of appeal.  Any such rules could set important criteria for representative actions, such as the minimum number of consumers affected and how similar their claims must be.<br\/><br\/>The CCPC also considers it would be useful for the courts to provide for fast-tracking of representative actions, both to provide faster redress when an action succeeds and to minimise the costs that are inevitably incurred when an action is prolonged.<\/p><p> The availability of funding for qualified entities will be crucial to their success.  The CCPC welcomes the possibility of removing court fees payable by qualified entities taking a representative action.  We note, however, that such fees are not likely to be material in the overall cost of a representative action.  The ancient prohibitions on champerty and maintenance remain in place in Ireland, despite having been abolished in most other common law jurisdictions.  These prohibitions will severely limit the ability of qualified entities to fund representative actions.  The CCPC therefore welcomes the recommendation in the 2020 Review of the Administration of Civil Justice, led by Mr. Justice Peter Kelly, that the rules on funding of litigation should be modernised.<\/p><p> At the committee's previous hearing on the Bill, there was some discussion on which types of body might become qualified entities.  The CCPC's view is that the interests of consumers are best served if they have the option of civil society bodies taking representative actions on their behalf in addition to public bodies taking enforcement actions against traders who breach consumer law.  Having these two options available will mean that consumers will be able to take matters into their own hands if a public body decides not to pursue a particular case for any reason.<\/p><p> I will end with some remarks on the CCPC's role in helping consumers to secure redress.  First, we will use the enhanced enforcement powers contained in the Consumer Rights Bill to secure redress for consumers in cases in which there is substantial or widespread consumer detriment.  These new enforcement powers mean we will be able to require traders to provide refunds, price reductions or similar remedies if they fail to deliver goods or services or if those goods or services are faulty or otherwise do not conform with the consumer contract.  Second, we will continue to advocate improvements to the small claims court procedure and a rise in the ceiling for claims.  Last year there were only 2,134 claims submitted through the small claims procedure, indicating that many consumers find that the process does not meet their needs.  Third, we will share expertise and collaborate with civil society bodies that are interested in becoming qualified entities to help them to develop the capacity to take on this role.  Fourth, we will consider how the CCPC's role in securing redress for consumers could evolve in the light of our experience using our new powers and once we know whether other bodies have secured designation as qualified entities.<\/p><p> The CCPC welcomes the general scheme of the Bill and the introduction of representative actions in Ireland.  The CCPC believes that representative actions for the protection of collective interests of consumers will complement the soon-to-be-expanded role of the CCPC and other public bodies in securing redress for consumers.  It will allow for more efficient cross-European redress in cases of mass harm and provides a further incentive to traders to comply with consumer protection law.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022091400002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jeremy Godfrey","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663110000,"counter":17,"content":"<p>Thank you, Mr. Godfrey.

Since 2004, the CAI has been lobbying for consumers to have the benefit of access to justice by means of collective action in a court whereby, rather than 1,000 consumers taking 1,000 cases to court, a qualified entity such as the CAI would take one case on behalf of those 1,000 consumers affected.  This is already effectively operational in other member states of the European Union.  Our engagement was significantly extended through our membership of BEUC, the Brussels organisation of consumer associations in the EU.  As a result, we are now, 18 years on, with collective redress demanded by the European Commission to be implemented by December and operational by June 2023 in every member state.<\/p> <p>  The draft Bill provides the template for Ireland's mechanism.

We have some points about specific items and we drill down quite specifically into various parts of the Bill.  I hope Deputies and Senators will be happy with the detail, rather than just broad brush strokes, that I will put forward.<\/p><p>Head 16(1) transposes the conditions laid down in Article 4(3) of Directive (EU) 2020\/1828 on the designation of an organisation as a qualified entity for the purposes of taking domestic or cross-border representative actions; in particular that the entity should be an association with the primary aim of protecting the interests of consumers.  The specifics of the designation process will be dealt with under future ministerial regulations, as referenced in head 16(2).<br\/><br\/>We are concerned that additional conditions could be introduced, as seems to be asked by the Law Society even here today, militating against the Consumers Association of Ireland, the only existing consumer NGO in Ireland, from applying to be a qualified entity.  Will those regulations be in place by the time this directive is to be operational on 25 June 2023? <br\/><br\/>The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is the designated authority to inform the European Commission of designated qualified entities.  What happens if it does not designate a body?  If it does not, Irish consumers will be left without their statutory rights under this directive.  What is the response of Oireachtas Members?<br\/><br\/>With regard to funding for qualified entities, head 7(3) states that, aside from an entry fee placed on an individual consumer to be a party to the representative action, &quot;any costs incurred in the bringing of a representative action for redress shall be borne by the qualified entity and not the consumers represented by it&quot;.  Head 20 clarifies that the head 7(3) fee should be a modest fee to be determined by the Minister, but how will this be determined?  Will it be determined via the proposed ministerial regulations or another regulation?<br\/><br\/>Head 4 states that all representative actions for redress or an injunctive measure will be taken via the High Court under new superior court rules.  Have these rules been adopted and will they be in place by 25 June 2023?  We all know that commencing legal proceedings in the High Court is not cheap and, yet, the Bill ignores the administrative costs that will be demanded of a qualified entity, that is, a consumer association, to commence a representative action. <br\/><br\/>Head 3(4) notes that the Minister for Justice may make regulations to provide for the removal of fees payable to the court by parties bringing representative actions under the Act.  This certainly would be of benefit to the qualified entity and, yet, as with other issues such as the superior court rules and ministerial regulations, we in the CAI are waiting to see if the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment or the Minister for Justice is truly on the side of the Irish consumer.<br\/><br\/>The CAI suggests that even if such measures were introduced, the legislation places considerable administrative burdens on the qualified entity, such as the provision of information about representative actions online, transparency as to the funding of the qualified entity to avoid conflicts of interest and interactions with consumers prior to commencement of a representative action.  In that case, the qualified entity would need to have a well-resourced office with staff to complete the task of instigating representative actions.<br\/><br\/>Without some form of funding from the Government or co-operative assistance from the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC, as mentioned in its presentation, possibly by means of a memorandum of understanding, the CAI is doubtful if this directive will be fully enacted in Ireland for the benefit of Irish consumers.<br\/><br\/>I highlight Articles 20(1) and (2) of directive.  Article 20 specifically states - this is not in the preamble - that:<\/p><blockquote>\tMember States shall take measures aiming to ensure that the costs of the proceedings related to representative actions do not prevent qualified entities from effectively exercising their right to seek the measures referred to in Article 7. <\/blockquote><p>Article 7 refers to representative actions.  The measures referred to in paragraph 1 may, for example, take the form of public funding, including structural support for qualified entities, limitation of applicable court or administrative fees, or access to legal aid.  <br\/><br\/>This issue is not mentioned at all in the Bill before the committee and therefore means that the Government does not seem serious about fully transposing Directive (EU) 2020\/1828, taking into account all the additional issues mentioned that still have to be enacted via ministerial regulations and changes to superior court rules.  Are the Deputies and Senators happy, as Oireachtas Members, to potentially see Irish consumers unable to avail of their statutory consumer rights under the directive as of 25 June 2023 due to these anomalies?<br\/><br\/>I will mention the issue regarding a minimum number of consumers.  Members will understand that preambles are really the philosophy behind the legislation.  They do not have to be transposed.  Preamble 12 of the directive notes that it is up to member states to lay down rules on various issues relating to representatives actions, such as &quot;to decide on the required degree of similarity of individual claims or the minimum number of consumers concerned by a representative action for redress measures in order for the case to be admitted to be heard as a representative action.&quot;.<\/p><p>The CAI does not regard these important matters to be covered by the Bill.  Will they also be an issue for ministerial regulations?<br\/><br\/>The last item I will mention is the length of prior consultation.  Head 10(5) states that prior to a qualified entity bringing an action before the courts seeking an injunctive measure:<\/p><blockquote>\tthe qualified entity must first seek to enter into consultations with the trader concerned with the express purpose of having the trader cease the infringement referred to in section 6 of this Act. <\/blockquote><p>This is a reasonably correct transposition of the directive, but the CAI would point out that one very important matter has been omitted in the wording of this section of the Bill.  Paragraph (41) of the preamble to the directive states:<\/p><blockquote>\tWhere Member States have established that there should be prior consultation, a deadline of two weeks after the request for consultation is received should be set, after which, if the infringement has not ceased, the applicant should be entitled to immediately bring a representative action for an injunctive measure before the competent court or administrative authority.  Such requirements could also apply to representative actions for redress measures, in accordance with national law. <\/blockquote><p>This is a crucial issue that must be amended in the Bill; otherwise, the prior consultation could be a means to entirely undermine the consumer representative action by obstructive lengthy consultations, whether by solicitors, lawyers or traders, thereby making the injunctive measure of little use if finally agreed to by the court.  Injunctive measures need to be introduced in a quick and timely fashion, as understood by Preamble (41).<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022091400002#F00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Raymond O'Rourke","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1663110000,"counter":25,"content":"<p>The CAI would like to note that in previous submissions to the Department of Justice and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, it was opposed to any form of US-style class-action collective-redress procedure being introduced in Ireland, as seems to have been envisaged in the Multi-Party Actions Bill 2017.  The directive is quite clear that the consumer representative action procedures are not like US class-action litigation.

We ask that substantial changes be made to it in order that Irish consumers, as of 25 June 2023, can rely on their statutory consumer rights, as described in the directive, and, importantly, deliver the appropriate resources by a truly independent entity to challenge the deep pockets of those who seek, with far too much regularity, to deny consumers their legal and fair entitlements under common law.<\/p> <p>  We thank the Chairman and members very much for their time and engagement with us today.

Beyond that, the cost of advising every consumer in an opt-in situation that a case is about to be taken and ensuring they all know and understand what the case is, are able to register, get in touch in person with an entity 24-7, as required, and not just a website, and be updated on progress is quite significant.

You know that if you are in these situations, the other side might start doing a bit of a Trump, appealing, going back and forth and just using up the time and then the injunctive relief is of little use.<br\/><br\/>In Persona Digital Telephony Limited <i>v.<\/i>the Minister for Public Enterprise, the Supreme Court ruled that third-party funding to support a plaintiff's legal costs and disbursements, that is, payments by a solicitor to a third party and claim back from a client, is unlawful.  This judgement causes a bit of friction, which is why things are not very clear here.  <br\/><br\/>I hear the Law Society talking again about the multiparty Bill and how we can do things with the High Court judge.  What can I say?  The committee knows I am a very strong European.  Why have a directive if you are going to have your own legal system decide how you do things?  This directive has come from Europe and we are part of the EU and must implement it in some ways.  Dare I say it, it is a bit like a spurious Brexit way of doing it - a case of we have a different legal system and we will just do it our own way and give consumers their rights in that way.  The consumers' rights are highlighted in this.  I know, as does the Deputy having been a Minister in this area, that it is minimum harmonisation.  It is full harmonisation in the food area.  Minimum harmonisation has always been in the area of consumers because the Swedes do things and the UK used to do things much more strongly than other countries and, therefore, there had to be this balance.  Regarding getting a balance, it is a bit of a cop-out to say our legal system is different from that of everybody else.  It is common law, we have these High Court rules and we are looking after the consumer.  I find this to be an incorrect way of transposing the directive.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022091400002#O00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Raymond O'Rourke"},{"type":"speech","time":1663110000,"counter":65,"content":"<p>I thank our witnesses for their presentations.

The former Chief Justice, therefore, said that this would need to be changed by the Legislature.  At the same time, it is also clear that the Irish courts, particularly in the context of more recent judicial appointments, are taking a more activist view on what might be permissible in respect of funding.  I refer the committee to the 2022 case of Atlas GP Limited <i>v<\/i>. Kelly &amp;amp; Ors.  In her judgment, Ms Justice Egan said: &quot;The range of interests and relationships which may justify the provision of funding is not closed and is properly the subject of development by the common law&quot;.  She also noted that the law in this field has undergone, and will undergo, considerable development.  Regarding the Law Society's position, I apologise if I have said it wrong, but we are in favour of the Bill.  It seems to us to be a good step, but we think the legislation could go further.  Our view simply reiterates what was previously set out in the LRC report and endorsed by the Kelly report, which is to give consumers direct access to collective, multiparty actions for themselves.<br\/><br\/>That brings me to the Deputy's question on the opt-out system.  My understanding is that the UK, even if it is not a member state of the EU anymore, has a possibility for opt-out in the context of its competition appeal tribunal.  The benefit of that opt-out system, and there is one, is that many of these cases may be settled, and a settlement is generally better in that it avoids the litigation costs.  If an opt-out class action case is settled, then the entire action has been settled.  It does have that efficiency option.<\/p><p>If an opt-in action is settled, there may still be others remaining outside of that tent that will come after you again.  There are benefits and arguments on either front.

I know the funding in the UK is significant third-party funding.

Preamble 24 states:<\/p> <blockquote> \tConsumer organisations in particular should play an active role in ensuring the relevant provisions of [European] law are complied with.

The example I used in my paper was to illustrate the challenges in getting the balance right.  The Wendy's case has been held up as a pin-up of excessive and abusive shakedown-type litigation in which the harm is imperceptibly low.  At the same time, it is also being held up as a case where a food lawyer sought to vindicate the rights of those who had been injured.  The Law Society is saying we should not rush into anything because law has a tendency to evolve beyond its original intention.  A cautious approach is not necessarily a bad one.  At the same time, I reiterate the possibility of implementing the reforms spoken about and reflected in a Private Members' Bill, which are also reasonably cautious and balanced.

Last weekend Aer Lingus obviously had some difficulties at the airport.  That is covered under EU legislation and maybe the airline will compensate people in the correct way, but there could be people who will not be compensated correctly.  That is something I would hope a certain number of consumers would come forward about and there would be a representative action.  I am aware the issue is that such an action could go the High Court, so you are immediately into a very difficult area.  Possibly, however, even just taking representative action involving so many consumers or whatever would make the trader, in this case Aer Lingus, negotiate because it does not want to go down this route and will instead put its hands up and say \"Yes\".  That, in a way, is what we want to do.<\/p><p> There will be some cases that may go to the High Court if they are for &euro;75,000 or more.

Parties can go to an administrative court and have a little ruling and then they go to the other court about compensation or whatever.

The annex refers to 60 pieces of legislation and they are all different.  As they all involve different public bodies, one answer probably does not apply to all of the pieces of legislation.  Broadly speaking, when enforcement action is taken, sometimes the trader concerned settles the case.  As part of that settlement, the trader might agree to pay compensation to all the affected consumers, which means there is no need for follow-on action.  In other cases, there might be enforcement action.  It can be the case that the obligation is to pay compensation.  I refer, for example, to statutory amounts of compensation for delayed flights.  The consumer rights Bill proposes to introduce a requirement for refunds in some circumstances, or price reductions in appropriate circumstances.  If a trader is not complying with those obligations, the enforcement action can order them to comply with those obligations.  It is all quite complicated because there are different enforcement mechanisms for different pieces of legislation.<\/p><p>An order to comply with an obligation to pay compensation might obviate the need for follow-on class action.  There are other mechanisms in the legislation for which the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC, is responsible.
