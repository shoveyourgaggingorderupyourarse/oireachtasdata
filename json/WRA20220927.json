Responding to developments in international trade, combined with rising costs and geopolitical uncertainty, companies across all sectors have taken steps to increase the flexibility and resiliency of supply chains, including reworking networks and nearshoring activities. To ensure that Ireland remains competitive for FDI, IDA Ireland reviews its overall enterprise policy on an ongoing basis. In carrying out this ongoing review process IDA Ireland works to ensure the Agency is aware of all relevant emerging trends, opportunities and challenges. This includes the trend of nearshoring, which involves a business moving its operation to a nearby country from one of greater distance. <\/p>  <p>  IDA Ireland has and continues to demonstrate its focus on this trend. IDA Ireland partners with client companies to identify opportunities for local sourcing to enhance the resilience of their supply chains. In doing so, IDA Ireland&rsquo;s sectoral divisions consider how to strengthen value chain linkages between IDA Ireland client companies and SMEs. This activity is beneficial to both MNCs and SMEs as linkages are strengthened and positive spillovers are achieved. IDA is collaborating with Enterprise Ireland to achieve the spillover effect, directly introducing MNCs to Enterprise Ireland clients which can fulfil supply chain requirements with local sourcing. This a key component of the Impact pillar under the IDA&rsquo;s four-year strategy, &lsquo;Driving Recovery and Sustainable Growth&rsquo;, to increased spend in the Irish economy by our MNCs.

Maintaining security of supply while integrating greater levels of renewable generation will require a very high penetration of variable electricity on the Irish grid, with increased electricity storage capacity providing a low-carbon substitute for high greenhouse gas emitting fossil fuels.<\/p>  <p>  EirGrid has reported that a number of battery storage projects have been contracted via two mechanisms: SEM Capacity Auctions and DS3 Systems Services. There is currently approximately 500MW of short-duration batteries on the all-island system providing system services, as well as 292MW of pumped hydro storage. In order to further support energy storage development throughout Ireland, my Department has committed to develop an energy storage policy framework which is due for publication early next year. To help inform the development of this framework a public consultation will issue shortly. <\/p>  <p>  Hydrogen storage could also have a significant role to play in power generation as a form of long-term electricity storage, with hydrogen potentially being used as a backup to renewables to generate electricity during periods of low renewable availability. In July, my Department launched a public consultation to gather the views of stakeholders to inform the development of a hydrogen strategy for Ireland which will be published later this year. Among the issues addressed was the question of hydrogen storage and responses were invited on a range of questions as to how Ireland might best develop hydrogen storage capacity. <\/p>  <p>  My Department is also currently undertaking a review of the security of supply of Ireland&rsquo;s electricity and natural gas systems. This review includes the identification of potential options to mitigate risks to security of supply, including different forms of energy storage. As part of this review, my Department recently launched a consultation to seek views from interested parties.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, over the course of the next decade all energy users across Ireland will be invited to adopt new approaches to using and conserving energy, including changing how they generate, store and consume electricity. One example of this is ESB Network&rsquo;s National Network, Local Connections programme which will be critical in creating a dynamic energy system and will explore the role of storage, among other flexibility drivers, in optimising the system for consumers across Ireland. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092700071#WRB04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Broadband Plan","counter":138,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092700071#WRB04925"},{"type":"question","counter":139,"qnumday":48,"qnumall":"[46741\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092700071#WRB04950","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"if he will report on the National Broadband roll-out and the fact that some residences (details supplied) in County Clare have been left without a broadband service.

In recognition of this, the Climate Action Plan contains commitments to significantly increase electrification within the national fleet, including an ambitious target of 945,000 electric vehicles (EVs) by 2030. Meeting this target will be extremely challenging; however, it represents the scale of transformation needed in the transport sector if emissions are to be reduced to the extent required. <\/p><p>A positive policy environment has been fostered with a generous suite of financial and taxation incentives in place for those buying an EV as well as an extensive publicly accessible recharging infrastructure network. Presently, there are approximately 64,700 EVs on Irish roads; a significant step-up is required if Ireland is to achieve its Climate Action Plan EV target. <\/p><p>My Department established the Electric Vehicle Policy Pathway Working Group to consider the optimum mix of regulatory, taxation and subsidy policies available to Government to significantly accelerate electric vehicle sales. This Group focused on mechanisms to achieve an immediate increase in EV uptake to attain over 175,000 EVs by 2025 in the line with the Climate Action Plan trajectory and, thereafter, to be well placed to reach full electrification by 2030. In its report, published last year, the Group recommended that proposals be developed to support EV sales in the commercial fleet,  including but not limited to car rental\/leasing companies, company  vehicles and car sharing services, in order to stimulate a greater  second-hand EV market.<\/p><p>On 21st July I launched a new dedicated Office, Zero Emission Vehicles Ireland, which will oversee and accelerate Ireland&rsquo;s transition to zero emission vehicles.

As such, the NTA has powers to make regulations in relation to the age limits of SPSVs.<\/p><p>Regulations made by the NTA in 2010 first established an age limit of less than 10 years old for new standard taxis and hackneys. The ten-year rule was adopted in recognition of the need to strike a balance between achieving standards that offer the customer confidence, comfort and safety, and allowing industry members to operate successfully.<\/p><p>I would note that the Irish 10 year rule for standard taxis and hackneys is not particularly onerous by comparison with other jurisdictions.<\/p><p>Wheelchair accessible taxis and hackneys are permitted to operate up to 15 years of age. No maximum permissible age is prescribed for limousines in recognition of both the vintage nature of many of these vehicles and their generally reduced mileage.<\/p><p>During the Covid-19 pandemic, standard age limits for taxis and hackneys were extended on several occasions, and are currently extended through to the end of 2022. This change helped ensure no operator exited the industry simply because of the need to replace a vehicle.<\/p><p>Within the last month a series of global circumstances has, in the NTA&rsquo;s view, considerably worsened the capability of taxi and hackney licence holders to secure new vehicles, with lead times of one year not uncommon already. Therefore the NTA have recently proposed to temporarily extend the maximum permissible age for taxis and hackneys with a current final operation date in 2023 and 2024, such that no current vehicle licence holder is forced out of the industry because a replacement vehicle cannot be purchased.<\/p><p>The NTA have opened a public consultation on this proposal on 19 September 2022, and will run until 12 October 2022.

Shannon Heritage ended their management contracts with An Post and Fingal County Council for sites in Dublin on 31 December 2021 and the transfer of the business and employees took place without issue. King John&rsquo;s Castle was successfully transferred to Limerick City and County Council on 4 April.

As part of its engagement with the Shannon Airport Group, Clare County Council identified a funding gap for which it sought government assistance to enable it to take over the sites.

The expense should apply to all employees in that category and not be discretionary. Revenue has advised me that it will consider FRE applications where a large number of employees incur broadly identical qualifying expenses which are not reimbursed by their employer. <\/p>  <p>  Applications are generally made by the representative bodies in the employment sectors concerned and are considered by Revenue based on the specific commonality of expenses within the employment category and compliance with the strictly applied statutory requirement for a tax deduction.  <\/p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that Veterinary Nurses have an existing FRE valued at &euro;400 where the individual supplies and launders their work uniforms and &euro;150 where the work uniforms are supplied by their employer and the individual incurs only laundry costs. This current FRE for veterinary nurses does not incorporate the yearly statutory registration fee with The Veterinary Council of Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  In recent years Revenue conducted a comprehensive review of the administratively based FRE regime which involved engagement with relevant representative bodies, to ensure that the expenses granted to each employment category remain justified and appropriate to modern day. Each category of FRE allowance was examined separately in the light of the legislative requirements of section 114 of the Taxes Consolidation Act (TCA) 1997, which as stated above, provides that expenses are tax deductible only if they are wholly, exclusively, and necessarily incurred by the employee in the performance of the duties of his or her employment and are not reimbursed by the employer.   <\/p>  <p>  I understand that, on foot of the comprehensive review carried out of the FRE rates, Revenue advised the representative body for veterinary nurses that, in their case, it is intended that the statutory registration fee will be included as part of an updated FRE rate when implemented.  Revenue advises me that it remains committed to the FRE regime and encourages all taxpayers to avail of their full tax relief entitlements.  <\/p>  <p>  Pending the implementation of the revised FRE rates, as for all employees, veterinary nurses retain their statutory right to claim a deduction under section 114 of the TCA 1997 in respect of an expense incurred wholly, exclusively and necessarily in the performance of the duties of their employment, to the extent to which the expenses are not reimbursed by the employer or not already included in the relevant FRE amount. <\/p>  <p>  The quickest and easiest way to claim tax relief for qualifying employment expenses (including any FRE) is to complete an online Income Tax Return.

Until the changes I brought in as part of the Finance Act 2019, Ireland&rsquo;s vehicle benefit-in-kind regime was unusual in that there was no overall CO2 rationale in the regime. This is despite a CO2 based vehicle BIK regime being legislated for as far back as 2008 (but never having been commenced). <\/p>  <p>  In Finance Act 2019, I legislated for a CO2-based BIK regime for company cars from 1 January 2023. From that date the amount taxable as BIK remains determined by the car&rsquo;s original market value (OMV) and the annual business kilometres driven, while new CO2 emissions-based bands will determine whether a standard, discounted, or surcharged rate is taxable. The number of mileage bands is reduced from five to four. EVs will benefit from a preferential rate of BIK, ranging from 9 &ndash; 22.5% depending on mileage. Fossil-fuel vehicles will be subject to higher BIK rates, up to 37.5%. This new structure with CO2-based discounts and surcharges will incentivise employers to provide employees with low-emission cars. <\/p>  <p>  I am aware there have been arguments surrounding the mileage bands in the new BIK structure as they can be perceived as incentivising higher mileage to avail of lower rates, leading to higher levels of emissions. The rationale behind the mileage bands is that the greater the business mileage, the more the car is a benefit to the company rather than its employee (on average); and the more the car depreciates in value, the less of a benefit it is to the employee (in years 2 and 3) as the asset from which the benefit is derived is depreciating faster. Mileage bands also ensure that cars more integral to the conduct of business receive preferential tax treatment.<\/p>  <p>  I believe that better value for money for the taxpayer is achieved by curtailing the amount of subsidies available and building an environmental rationale directly into the BIK regime. It was determined in this context that reforming the BIK system to include emissions bands provides for a more sustainable environmental rationale than the continuation of the current system with exemptions for electric vehicles (EVs).  This will bring the taxation system around company cars into step with other CO2-based motor taxes as well as the long-established CO2-based vehicle BIK regimes in other member states.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the above and  in light of government commitments on climate change, Budget 2022 extended the preferential BIK treatment for EVs to end 2025 with a tapering mechanism on the vehicle value threshold. This BIK exemption forms part of a broader series of very generous measures to support the uptake of EVs, including a reduced rate of 7% VRT, a VRT relief of up to &euro;5,000, low motor tax of &euro;120 per annum, SEAI grants, discounted tolls fees, and 0% BIK on electric charging.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, it should be noted that this new BIK charging mechanism was legislated for in 2019 and was announced as part of Budget 2020. I am satisfied that this has provided a sufficient lead in time to adapt to this new system before its implementation in 2023. Therefore there are no plans to postpone its introduction. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092700075#WRF03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":341,"qnumday":115,"qnumall":"[46661\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092700075#WRF03500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the status of a review into farm contractors regarding the carbon tax; if he intends to introduce any measures arising from such in Budget 2023; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1451","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":342,"content":"<p>Finance Act 2012 introduced section 664A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 which provides that a farmer may take an income tax or corporation tax deduction for farm diesel (including any carbon tax charged in respect of diesel) and then a further deduction for farm diesel which is equal to the difference between the carbon tax charged and the carbon tax that would have been charged had it been calculated at the rate of &euro;41.30 per 1,000 litres of farm diesel (the 2012 baseline).<\/p>  <p>  The measure was reviewed as part of the Tax Strategy Group and part of the Climate Action and Tax Paper which is available at: assets.gov.ie\/231224\/4d31b697-1bfb-4177-bb96-a744bbdfba99.pdf.<\/p>  <p>  The relevant TSG paper concluded that:<\/p>  <p>  \"On the grounds of equity, the case for a continuation of section 664A for farmers is not a strong one.

The fact that the normal business deduction in respect of input costs would remain in place as well as the VAT refund scheme for business diesel expenditure should also be kept in mind.<\/p>  <p>  However, the war in Ukraine has caused fuel prices to increase and has raised concerns domestically about food security and the supply of fodder.

As a consequence, lower rates of tax will generally apply to cars that are more environmentally friendly.<\/p>  <p>  From 1 January 2023 the amount taxable as a benefit-in-kind remains determined by the car&rsquo;s original market value (OMV) and the annual business kilometres driven, but new CO2 emissions bands will be used to determine whether a standard, discounted, or surcharged rate applies. Thus, under the new charging regime, the carbon footprint and fuel emissions of the car play a key role in determining the benefit-in-kind charge.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding the specific circumstances of the person referred to in the details supplied, a 6% BIK rate under the current rules would suggest that the person concerned does mileage in excess of 48,000 per annum.  The person also indicates that under the new rules, for the 2023 tax year and subsequent years, they will be liable to BIK at a rate of 18%.  This suggests they are driving a non-electric car in category C (i.e. CO2 Emissions more than 99g\/km up to and including 139g\/km) with business mileage of between 39,001 to 52,000. <\/p>  <p>  The precise arrangements surrounding what types of vehicles are provided by employers for those employees that are &lsquo;on the road&rsquo; in the performance of their duties is a matter between the employee and their employer.  Given the new taxation rules that will apply for company cars from 1 January next, it may provide an opportunity for the person concerned to discuss the matter with their employer.  <\/p>  <p>  I am aware there have been arguments surrounding the mileage bands in the new BIK structure as they can be perceived as incentivising higher mileage to avail of lower rates, leading to higher levels of emissions. The rationale behind the mileage bands is that the greater the business mileage, the more the car is a benefit to the company rather than its employee (on average); and the more the car depreciates in value, the less of a benefit it is to the employee (in years 2 and 3) as the asset from which the benefit is derived is depreciating faster. Mileage bands also ensure that cars more integral to the conduct of business receive preferential tax treatment.<\/p>  <p>  I believe that better value for money for the taxpayer is achieved by curtailing the amount of subsidies available and building an environmental rationale directly into the BIK regime. It was determined in this context that reforming the BIK system to include emissions bands provides for a more sustainable environmental rationale than the continuation of the current system with exemptions for electric vehicles (EVs).  This will bring the taxation system around company cars into step with other CO2-based motor taxes as well as the long-established CO2-based vehicle BIK regimes in other member states.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the above and  in light of government commitments on climate change, Budget 2022 extended the preferential BIK treatment for EVs to end 2025 with a tapering mechanism on the vehicle value threshold. This BIK exemption forms part of a broader series of very generous measures to support the uptake of EVs, including a reduced rate of 7% VRT, a VRT relief of up to &euro;5,000, low motor tax of &euro;120 per annum, SEAI grants, discounted tolls fees, and 0% BIK on electric charging.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, it should be noted that this new BIK charging mechanism was legislated for in 2019 and was announced as part of Budget 2020. I am satisfied that this has provided a sufficient lead in time to adapt to this new system before its implementation in 2023. Therefore there are no plans to postpone its introduction.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092700075#WRF05600","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Legislative Measures","counter":363,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092700075#WRF05700"},{"type":"question","counter":364,"qnumday":123,"qnumall":"[46797\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092700075#WRF05800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the reason that an Act which was never intended for small community groups is being applied rigorously to the community groups (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1500","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":365,"content":"<p>The National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) who manages State Savings have informed me that, under the Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) Act 2010 as amended, designated bodies, such as An Post and the Prize Bond Company, are required by law to comply with anti-money laundering requirements and verify all customers&rsquo; identities.<\/p>  <p>  State Savings products are distributed and administered by An Post and the Prize Bond Company acting as agents of the NTMA and are subject to published Terms and Conditions which contain the applicable requirements regarding confirmation and verification of the identity of all purchasers\/holders. <\/p>  <p>  State Savings products are offered by the Minister for Finance acting through the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) pursuant to the powers conferred on the NTMA by the National Treasury Management Agency Act 1990 and the National Treasury Management Agency Act 1990 (Delegation of and Declaration as to Functions) Order 1990 (S.I.

Until the changes I brought in as part of the Finance Act 2019, Ireland&rsquo;s vehicle benefit-in-kind regime was unusual in that there was no overall CO2 rationale in the regime. This is despite a CO2 based vehicle BIK regime being legislated for as far back as 2008 (but never having been commenced). <\/p>  <p>  In Finance Act 2019, I legislated for a CO2-based BIK regime for company cars from 1 January 2023. From that date the amount taxable as BIK remains determined by the car&rsquo;s original market value (OMV) and the annual business kilometres driven, while new CO2 emissions-based bands will determine whether a standard, discounted, or surcharged rate is taxable. The number of mileage bands is reduced from five to four. EVs will benefit from a preferential rate of BIK, ranging from 9 &ndash; 22.5% depending on mileage. Fossil-fuel vehicles will be subject to higher BIK rates, up to 37.5%. This new structure with CO2-based discounts and surcharges will incentivise employers to provide employees with low-emission cars. <\/p>  <p>  I am aware there have been arguments surrounding the mileage bands in the new BIK structure as they can be perceived as incentivising higher mileage to avail of lower rates, leading to higher levels of emissions.

As a matter of clarification, questions of employment versus self-employment status impact the work of three different Government bodies.  The Department of Social Protection (DSP) has responsibility for the PRSI system and determines employment status for social insurance purposes; the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) determines employment status when adjudicating on employment rights matters; and Revenue may determine a worker&rsquo;s employment status in the context of his\/her treatment for income tax purposes and in allocating the income earned to the appropriate Schedule under the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997. <\/p>  <p>  While in most situations involving determinations of employment status there is commonality of approach across the three bodies, the decision of one organisation is not binding on the other, and as a consequence, a determination of employment status in one context may not be the same as in another context.  <\/p>  <p>  There are close working relationships between the three bodies, including conducting joint compliance interventions to ensure that employers are operating employment arrangements correctly.  Furthermore, in July 2021, an interdepartmental working group comprising the DSP, Revenue and the WRC further updated the Code of Practice on Determining Employment Status. The purpose of the revised Code is to provide an enhanced understanding of employment status, taking into account current labour market practices and developments in legislation and case law. These developments include, for example, new forms of work such as platform work and the gig economy. It is a &lsquo;living document&rsquo;, which will continue to be updated to reflect relevant changes into the future.<\/p>  <p>  Instances where determinations of employment status between Revenue and the DSP (and\/or the WRC) differ are very rare and there is open dialogue between the relevant bodies to discuss the respective views.  However, as already stated, the decision of one organisation is not binding on the others. <\/p>  <p>  One example where the approach between DSP and Revenue is different involves home tutors.

Some &euro;2.4 billion in cost of living measures has been announced since last October. Looking ahead, the Government will continue to address these challenges head on. Budget 2023 will be a &lsquo;Cost of Living Budget&rsquo; and will build on the fiscal supports the Government has already provided to cushion the impact of rising prices. <\/p>  <p>  The Government supported households and firms through the pandemic and will continue to do so in the face of unprecedented energy price spikes caused by Putin&rsquo;s war. However, we must be cognisant that resources are limited and while government policy will absorb some of the price shock, we cannot cushion households and businesses from the entire impact. The Government has to balance the appropriate response to the increased cost of living in Ireland with the unprecedented level of global economic uncertainty and macroeconomic risk. Furthermore, in calibrating how we respond to the current challenges, it is important that we strike the right balance and ensure that policy doesn&rsquo;t inadvertently add further inflationary pressures into the system.<\/p>  <p>  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that there are a number of administrative and legislative provisions under which employers can support employees in working from home.<\/p>  <p>  Employees may incur certain expenditure in the performance of their duties working from home, such as additional heating, electricity, and broadband costs. Revenue operates a long-standing administrative practice which allows an employer to make payments up to &euro;3.20 to employees, for each day worked from home, subject to certain conditions, without deducting PAYE, PRSI or USC. There is no legal obligation on an employer to make such a payment, as it is at the discretion of the employer.<\/p>  <p>  The home-working allowance originated in 1993; according to the CSO's CPI Inflation Calculator, the inflation rate in Ireland since January 1993 is 81 per cent which, if applied to the &euro;3.20 rate, would amount to &euro;5.79 today.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, my Department reviewed the tax arrangements for remote working as part of the 2021 Tax Strategy Group process and published the resultant paper on the Department's website. The review found that the daily tax-free rate of &euro;3.20, up to &euro;16 per week or &euro;832 per annum compares favourably internationally. For example, in the UK, the weekly rate is just &pound;6 per week or a maximum of &pound;312 per annum.<\/p>  <p>  Where an employer does not pay &euro;3.20 per day to a remote worker, or that amount doesn&rsquo;t sufficiently cover the additional cost borne by the employee as a result of working from home, the employee may be entitled to claim Remote Working Relief, which is provided for in section 114A of the Taxes Consolidation Act (TCA) 1997. This measure allows employees, subject to satisfying certain conditions, to claim an income tax deduction amounting to 30% of the relevant cost of electricity, heating and broadband for the days spent working from home as a remote worker. <\/p>  <p>  Revenue has advised that the provision of equipment, such as computers, printers, scanners and office furniture by the employer to enable the employee work from home will not attract a benefit-In-kind charge, where the equipment is provided primarily for business use. In addition, the provision of a telephone line, broadband and such facilities for business use will also not give rise to a benefit-in-kind charge, where private use of the connection is incidental. These exemptions are provided for in section 118 TCA 1997.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, comprehensive guidance material on the range of measures available to remote workers is published on the Revenue website. Detailed material is included in Tax and Duty Manual Part 05-02-13 Remote Working Relief, which is available at: www.revenue.ie\/en\/tax-professionals\/tdm\/income-tax-capital-gains-tax-corporation-tax\/part-05\/05-02-13.pdf.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092700076#WRG02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Bodies","counter":390,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092700076#WRG02400"},{"type":"question","counter":391,"qnumday":133,"qnumall":"[47212\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092700076#WRG02500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the progress that has been made to replace the disabled drivers medical board of appeals; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1580","askee":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":392,"qnumday":134,"qnumall":"[47226\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092700076#WRG02600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of persons that are waiting for their appeals to be dealt with through the Disabled Drivers Board of Appeal; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1580","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":393,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 133 and 134 together.<\/p>  <p>  The Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers Scheme provides relief from Vehicle Registration Tax and VAT on an adapted car, as well as an exemption from motor tax and an annual fuel grant.<\/p>  <p>  The Scheme is open to severely and permanently disabled persons as a driver or as a passenger and also to certain charitable organisations.

The Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland (PSI), the pharmacy regulator, has been liaising with stakeholders, on efforts being taken within the sector to understand and address this issue. I am informed that this is a complex problem with many contributing factors and multiple stakeholders. Workforce challenges are being experienced in other sectors nationally, and in the pharmacy sector in a range of other countries.  I also understand that the PSI are currently undertaking a project, due to run across 2022-&rsquo;23 to assess emerging risks to the continued availability of a professional pharmacy workforce within community and hospital pharmacy in Ireland. The PSI has also committed in its Service Plan 2022 to complete a review of the Third Country Qualification Route (TCQR).<\/p>  <p>  During the COVID-19 pandemic the Health Service Executive established a Community Pharmacy Contingency Planning working group with relevant stakeholders, to support the implementation of all COVID-19 support measures in the context of pharmacy services and the contribution this sector could make.

The Arts Council sees festivals as key producers and presenters of the arts and are critical to engaging large and diverse audiences. The Arts Council also provides financial support to a number of single art form festivals (e.g. theatre, dance, film) and such festivals are supported within the policy context of those art forms. The Council also supports many multidisciplinary arts festivals, meaning those festivals that programme across different art forms, including literature, music, street arts, theatre, visual arts and different areas of arts practice. Their Festivals Investment Scheme, for example, is specifically designed to offer support to local\/voluntary organisations to develop arts festivals. The larger festivals regularly supported by the Council include the Wexford Festival Opera and the Galway Arts Festival. Further details can be accessed on the Arts Council&rsquo;s website at the following link www.artscouncil.ie\/Arts-in-Ireland\/Festivals\/<\/p>  <p>  My Department run a Small Scale Local Festivals and Summer Schools Scheme. The Scheme is designed to support local cultural festivals and summer schools which are not in receipt of other central Government monies, and which may not be eligible under funding criteria for larger scale events supported by F&aacute;ilte Ireland, the Arts Council and similar bodies. The maximum funding available under this scheme is capped at &euro;5,000.  Details of the 34 events that were supported under the Small Scale Local Festivals and Summer Schools taking place around Ireland in 2022  can be found via this link  www.gov.ie\/en\/press-release\/247c6-minister-martin-announces-funding-for-small-scale-local-festivals-and-summer-schools\/<\/p>  <p>  The Department also provides funding to support Comhaltas Ceolt&oacute;ir&iacute; &Eacute;ireann (CC&Eacute;), which is the largest group involved in the preservation and promotion of Irish traditional music both at community and national level. Annual funding is provided to CC&Eacute; for its work in the protection and promotion of Irish traditional music and culture.  Many of us welcomed the return of the Fleadh Cheoil that  took place in Mullingar from 31 July to 7 August. As the greatest annual gathering under the auspices of Comhaltas Ceolt&oacute;ir&iacute; &Eacute;ireann, the Fleadh is principally organised at community level by the local branches in partnership with the local authority, media and other partners and sponsors. <\/p>  <p>  The Creative Ireland Programme is a culture-based programme led by my Department to promote individual, community and national well-being. Its core proposition is that participation in arts, cultural and heritage-based activities drives personal and collective creativity, with significant implications for individual and societal well-being and achievement. Under the Creative Communities initiative in the Creative Ireland Programme, my Department and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage provide funding to each of the 31 local authorities to enable them to implement their individual Culture and Creativity Strategies 2018-2022. These Strategies were developed in 2017 following extensive local public consultation and are unique to each local authority, reflecting the breadth of cultural and creative work being undertaken in each area as well as the strategic priorities identified by the local community.  Within this context, many festivals and events have received support from their local authorities. Further information is available on www.creatieireland.gov.ie\/en\/creative-communities\/<\/p>  <p>  F&aacute;ilte Ireland supports local authorities in the development of tourism in their area including funding for capital investment, festivals and events. Festivals and participative events are also an important part of Irish tourism activities and in this context, F&aacute;ilte Ireland operate the Festival Innovation Programme Fund, which can be found at this link: www.failteireland.ie\/Identify-Available-Funding\/Festivals-Innovation-Programme.aspx<\/p>  <p>  Festivals and events also play a significant part in attracting and holding visitors in particular areas of Ireland at different times of the year. Tourism Ireland works closely with many festivals to provide exposure for them in key markets overseas. The St Patrick&rsquo;s Festival, Galway 2020, Cork Jazz Festival, and Wexford Festival Opera are just some examples of festivals which have received extensive coverage through Tourism Ireland&rsquo;s marketing overseas. Tourism Ireland also work with Culture Ireland to bring the best of Ireland&rsquo;s artists, writers, poets, musicians and dancers to the attention of enthusiasts and new audiences.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092700077#WRH04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1471"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":455,"content":"<p>Question No. 155 answered with Question No. 154.<\/p>"},{"type":"question","counter":458,"qnumday":156,"qnumall":"[46963\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092700078#WRJ00300","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"if her Department will be providing details of the types of funding schemes that are available for local festivals and events funded by F&aacute;ilte Ireland; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1601","askee":"1471"},{"type":"speech","counter":459,"content":"<p>My Department's role in relation to tourism lies primarily in the area of national tourism policy and implementation of that policy is a matter for the tourism agencies, F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland, as well as certain other bodies.

Many areas of cities, towns and villages of all sizes face the blight of vacant properties, which, if brought back into use, could add real vibrancy to towns of all sizes around the country and new accommodation to both urban and rural areas. We want to see vacant homes, and indeed vacant commercial properties that could be converted, brought back into use and we are incentivising people to do that through the Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe Towns Fund.<\/p>  <p>  Schemes under the Fund, which is delivered by local authorities, will provide new choices for people to live in towns and villages in Ireland, through the provision of a grant to support the refurbishment of vacant properties and by providing serviced sites in towns and villages to people in order to build their own homes.<\/p>  <p>  On the 14 July, I launched the Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant as part of the Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe (Towns) Fund. The grant will benefit those who wish to turn a formerly vacant house or building into their principal private residence.<\/p>  <p>  A grant of up to a maximum of &euro;30,000 is available for the refurbishment of vacant properties for occupation as a principal private residence, including the conversion of a property which has not previously been used as residential. Where the refurbishment costs are expected to exceed the standard grant of up to &euro;30,000, a maximum top-up grant amount of up to &euro;20,000 is available where the property is confirmed to be derelict, bringing the total grant available for a derelict property up to a maximum of &euro;50,000.<\/p>  <p>  On 21 September, I launched the Ready to Build Scheme as part of the Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe (Towns) Fund.  Under the Ready to Build Scheme, local authorities will make serviced sites in towns and villages available to potential individual purchasers to build their homes. These sites will be available at a discount on the market value of the site for the building of a property for occupation as the principal private residence of the purchaser. <\/p>  <p>  When the Fund was launched, I committed to ongoing review of the schemes under it and in particular I am pleased to see that the feedback on the Vacant Property Refurbishment Scheme to date has been overwhelmingly positive, with 169 applications submitted by the start of September.<\/p>  <p>  Given that Pathway 4 of Housing for All is intended to support re-use of existing buildings and the synergy with the Government's Our Rural Future policy, I do see the sense in extending the eligibility for the scheme to vacant properties in both our cities and rural areas to ensure we are using our existing housing stock to the fullest extent possible. In that context, I am pleased to say that the Government has decided to extend the vacant property refurbishment scheme and I expect to have that extension to cities and rural properties in place by the end of October.<\/p>  <p>  It will continue to be only for those who intend to occupy the property as their principal private residence.

The volume of applications made under the Act in recent years has grown significantly. In parallel, my Department is leading an extensive marine management reform programme, the likes of which the State has never seen.<\/p>  <p>  The expected time for processing and determining foreshore applications can vary considerably and is influenced by the quality of the application and supporting documents received, the nature and complexity of the application, the level of public engagement during the consultation process and up until recently, impacts from restrictions imposed as a result of Covid-19, among other matters. Each application must be assessed appropriately in accordance with the applicable requirements of domestic and EU law including the EIA Directive, Birds and Habitats Regulations and the Foreshore Act. <\/p>  <p>  A range of foreshore consents related to offshore energy infrastructure granted under the Foreshore Act 1933 in recent years have been assessed and prioritized in tandem with the other high level Government objectives in the maritime space. Details for foreshore applications and determinations are available on my Department's website at www.gov.ie\/en\/collection\/f2196-foreshore-applications-and-determinations\/<\/p>  <p>  A further proportion of foreshore applications on hand include licence applications for site investigations within the foreshore area linked to the proposed development of offshore renewable energy projects. The site investigations are critical activities developers undertake in order to investigate viability and prepare environmental impact assessments of potential future offshore renewable energy infrastructure.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has also been prioritising site investigation licence applications linked to qualified Offshore Renewable Energy (ORE) projects, known as \"relevant projects\" or Phase 1 projects, which qualify to make an application to the Minister for Environment, Climate and Communications for a Maritime Area Consent (MAC) as part of the transition provisions in the Maritime Area Planning Act 2021. Any project in this category granted a MAC by the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications must then apply for the necessary development permission from An Bord Plean&aacute;la under the new marine planning system.  That Department will also shortly conclude the criteria to select a second batch of ORE projects to enter the new maritime consenting system, enabling delivery on our 2030 targets.<\/p>  <p>  The Government recently approved the prioritisation of renewable energy plans and projects in the Irish maritime area, as a direct response to the energy and climate crises. This decision follows on from the recently agreed Government ambitions for an increase of offshore wind energy, which targets the delivery of an additional 2GW of offshore wind for the production of green hydrogen. Following this decision, the Government&rsquo;s intention is that the following projects in the maritime area will receive priority attention: <\/p>  <p>  - Any marine infrastructure projects that align with Government decisions to address risks to energy security of supply. <\/p>  <p>  - Projects that are capable of delivering 200MW or above of offshore renewable energy to meet domestic demand before 2030, using well established, proven technologies. <\/p>  <p>  - Infrastructure that will support delivery and deployment of Renewable Energy projects such as grid and port facilities. <\/p>  <p>  - Projects utilising emerging technology that may have the ability to assist the State in meeting its 2030 targets such as floating wind and green hydrogen<\/p>  <p>  To give effect to this decision, approval has also been given to the immediate development of a Statutory Marine Planning Policy Statement (MPPS) by my Department that will prioritise energy and energy-related projects above all other maritime activities during the six year lifetime of the MPPS. By taking this action, the State&rsquo;s consenting authorities, such as An Bord Plean&aacute;la and the soon to be established Maritime Area Regulatory Authority will prioritise the processing of renewable energy projects, including those that support the development of ORE infrastructure in both the marine and onshore.<\/p>  <p>  The Foreshore Unit in my Department is currently assessing the current caseload of foreshore lease and licence applications in the context of this Government decision. A key consideration will be how the significant number of site investigation licenses that are on hand and not associated with the Phase 1 projects can be managed given the priority status afforded across Government to applications associated with projects capable of delivering before 2030 using well established technologies.<\/p>  <p>  The specific long-term plan for the operation of the Moneypoint Power Station is a matter for my colleague the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications in the context of energy supply security policy generally.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092700078#WRJ03075","answer":true,"speaker":"1595"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Emergency Accommodation","counter":492,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092700078#WRJ03100"},{"type":"question","counter":493,"qnumday":169,"qnumall":"[46750\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092700078#WRJ03200","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the resources and funding that have been allocated to Clare County Council for the provision of emergency accommodation; if additional funding will be administered by his Department given the emergency accommodation is at full capacity; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1520","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":494,"content":"<p>My Department does not fund any homeless services directly but provides funding to housing authorities towards these costs.

Both these measures came into effect from 11 July 2022.<\/p>  <p>  A separate review of the discretion available to Homeless HAP tenancies in Dublin, which is up to 50% above the prescribed maximum rent limits, is currently being undertaken by my Department, in conjunction with the Housing Agency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092700079#WRK03900","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rental Sector","counter":558,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092700079#WRK04000"},{"type":"question","counter":559,"qnumday":191,"qnumall":"[47261\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092700079#WRK04100","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if he will introduce a ban on evictions into homelessness to address rising homelessness levels; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1579","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":560,"content":"<p>Having regard to the manifest and grave risk to human life and public health posed by the spread of Covid-19 and in order to mitigate, where practicable, the effect of the spread of that disease, the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020 provided for a temporary moratorium on tenancy terminations, other than in exceptional and limited cases during the emergency period from 27 March 2020 to 1 August 2020.<\/p>  <p>  The operation of the Residential Tenancies Acts 2004 - 2022 and the residential rental market, are kept under constant review by my Department, the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) and the Housing Agency and I will bring forward any necessary and justifiable legal change in a timely manner.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092700079#WRK04200","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"question","counter":562,"qnumday":192,"qnumall":"[47263\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092700079#WRK04400","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if a matter in relation to housing inspections on rental properties that are being carried out by local authorities will be examined (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1487","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":563,"content":"<p>The Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations 2019 specify requirements in relation to a range of matters, such as structural repair, sanitary facilities, heating, ventilation, natural light, fire safety and the safety of gas, oil and electrical installations.

The School Inclusion Model (SIM) is based on policy advice from the National Council for Special Education, based on the principle of providing the right support at the right time, delivered by a range of personnel with relevant qualifications and skill-sets.  Its purpose is to help students achieve better outcomes.  Independent evaluation is a central part of the project and the outcome will inform future policy on the potential to extend SIM to other schools.<\/p><p>The project includes a number of elements:<\/p><p>- Availability of therapists (speech and language, occupational) to schools to build teacher capacity<\/p><p>- Allocation of SNAs on a front-loaded basis<\/p><p>- Additional professional supports for the school including psychology, behavioural and professional development<\/p><p>- Training of SNAs<\/p><p>In February 2019, the Government approved the trialling of the Model for the 2019\/20 school year. Initially designed as a one year pilot involving up to 75 participating schools in the CHO 7 region, it was interrupted by Covid-19 with the closure of schools and the diversion of HSE therapists from the project to Covid related work. It was then extended to the 2020\/21 school year which was also interrupted by Covid.  Progress has been made on aspects of the Model but much remains to be done in terms of in-school implementation and evaluation.  The Pilot recommenced in November 2021 in CHO7.<\/p><p>SIM In-School Therapists work in partnership with teachers to co-develop interventions to support children. The interventions are founded in evidence-based occupational therapy (OT) and speech and language therapy (SLT) strategies and techniques, joined with the educational knowledge and experience of the teacher. The interventions are structured to be primarily delivered by the teacher, with support from the therapists.<\/p><p>The therapists provide relevant training, therapy-based strategies, coaching and modelling support to teachers to build their capacity. To ensure that therapy supports have long lasting impact, the overall focus is on building the capacity of schools and teachers, and embedding interventions into everyday school practices.<\/p><p>SIM provides a systemic approach to building the capacity of school communities to meet the needs of children. <\/p><p>There are a number of challenges and barriers to continuing the roll-out of SIM in CHO7 and expanding SIM to other areas at this time. The single biggest challenge is the availability of therapists.

With this information, my Department carries out nationwide demographic exercises to determine where additional school accommodation is needed at primary and post-primary level.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to advise the Deputy that my Department is aware of increasing local pressures and demand for primary and post-primary school places in a number of school planning areas including school planning areas in Dublin 9. <\/p>  <p>  Where data indicates that additional provision is required, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may be provided through either one, or a combination of, the following:<\/p>  <p>  - Utilising existing unused capacity within a school or schools,<\/p>  <p>  - Extending the capacity of a school or schools,<\/p>  <p>  - Provision of a new school or schools.  <\/p>  <p>  My Department is working to establish the true extent of any capacity issues through ongoing discussions with the relevant school authorities.  In that context, similar to the process adopted in advance of the current academic year, my Department is engaging with patron bodies, including those of schools in Santry and Whitehall, to identify particular capacity requirements for the forthcoming year(s) which may necessitate further action to that already in train, including the provision of modular accommodation where necessary.<\/p>  <p>  Under Project Ireland 2040, my Department continues to make progress to increase the infrastructural capacity in the schools sector, in order to meet demographic and other demands.  It is expected that the enrolment pressures in this, and other areas will reduce in the short-term as such planned additional capacity comes on stream and as demographic demand moves past its peak. <\/p>  <p>  The Capital Programme details the school projects that are being progressed under Project Ireland 2040. The current status of large-scale projects being delivered under Project Ireland 2040, including projects in the school planning areas in question, may be viewed on my Department's website at, www.gov.ie and this information is updated regularly. In addition, a list of large-scale projects completed from 2010 to date may also be viewed on the website.   <\/p>  <p>  My Department is currently planning the delivery of a major campus project on the current Clonturk Community College site in Whitehall. The project will deliver two new 1,000 pupil post-primary schools and 1 new primary school (8 classrooms) on the Clonturk site.  One of the new post- primary schools will be for Ellenfield Community College to replace their existing school. The new school will include a 4 classroom SEN Base. The other new post-primary school is a replacement school building for Clonturk Community College. The expanded post-primary schools will provide circa 1,200 additional co-educational, multi-denominational post-primary school places in North Dublin City.<\/p>  <p>  The Department is currently developing the accommodation brief for this significant campus development and is engaging with the school patrons as part of this process.<\/p>  <p>  The additional capacity being provided by all of these projects is intended to address projected future capacity requirements in the area. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092700082#WRN03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disadvantaged Status","counter":701,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092700082#WRN03200"},{"type":"question","counter":702,"qnumday":236,"qnumall":"[46645\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092700082#WRN03300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the status of the DEIS review for a school (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1568","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":703,"content":"<p>In March I was glad to be able to announce a major expansion of the DEIS &ndash; Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools programme which means that, for the first time since 2017, the programme is being significantly expanded and eligible schools will now gain access to targeted supports to address educational disadvantage. This will add an additional &euro;32million to my Department&rsquo;s expenditure on the DEIS programme from 2023, bringing the 2023 allocation to in the region of &euro;180million.<\/p>  <p>  Schools were identified for inclusion in the programme through the refined DEIS identification model which is an objective, statistics based model. Schools were not required to apply for inclusion in the DEIS programme and the model has been applied fairly and equally to all schools. <\/p>  <p>  The DEIS identification process aims to identify those schools with the highest levels of concentrated disadvantage or the highest proportion of students from disadvantaged backgrounds within a school. The model uses information from the school&rsquo;s individual enrolment database and 2016 national census data as represented by the Pobal HP Deprivation index. The model takes into account the student cohort and the relative disadvantage within a given school.  The DEIS identification model takes into consideration the significant educational disadvantage experienced by Traveller and Roma learners and by students residing in direct provision or emergency homeless accommodation. <\/p>  <p>  A detailed paper on the refined DEIS identification model is available on gov.ie at www.gov.ie\/en\/publication\/a3c9e-extension-of-deis-to-further-schools\/#how-schools-were-selected-for-inclusion-in-deis<\/p>  <p>  Schools that were not satisfied with the outcome following the application of the DEIS identification model to their school enrolment data were provided with the opportunity to have that outcome reviewed. The details of the Appeals process is outlined in Circular 0019\/2022 which can be found on the gov.ie website. All appeals submitted have now been processed by my Department and schools have been notified of the outcome. The DEIS appeals process was applied fairly across all appellants and the results are final. My Department will continue to support schools to deliver high quality, inclusive teaching and learning to students and young learners. <\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that the extension of the DEIS programme to new schools is just one phase of work in my vision for an inclusive education system which supports all learners to achieve their potential. While the DEIS programme supports those schools with the highest levels of concentrated educational disadvantage, I recognise that there are students at risk of educational disadvantage in all schools. Conscious of this, and recognising the need to target resources to those schools that need them most, the next phase of work will explore the allocation of resources to schools to tackle educational disadvantage. Part of this programme of work will involve consultation with all relevant stakeholders.<\/p>  <p>In addition to this, following the National Census 2022 held on the 3rd April last it is envisaged that an updated HP Deprivation Index will be generated by Pobal and will be available in Q3 of 2023. My Department will engage with Pobal in relation to this process. The updated HP Deprivation Index, when available, can be considered by my Department to inform future resource allocation to tackle educational disadvantage.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092700082#WRN03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Transport","counter":704,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092700082#WRN03500"},{"type":"question","counter":705,"qnumday":237,"qnumall":"[46670\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092700082#WRN03600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if she will investigate the reason that a pupil (details supplied) who applied for a school bus ticket in April 2022 and who has been using the school transport service for the past four years and is paying for this service has been advised that there is no bus ticket despite the bus travelling the route on a daily basis at 50% capacity; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1508","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":706,"content":"<p>The School Transport Scheme is a significant operation managed by Bus &Eacute;ireann on behalf of the Department.

Schools were not required to apply for inclusion in the DEIS programme and the model has been applied fairly and equally to all schools. <\/p>  <p>  The DEIS identification process is based on the principle of concentrated disadvantage and the proportion of students from disadvantaged backgrounds within a school. It takes into account the specific enrolment within a school and the proportion of students within that school.

The DEIS appeals process was applied fairly across all appellants and the results are final. <\/p>  <p>  My Department will continue to support schools to deliver high quality, inclusive teaching and learning to students and young learners. It is important to note that the extension of the DEIS programme to new schools is just one phase of work in my vision for an inclusive education system which supports all learners to achieve their potential. While the DEIS programme supports those schools with the highest levels of concentrated educational disadvantage, I recognise that there are students at risk of educational disadvantage in all schools. Conscious of this, and recognising the need to target resources to those schools that need them most, the next phase of work will explore the allocation of resources to schools to tackle educational disadvantage.

The Home School Community Liaison (HSCL) Scheme is an integral element of the DEIS programme.  It is a school-based intervention provided to DEIS schools to address the needs of pupils at most risk of educational disadvantage. The role of the HSCL Coordinator is to work primarily with the salient adults in the child&rsquo;s life, in order to empower them, so that they can better support their children to attend school, participate in education and develop positive attitudes to life-long learning. Central to the HSCL initiative, is the identification of educational needs and the provision of a tailored and proportionate response to those needs, through a range of interventions, which are evidence-based, focused and structured.<\/p>  <p>  HSCL supports are provided to all DEIS Urban and DEIS Post-Primary schools. In the 2022\/23 school year there are 529 HSCL posts allocated to provide supports to approximately 207,000 students under the DEIS programme. A further 4 posts are allocated to support schools participating in the National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy (NTRIS) STAR pilot working with Traveller and Roma students.<\/p>  <p>  Enabling children with special educational needs (SEN) to receive an education appropriate to their needs is a priority for this Government.  It is also a key priority for me as Minister for Special Education &amp;amp; Inclusion, for my Department and for the National Council for Special Education (NCSE).  This year, my Department will spend in excess of &euro;2 Billion, or over 25% of the Department&rsquo;s budget on providing additional teaching and care supports for children with special educational needs. As a result, the number of special education teachers, special needs assistants and special class and special school places are at unprecedented levels.  Staffing ratios in special schools are significantly lower than in mainstream schools and are intended to ensure that the needs of students can be met effectively. While the benefits of having good links between the home and school are acknowledged for all students, there are no current plans to extend DEIS programme measures to special schools.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092700083#WRO03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1472"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":754,"content":"<p>Question No. 255 answered with Question No. 254.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Enrolments","counter":755,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092700083#WRO03700"},{"type":"question","counter":756,"qnumday":256,"qnumall":"[46972\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092700083#WRO03800","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the school catchment area in which Clonshaugh, Dublin 17, is located; the primary and secondary schools in the catchment area; the nature of each school; if a location such as this directly adjoining and integrated with other urban school catchments can be accommodated in getting access to schools in neighbouring catchments in cases in which they would otherwise be considered as of lower priority.","asker":"1549","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":757,"content":"<p>In order to plan for school provision and analyse the relevant demographic data, my Department divides the country into 314 school planning areas and uses a Geographical Information System, using data from a range of sources, including Child Benefit and school enrolment data, to identify where the pressure for school places across the country will arise and where additional school accommodation is needed at primary and post-primary level.

The model uses information from the school&rsquo;s individual enrolment database and 2016 national census data as represented by the Pobal HP Deprivation index. The model takes into account the student cohort and the relative disadvantage within a given school.  The DEIS identification model takes into consideration the significant educational disadvantage experienced by Traveller and Roma learners and by students residing in direct provision or emergency homeless accommodation. <\/p>  <p>  A detailed paper on the refined DEIS identification model is available on gov.ie at:<\/p>  <p>  www.gov.ie\/en\/publication\/a3c9e-extension-of-deis-to-further-schools\/#how-schools-were-selected-for-inclusion-in-deis<\/p>  <p>  Schools that were not satisfied with the outcome following the application of the DEIS identification model to their school enrolment data were provided with the opportunity to have that outcome reviewed.

These include road, rail and ferry services provided by companies such as Bus &Aacute;tha Cliath, Bus &Eacute;ireann and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, as well as Luas and services provided by over 80 private transport operators.  There are approximately 1,043,000 customers with direct eligibility.  The estimated expenditure on free travel in 2022 is &euro;95 million.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that, in general, access to a free travel pass for those aged under 66 is linked to a person being in receipt of certain primary Social Protection payments such as Disability Allowance, Invalidity Pension, Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, Blind Pension and Partial Capacity Benefit.  Crucially, as many illnesses or physical conditions have an impact across a spectrum from mild to severe, entitlement to these social welfare schemes is not provided on the basis of a diagnosis but on the basis of the impact of that diagnosis on the individual concerned.  In this way, resources can be targeted to people in most need.<\/p>  <p>  Therefore, while a diagnosis of a particular medical condition will be required to establish if a person may be eligible for certain social welfare schemes, evidence of impact is also required before entitlement to the scheme or the related free travel scheme is established.  The sole exception to this general approach is in respect of people who are blind.<\/p>  <p>  While consideration is always given to any requests to improve or extend eligibility to the free travel scheme, uncoupling the link between receipt of particular social welfare payments and eligibility for the free travel scheme would so fundamentally alter the scheme that it would move it away from being a social welfare measure to being a general transport initiative.<\/p>  <p>  Any such change would also require potentially very significant additional funding for the free travel scheme and would have to be considered in the context of overall budgetary negotiations.<\/p>  <p>  I am aware of an ongoing campaign by Epilepsy Ireland and recognise the issues and difficulties that can arise due to a person being diagnosed with epilepsy and who is unable to drive as a result of their condition.  I have met with representatives of Epilepsy Ireland to discuss its proposal in detail.  <\/p>  <p>  Following the meeting, I asked my Department officials to examine the issues raised by Epilepsy Ireland. This work is still ongoing.  <\/p>  <p>  Finally, the Department of Social Protection provides Additional Needs Payments as part of the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme for people who have an urgent need which they cannot meet from their own resources.  These payments are available through our Community Welfare Officers and include help towards recurring travel costs that cannot be met from the person's own resources and are deemed to be necessary.  Every decision is based on consideration of the circumstances of the case, taking account of the nature and extent of the need and of the resources of the person concerned. <\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092700085#WRQ03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"question","counter":844,"qnumday":286,"qnumall":"[46573\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092700085#WRQ03800","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the position in respect of education workers who need to sign for unemployment benefits during holiday periods; if claims are closed by her Department when such persons return to work or if the claims remain permanently open; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1620","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":845,"content":"<p>Educational Sector Workers (ESWs) who wish to avail of income support while temporarily laid-off during the school breaks can apply for a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment but must satisfy all the qualifying conditions to receive this payment.

It should be noted that the decision to apply the requirements of IORP II to all schemes and trust RACs was announced by the Government in 2019 and it was expected that trustees and insurance providers would have been preparing for compliance with these requirements in advance of transposition.

Given the contingency-based nature of this system, it can happen that a person may experience more than one contingency at the same time, but generally they can receive only one  payment.  This principle is common to social security systems across the world.

Under this scheme, the Department may make an additional needs payment to meet essential expenditure which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet out of their weekly income.  The payment is available to anyone who needs it and qualifies, whether the person is currently on a social welfare payment or working on a low income.<\/p>  <p>  My Department will continue to keep the range of supports under review.

The funding for the programme amounted to around &euro;16 million and was provided jointly under the European Union&rsquo;s ESF 2014-2020 Programme for Employability, Inclusion and Learning Operational Programme and the Irish Exchequer.  In line with commitments under the Comprehensive Employment Strategy, the Final Evaluation of the Ability Programme was published at its conclusion.<\/p>  <p>  Last year, I put a plan in place to allow for the transition of the remaining Ability providers and participants to new arrangements and this was agreed with the Ability Providers Subgroup following a meeting with this group.  This included a two-month extension to the 26 organisations still operating under the programme at that time. <\/p>  <p>  The current Dormant Accounts Fund Measure to Support the Employment of People with Disabilities was a new employment support measure for people with disabilities.  On 30 July last year I announced that 45 projects had been funded up to an amount of &euro;7.6 million.  This programme began in September and runs up to the end of 2022.  All 27 organisations who received funding under the former Ability Programme were successful in securing funding under this new measure, including the organisation referred to by the Deputy. <\/p>  <p>  It was agreed that a new employment programme for people with disabilities would be included in the new Operational Programme for Ireland under the European Social Fund Plus (ESF+) 2021-2027.  This new disability focused employment measure will build on the learnings of the former Ability Programme.  The new programme will also need to add complementarity to the suite of existing employment supports targeted at people with disabilities provided by my department and broader national strategies for employment of people with disabilities, including the Comprehensive Employment Strategy for People with Disabilities. <\/p>  <p>  The ESF Managing Authority in Ireland - based in the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science - has compiled the Operational Programme for Ireland which has been approved by Government.  The Operational Programme has been formally submitted to the European Commission.  It is expected that Commission approval will be communicated in the latter part of the year. <\/p>  <p>  Once approval is in place, it is anticipated that the new disability programme will be open by way of a competitive process in 2023 to applications from organisations across the country, including the 27 former Ability Programme organisations referred to by the Deputy.<\/p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that my commitment in relation to providing funding supports to improve the employment possibilities of people with disabilities has not been found wanting to date and that the organisation&rsquo;s concern raised by the Deputy is acknowledged and noted.

In relation to Jobseeker's Allowance a disregard of &euro;20 per day up to a maximum of &euro;60 per week (3 days) applies to earnings from employment.  The balance is then assessed at 60%. <\/p>  <p>  In addition to the Jobseeker schemes, the Working Family Payment (WFP) is a tax free in-work support which provides an income top-up for low-earning employees with children.  Once awarded, WFP is generally payable for a minimum period of 52 weeks as long as the recipient continues to be engaged in paid employment as an employee for not less than 38 hours per fortnight with the same employer.

The foster care allowance is currently &euro;325 per week for a child under 12 years of age and &euro;352 per week for a child aged 12 years and over. It is paid in respect of the child and provided in order to allow foster carers to meet all of the child's daily living needs, including food, clothing, basic travel, education costs and hobbies and sports activities. The allowance is not considered as means for social welfare purposes, and is not subject to tax. <\/p>  <p>  If required, Tusla can also provide financial supports to foster carers through either additional or enhanced payments. Additional payments refers to any payment made to a foster carer that exceeds the standard rate of the fostering allowance. Such additional payments may be made in respect of children or young people who have additional needs that are not covered by the standardised fostering allowance. Additional payments can only be made where a child has additional medical or educational needs and when authorisation has been received from the Tusla Area Manager. Each application for an additional payment will be accompanied by supporting documentation evidencing the need.  <\/p>  <p>  Enhanced allowances for foster carers can be made when a longer term financial need is identified for additional supports for the child. A maximum of twice the weekly allowance may be paid in respect of children aged between 0-18 years if they require significant care over and above the needs of other children in foster care. This includes children who have been diagnosed with significant special needs and require a high level of personal care and supervision. The purpose of considering an enhanced allowance in these cases is to support foster carers in providing care to these children who have additional needs. <\/p>  <p>  You may be aware that Tusla are in the process of developing a Strategic Plan on Foster Care 2022-2025 and I am aware that Tusla has recently engaged with foster carers in a consultation to inform the development of the Plan.Through this consultation, foster carers highlighted the need for the foster care allowance to be reviewed in light of inflation and increases in social welfare allowances.

Tusla does not have a remit to intervene in ongoing third-party disputes such as the one outlined in this case, as the statutory powers of the Agency are limited solely to the regulation of ELC and SAC services, as prescribed by legislation.  <\/p>  <p>  Tusla noted that this matter is currently before the courts and on this basis it would not be appropriate to provide any additional comment on this individual case, pending the outcome of these proceedings. <\/p>  <p>  Tusla remains at the disposal of the service provider in this case, to assist in the progression of any matters in relation to the ongoing registration and regulation of the service in line with the relevant statutory requirements. Should the provider have any additional queries in this respect, these can be directed to Tusla&rsquo;s Early Years Inspectorate either by telephone on 061 461700, or by email at ey.reception@tusla.ie.<\/p>  <p>  The service provider may also wish to contact their local CCC to discuss what supports may be available to them.

I recognise that childminders are highly valued by many parents because of the home-from-home setting, their strong and lasting relationships, and the flexibility they can offer. Many families prefer to use childminders, while for some families, in areas where centre-based care is either not available or its opening hours do not match the family&rsquo;s childcare needs, childminding is the only option.<\/p>  <p>  The limitation of public funding schemes to Tusla-registered ELC and SAC providers helps to ensure that public funding is provided where there is assurance of the quality of provision. While only a small number of childminders are currently required to register with Tusla under the Child Care Act 1991, it is intended that the National Action Plan for Childminding 2021-2028 will result in the opening up of the National Childcare Scheme to a much wider cohort of childminders.<\/p>  <p>  The National Action Plan for Childminding 2021-2028, which I launched in April 2021, sets out a plan for extending State support and regulation to childminding on a phased basis over the coming years. The overall objective of the National Action Plan for Childminding is to improve access to high quality and affordable ELC and SAC through childminding.  <\/p>  <p>  To do this, the Action Plan sets out an incremental and supportive pathway to regulation. This will enable more childminders to access Government subsidies, making their services more affordable to parents. It will also enable them to access a variety of supports to assist them in meeting regulatory and quality requirements. The National Action Plan for Childminding commits to develop new childminder-specific regulations that are proportionate and appropriate to the home setting in which childminders work.  <\/p>  <p>  The Action Plan has a number of specific objectives including: <\/p>  <p>  - Enable a far greater number of parents who use childminders to benefit from subsidies under the National Childcare Scheme.  <\/p>  <p>  - Support quality assurance of childminders and safeguarding of children through extending the scope of regulation and inspection to all paid, non-relative childminders.   <\/p>  <p>  - Provide greater recognition of childminders and develop appropriate childminder regulations and inspection processes to reflect the home environment in which childminders work. <\/p>  <p>  - Provide a supportive, phased transition process, to facilitate the largest possible number of childminders to enter the regulated sector, the sphere of quality assurance, and access to Government subsidies, while recognising the time and supports required for this reform.   <\/p>  <p>  - Support retention and recruitment of childminders. <\/p>  <p>  Parents currently experiencing difficulty in relation to their ELC and SAC needs should contact their local City\/County Childcare Committee (CCC) for assistance.

Additional payments refers to any payment made to a foster carer that exceeds the standard rate of the fostering allowance.

Lists of all the approved institutions and the approved courses that each institution offers is also provided.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, there is a webpage dedicated to approved courses and institutions for undergraduate students which lists a number of institutions that provide courses offered through the CAO which are not eligible for SUSI funding.<\/p>  <p>  Apart from the information available on SUSI's website, representatives from SUSI also attend various events such as college Open Days and Higher Options events throughout the year, with the aim of meeting students and answering any questions they may have about the application process.

Otherwise, he\/she would be assessed as a dependent student, i.e. assessed with reference to parental income and address. <\/p>  <p>  A student&rsquo;s status for grant purposes is defined at their first point of entry to an approved further or higher education course or at their point of re-entry to an approved course following a break in studies of at least three years, and continues to apply for the duration of their studies. <\/p>  <p>  However, there are points at which a student may reclassify from a dependent student to an independent student.

The relevant information, including details of parental income, would be required by SUSI to determine grant eligibility as a dependent student. <\/p>  <p>  Apart from the Student Grant Scheme, students in third-level institutions experiencing exceptional financial need can apply for support under the Student Assistance Fund (SAF). Students can apply for the SAF to help with either temporary or ongoing financial difficulties and can be assisted towards their rent, childcare costs, transport costs, medical costs and books\/class materials. This Fund is administered on a confidential, discretionary basis and assists students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances. Details of this fund are available from the Access Office in the third level institution attended.<\/p>  <p>  The Fund for Students with Disabilities (FSD) supports participation by students with a disability in further and higher education.  The aim is to ensure that students can participate fully in education, or on an equal basis with their peers.  The Disability Officers actively promote the ethos of inclusive learning for all students. Recently the FSD has also been used for projects to develop strategic disability services in HEIs and supports for students. Examples include inclusive design in teaching and learning, improving online teaching and learning practices, staff training, improving campus experience for students with disabilities, assistive technology supports and autism-friendly spaces.<\/p>  <p>  I would also encourage students to review information on the student assistant fund, the fund for students with Disabilities and other financial supports available at www.studentfinance.ie and to contact their Access Office in the third level institution attended for details of any further supports.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092700089#WRU04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1624"},{"type":"question","counter":1072,"qnumday":364,"qnumall":"[47079\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092700089#WRU04200","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if a review will be considered for a person (details supplied) given the change in pension contributions; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1521","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","counter":1073,"content":"<p>Under the terms of the Student Grant Scheme, grant assistance is awarded to students attending an approved course in an approved institution who meet the prescribed conditions of funding, including those relating to nationality, residency, progression, previous academic attainment and means. <\/p>  <p>  The student referred to by the Deputy was awarded 50% rate of Student Contribution. <\/p>  <p>  I understand there has been ongoing engagement between SUSI and the student.

Reforms will be developed with a supportive approach to businesses, and the interests of public health, consumers and communities will be central to implementation.<\/p>  <p>  Work on the consolidation and reform of the licensing laws and the drafting of the General Scheme is advancing well. This is a reform on which there are many views across society, and the legislation needs to be informed by those views.<\/p>  <p>  Last November, the Minister launched a wide-ranging consultation to seek the views of the public on the modernisation of Ireland&rsquo;s licensing laws.

That webinar can be viewed on the Department&rsquo;s YouTube channel via the following link: youtu.be\/0tMtKzd_9jA .<\/p>  <p>  It is intended to progress this legislation in the months ahead.

The inclusion of diabetes as one of four chronic diseases in respect of which GMS patients receive ongoing, planned care from their GP through the Chronic Disease Management Programme also represents a major step forward in assisting those living with diabetes to manage their condition.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092700094#WRZ03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medicinal Products","counter":1299,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092700094#WRZ03500"},{"type":"question","counter":1300,"qnumday":442,"qnumall":"[46630\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092700094#WRZ03600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if funding for the cystic fibrosis drug kaftrio will be made available for children once they turn six years of age;

These are provided through community services known as Community Funded Schemes and play a key role in assisting and supporting people to maintain everyday functioning, and to remain living in their homes and local community. Each Community Health Organisation (CHO) operates processes for the allocation of funding for medical and surgical aids and appliances. Each application within a CHO is assessed by the local Resource Allocation Group and a determination is made regarding approval based on clinical priority and the funding availability within local budgets.<\/p>  <p>  The Long-Term Illness (LTI) scheme was established under Section 59(3) of the Health Act 1970 (as amended). Regulations were made in 1971, 1973 and 1975, prescribing 16 illnesses covered by the scheme. These are: acute leukaemia; mental handicap; cerebral palsy; mental illness (in a person under 16); cystic fibrosis; multiple sclerosis; diabetes insipidus; muscular dystrophies; diabetes mellitus; parkinsonism; epilepsy; phenylketonuria; haemophilia; spina bifida; hydrocephalus; and conditions arising from the use of Thalidomide.<\/p>  <p>  Under the LTI scheme, patients receive drugs, medicines, and medical and surgical appliances directly related to the treatment of their illness, free of charge. The LTI scheme will be included as part of a review of the current eligibility framework, including the basis for existing hospital and medication charges, to be carried out under commitments given in the Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Strategy.<\/p>  <p>  In the meantime, for people who are not eligible for the LTI scheme, there are other arrangements which protect them from excessive medical costs.<\/p>  <p>  Under the Drug Payment Scheme, no individual or family pays more than &euro;80 a month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines. The scheme significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals with ongoing expenditure on medicines.<\/p>  <p>  People who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be eligible for a medical card. In accordance with the provisions of the Health Act 1970 (as amended), eligibility for a medical card is determined by the HSE. Medical card eligibility is primarily based on an assessment of means and is not granted on the basis of any particular condition.<\/p>  <p>  In certain circumstances the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds the income guidelines, where he or she faces difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from illness. In circumstances where an applicant is still over the income limit for a medical card, they are then assessed for a GP visit card, which entitles the applicant to GP visits without charge.<\/p>  <p>  For persons experiencing difficulty paying their electricity costs, financial assistance may be available through the Supplementary Welfare Allowance (SWA) Scheme administered by the Department of Social Protection. Further information on the type of SWA payments available can be found here: www.gov.ie\/en\/collection\/d5554-supplementary-welfare-allowance\/. <\/p>  <p>  Finally, individuals may also be entitled to claim tax relief on the cost of their medical expenses, including medicines prescribed by a doctor, dentist, or consultant.

Following consultation, my Department sanctioned additional resources to deal with the backlog. These have been in place for some time now and timelines for processing applications have significantly reduced. <\/p>  <p>  In 2021 there were 4,546 applications from overseas nurses and midwives and, based on current trends, the NMBI estimates that it will receive just over 5,256applications in 2022.<\/p>  <p>  So far in 2022, NMBI has issued 4,523 Decision Letters to overseas applicants. This is higher than the number issued during the full year of 2021 (2,430) and NMBI expects to have issued about 5,500 by year-end, which will be more than double the 2021 total. A Decision Letter is a key milestone for applicants and usually ( 98% of cases) includes an instruction for the applicant to go through a &lsquo;compensation measure&rsquo; to allow them to demonstrate their clinical skills in terms of meeting the standard required in Ireland set by NMBI.  <\/p>  <p>  Approximately 80% of nurses and midwives pass their required compensation measures (either an adaptation period or an aptitude test) and convert to a registrant within six months of their decision letter being issued. Following registration, they can join the nursing and midwifery workforce.<\/p>  <p>  In the period up to January 2022, 95% of initial applications received by NMBI were incomplete applications. This increases the lead in time for registration as time is lost while individuals gather (and supply to NMBI) the necessary documents and information which had not been supplied initially. As of the end of August 2022, only 55% of applications were incomplete at the point of submission, which is a substantial improvement.<\/p>  <p>  The NMBI continues to work with key agencies and stakeholders as part of its role in supporting applicants, including aiming to further reduce the number of incomplete applications received.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to assisting applicants, the NMBI&rsquo;s approach is to reduce the timeframe in responding to incomplete submissions, thereby speeding up the process. Currently, these applications are assessed within 4 days of submission and applications that require re-assessment are reviewed within 5 days of receiving the additional necessary documents or information which had been sought from applicants. Once again this is a significant improvement since January 2022.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware the NMBI has a number of statutory obligations to protect the public in its dealings with nurses and midwives and to protect the integrity of the practice of the professions of nursing and midwifery. Maintaining a high level of scrutiny in the assessment of applications is an essential element of this protection.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092700098#WRDD01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Appointments Status","counter":1471,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092700098#WRDD01400"},{"type":"question","counter":1472,"qnumday":499,"qnumall":"[46894\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092700098#WRDD01500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if an appointment with a specialist will be expedited for a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1487","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1473,"content":"<p>Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.

The DPS is not means tested and is available to anyone normally resident in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  The DPS threshold was reduced twice in 2022; to &euro;100 per month as of 1 January 2022, and to &euro;80 per month as of 1 March 2022. The DPS significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals with ongoing expenditure on medicines.<\/p>  <p>  People who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be eligible for a medical card under the General Medical Services (GMS) scheme. In accordance with the provisions of the Health Act 1970 (as amended), eligibility for a medical card is determined by the HSE. In certain circumstances, the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds the income guidelines, where he or she faces difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from illness.<\/p>  <p>  In circumstances where an applicant is still over the income limit for a medical card, they are then assessed for a GP visit card. Since 2015, every individual aged 70 and over has automatic eligibility for a GP visit card.<\/p>  <p>  On 1 November 2020, prescription charges under the GMS scheme were reduced as follows:<\/p>  <p>  - For persons over 70, the charges were reduced to &euro;1 per item with a maximum monthly charge of &euro;10 per person or family per month.<\/p>  <p>  - For persons under 70, the charges were reduced to &euro;1.50 per item with a maximum monthly charge of &euro;15 per person or family.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to this change, the weekly gross medical card income thresholds for those aged 70 and over were increased to &euro;550 per week for a single person and &euro;1,050 for a couple. This increase ensures that a greater proportion of those aged 70 and over now qualify for a medical card. <\/p>  <p>  It is also important to note that the DPS is deliberately designed as a simple universal non-means tested scheme which is in place to protect those who do not qualify for a medical card from excessive medical costs. There is a process around means testing for medical cards which requires the HSE to consider hardship and inability to pay for required health care when making determinations around eligibility.

The role of a pharmacist is a significant and responsible one, and patients must be assured that pharmacists are capable of providing a safe and effective pharmacy service. <\/p>  <p>  The PSI operates three routes of recognition\/registration depending on where the pharmacy qualification has first been acquired &ndash; the national route, EU route and non-EU (third country qualification recognition - TCQR) route under established processes based in Irish and EU law, and cognisant of obligations emanating from Community Membership, and other legislative frameworks including Equality legislation. Currently, each individual applicant going through the TCQR process has the qualification presented assessed through a defined process, which may\/may not include the requirement for completion of a period of adaptation, based on the outcome of the individual&rsquo;s performance in an Equivalence Examination, and conducted on behalf of the PSI by a third party, currently UCC. <\/p>  <p>  The PSI has recognised that its Third Country route of qualification recognition and registration is complex for applicants and is currently in a process to review it so that it is more streamlined and easier to navigate, with the aim being to have an improved TCQR route in place.  This is a strategic project being progressed as part of the PSI Service Plan for 2022. <\/p>  <p>  My Department has professionally qualified pharmacists among its staff and does not have plans to appoint a chief pharmaceutical officer at the present time.

In line with the Act and the national framework agreed with industry, a company must submit an application to the HSE to have a new medicine added to the formal Reimbursement list. Reimbursement is for licensed indications which have been granted market authorisation by the European Medicines Agency or the Health Products Regulatory Authority.<\/p>  <p>  In making a relevant reimbursement decision, the HSE is required under the Act to have regard to a number of criteria including efficacy, the health needs of the public, cost effectiveness and potential or actual budget impact. The Reimbursement list is the same for the General Medical Services (GMS) scheme and the Drug Payment Scheme (DPS). <\/p>  <p>  The DPS provides for the refund of the amount by which expenditure on approved prescribed medicines or medical and surgical appliances exceeds a named threshold in any calendar month. The DPS is not means tested and is available to anyone normally resident in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  Some hormone replacement therapy (HRT) medications are available to medical card holders under the GMS scheme, subject to the statutory prescription charge. These same HRT medications are also available under the DPS, which ensures that no individual or family pays more than &euro;80 a month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines. The DPS significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals with ongoing expenditure on medicines.<\/p>  <p>  People who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be eligible for a medical card. In accordance with the provisions of the Health Act 1970 (as amended), eligibility for a medical card is determined by the HSE. In certain circumstances the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds the income guidelines, where he or she faces difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from illness. In circumstances where an applicant is still over the income limit for a medical card, they are then assessed for a GP visit card, which entitles the applicant to GP visits without charge.<\/p>  <p>  Individuals may also be entitled to claim tax relief on the cost of their medical expenses. This includes medicines prescribed by a doctor, dentist, or consultant. Relief is at the standard tax rate of 20%.<\/p>  <p>  Progressing women&rsquo;s health is a priority for this government.

This Action Plan provides the foundation to address women&rsquo;s whole health and help ensure that action on women&rsquo;s health looks beyond reproductive health to make a real difference to women&rsquo;s lives. For example, on 28th April 2022, I allocated up to &euro;2.5 million of the Women&rsquo;s Health Fund to priority areas within the Women&rsquo;s Health Action Plan, including menopause. Six menopause clinics nationwide will be open by end 2022. This is two more than was envisaged at the time of publication.
