I know that he is busy today and it is very much appreciated.<\/p> <p>In recent years, the death knell of local media has been sounded time and time again.  However, just as video did not kill the radio star, the demise of newspapers does not have to be a foregone conclusion.  Irish newspapers are the voice of the people, their communities and their regions.  They are the fourth estate.  A fully functioning fourth estate enhances the free and democratic society in which we live.  However, good journalism is under threat.  Censorship, economic pressure, job insecurity and a lack of political will to meet any of these challenges head on is resulting in an uncertain future for journalism.  NewsBrands Ireland and Local Ireland, which represent national and local newspapers respectively, are leading the charge for a seismic change in how the newspaper industry is supported in Ireland.  The newspaper industry has invested in innovation to ensure it always remains connected with its readers.  However, more needs to be done and the onus for taking action must lie with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.<\/p> <p>Ireland is currently an outlier within the European Union in respect of government action in support of independent journalism.  We have one of the highest percentages of value-added tax, VAT, at 9%.  The VAT rate for digital products is 23%, which is ironic when we consider the focus of Government in recent years and the importance of the digital economy.  In comparison, the VAT rate on printed newspapers in the United Kingdom is set at 0%.  The Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment can use his office to ask the Minister for Finance to reduce the VAT rate to 5% on printed and digital products and, ultimately, reduce it to 0% when EU rules allow him to do so.  <\/p> <p>Ireland's defamation laws and the two bodies which police them are from a bygone era.  They were set up before the advent of online media reporting.  While I understand the responsibility for this lies with the Minister for Justice and Equality and his Department and that a single oversight body for all media, including online media, is being considered by the Government, it would be useful to have the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment involved in any reform of these laws.<\/p> <p>I attempted to have statements on the newspaper industry taken in the House.  However, I was told in no uncertain terms by a number of Departments that newspapers were not under their remit and that, as far as they were concerned, they did not come under the remit of any Department.  This needs to change.<\/p> <p>Extending the remit of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment to cover print and online journalism similarly to the way it covers broadcasting and having a dedicated official within the Department to oversee this would be ways in which independent journalism could be supported.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Diarmuid Wilson:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2017\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2017&amp;amp;pid=DiarmuidWilson&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=19\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> As I am sure the Minister is aware, we have recently seen an exodus of fantastic journalists, some of whom have joined Ministers and Departments and are using their skills in other areas of the economy.  Poor salaries, no career opportunities, more pressure in the 24-7 news cycle, fewer resources and no support are leading to a brain drain from the industry.  Establishing a news publishers media fund that would drive innovation and investment, coupled with a training and support scheme for all journalists, would encourage quality journalism and make the industry a sustainable and enduring one for all involved.  We need more than a bursary for local broadcasters; we need to show our support for all journalists and the important role they play in our society.  I thank the Minister again for coming to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018091900002#B00300","speaker":"1418","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1537363800,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this matter.  These issues, among others, have also been raised by NewsBrands and Local Ireland as part of their Journalism Matters campaign.<\/p> <p>The composition of Departments and their remits are matters solely for An Taoiseach.  Therefore, the extension of my Department&rsquo;s remit and the appointment of an official to take responsibility for all elements of the media are not matters on which I can respond.  Aspects of policy responsibility in regard to matters that affect the media are currently shared by a range of Departments.  Let me give some examples to illustrate this point.  Defamation law is a matter for the Department of Justice and Equality.  Policy on taxation, specifically VAT, is the responsibility of the Department of Finance.  Responsibility for policy on culture is the responsibility of the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  I have responsibility for broadcasting policy and policy on media plurality.  The latter role can involve print media or newspapers as they may be parties to a proposed merger.  Upon receiving notification from prospective parties, which must first receive the approval of the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission on competition grounds, my Department carries out an assessment as to whether the transaction is contrary to the public interest in protecting the plurality of media in the State.<\/p> <p>As the Senator may be aware, the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland is the independent regulator established under the Broadcasting Act 2009 to regulate traditional or linear television and radio broadcasters in Ireland.  The basis for the regulation of television broadcasting is provided for in the European audiovisual media services directive, a review of which will be finalised before the end of the year.  This revision will require member states to increase the level of oversight in place for non-linear or on-demand television providers, such as Netflix and RT&Eacute; Player.  Member states will also be required, for the first time, to require video-sharing platform services established in their territory, such as YouTube, to ensure that users, especially minors, are protected from the most harmful content.  This is to be achieved through co-regulation.  Once the finalised version of the directive is published, Ireland will have 21 months to implement the required changes.  Preparatory work is under way within my Department.  Once the text has been finalised, public consultation will be held to inform our approach to implementation.<\/p> <p>I recognise the importance of independent journalism and the vital role it plays in our society and in supporting our democracy by providing access to accurate, high-quality and relevant information to citizens throughout the country.  As I have outlined, my remit does not extend to all aspects of media policy but I have specific responsibilities regarding the broadcasting media.  In recognition of the important role and challenges faced by many local and community radio broadcasters, I am proposing, as part of the broadcasting (amendment) Bill 2017, to introduce a new funding scheme to offer bursaries to journalists working in these stations.  The Bill is currently being drafted by the Parliamentary Counsel and I hope to publish and commence the legislation in both Houses of the Oireachtas as soon as possible.<\/p> <p>Separately, the European Commission, as part of its initiative to tackle online disinformation, has announced that it will introduce measures to support quality journalism across member states.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Denis Naughten:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=809\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=809&amp;amp;pid=DenisNaughten&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=19\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The Commission has proposed to member states that a specific allocation should be made in the fund under the Creative Europe programme 2021-27 to support enhancing a free, diverse and pluralistic media environment, quality journalism and media literacy.

On 3 August 1923, the new Irish State passed the Defence Forces Act, which raised an armed force to be called &Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann, comprising such numbers of officers, non-commissioned officers and men as may from time to time be provided by the Oireachtas, the new Parliament of the Irish Free State.  Ever since that time, the men and women of &Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann have served the State loyally and bravely, and they deserve our support.  Earlier I proudly took part in the respect and loyalty march because I support better pay for the Defence Forces.  We owe them not only our respect but also a fair living.  There is no need to rehearse the litany of great work they do at home and abroad, their dignity in times of ceremony, their empathy in times of community distress or the bravery they showed over the decades of attack by the dark forces of the paramilitaries.  I have done that a dozen times in the House.<\/p> <p>I do not argue we need to pay members of the Defence Forces more to compete with other careers in the economy now that we are approaching full employment.  I call for better pay and conditions for one reason only: they deserve it - no more, no less.  There is no point in us continuing to blame Fianna F&aacute;&iacute;l.  While the party caused the mess, Fine Gael is in government now and it is up to us to do what we have always done throughout the history of this State, which is to do the right thing for the men and women of &Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann, and the right thing for the country.  <\/p> <p>Will the Taoiseach and Minister for Defence and the Minister of State with direct responsibility for this issue, Deputy Kehoe, shake off the reticence of the bureaucrats in the Department and ensure that men and women of the Defence Forces get a fair day's pay for a fair day's work?  The fact that significant numbers of them have to rely on family income support is unacceptable.  We must make work pay.  Military life is tough and requires many sacrifices from those who serve and from their loved ones.  They know this when they enlist but they should not have to make sacrifices on a basic standard of living to serve their country.  Members of the Army, the Navy and the Air Corps should get the same rate of pay as a civilian in a comparable job.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Gabrielle McFadden:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2399\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2399&amp;amp;pid=GabrielleMcFadden&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=19\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->On top of that, they deserve additional payment to compensate for the extra challenges they face as serving personnel, such as time away from family, unsociable hours and working under pressure.<\/p><p>These are the people who get up early in the morning, work long hours, nights and weekends and serve us with loyalty and professionalism.

I ask him to fight for the resources necessary to implement an increase in this allowance as part of this year's budget.  I ask him to call for an immediate report from the Public Service Pay Commission, whose job it is to establish whether, and to what extent, a difficulty exists in terms of recruitment and retention of specific sectors of the public service and to make proposals to Government for appropriate remuneration.  We want this now.<\/p><p>In the case of the Defence Forces, the difficulties are clear.  We have had the findings of the workplace climate in Defence Forces study for some time now and, in the interim period, personnel are voting with their feet.  They are walking away.  The solution is clear: pay people enough to make military service an attractive career option.  It is that simple.  For almost 100 years, the Defence Forces stood up for us and now it is time for us to stand up for them.

I have never questioned the loyalty or bravery of any member of the Defence Forces if he or she is serving overseas or serving here in Ireland and facing whatever issue they have to respond to.  The Government values each member and the roles that members of the Defence Forces carry out along with members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and other State agencies.  For this reason, the Government has tasked the Public Sector Pay Commission to examine recruitment and retention issues in the Defence Forces.  That process is under way and submissions have been made.  The commission is engaging with individual serving members of the Irish Defence Forces.<\/p> <p>Public service pay and pensions are a significant component of Government expenditure.  Similar to other areas within the public service, the pay of the Permanent Defence Force, PDF, was reduced during the financial crisis.  The reduction in pay was on a graduated basis with increased rates of deductions for those on higher earnings.  These actions were one of the measures necessary to be taken to stabilise the financial situation which the country faced following the economic collapse.<\/p> <p>Improvements within the economy provided the opportunity to begin the unwinding of the public service pay cuts imposed on public servants, including members of the Defence Forces.  The Defence Forces' pay is continuing to increase in line with other public sector pay agreements.  The Permanent Defence Force representative associations balloted their members who voted to accept the terms of the pay agreements.  The focus of these increases is weighted in favour of those on lower pay.<\/p> <p>Members of the Defence Forces received increases in pay in 2017 under the Lansdowne Road agreement.  In addition, in a separate deal agreed with the Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Representative Association, PDFORRA, the pay of general service recruits and privates who joined the Permanent Defence Force from 1 January 2013 was increased further.<\/p> <p>The Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020 provides further increases in pay, ranging from 6.2% to 7.4% over the lifetime of the agreement, with the focus of the agreement once again being on the lower paid.  The first increase due under the agreement from 1 January 2018 has been paid to Permanent Defence Force personnel and a second increase of 1% on annualised salaries is due on 1 October 2018, which we will see shortly.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Paul Kehoe:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1805\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1805&amp;amp;pid=PaulKehoeFG&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=19\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->By the end of the current public service pay agreement the pay of all public servants, including members of the Defence Forces, earning under &euro;70,000 per annum will be restored to pre-FEMPI levels.  The restoration of cuts to allowances will also be considered in the context of the agreement.<\/p><p>Basic pay and military service allowance are only an element of the overall income package for members of the PDF.  Members of the Defence Forces also receive a range of duty allowances depending on their assigned tasks.  Almost half of the PDF personnel receive additional technical pay per week.  The rate of technical pay ranges from &euro;420 to &euro;7,000 extra each year depending on the job of the individual member.  When these allowances, excluding overseas peace support allowance, are added to basic pay, the current average gross income for a private three star and Naval Service equivalent is just over &euro;35,000 per year.  The average annual gross income for a sergeant is just under &euro;45,000.  In the officer ranks, the average annual gross income is &euro;52,800 per annum for captains and &euro;88,000 for colonels.<\/p><p>Defence Force personnel are also entitled receive to tax-free overseas allowances while participating in overseas military operations on direction of the Government.  The number of personnel serving overseas has increased over the past number of years.  As of 1 September 2018, Ireland is contributing 621 Defence Forces personnel to nine missions throughout the world.<\/p><p>Given the unique and demanding nature of military life, there is understandably a relatively high level of turnover among Defence Forces personnel.  This is not new and the PDF has always had a level of turnover that far exceeds other areas of the public service.  The total number who have left the Defence Forces in recent years is consistent with long term trends.<\/p><p>The Government is committed to maintaining the establishment of the PDF at 9,500 personnel and recognises that a key challenge for the Defence Forces is to reach and maintain this strength.  Recruitment competitions have been held this year for general service, cadetships, apprentices and direct entries.  The applications from these various competitions are being progressed and successful candidates are being inducted.  Another general service recruitment competition is currently in process.<\/p><p>In 2016, the Government established an independent Public Service Pay Commission to provide objective analysis and advice on the most appropriate pay levels for the public service, including the Defence Forces.  This informed the most recent pay agreement.<\/p><p>Under my direction, the Department of Defence raised recruitment and retention issues as part of the submission to the commission.  The Government has tasked the commission with examining these challenges in the defence sector in more detail.  This work has commenced and the Department of Defence has submitted detailed material.  In consultation with the senior management of the Defence Forces, the commission has commenced surveying members of the Defence Forces and is being facilitated in this work by military management.<\/p><p>In addition, there is an ongoing programme of HR development within the Defence Forces.  A number of initiatives ranging from a review of the conciliation and arbitration scheme, a review of the criteria governing contracts for enlisted personnel and a comprehensive skills gap analysis to the implementation of the Working Time Directive have been initiated.  Measures to improve the work-life balance for members of the Defence Forces have also been advanced.<\/p><p>The Government continues to demonstrate its commitment to ensuring that the Defence Forces are equipped and trained to best international standards to meet operational requirements, both at home and abroad.  The budget allocation for 2018 delivered an additional &euro;25 million.  An additional &euro;98 million for capital expenditure has been provided out to 2021.<\/p><p>These measures address a range of issues that are aimed at ensuring the Defence Forces retain the capabilities to undertake the roles assigned by Government and remain a career of choice for anyone who wants to work in a challenging and varied environment which provides opportunities for lifelong learning and self-development.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018091900002#E00200","speaker":"1365","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1537363800,"counter":22,"content":"<p>We normally allow eight minutes for these but 13 minutes have elapsed.

Exactly how much has been saved by the school transport cuts over the years?  School transport is becoming less and less viable.  The original intention was to get rid of school transport.  We are now making it impossible for families and students to get on the school bus.  We have to remember that school transport is an integral part of the education system.

I have already spoken to the Minister of State on the matter.  In Limerick, we have an issue in the Caherconlish, Ballyneety, Donaghmore and Fedamore area, which is outside Limerick city.  Students of the local school, John the Baptist community school in Hospital, are unable to get school transport.  We have a unique set of circumstances.  We have a common application system in Limerick city for schools.  Through a quirk of fate the distance from Caherconlish, Ballyneety, Donaghmore and Fedamore to the GPO in Limerick city is marginally shorter than the distance to the local school, John the Baptist community school in Hospital.  If students applied to schools in Limerick city under the common application system, in most cases they would not satisfy the eligibility criteria.  Therefore, I am asking the Minister of State to encourage and facilitate the school transport system in Limerick city and county to look at this matter.<\/p> <p>At present there are 20 students who can use the bus on a concessionary basis but they are without a bus.  Ten of those are concessions that were on the bus previously.  Two of the ten have been there for the past five years and are going into sixth year.

In most cases they would not be eligible for school places elsewhere.  I ask the Minister of State to facilitate the solution being considered to get these 20 children to their school places.

I will provide an outline of the extent of the school transport service which very many people may not be aware of.  It is a significant operation managed by Bus &Eacute;ireann on behalf of the Department.  In 2017 and 2018, over 117,000 children, including 12,000 with special educational needs, were transported in over 4,500 vehicles on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country, covering over 100 million kilometres, with a total cost in 2017 of &euro;190 million.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy John Halligan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2315\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2315&amp;amp;pid=JohnHalligan&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=19\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Parental contributions towards the cost of school transport amounted to &euro;15.4 million, so the State covers a significant cost of school transport and it increases every year.  Children are generally eligible for school transport if they satisfy the distance criteria and are attending their nearest school.  Children who are eligible for school transport and who have completed the application process on time have been accommodated on school transport services for the current year, where such services are in operation.  Children who are eligible for school transport but for whom no transport service is available may, following an application for transport within the prescribed time limits, receive a remote area grant towards the cost of private transport.  That grant is calculated on miles, just like for civil servants.  Children who are not eligible for school transport may apply for transport where spare seats are available, after eligible children have been accommodated.  This is referred to as concessionary transport.  Where the number of ineligible children exceeds the number of spare seats available, Bus &Eacute;ireann will allocate tickets for the spare seats using an agreed selection process.  Under the terms of the scheme the number of spare seats varies from year to year, based on the capacity of the buses running on all of the various routes and the number of eligible children accommodated on each route.  Hence, there is no guarantee that a non-eligible child who received a place the previous year will do so the following year, nor is there a guarantee that a sibling of the non-eligible child in receipt of a ticket will also do so.  It is included in the terms and conditions on the Bus &Eacute;ireann online application form that available seats may vary from year to year and that the transport of children who are not eligible cannot be guaranteed for the duration of the child's education.<\/p><p>Routes cannot be altered under the scheme and nor will additional vehicles will be introduced.  Neither larger vehicles nor extra trips using existing vehicles will be provided to cater for children who are not eligible, as additional State costs would be incurred by covering the cost of providing school transport for children who are eligible for it.<\/p><p>It is important to remember, and I say this to everybody, that the school transport scheme was put in place for eligible children and for children with special needs.  All eligible children in Ireland get school transport.  Now and then there may be a click in the system and something might happen with Bus &Eacute;ireann or something might fall through the cracks, but we are dealing with 117,000 children.  All special needs children get school transport.  It is one of the best schemes in Europe.  An independent assessment showed that for a maximum of &euro;300 per year in primary school and a maximum of &euro;600 in secondary school, the cost per family of taking the car to drive children to school would amount to &euro;1,200.  This came from two independent reviews.  We have not increased the cost of transport.  Our difficulty lies in the fact that we started some years ago with 700 concessionary places for children and we are now up to 24,700, whom we find it extremely difficult to get on to the school buses when we factor in all of the eligible children and the children with disabilities who are entitled to school transport.  That is how complicated and difficult the scheme is.<\/p><p>When one looks at it, 99% of people are happy with school transport and 99% of families will say that this is a great scheme.  It is not without its faults, however, with so many children involved and the complexity of running such a scheme every day of the week, twice per day, to and from schools and with 4,000 vehicles across the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018091900002#H00300","speaker":"1351","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1537363800,"counter":40,"content":"<p>Can we speak here?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018091900002#J00200","speaker":"1374"},{"type":"speech","time":1537363800,"counter":41,"content":"<p>It will have to be very brief because we are miles over time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018091900002#J00300","speaker":"1381"},{"type":"speech","time":1537363800,"counter":42,"content":"<p>I will be very brief.

Conscious of time, I will be brief.  I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, to the House although I had requested that the Minister, Deputy Harris, come to the House to make a statement on the closure of the paediatric inpatient service at the National Rehabilitation Hospital, NRH, in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  I have rehearsed this saga and related issues since January 2017.  Today, I call on the Minister for Health, whom I am somewhat surprised is not here, although I acknowledge and accept he is a busy man, to explain why the NRH has not been provided with the necessary staffing, resources and specialist supports that are required to enable it to provide a safe and appropriate level of rehabilitative care to patients up to its full bed capacity and to commit to an immediate reopening of the 12 bed closures at this hospital.<\/p> <p>Today, there are 12 beds closed in this hospital.  The NRH provides a comprehensive range of specialist rehabilitation services to patients from throughout the island of Ireland, who as a result of accident, illness or injury have acquired a physical or cognitive disability and require specialist rehabilitation.  The NRH in D&uacute;n Laoghaire has advised me that it has a multitude of programmes, including the brain injury programme, including strokes; the spinal cord system and care programme; the prosthetic, orthotic and limb absence rehabilitation programme - better known as the POLAR programme; paediatric and family-centre rehabilitation.  It is on paediatric beds and consultants that I would like to dwell in the time available to me.<\/p> <p>The Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, is aware of the situation, which I know because during my engagement today with the hospital I was advised that his Department had sought clarification on the matter yesterday.  On 30 August 2018, a statement was issued relating to the closure of the paediatric inpatient service at the National Rehabilitation Hospital.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Victor Boyhan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2463\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2463&amp;amp;pid=VictorBoyhan&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=19\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->On top of all of the other problems we have had in this hospital with closures, lack of resources for staff, patients, patients' families, the people queuing up and all the patients waiting in acute hospital beds, no Minister can stand over what is happening there.  I really do not want any more lame excuses from anyone in the Department of Health.  I have contacted the Minister's office throughout the summer offering to take up his initial invitation to me to meet him to discuss the NRH.  He has not yet responded with a firm date to meet.  That is disappointing to me and is perhaps a measure of the lack of commitment to and focus on the National Rehabilitation Hospital in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  It disappoints me to have to say that.  In summary, the hospital says in this statement that it wishes to restore the much-needed paediatric cover for this hospital to allow it to get on with providing inpatient services and to resume as early as possible.  In January 2017 the hospital had 12 beds closed.  Despite promises to open them we confirmed in July that six had been opened.  In August, another six beds to do with the inpatient paediatric services closed.  It is unacceptable.  The patients are unhappy.  I have indicated to politicians in the constituency of D&uacute;n Laoghaire, members of all parties and none, that there will be a series of public rallies and meetings which I will lead to get a focus on this.  I have been very patient - and I think every Member of this House will vouch for that - in consistently raising this issue but I am getting a closed door.  Patients are disappointed but more importantly, so are the families.  The final issue is that we have patients waiting in acute hospital beds to avail of the excellent services in the National Rehabilitation Hospital.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018091900002#K01500","speaker":"1379","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1537363800,"counter":60,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Boyhan for raising this issue and for giving me an opportunity to respond.  The NRH in D&uacute;n Laoghaire in Dublin provides complex specialist rehabilitation services to patients who, as a result of an accident, illness or injury, have acquired a physical or cognitive disability and require specialist medical rehabilitation.  The hospital has a reputation for excellence, as Senator Boyhan said, and provides patients with every opportunity to meet their rehabilitation goals through personalised treatment plans delivered by consultant-led interdisciplinary teams expert in their fields.<\/p> <p>Services provided at the hospital include a paediatric programme which is delivered by a paediatric team based on campus with clinical oversight provided by a consultant paediatrician who is based off-campus at another hospital.  Until recently this consultant paediatric oversight had been provided by a paediatrician at Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin, whose contract includes a seven-hour clinical attachment to the NRH.  I am advised by the Health Service Executive, HSE, that the consultant paediatrician in question has recently gone on unplanned long-term leave and arising from this unforeseen development, Our Lady's Children's Hospital is not in a position to provide consultant oversight to the National Rehabilitation Hospital's paediatric programme.  In light of this, the NRH has reluctantly closed its inpatient paediatric service on the basis that it is not possible to appropriately assess and triage new paediatric referrals and medically manage paediatric patients without consultant paediatric input.  <\/p> <p>I am aware that the parents of children requiring inpatient and day care services at the NRH are very concerned and I assure them that all is being done by the HSE to address this situation.  The Children's hospital group has confirmed that officials have been working to identify another consultant paediatrician with an interest in disability to fill the vacancy to provide appropriate clinical paediatric oversight to the services provided in the NRH.  I understand that a meeting between officials in the HSE community healthcare organisation, CHO, 6, the NRH and the Children's hospital group is being arranged imminently to discuss possible options required to affect the resumption of a sustainable service as soon as possible.  In the interim, the paediatric team at the NRH will continue to carry out assessments and provide therapies and outpatient services to existing paediatric patients.  <\/p> <p>The Government recognised the excellent rehabilitation programme which the NRH delivers and the hospital's excellent patient outcomes.  A key priority at the moment is delivery of replacement accommodation at the hospital.  This development will see the existing ward accommodation replaced by a new fit-for-purpose ward accommodation block of 120 single en suite rooms with integrated therapy spaces, a new sports hall, a hydrotherapy unit and a temporary concourse, as well as clinical and ancillary spaces.

It is a stark reminder of how dangerous this type of weather is.  We must be especially vigilant when we are driving cars and on the roads.<\/p> <p>I join with others who have expressed support for the members of the Defence Forces and their families who gathered outside Leinster House earlier in support of better conditions and increased pay for those who serve in the Defence Forces.  I have raised this matter in the Chamber and many colleagues, especially Senators Craughwell, Wilson and Leyden, have raised on numerous occasions the standard of living and the meagre allowances paid to members of the Defence Forces.  Many female relatives of members of the Defence Forces have been vocal and they have not ceased in their campaign to ensure the standard of living for members improves.  It is a damning indictment of the Government that 30% of the Defence Forces' members are in receipt of family income support, FIS payments.  I call on the Minister to address this matter in the House; to make a proper statement on it and to put his money where his mouth is and forget about lip service.<\/p> <p>The second issue I wish to raise is BusConnects, a radical new proposal for Dublin Bus.  We all want better infrastructure and more investment in Dublin.  However, the current plan, although it has some benefits, including a more transparent and streamlined fare system, is causing massive anxiety for many people in the city, so much so that thousands of people have attended public meetings organised by Oireachtas Members regarding this plan, which is colloquially known as the \"bus disconnects plan\".   Bus routes in my constituency such as the 123 and 15A service St. James's Hospital and St. Luke's Hospital, which provide oncology services, but people will no longer have a direct route to these hospitals.  <\/p> <p>The current proposal seems to affect the elderly, the disabled and infirm.  It is not realistic for people who need to attend an appointment to wait and have to change buses once, if not twice, to go to hospital.  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport cannot hide behind the National Transport Authority, NTA.  The NTA reports to the Minister, the Minister is responsible to Government and the Government must report to the D&aacute;il.  I am glad this matter is being debated as we speak in the D&aacute;il.  My party has tabled a Private Members' motion on extending the consultation period and I hope the Minister accedes to that request.  It is important that we have a better bus service in Dublin but it must be the right service and bus users must be allowed to contribute to the consultation process.<\/p> <p>I wish to raise the proposed sale of the John Player site on the South Circular Road, a site that could house 600 people.  NAMA is putting this site for sale on the open market in the same week the Government launched its new land initiative plan, under which it proposes to buy houses on the private market.  The agency has been allowed to put this site on the open market yet it seems the Government is washing its hands of the process, saying that it cannot interfere with NAMA or the receiver.  This property is in the ownership of NAMA, and the Minister for Finance has responsibility for NAMA.  He should come to the House and explain the reason this site is being put up for sale on the open market.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018091900002#O00100","speaker":"1407"},{"type":"speech","time":1537363800,"counter":81,"content":"<p>I wish to draw attention to mental health in the workplace, especially following the VHI report on mental health in the corporate workplace.

These are troubling figures.  Just 16% of those surveyed said they were extremely satisfied with their lives, whereas 21% of people - essentially one in five - are extremely or very stressed.  In a recent case, a business executive who had been required to deal with out-of-hours work emails, including some at midnight, was awarded &euro;7,500.  This shows that technology in the workplace can increase the pressure on workers.  In many cases, this compounds the plight of workers who are terrified about not being able to pay their rent or make their mortgage repayments.<\/p><p>Many staff in this building know about the toll that workplace stress can take on employees' mental health.  I am asking the Seanad, and the Oireachtas as a whole, to show an example to employees here by taking up some of the advice of the VHI expert group.  For example, the expert group has suggested that resilience training should be provided to maintain employees' mental health.  I feel strongly that there should be flexible options.  I recently stayed in an apartment in town that overlooks some offices.  I was horrified to see people working until all times of the day and night.  The reality is that there is no flexibility, especially for young people and young parents.  I suggest that we should be showing flexibility to Oireachtas employees, for example by enabling them to work from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.  In some cases, they have to work until 10 p.m.  We should ensure their working conditions and working hours are flexible.

At least 57 children in counties Mayo and Galway are currently waiting for assessments.  This is more than unacceptable - it is in breach of the legislation.  These figures mask the reality that many parents have lost faith in the system and the long waiting lists.

I know that the Bill was meant to come into the D&aacute;il tonight and that it has been postponed until next week but I am seriously concerned about the Final Stages and how the alcohol industry has been working so hard over the summer months, making one last shameful attempt to weaken the Bill and to remove some of its key provisions.<\/p><p>My colleagues will remember that we agreed in the Seanad in November with cross party support, on amendments tabled by myself and Senator Nash, that cancer warnings would form a key part of this legislation.  This is important because public knowledge on the empirical, proven link between alcohol and fatal cancers is shockingly low.  People know that smoking causes cancer but the awareness is just not there with regard to alcohol.<\/p><p>We know from research in the UK that 90% of people do not know that alcohol increases the risk of cancer and we have a similar figure of 80% here in Ireland.  Those numbers aware of the link are shockingly low and the industry would like to keep them that way because it does not want people to know that alcohol causes cancer.<\/p><p>What is important is that we are not just talking about health issues caused by high levels of problem drinking, but by frequent, moderate use.  I want to emphasise that alcohol can cause cancer by moderate use.  People do not realise the effect it has and this is particularly worrying when it comes to cancer.  The Healthy Ireland survey data shows that only 27% of women and 16% of young women know that even one glass of wine a night can substantially increase the risk of contracting breast cancer.  Reasonable estimates say that this has resulted in about 350 cases of breast cancer a year.  I wonder what an industry lobbyist would say to a young woman dealing with a cancer diagnosis as a result.  I am sure they all have mothers, sisters and daughters.  Would they be happy that they fought so hard to resist reasonable awareness raising health warnings that could have prevented some of these cases?  This is about making sure that people have the information needed to make an informed decision and I ask the political parties to stand firm on this point, to put public awareness and health above profit.  I ask the Leader to reintroduce the Bill in this House as a matter of urgency once it has passed Final Stage in the D&aacute;il so that we can finally get it up to the Park and signed into law.

The eighth amendment is now officially removed from the Constitution and there is no further impediment in the way of legislating for abortion.<\/p> <p>We know that the Minister, Deputy Harris, has produced a very welcome Bill and I am anxious because I hear from the Joint Committee on Health proceedings this morning that there was some scepticism expressed at that committee by health professionals that it would be difficult to have the legislation and framework in place in time for women to be able to access reproductive health services in January.

I have been made aware by Trinity constituents of a very serious issue concerning linking of church attendance with school admission that has arisen in a particular school in Greystones, St. Patrick's national school, which has been named in the national media.  This has resulted in the resignation of the highly experienced and respected principal and a board member.  I believe that the manner in which the patron, the Church of Ireland, is engaging with this serious issue has raised serious concerns around the separation of church and State in our education system, concerns that are much broader than just one school.  I will put down a commencement matter in the Seanad next week specifically about this issue and this school.  I will ask that the Department of Education and Skills appoint an inspector or establish some other mechanism to investigate the matter fully and report to the Minister.  However, I also wish to raise this issue in a broader fashion and seek a debate on it in the Seanad Chamber.  It is part of a much bigger issue concerning the continued linkage of church and State within our schooling system.<\/p><p>As an example, we still have serious issues regarding religion within teacher training colleges.  For example, the new teacher training strand at Dublin City University, DCU, which I understand does not admit Catholics, requires 98 fewer Central Applications Office, CAO, points for admission than teacher training in other colleges.  There are some very serious issues in respect of teacher training mechanisms, the issue of patronage and how school admissions are run at particular levels.  I may be corrected on the issue of the DCU teacher training strand, but I understand there is an issue where priority is given to other religions.  It may not be the case that it does not admit Catholics, but there is an issue regarding admission of particular religions and lower CAO points requirements than for other teacher training courses.  I ask the Leader for a debate on this matter in due course.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018091900002#Q00200","speaker":"1402","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1537363800,"counter":88,"content":"<p>I too wish to join Senator Ardagh in passing our sympathies to the family of the lady in Galway who died in the horrific accident in which a caravan was blown off a cliff.<\/p> <p>I raise the fact that 52 people are currently on trolleys in University Hospital Limerick.

In particular, the plan does not take into consideration the needs of a rapidly expanding population in north County Dublin, where I live and which I represent.<\/p><p>It is clear that there needs to be a redesign of the bus network but one needs to consult the people who depend on the buses.  It is clear, particularly regarding north County Dublin, that the whole aim of the plan is to get people to use the trains but if one knew anything about commuter trains in north County Dublin one would realise they are operating at capacity.  They do not have the capacity to take extra passengers.  Many living in north County Dublin cannot access the trains because they live a significant distance from a train station.  By having the short period of consultation, the Government, with the NTA, is not taking into consideration the views of the people who use the bus service.<\/p><p>The new bus networks should be linking people and communities with places they want to go, such as universities, hospitals and the airport, not shopping centres.  I would really like the Minister to come to the Chamber as soon as possible to have a full, dedicated debate on the BusConnects plan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018091900002#R00400","speaker":"1376","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1537363800,"counter":92,"content":"<p>I echo the call made by Senator Bacik for a real debate on the report of the Commission of the Future of Policing in Ireland.

Morale among members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is low.  The self-esteem of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has been dented by recent events.  The proposals of Ms O'Toole and her group should be implemented rapidly.  Members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na - men and women - and civilian staff in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na should be given a very clear message that change is on the way and that the Government is 100% committed to this and that it will happen.<\/p> <p>Senator Bacik mentioned the referendum result and the fact that the challenge has finally gone through the courts, that the President had finally signed the legislation into law and that our Constitution is now changed.

We need to have a debate in this House.  If it goes the same way as the Patten commission on policing in Northern Ireland, it would be a huge success.  People do not realise that Mr. Chris Patten's grandfather came from Boyle in County Roscommon.  We are proud of Chris Patten and how he has handled himself, especially in the Brexit negotiations.<\/p> <p>Recently there was a housing protest in the north inner city of Dublin.  Commissioner Harris rightly said that the form of attire used by garda&iacute; was not correct.  Sometimes in this Seanad or even in politics more generally we need to be careful of how we criticise An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  My grandfather was one of the first garda&iacute;.  I am proud of the role they have played.  They have made mistakes but I am very much behind An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and politicians should be also.  The policing report will hopefully draw a line under what at times can be an easy go at members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  They do a tough job.  I recently saw that a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was attacked by a criminal gang while bringing his child to school.  We should be careful about these online threats on social media.  I would not like to be a garda and have people taking my photograph, putting it online and knowing where I live.

The really unconscionable part is that some 60% of the houses built on what was our land will be sold at market prices, completely out of the reach of the many.

It is great to see him here and I hope he enjoys his trip.<\/p><p>I raise the issue of school transport, which is one of the key issues in my part of the world, as, in many way, is the lack of changes in the structure itself.  There was a Commencement debate earlier on this issue.  I listened intently to the debate on the key issues for school transport and how we need to address a major change in that structure.  We are seeing an increase in the population going to school and concessionary tickets are fading away and because of that students in my part of the world are not getting buses.  That is becoming a huge issue.  In my own parish of Minane Bridge, students are not getting buses and these were students who traditionally got the school bus.  We need to have a complete review of the structure, how it is set up, and these 314 districts regarding school education itself.  For that to change, we need to look at our general approach.  We need to put a service in place where the vast majority of students have the opportunity to get a school bus.  That is not happening at the moment.  The stress that is caused to parents, pupils and the entire community because of that is a huge issue.<\/p><p>The other issue is not knowing whether one will get a place on the bus.  I know of people who, in the first week of September, were waiting for the phone call to say their son or daughter was going to be on the bus.  In one case, the parents got a phone call to say that their son was being taken off the bus, which was totally unacceptable.  I propose we invite the Minister with responsibility for school transport to the Seanad, have at least a two hour debate and thrash out these issues.  Unless there is a new policy and budget in place, we will miss an opportunity to ensure young people can go to secondary and primary school on the school bus which is a basic right.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018091900002#T00700","speaker":"1386","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1537363800,"counter":103,"content":"<p>I join with Senator Lombard in welcoming the Cathaoirleach of Monaghan County Council, Councillor David Maxwell, and his family to the Chamber.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018091900002#U00200","speaker":"1381"},{"type":"speech","time":1537363800,"counter":104,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018091900002#U00300","speaker":"1391"},{"type":"speech","time":1537363800,"counter":105,"content":"<p>I hope he has an enjoyable stay and I think it is more sheltered here than it is in Monaghan at the moment.

It is incumbent on us as elected representatives, especially in the Oireachtas, to stand by and support the Garda.  It is easy for groups out there to attack the force.  No organisation is perfect.  There is not a police force in the world, not even in heaven above, without its flaws.  We are proud of the Garda.  It is incumbent on us to support garda&iacute; when they become the subject of unacceptable criticism.  A few weeks ago in Dublin, I was walking along the street when an altercation took place.  Two young garda&iacute; were attempting to arrest a group of people who had clearly been in breach of the peace and a group of people gathered around them with mobile phones, sticking the phones literally into their faces and asking &quot;What's your number?  What's your number?&quot; and all that type of thing.  There is a fine line between civil liberty and harassment of the Garda and I, for one, would come down on the side of the latter.<\/p><p>Members have heard me speak <i>ad nauseam<\/i>here about our gas security.

I am delighted to tell the House that the Shannon LNG project, which I have been very involved in and supported for almost 12 years, is about to come to fruition with new investors.  It is facing one final hurdle, which is an attempted injunction next month.  We will let that case take its course.

Today all of us here must give our support to the Defence Forces, along with proper pay and respect.  They protect us, rescue us and save us but what do we do for them?  Very little.  <\/p><p>The Defence Forces are the poorest paid in the public sector.  They are salaried.  They are not paid by the hour and many are on family income supplement because they cannot support their families on that salary.  They are not provided with free accommodation or married quarters.  They have to pay for school books and uniforms.  Like every family, they must put food on the table as well as pay their mortgage.

I was proud to stand beside those families outside and to call this Government out for the appalling way it is treating them.<\/p><p>During the recent Papal visit, members of the Defence Forces slept on camp beds, were away from home for three days and received no extra pay, only an allowance.

Surely it is not beyond the competence of those in the Department to come up with a common-sense scheme that will allow our school children to be taken to school.  I ask the Leader to take the message back to the Government that the system needs to be reviewed as a matter of urgency.  We all stood here this time last year and discussed the same issues and problems and we are back here this year doing likewise.

The Senators are correct to raise this very important issue.  Many of my party colleagues, such as Councillor Emer Higgins and Deputy Rock have also held public meetings on the matter.  There is a need to have meaningful consultation.  I do not buy the conspiracy theory argument that suggests people are not engaged when the D&aacute;il goes into recess.  They are engaged and the fact that many Members of the Houses and councillors have had public meetings shows people are indeed involved and engaged with the process.<\/p> <p>What is important, however, and where I agree wholeheartedly with the Senators is that we need to have full public consultation.  There needs to be real meaningful dialogue and engagement.  What outcome do we want to see?  We want to see better routes; increased journeys; and faster bus connectivity.  Public transport is something to which the Government is committed.  If we need to see an extension of the consultation period, I would have no personal problem with that.

As far as I am aware, engagement with NAMA is precluded under the Act.  However, the issue raised is one on which there is need for consultation.<\/p><p>I wish Senator Freeman well in the Presidential election and I congratulate her on attaining the nomination and on raising the issue of mental health.  Yesterday, I spoke at an event and I made the point that there is a need for mandatory mental health training in the workplace in order that people will have the tools to promote positive mental health and to address stress in the workplace owing to, in some cases, inflexible and long working days.  It is important that we recognise that the workplace has changed.  In times past, there was a considerable amount of emphasis on vocational training and the physical health of employees.  We now need to do likewise in respect of mental health and wellbeing.  The Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Bruton, has made changes in the curriculum in terms of wellbeing but I agree with Senator Freeman that it is important that there is mental health training in the workplace.<\/p><p>Senator Conway-Walsh raised the issue of waiting times for assessment of needs, in respect of which she rightly quoted the disability Act and stated that the number of applications is way too high.  Following on from enactment of the legislation, 1,138 applications were received in 2016.  This increased to 5,839 last year.  Between 2005 and 2017, 43,521 completed applications were received by the HSE.  It is important to recognise that there has been profound change.  An assessments of need compliance improvement plan has been put in place by the HSE and the Minister of State with responsibility for this area, Deputy Finian McGrath, has allocated additional resources to areas where there are significant backlogs.  I agree that we need to erode these waiting times as they are a source of stress to people and families.<\/p><p>On the point raised by Senator Black, the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill 2015 was not delayed by the Government in the Lower House, but for other reasons.  The Taoiseach is on record as saying as late as yesterday that it is a priority of the Government to have that Bill enacted as soon as possible.  It is my understanding that the Bill will be back before the D&aacute;il next week.  I give the Senator a commitment that the Bill will be taken here as soon as possible after the D&aacute;il has done its work.  The Senator will be aware that much of what happens in the Seanad is conditional on the D&aacute;il concluding its business.  She is correct that we need to have the conversation about the continued misuse and abuse of alcohol in our society.  The Public Health (Alcohol) Bill is but one measure in this regard, although an important one.  Senator Black is to be commended for the work that she does.  Having the type of conversations which bring people on a journey forms part of what we must do.    <\/p><p>Senator Bacik raised the issue of the eighth amendment.  I welcome the signing into law by President Higgins of the Thirty-sixth Amendment of the Constitution Bill 2018.  The eighth amendment is now repealed.

I understand that at the meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health this morning concerns were expressed by a variety of spokespersons for different organisations.  If the views articulated by the Irish College of General Practitioners, ICGP, and the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists in terms of the infrastructure not being in place are true then we need to have that conversation in tandem with the passage of the legislation.  I hope that by the end of the year we will have all of the necessary pieces in place.  Yesterday's announcement from the &Aacute;ras was important.

There is universal acceptance that the culture within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na needs to change but, equally, as outlined by the commission, its structure and management, along with the culture and oversight, must also be tackled.  I might get attacked on this but 2022 is the centenary of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and there is a window between now and then to bring about this much needed reform.  Members have spoken about the Patten report in the North on what is now the Police Service of Northern Ireland, PSNI.  It is a watershed moment for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and one we should embrace and move forward with.  I give a commitment that we will have the Minister in the House to discuss the report.<\/p><p>The report makes many innovative and exciting proposals.  I am not going to go through it all but the Minister has requested the Department of Justice and Equality, in consultation with the Department of the Taoiseach, to move quickly to put in place arrangements for an implementation group on policing reform and an implementation programme office, as recommended by the commission.  I hope we will debate the report in tandem with what the Government is doing.  I join Senators O'Sullivan, Coghlan and others in endorsing the need to have balance in the way people criticise members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on social media, in the media or on any other platform.  They are guardians of the peace and go about their work professionally - whether it is in sporting organisations, as voluntary stewards, in the traffic corps or during the papal visit.

The number is too high and the Government is committed to tackling the waiting lists and it has committed to opening additional beds in Limerick.<\/p> <p>I join Senator McDowell in calling for a review of the situation where a citizen can appeal a referendum result.  That is outdated, outmoded and has served its time.  I say that in the context of many referenda that we have had, whether on children, marriage equality or the eighth amendment.  I will explain why I agree with Senator McDowell.  We had pre-legislative scrutiny, the Citizens' Assembly and the Constitutional Convention. These provided for all the issues in the relevant referendum to be debated but, in some cases, one person put in serial objections.  That is wrong.  We should not have a situation where the will of the people is delayed for 90 days or more.  I agree fully with Senator McDowell and I will be happy to have a debate on the process where a referendum petition can be put before the courts.  I do not oppose people challenging a result but there must be a way or, as Senator McDowell put it, a threshold that must be overcome.  I endorse his remarks on that.<\/p> <p>I am sorry but Senator Feighan also made the point I referred to earlier, not Senator Coghlan.  With the indulgence of the Chair, I commend Senator Feighan.  During the summer he sent all of us a letter with a shamrock poppy to commemorate the sacrifices of Irishmen and Irishwomen who fought and died in the First World War.  The Senator has been a champion of marking the significant centenary that is Remembrance Sunday and I thank him for his letter and his shamrock poppy.   It is particularly important as the centenary is this year on 11 November.  It is one we as Members of the Oireachtas could support him on and I thank him again.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Jerry Buttimer:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=19\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> Senator Warfield raised the issue of the housing crisis of which the Government is very cognisant.  I am very conscious that we have a lot of work to do, notwithstanding that we have work done and undertaken.  The Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government has been in the House on numerous occasions.  I am happy to have him come back to the House again.  We need political parties to make a strategic decision and not table motions of confidence or no confidence in the Minister because, as the leader of Fianna F&aacute;il has said, the latter will not build a single house.  We need to adopt a joint approach to tackling housing, which is what happened at the beginning of the Oireachtas term.  It beggars belief that members of political parties on councils have opposed and blocked housing developments at a time when we need them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018091900002#AA00300","speaker":"1391","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1537363800,"counter":169,"content":"<p>Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il did it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018091900002#BB00200","speaker":"1372"},{"type":"speech","time":1537363800,"counter":170,"content":"<p>Sinn F&eacute;in did it in the county in which we reside and Sinn F&eacute;in councillors on South Dublin County Council voted against the provision of social and affordable private housing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018091900002#BB00300","speaker":"1391"},{"type":"speech","time":1537363800,"counter":171,"content":"<p>That is not the case.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018091900002#BB00400","speaker":"1372"},{"type":"speech","time":1537363800,"counter":172,"content":"<p>The Senator's party voted against the provision of 975 houses.  We either want houses or we do not.  I am of the view that every person needs to have a home whether it is private, social or affordable.  I know that the Senator did not say the following but I wish to dispel the notion that the Fine Gael Party opposes the provision of social housing, on the contrary.  I support the need to have affordable houses built to give people an opportunity to buy and live in their own homes, and to have social housing built.  I welcome the proposed establishment of the Land Development Agency.  I hope, in tandem with county and city councils, that houses built will be built faster.  In my own city of Cork, where Senator Colm Burke and I live, there are building sites where social houses are being constructed such as Deanrock Estate, White Street and in Carrigaline, which is in my constituency of Cork Central, to name but three sites.  As we speak, social housing is being constructed by this Government and the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government.<\/p> <p>Senators Lombard and Gallagher raised the issue of school transport as did other Members.  Earlier the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills, Deputy Halligan, was in the House to take a Commencement matter.  School transport is a significant issue and many Members of this House have had to navigate the choppy waters of this issue over the summer months.   I accept that there is a need for reform because there are people whom the nearest school does not suit.  I am talking about children with disabilities who must attend another school but were deprived of school transport.  That is wrong.  I heard the Minister of State say that the Government has spent over &euro;190 million on school transport.  It is important that we consider the scheme in terms of the nearest school option and eligibility for transport and I hope that the scheme is reviewed.  Senator Lombard was right to say that accessing school transport is a source of huge stress and a burden for many families.<\/p> <p>I thank Senator Leyden for raising the important issue of the Taoiseach's visit to Salzburg.  The issue of Brexit is the question of our time and there are many unknowns.  I believe that the Brexit negotiations and tax reforms are two separate issues.
