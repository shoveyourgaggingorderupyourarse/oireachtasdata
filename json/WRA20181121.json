This engagement involves the identification of key strategic, operational and policy issues arising from Brexit.<\/p>  <p>  As I have said in response to this question in the past, the UK's decision to leave the EU does not of itself give rise to additional border control requirements and accordingly there is no reason to revisit previous decisions on the location of military installations across the country, including in the border region. The avoidance of a hard border on the island is fundamental to the draft Brexit agreement reached last week between the EU and the UK government. As such, there are no plans to reintroduce a new Army barracks or Defence Forces base in counties Cavan and Monaghan or the greater Border region.   <\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, and as I have also outlined previously in this regard, it is important to note that primary responsibility for the internal security of the State rests with the Minister for Justice and Equality and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Accordingly, responsibility for the security aspect of border control rests with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, while the Revenue Commissioners also have responsibilities relating to their particular mandate.<\/p>  <p>  Among the roles assigned to the Defence Forces in the White Paper on Defence is the provision of Aid to the Civil Power which, in practice, means to provide assistance and support to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na when requested to do so.

The previous incumbent providing these services to the Defence Forces on contract retired in May 2018 while arrangements were being made to implement this recommendation. <\/p>  <p>  In the intervening period, patients presenting to Defence Forces Primary Carers (Medical Officers or contracted civilian GPs) with a requirement for urgent psychiatric assessment are referred to HSE A&amp;E Departments. Here they are assessed by the duty on-call psychiatric staff who triage referrals and these patients will either be admitted for in-patient care or referred onward to HSE outpatient psychiatric services where appropriate.<\/p>  <p>  To continue to provide an interim in-house service until such time as the military psychiatrist position could be filled, efforts were made to engage a locum psychiatrist.  However, this proved to be unsuccessful.  <\/p>  <p>  Subsequently, it was agreed to launch a procurement process to contract a third-party private service provider for psychiatric services as a bridging arrangement pending the appointment of a locum or full time psychiatrist.  <\/p>  <p>  In addition, a direct entrant competition for the position of military psychiatrist was launched on 26th July 2018 and closed on 30th September 2018. No applications were received for this competition and further options are now under consideration as to how to proceed. <\/p>  <p>  It must be stressed that there is no delay in referring patients requiring immediate psychiatric care or assessment. When presenting to HSE A &amp;amp; E Departments, those requiring hospitalisation are immediately admitted. For non-urgent outpatient cases the waiting time is approximately 3 months. In order to provide Defence Forces Primary Carers with the broadest range of options possible in dealing with the spectrum of cases that present to them, they have also been authorised to refer cases to local external private psychiatrists for outpatient treatment where deemed appropriate. <\/p>  <p>  With regard to mental health supports generally, I can assure the Deputy that the health and welfare of the men and women of the Defence Forces is a high priority for me. Mental health services are part of a range of medical and non-medical services provided to ensure that Defence Forces personnel are medically fit to undertake the duties assigned to them. <\/p>  <p>  In addition to the clinical supports I have already outlined, non-medical mental health services are provided by the Personnel Support Service (PSS).  The PSS makes confidential services, including critical incident stress management, and psychosocial support available to all Defence Forces personnel through its network of Barrack Personnel Support Service Officers and occupational social workers at formation, unit and barrack level. <\/p>  <p>  The PSS also supports contingents before, during and after overseas deployments and its trained personnel are deployed in response to any significant operational incidents at home or overseas. The service is also available to the families of serving personnel. <\/p>  <p>  As additional support, my Department has arranged the provision of a confidential counselling, referral and support service, on a wide range of personal and work related issues, for serving members of the Defence Forces, civilian employees and Civil Defence members. A Freephone confidential helpline is available on a 24\/7 basis 365 days a year and is staffed by fully-trained and experienced counsellors. <\/p>  <p>  While I am satisfied that the available medical services offer comprehensive supports to Defence Forces members, I can assure the Deputy that they are kept under constant review.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112100074#WRA01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1365"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Defence Forces Expenditure","counter":16,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112100074#WRA01250"},{"type":"question","counter":17,"qnumday":70,"qnumall":"[48393\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112100074#WRA01300","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"the amount of the budget in 2018 which will be taken by additional costs associated with PESCO related activities; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1367","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":18,"content":"<p>Ireland joined Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO) in December, 2017 following Government and D&aacute;il approval.

As identified in the Council Decision of 6th March establishing the first list of PESCO projects, I have confirmed Ireland's participation in two PESCO projects - (1) The European Union Training Mission Competence Centre and (2) Upgrade of Maritime Surveillance.

I did however meet with two individuals in relation to the matters raised. <\/p>  <p>  As I have clearly stated to this House, the health and welfare of the men and women of the Defence Forces are a priority for me. <\/p>  <p>  In this regard, there are a number of processes already in train relating to reviewing health and safety procedures in the Air Corps.  Firstly, in September 2016, I appointed an independent third party to review allegations made in a number of protected disclosures relating to health and safety issues in the Air Corps which were received in late 2015 and early 2016. The report of the independent third party review was received by my Department in June 2017. Although the report found that the Defence Force's regime appears to be capable of meeting statutory requirements, it makes a number of observations including in relation to documentation, health surveillance, and exposure monitoring.  It also notes that the Health and Safety Authority (HSA) is the appropriate statutory body to deal with such matters. I sent the report to those who had made disclosures for their views and I am considering the next steps in the process having received those views and in the context of ongoing litigation.<\/p>  <p>  Separately, and in parallel to the independent review, following an inspection in 2016, the Air Corps has continued to work with the HSA to improve its health and safety regime. I have been informed by the military authorities that the HSA has formally noted the considerable progress made to-date by the Defence Forces towards implementation of a safety management system for the control of hazardous substances. Subject to completion of the improvement plan, the HSA investigation is closed.  However, it must be noted that Air Corps health and safety is a matter of ongoing monitoring, supervision and adjustment. The Air Corps is fully committed to implementing improved safety measures that protect workers from potential exposures to chemicals and will ensure risks are as low as reasonably practicable.<\/p>  <p>   As litigation is ongoing it would be inappropriate for me to comment further.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112100074#WRA03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1365"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":43,"content":"<p>Question No. 81 answered with Question No. 66.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":44,"content":"<p>Question No. 82 answered with Question No. 68.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Defence Forces Personnel Data","counter":45,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112100074#WRA03550"},{"type":"question","counter":46,"qnumday":83,"qnumall":"[47798\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112100074#WRA03600","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"the number of medical staff in the Defence Forces by occupation in each of the years 2015 to 2017 and to date in 2018; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1302","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":47,"content":"<p>I wish to state at the outset that the health and wellbeing of our Defence Forces is of the highest priority for me.

A reduced fee is applied on applications for passports for minors in recognition of the fact that a minor&rsquo;s passport is valid for only five years. Most adult passports will be issued for a period of ten years. I have asked my staff to review the cost of the standard ten year adult Irish passport and to compare it to the cost of a similar passport in many other jurisdictions. I am satisfied that, at a cost of &euro;80, which breaks down to &euro;8 per year, the Irish passport fee compares favourably with the services offered elsewhere. For example, an adult would have to pay &euro;8.50 per year for a British passport, &euro;8.60 per year for a French passport, &euro;9.70 per year for an American passport and &euro;18.10 per year for an Australian passport.<\/p>  <p>  Based on 2017 application volumes, the Passport Service has calculated the potential annual cost of eliminating the passport application fee for applicants over 70 years of age to be over &euro;3.7m.  Given that any shortfall in revenue would have to be met by the taxpayer, a decision to waive or reduce the application fee for any category of applicant would require careful consideration. It is important to ensure that the major upgrades to the passport service technology platforms and business processes as well as significant customer service improvements which have taken place in recent years can be maintained and further developed.  <\/p>  <p>  In the context of the services provided by the Passport Service, I would like to draw attention to the well-advanced Passport Reform Programme, one element of which is an online passport application service which was launched on 30 March 2017. <\/p>  <p>  To date over 273,000 adults have renewed their passport using this online facility. At present, the online passport application service accommodates adult passport renewal applications and passport card applications.

The service is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week from anywhere in the world. Whilst the online service does not distinguish between applicants based on age, applicants can be assured that the online system will be the cheapest as well as the most efficient, secure and convenient way to apply to renew their passport.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112100075#WRB03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Human Rights","counter":119,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112100075#WRB03600"},{"type":"question","counter":120,"qnumday":112,"qnumall":"[48476\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112100075#WRB03700","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he will report on alleged persecution and intimidation of Christians in parts of Pakistan and India; if he has asked Ireland's ambassadors to raise these reports with the governments concerned; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":121,"content":"<p>Under Article 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion.

The reports of violence, arbitrary detention, and persecution of civil society leaders, peaceful protesters and those who have assisted them paint a troubling picture of repression. <\/p>  <p>  I once again strongly condemn any use of violence and reiterate my calls on all actors to respect the right to peaceful protest and to freedom of expression. I also call on authorities to ensure full accountability for all acts of violence, while ensuring due process for all prisoners.  <\/p>  <p>  I am aware of the reports to which the Deputy refers and the worrying accounts they contain of a pattern of human rights abuses and repression. Compounding this climate of impunity is a lack of official cooperation with the international missions investigating human rights abuses.  <\/p>  <p>  The UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) was expelled from the country following the publication of its report. The Group of Independent Experts (GIEI) and the Follow-Up Mechanism of Nicaragua (MESENI), set up by the Inter-American Commission of Human Rights (IACHR), have also both reported difficulties in working with the authorities. I urge the Government of Nicaragua to allow the OHCHR officials to re-enter the country, and to cooperate fully with the GIEI and MESENI, so that they can effectively carry out their important work. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland regularly engages on this issue at EU and international level. The EU and its Member States, including Ireland, calls on the government of Nicaragua to act on the findings and recommendations by the IACHR and OHCHR, to ensure full accountability for perpetrators of human rights abuses and the disarming and disbanding of armed groups. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland also supported the declaration in October by the EU High Representative on behalf of the EU on the situation in Nicaragua.<\/p>  <p>  The statement expressed the EU&rsquo;s serious concern at the situation, and urged the government of Nicaragua to allow the return of the OHCHR to enable it to continue its mission, as well as calling on the government of Nicaragua to stop the disproportionate use of force against demonstrators, halt arrests based on laws which criminalise peaceful protest, allow free peaceful demonstrators and re-establish the full respect of due process for all detainees. <\/p>  <p>  I echo the EU call on the government of Nicaragua to resume the national dialogue. I believe that inclusive dialogue remains the only way of negotiating a peaceful and democratic resolution to this crisis, and of restoring the trust of the Nicaraguan people in the country&rsquo;s institutions. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland supports EU action taken to support international and local initiatives to address the human rights situation, promote a culture of peace, and to provide support to victims of the crisis and their families. It is important to monitor the humanitarian consequences of the crisis and its impact on the population.<\/p>  <p>  Officials in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, both in Dublin and in our Embassy in Mexico, which has responsibility for diplomatic relations with Nicaragua, have been monitoring the situation closely.

These measures will take effect from 1 January 2019.<\/p>  <p>  The rate of betting duty at 1 per cent on the amount of bets wagered in Ireland is at an all-time low,\u00a0and betting duty receipts are exceptionally low when compared to other sectors subject to excise taxes. It is also the case that there is no VAT applied on betting transactions. With the Betting (Amendment) Act 2015 now well embedded in, I believe it is timely to increase the rates of Betting Duty and Betting Intermediary Duty.<\/p>  <p>  I acknowledge that advances in technology have challenged existing business models and have changed the structure of many markets, including the betting market, with\u00a0more betting taking place online. I further acknowledge\u00a0that smaller bookmakers may have ongoing difficulties\u00a0competing in that environment or indeed with large retail bookmakers.

While problem gambling can result in the problem gambler, and their family, bearing the severest of economic and of course personal costs,\u00a0the social costs of problem gambling can extend to their employers and to public institutions in the health, welfare and justice systems, such costs ultimately borne by taxpayers.

The Act introduces a number of additional offences to give better effect to the UN Convention against Corruption (UNCAC), the Council of Europe Criminal Law Convention on Corruption and the OECD Convention on Combatting Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions, as well as providing for some of the recommendations of the Mahon Tribunal. <\/p>  <p>  The Act creates several new offences to strengthen the law on corruption in Ireland.  New offences include:<\/p>  <p>  - Offering or agreeing to accept a gift, consideration or advantage to induce another person to exert an improper influence over an act of a foreign or public official.<\/p>  <p>  - Making use of confidential information obtained in the course of duties by an official in order to gain an advantage.<\/p>  <p>  - Giving a gift, consideration or advantage where a person knows or reasonably ought to know that the gift will be used to facilitate a corruption offence. <\/p>  <p>  - A new strict liability offence for corporate bodies whose management, employees or subsidiaries commit a corruption offence with the intention of securing an advantage for the company. It shall be a defence for the body corporate to prove they took reasonable steps to prevent this. The penalty for conviction on indictment is an unlimited fine.<\/p>  <p>  The Act extends the categories of persons to whom the presumptions relating to corrupt donations will apply, to include family members and close business associates, as recommended by the Mahon Tribunal. It also creates a presumption of corrupt enrichment whereby a public official who has not declared an interest in land or other property, when obliged to do so, can be presumed to have obtained it as an inducement or reward for doing an act in relation to his or her office.<\/p>  <p>  Penalties under the Act aim to be sufficiently strong to reflect the serious social and economic harm corruption can do, particularly when committed by public officials. Sentences of up to 10 years are provided for as well as unlimited fines upon conviction on indictment. The Act provides for a penalty of forfeiture of office if an Irish official is found guilty of corruption on indictment, as recommended by UNCAC. The forfeiture of office penalty will not apply where there is already a process for a position to be terminated by resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas, or where the power of removal is derived from a Constitutional power.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112100077#WRD02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Court Accommodation Provision","counter":223,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112100077#WRD02400"},{"type":"question","counter":224,"qnumday":148,"qnumall":"[48483\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112100077#WRD02500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the progress that has been made on the commitment in the National Development Plan 2018-2027 in relation to the provision of a standard county type court facility in north County Kildare; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1301","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":225,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware, under the provisions of the Courts Service Act 1998 management of the courts, including the provision of accommodation for court sittings, is the responsibility of the Courts Service, which is independent in exercising its functions. <\/p><p>However, in order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have had enquiries made and the Courts Service has advised that Naas\/North Kildare is one of a number of locations identified where there will be a requirement for additional court facilities in the future.

The main provisions of the Bill as published include extending the existing offence of sending threatening or indecent messages to apply to all threatening, false, indecent and obscene messages using any form of online or traditional method of communications. The Bill creates new offences to deal with the distribution of intimate images without consent. The Bill also proposes extending the existing offence of harassment as contained in section 10 of the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act, 1997 to include all forms of communication, including through online or digital communications,\u00a0and including communication about a person. This Bill will therefore deal with recommendations 15-18 of the Report on Cyber Security for Children and Young Adults. <\/p>  <p>  Cabinet agreed in May\u00a0this year to cease work on the Government Bill and to support Deputy Howlin's Bill to ensure that legislation\u00a0can be enacted as soon as possible.

It is important to note that SHA focuses solely on expenditure for health purposes and excludes other expenditures, such as elements of social care expenditure, which would also come under the remit of my Department. While there are known issues in the international comparability of SHA estimates, such as those around Out-of-Pocket and Long-Term Care expenditures, SHA still represents a useful approach to measuring the level of health expenditure on health goods and services, including public and private expenditure, across countries. <\/p>  <p>  The SHA methodology produces estimates of health expenditure in the currency and price level of the relevant country. Purchasing Power Parities (PPPs) are used to turn these estimates into a common currency, valued at a uniform price level. The values resulting from this exercise should reflect only differences in the volumes of goods and services consumed in countries. For this calculation the OECD uses PPPs based on Gross Domestic Product while Eurostat uses Actual Individual Consumption PPPs. The differences in these approaches reflects the set of prices included in their calculation. <\/p>  <p>  GDP is a measure of all expenditures in an economy. PPP based on prices from GDP includes the most comprehensive coverage of goods and services. Irish GDP has experienced significant volatility in recent years as a result of globalised activities in the economy. My Department have been in communication with the OECD to clarify whether this has distorted the GDP PPP for Ireland, however it is not clear at this point whether this is the case.\u00a0More generally, the OECD and Eurostat note that while GDP is a good indicator of the level of economic activity, it is not an accurate measure of material well-being, when material well-being is defined in terms of individual goods and services consumed by households, that is, the goods and services that households consume to satisfy their individual needs.<\/p>  <p>  AIC relates more to the domestic consumption of goods and services. It includes all goods and services consumed by households whether purchased by themselves or provided by Government or Non-Profit Institutions Serving Households, whereas GDP includes items such as net exports.<\/p>  <p>  For certain countries, such as Ireland, there is a significant difference in the value of the AIC and GDP PPP. Given the importance of this parameter for measuring the volume of health goods and services consumed in Ireland, work is ongoing by my officials to evaluate the most appropriate PPP to use in international comparisons.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112100078#WRE02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mental Health Act Review","counter":287,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112100078#WRE02900"},{"type":"question","counter":288,"qnumday":169,"qnumall":"[48500\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112100078#WRE03000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of the recommendations of the expert review of the Mental Health Act 2015 that have been implemented;

It is my intention that the supports available through my Department will continue to improve conditions in these communities into the future. <\/p>  <p>  This can be achieved through the implementation of programmes and initiatives that facilitate and encourage economic development through the creation of jobs and the infrastructure required to support those jobs, and to provide other facilities that support our communities to become and remain desirable places to live, work and raise families. <\/p>  <p>  To help bring this about, my Department will work across Government to:<\/p>  <p>  - Create the conditions to support increased economic opportunities and local employment in all areas of the country<\/p>  <p>  - Enable\u00a0communities disadvantaged by location or social issues to reach their full potential now and in the future<\/p>  <p>  - Deliver\u00a0schemes and programmes that support the revitalisation of towns and villages<\/p>  <p>  - Improve\u00a0\u00a0access to services and social networks that ensure a high quality of life<\/p>  <p>  - Support all communities to be able to have a voice in shaping their own futures and addressing their common goals<\/p>  <p>  My Department's budget will increase by &euro;62 million to &euro;293 million in 2019 - a 27 per cent increase on our 2018 allocation of &euro;231 million - which adds to our capacity to provide direct and indirect supports to local communities through the range of schemes and programmes delivered by my Department. <\/p>  <p>  These include the Dublin North East Inner City Initiative, the Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme, LEADER programme, Community Enhancement Programme, CL&Aacute;R Programme, Outdoor Recreation Infrastructure Scheme and the Town and Village Renewal Scheme. My Department also provides supports for social enterprises. <\/p>  <p>  The increased budget allocation for Dormant Accounts will also allow continued support for excellent existing measures such as the Social Innovation Fund Ireland and funding for new measures such as supporting enterprise hubs along the Atlantic Economic Corridor. The increased funding will provide for a number of Volunteer Centres around the country and support measures under the Dormant Accounts Action Plan which address economic, social or educational disadvantage. <\/p>  <p>  A key priority is to ensure better alignment, consolidation and integration of programmes across the Department, while we will also focus on cross-Departmental and whole-of Government approaches with a view to achieving greater impact and effectiveness in the delivery of our supports to communities.\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The Action Plan for Rural Development, the Framework Policy for Local and Community Development in Ireland, and Project Ireland 2040 are strategic policy initiatives that set out the ways in which Government aims to address disadvantage and how we can support both rural and urban communities across Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  The Action Plan is coordinated and monitored by my Department and is the most comprehensive Government plan ever produced to support economic and social development in rural areas. The measures within it are being delivered across a range of Government Departments, State agencies and other organisations over the period to 2020.\u00a0\u00a0The Third Progress Report on the Action Plan is due to be published shortly and I can confirm significant progress continues to be made across the range of measures. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Project Ireland 2040 laid out the Government&rsquo;s

job creation, attract tourism investment and to contribute to sustainable economic development in all communities throughout
