I would like to thank both public and commercial operators and their staff for their continued dedication to providing this vital service in such challenging times.  <\/p>  <p>  The Government's \"Living with Covid\" Plan sets out capacity guidance for public transport at each of the 5 risk levels identified in the Plan.  Due to the rising incidences of Covid-19 in the community, An Taoiseach announced that for a period of six weeks from midnight on Wednesday 21st October, the whole country would move to Level 5 of the Plan.  At current levels of risk, public transport operators are restricted to using only 25% of the passenger-carrying capacity on their vehicles.  Importantly, the Plan's guidance on working from home where possible, and on the closure of social, leisure and other facilities has reduced the demand for public transport well below normal levels.  The advice is aimed at ensuring public transport is safeguarded for those who need it most, including essential workers and students.  Both my Department and the NTA are closely monitoring public transport demand and will continue to be guided by public health advice.  <\/p>  <p>  Since the move to Level 5, the NTA and bus operators in Dublin (Dublin Bus and Go-Ahead Ireland), have re-allocated a number of vehicles and drivers across the network to enhance the capacity in areas where they were experiencing capacity issues.<\/p>  <p>  Approximately 43 buses have been redeployed by Dublin Bus since October 22nd to help mitigate the impact of the capacity restrictions and reduce the number of passengers being left at stops. Where possible, these vehicles are being deployed during peak demand times, particularly for school travel.  These measures have also assisted in reducing passengers' wait times at stops. Currently, all available vehicles are in use, so whilst the re-allocation has eased the situation, it remains the case that there may still be instances of people having to wait for another bus. <\/p>  <p>  The NTA continues to monitor the effects of the reduction in capacity very closely in conjunction with public transport operators.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020112500062#WRC00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Driver Licences","counter":69,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020112500062#WRC00800"},{"type":"question","counter":70,"qnumday":41,"qnumall":"[39037\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020112500062#WRC00900","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if he will address the case of a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1557","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":71,"content":"<p>Irish driving licences can only be issued to people resident in Ireland.

The measures included flexible loan repayment arrangements where needed, including loan payment breaks initially for a period up to three months and then subsequently extended for up to six months. This was a welcome initiative and it allowed necessary relief to be quickly and efficiently provided to borrowers. However, each borrower&rsquo;s position is different and that&rsquo;s why a case-by-case approach has been adopted as some sectors of the economy are more impacted than others.<\/p>  <p>  The T&aacute;naiste, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and I met the CEOs of the country&rsquo;s retail banks and the Banking Payments Federation Ireland on 28 September and indicated that it is particularly vital that lenders work with their customers to ensure that suitable arrangements are put in place to assist their customers who are still experiencing difficulty. The lenders indicated that they will ensure that customers who have difficulties in meeting their loan repayments will be supported with a range of options so that a suitable arrangement can be agreed. <\/p>  <p>  Borrowers have a suite of regulatory protections and lenders have specific obligations to support and work with borrowers who are continuing to experience loan difficulty because of Covid-19. These options could include additional flexibility, and this could be a short term arrangement such as additional periods without payments or interest-only repayments, or if appropriate more long term arrangements. <\/p>  <p>  I will continue to work with the Central Bank, as regulator, to ensure that the Central Bank protection framework will be fully available to all borrowers that will still need support due to the economic impact of Covid-19. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020112500062#WRC03900","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Procurement Contracts","counter":97,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020112500062#WRC04000"},{"type":"question","counter":98,"qnumday":53,"qnumall":"[39048\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020112500062#WRC04100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if his Department and any commercial or non-commercial State bodies and private entities subsidised by 50% or more of public funding under the aegis of his Department have implemented social clauses in their public procurement contracts in the past three years (details supplied); and if so, the nature of these social clauses.","asker":"1579","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":99,"content":"<p>The OGP Information Note <i>&lsquo;Incorporating Social Considerations into Public Procurement&rsquo; <\/i>gives guidance on how public sector bodies can deliver wider social and environmental aims through their procurement processes for example, employment and training opportunities for disadvantaged groups, disability access, promoting social inclusion, or the protection of the environment and combating climate change.<\/p><p>I would like to reassure the Deputy that my officials are very cognisant of the importance of social considerations in procurement.

I understand that the European Commission recently confirmed to my Department that it had no issues concerning the completeness of the national transposition measures in respect of the Directive. <\/p><p>With regard to the interaction between the Directive and the Central Bank&rsquo;s Review on differential pricing, I understand that the purpose of the Review is to examine the extent to which the practice of differential pricing (whereby customers with similar risk and cost of service are charged different premiums, for reasons other than risk and cost of service) is consistent with the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code 2012 (the &ldquo;Code&rdquo;).  The Deputy will be aware that the Code requires firms to <i>inter alia<\/i>act honestly, fairly and professionally in the best interests of their customers; and make full disclosure of all relevant material information, including all charges. In addition, it is seeking to establish the impact of differential pricing on consumers; identify the drivers of consumer behaviours including how consumers engage with the insurance industry; assess the extent to which these pricing practices lead to outcomes consistent with the Code; and assess the governance and oversight of differential pricing.  The Deputy will also be aware that the Central Bank&rsquo;s review is ongoing and in this regard, I believe that it would be prudent to await the outcome of the review in advance of reaching any conclusions.  <\/p><p>In conclusion, differential pricing is undoubtedly a complex issue and will need careful consideration of any potential remedies, and what overall impact they would have on consumers.  We need to guard against the risk of unintended consequences in that in attempting to address an issue we don&rsquo;t create an undesirable knock-on impact elsewhere.  This could include discouraging competition or new entrants to the market, all of which is not in Irish consumers long-term interests.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020112500063#WRD01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Community Banking","counter":113,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020112500063#WRD01400"},{"type":"question","counter":114,"qnumday":58,"qnumall":"[39253\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020112500063#WRD01500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his plans to advance proposals for community banking, with particular reference to the role of the post office network in the further development of financial services; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1556","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":115,"content":"<p>In December 2019, the Department of Finance published a report on the Evaluation of Concept of Community Banking in Ireland by Indecon Consultants.

Under the Regulations, essential education encompasses primary and post-primary schools, and higher and further education where remote learning is not possible. Where a service provider considers that they fall into the essential education category e.g. as part of the national curriculum or as part of a specific, state-sponsored course of study, they should refer to the Department of Education&rsquo;s guidance in relation to the operation of education services under Level 5 restrictions. <\/p><p>Similarly, The Health Act 1947 (Section 31A - Temporary Restrictions) (COVID-19) (No.7) Regulations, which applied when the country was under Level 3 of the Plan for Living with COVID-19, did not allow any exercise or dance classes, regardless of the form e.g. Irish, ballet, jazz etc.  <\/p><p>I fully understand the benefits that activities such as dance bring to peoples overall health and well-being.

The Programme for Government commits to increasing the social housing stock by more than 50,000, with an emphasis on new builds. In Budget 2021, we backed this objective with funding of &euro;3.3 billion for the delivery of housing.  The available funding will deliver 12,750 new social homes through build, acquisition and leasing.  A major focus of this investment is the delivery of new build, with an overall target of 9,500 new homes and the increased build targets will see increased local authority build on local authority land. <\/p>  <p>  In progressing this major construction programme it is important to pursue timely delivery while also ensuring value for money in terms of Exchequer funding. In this regard, social housing projects, like all publicly-funded construction projects, must comply with the Government&rsquo;s Public Spending Code and Capital Works Management Framework (CWMF), the objectives of which are to ensure greater cost certainty, better value for money and financial accountability. <\/p>  <p>  My Department, working with local authorities has sought to streamline its \"4-stage\" approval process for social housing and to introduce other measures to increase the pace of delivery. As a result of this work a pre-construction programme of 59 weeks was agreed, which includes design, Part 8 approval, detailed design, preparation of tender documentation, issuing tenders and tender reports. The 59-weeks includes 15 weeks for the requisite Department approvals, which occur in parallel with local authority activities where possible.  <\/p>  <p>  Local authorities have been able to reduce this pre-construction timeline further using design and build frameworks. Off-site construction has also been used to reduce local authority construction timelines.<\/p>  <p>  Building on this work, in September I increased the Single-Stage Approval Process for local authority Social Housing Capital Construction Projects from &euro;2m to &euro;6m, to give further autonomy to local authorities to progress projects by reducing the number of approvals sought from the Department from four to one. <\/p>  <p>  There are approximately 20 projects (50 units) (under &euro;2m) currently going through the single stage process and one project (under &euro;6m) about to transition due to the increased limit.

The LDA Bill will focus on the establishment of the corporate form and financial structure of the Agency. Once the primary legislation is in place, arrangements will be finalised in relation to the capitalisation of the LDA with funding of up to &euro;1.25 billion being provided from ISIF.  My Department is currently working closely with the Office of the Attorney General on the draft legislation to ensure the LDA are given all necessary powers to carry out its functions. <\/p>  <p>  The LDA has an immediate focus on managing the State&rsquo;s own lands to develop new homes, and regenerate under-utilised sites. In the longer-term, it will assemble strategic land-banks from a mix of public and private lands, making these available for housing in a controlled manner, which brings essential long-term stability to the Irish housing market.<\/p>  <p>  Along with its initial 8 sites, the LDA is working in partnership with local authorities to develop and master plan a range of strategic sites. One example is the Shanganagh Castle site. The LDA, in partnership with Dun Laoghaire Rathdown County Council, have been granted planning permission for the development of 597 homes on this site. It is intended that approximately 34% of the units in this development will be for social housing, 51% will be cost rental and 15% will be for affordable purchase. <\/p>  <p>  As part of its remit, the LDA is also working to develop an inventory of all relevant public lands to allow for better management of these land assets, including their strategic planning and urban regeneration potential. This database will contain information on all relevant public lands including location, mapping and title. It is intended that the forthcoming LDA Bill will provide that all state bodies will be obliged to assist the LDA in the compilation of the database, where appropriate. It also provides that the LDA will report to the Minister periodically on the optimal use of public lands. In accordance with the Programme for Government, the LDA Bill will require all public bodies disposing of lands to first offer them for sale to the LDA. <\/p>  <p>  In line with its mandate, the LDA will retain experienced staff with extensive skills and experience in project management, finance, planning, development, law and procurement and will provide professional services to master-plan key sites\/areas for development in key urban areas, in partnership with local authorities and other state bodies.

There are credible allegations of mass casualties, including civilian casualties, and of human rights abuses. There is a grave risk of a humanitarian crisis. Tigray is home to many refugees, displaced persons and local communities already coping with the stresses of the COVID-19 pandemic. If not contained, this conflict could threaten the stability of Ethiopia, Africa&rsquo;s second most populous country, and have serious regional implications for the wider Horn of Africa, one of the continent&rsquo;s most fragile regions. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland is actively supporting the efforts of the EU and wider international community to de-escalate the situation, including through engagement with the African Union which has appointed three Special Envoys. Minister Coveney has called for an immediate cessation of hostilities, and the commencement of a national dialogue to de-escalate tensions.  Minister Coveney has also condemned the reported atrocities and identity-based attacks. It is essential to ensure that the human rights of all Ethiopians are upheld. I am gravely concerned by reports that Ethiopia&rsquo;s federal military has said civilians should protect themselves from heavy artillery, in advance of a planned assault against the regional capital. I urge all parties to the conflict to respect international humanitarian law.<\/p>  <p>  The situation in Ethiopia was raised by HRVP Borrell at a meeting of EU Foreign Ministers on 19 November. Minister Coveney intervened calling for continued EU efforts to push for a resolution of the crisis, and stressed the need to act fast and collectively to call for unconditional, unrestricted access for humanitarian actors to affected areas.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s Embassy in Addis Ababa is engaging closely with other EU Heads of Mission, the UN and other members of the international community in monitoring, reporting and advocating on the situation and in preparing for an emergency humanitarian response.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s largest bilateral development cooperation programme is in Ethiopia.  The Embassy of Ireland is in the process of providing &euro;416,000 to the humanitarian response in Tigray, along with a projected &euro;500,000 to support refugees in Eastern Sudan. My Department is actively looking at ways to address other critical funding needs in light of the escalating humanitarian situation.<\/p>  <p>  In the context of our upcoming tenure on the UN Security Council, Ireland will continue to monitor the situation in Ethiopia closely and will continue to advocate for a peaceful resolution to the current conflict.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020112500065#WRF02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1573"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Defence","counter":206,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020112500065#WRF02500"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Procurement Contracts","counter":205,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020112500065#WRF02400"},{"type":"question","counter":206,"qnumday":94,"qnumall":"[39044\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020112500065#WRF02500","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"if his Department and any commercial or non-commercial State bodies and private entities subsidised by 50% or more of public funding under the aegis of his Department have implemented social clauses in their public procurement contracts in the past three years (details supplied); and if so, the nature of these social clauses.","asker":"1579","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":207,"content":"<p>The procurement of goods, services and works in my Department and by the Defence Forces is carried out in accordance with public procurement policies and national and European laws.

My Department&rsquo;s Wellbeing Policy and Framework for practice has given recognition to the importance of promoting wellbeing in education.  It outlines a comprehensive, whole-school approach to the promotion of wellbeing and positive mental health. It focuses on the whole school community, as well as groups and individual young people with identified needs. <\/p><p>The National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) of my Department provides a comprehensive, school-based psychological service to all primary and post primary schools through the application of psychological theory and practice to support the wellbeing, academic, social and emotional development of all learners. NEPS provides a casework service to schools through the assigned NEPS psychologist, or sometimes, temporarily, via the Scheme for the Commissioning of Psychological assessments &ndash; SCPA.  Individual casework service involves a high level of psychologist collaboration with teachers and parents, often also working directly with the child\/young person.  NEPS may become involved with supporting individual students where the school&rsquo;s SET team or Student Support Team (in post-primary) feels that the involvement of the psychologist is needed. Psychologists may provide consultation in relation to appropriate therapeutic interventions to be delivered in the school setting and engage in direct work with an individual student as appropriate. This year due to Covid19 some elements of casework service is modified to ensure compliance with public health and your school&rsquo;s safety measures. <\/p><p>In the event that the need for a more targeted counselling or a specialised intervention is identified by the NEPS psychologist, a referral is made to an outside agency for evaluation and ongoing support.  The NEPS psychologist can identify the most appropriate referral pathway and supports school with the onward referral to Child and Adolescent Mental Health Team (CAMHS), HSE Primary Care\/Community Psychology teams, or an identified local community based specialist mental health service.  <\/p><p>In addition to casework NEPS psychologists work with teachers to build their capacity.  NEPS teams offer training and guidance for teachers in the provision of universal and targeted evidence-informed approaches and early intervention to promote children&rsquo;s wellbeing, social, emotional and academic development. Initiatives such as the Incredible Years Social Emotional learning Programmes and the FRIENDS Resilience Programmes have been welcomed by schools and their impact positively evaluated.  <\/p><p>Also at post primary level, counselling is a key part of the role of the Guidance Counsellor, offered on an individual or group basis as part of a developmental learning process, at moments of personal crisis but also at key transition points. The Guidance Counsellor also identifies and supports the referral of students to external counselling agencies and professionals, as required. The Guidance Counsellor is key in developing and implementing innovative approaches to wellbeing promotion on a whole schools basis though the school&rsquo;s Guidance Plan.  Each post primary school currently receives an allocation in respect of guidance provision, calculated by reference to the approved enrolment.  <\/p><p>My Department works closely with the Department of Health and will be represented on the newly established National Implementation Monitoring Committee which will drive and oversee the implementation of the recommendations of the Sharing the Vision &ndash; a Mental Health Policy for Everyone. <\/p><p>The curriculum also plays an important role in teaching students about managing their wellbeing. All students commencing Junior Cycle from September 2017 onwards undertake the area of learning called Wellbeing. Wellbeing crosses the three years of Junior Cycle and builds on substantial work already taking place in schools in support of students&rsquo; wellbeing. When planning a Wellbeing Programme schools should consider the NCCA developed short courses in PE, SPHE, and CSPE. In particular the Strand 4: My Mental Health focuses on building positive mental health, examining young people&rsquo;s experience of mental ill health and learning how to support themselves and others in challenging times. These are the result of widespread consultation with education partners to ensure that the courses address important, relevant and meaningful learning for young people in these subjects. Wellbeing is one of the principles that underpins Junior Cycle education and is reflected in a number of the statements of learning that are central to planning for the student&rsquo;s experience of and the evaluation of the schools Junior Cycle programme.  At primary level SPHE is mandatory SPHE supports the personal development, health and well-being of young people and helps them create and maintain supportive relationships.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020112500065#WRF04200","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Data","counter":225,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020112500066#WRG00200"},{"type":"question","counter":226,"qnumday":101,"qnumall":"[38993\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020112500066#WRG00300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the figures relating to bullying, substance abuse and the scale of mental issues in primary schools; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1603","askee":"1582"},{"type":"question","counter":227,"qnumday":102,"qnumall":"[38994\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020112500066#WRG00400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the figures in relation to bullying, substance abuse and the scale of mental issues in post-primary schools; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1603","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":228,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 101 and 102 together.<\/p>  <p>  While my Department is not responsible for holding the data requested by the Deputy, it does have an important role to play in supporting the wellbeing of all in the school community.

The procedures include specific requirements in relation to the use of prevention and education strategies and the consistent investigation, follow up and recording of bullying behaviour amongst pupils. There is a requirement in the procedures for the School Principal to report regularly to the Board of Management on the overall number of bullying cases and provide confirmation that they are being dealt with in accordance with the anti-bullying procedures. The Board is also required, under the procedures, to undertake an annual review of the school's anti-bullying policy and its implementation by the school. Written confirmation that the review has been completed must be available and published on the school website. There is no requirement for reporting centrally to the Department. My Department's approach in the procedures is that the Inspectorate, as part of its inspection of schools, specifically examine schools compliance with the anti-bullying procedures including the actions taken to create a positive school culture and to prevent and tackle bullying. <\/p>  <p>  My Department is working along with other Government Departments and agencies to support the full implementation of the national drug strategy - Reducing Harm, Supporting Recovery 2017-2025 &ndash; participating on both the National Oversight Committee   leading and directing on its implementation and on the Strategy Standing Sub Committee on the overall co-ordination and implementation of the strategy actions.

NEPS teams offer training and guidance for teachers in the provision of universal and targeted evidence-informed approaches and early intervention to promote children&rsquo;s wellbeing, social, emotional and academic development.  NEPS psychologists provide a Support and Development service to schools that includes planning meetings, consultation, cluster group meetings and more formal teacher professional learning opportunities which includes teacher professional learning programmes such as the Friends Resilience Programmes and the Incredible Years Social Emotional learning programme.  These programmes have been welcomed by schools and their impact positively evaluated.  My Department is working to adapt these programmes for online delivery later in the academic year. <\/p>  <p>  NEPS also supports school leaders and teachers to establish and operate student support teams.  Student Support Teams are part of the student support system in a school. <\/p>  <p>  At primary level Social, Personal, Health Education (SPHE) is mandatory and it supports the personal development, health and well-being of young people and helps them create and maintain supportive relationships. Since September 2020, the Professional Development Service for Teachers (PDST) Primary Health and Wellbeing team have been providing bespoke (virtual) CPD and support to schools in the following areas; Teaching and Learning in SPHE (including visual arts), Stay Safe Programme, RSE, Anti-bullying (including Internet Safety and Cyber-bullying), Teacher Wellbeing and Restorative Practice. PDST&rsquo;s Wellbeing support is rooted in the SPHE curriculum. <\/p>  <p>  At post primary level, all students commencing Junior Cycle from September 2017 onwards undertake the area of learning called Wellbeing.

Due to the current context, PDST&rsquo;s Mental Health Seminar has been postponed until 2021. Since September 2020, PDST advisors have facilitated online bespoke in-school support. During PDST&rsquo;s support engagements, they have supported schools through facilitated dialogue around Junior and Senior Cycle SPHE and RSE.<\/p>  <p>  The Wellbeing Policy Statement and Framework for Practice was published by my Department in July 2018 and sets out the ambition and vision of the Department that the promotion of wellbeing will be at the core of the ethos of every school.  The policy describes how schools can best promote wellbeing.  The Wellbeing Policy Statement indicates that schools should adopt a whole-school, multi-component, preventative approach to wellbeing promotion that includes both universal and targeted interventions.   <\/p>  <p>  Since the policy was published, significant work has taken place to realise the vision set out. A Wellbeing Office has been established in NEPS to support the implementation of the Wellbeing Policy and a Wellbeing Steering Group, oversees the implementation of the Policy.  In order to develop the required Continuing Professional Development (CPD) and resources for schools, the Department worked with 30 schools (10 post primary and 20 primary) in an Action Research Project to support the implementation of the Wellbeing Promotion Process.  The work was led by the PDST in collaboration with Junior Cycle Teachers (JCT) and NEPS. This findings from this research project will assist the Department in reviewing and planning for the needs of schools and centres for education in relation to wellbeing promotion nationally. <\/p>  <p>  A number of key resources have been made available to schools and further supports will be made available.  These include Statements of Effective Practice to guide and standardise the approach to reviewing wellbeing promotion in schools, parent, teacher and student questionnaires and directories of CPD and online support available from the Department, its support services and the HSE in the area of wellbeing<\/p>  <p>  My Department will continue the coordinated implementation of the Department&rsquo;s Wellbeing Policy over the coming months.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020112500066#WRG01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"question","counter":235,"qnumday":106,"qnumall":"[38998\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020112500066#WRG01500","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the training and support available to teachers in primary schools in order to deal with the mental health issues of students; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1603","askee":"1582"},{"type":"question","counter":236,"qnumday":107,"qnumall":"[38999\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020112500066#WRG01600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the training and support available to teachers in post-primary schools in order to deal with the mental health issues of students; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1603","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":237,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 106 and 107 together.<\/p>  <p>  There are a number of ways in which teachers are supported to deal with matters relating to wellbeing and mental health.

It is important to note that entitlement to these supports is not contingent on the nature of the illness\/disability but on the extent to which a particular illness or disability impairs or restricts a person&rsquo;s capacity to work.<\/p>  <p>  In March of this year, under the Health (Preservation and Protection and other Emergency Measures in the Public Interest) Act 2020 (No. 1) and subsequent regulations, the Government provided for entitlement to illness benefit for persons who have been diagnosed with Covid-19 or are a probable source of infection with Covid-19.<\/p>  <p>  The rate of payment of the enhanced Illness Benefit payment in respect of Covid-19 is higher than the normal maximum personal rate for a limited period.  The measures were designed to ensure that where a registered medical practitioner or a HSE medical officer diagnoses a person with Covid-19 or identifies him or her as a probable source of infection of Covid-19, the person can comply with medical advice to isolate, while having their income protected.  This is essential to limit and slow down the spread of the virus, to keep the number of people affected to a minimum, and to reduce a peak of cases which would cause extreme pressure on the health system.<\/p>  <p>  The enhanced rate of Illness Benefit was brought in as a short-term public health measure and is not a long-term income support payment.  It is payable for 2 weeks where a person is isolating as a probable source of infection of Covid-19 and up to 10 weeks where a person has been diagnosed with Covid-19. The purpose of the enhanced Illness Benefit payment in respect of Covid-19 is to encourage people to not go to work due to financial constraint when they should be in isolation.  <\/p>  <p>  In a case where a person continues to be ill beyond 10 weeks, standard Illness Benefit may be paid for an extended period, based on the person&rsquo;s continued eligibility.  Illness Benefit is the primary income support payment for people who are unable to attend work due to illness of any type.  Additional payments may also be made in respect of a qualified adult and qualifying children.<\/p>  <p>  Apart from these income supports, my Department also provides a support under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme.

Both options were subject to qualification criteria and neither required the CE participant to undertake any training resulting in the achievement of a major QQI award.<\/p><p>In 2017 the new conditions and qualifying criteria were introduced and a saver clause was provided for the existing clients:<\/p><p>&lsquo;Participants who commenced on CE prior to 3rd July 2017 will be entitled to remain under their existing CE eligibility rules, where this is to their advantage.  If it is more advantageous to the person, the current criteria can be applied.&rsquo;<\/p><p>The saver clause that was introduced allowed CE participants who commenced under that option to continue on CE for a maximum of three consecutive years with or without working towards a QQI major award, whichever was more advantageous. The 2017 saver clause does not allow those affected to continue to participate on CE for six years consecutively.<i><\/i><\/p><p>The same continuous limitation of three years continues to apply to all CE participants both pre and post 2017.  CE participation was never intended to be long-term and the maximum continued participation on CE is three years. <\/p><p>In general CE placements for new entrants aged between 21 and 55 years are for one year.  CE participants who are working towards a Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI) major award can seek to extend their participation on CE by up to two years to enable them to reach the required standard of qualification. CE participants aged 55 years or older can remain on CE for three years and do not have to work towards a QQI major award. In either scenario, a maximum of three consecutive year's participation on CE is permissible.  A person may re-qualify for CE after a twelve month break once they satisfy the qualifying conditions.  An overall lifetime limit of six years applies to all CE participants (seven years for those on a disability payment).  The same rules and eligibility criteria attached to participation on CE are applied throughout the country.  <\/p><p>The priority for my Department is to ensure that all employment and activation programmes have the best outcomes for participants.

The NCCIS has been fully implemented in all Tusla areas and is the central repository\/ archive for current children in care records.

Tusla assesses all child welfare and protection concerns that are reported to it.<\/p><p>The Children First Act 2015, which was fully commenced in December 2017, provides for a number of key child protection measures. These include awareness raising, providing for mandatory reporting of child protection concerns by certain categories of persons and improving safeguarding arrangements in organisations providing services to children. The Act operates alongside the non-statutory obligations provided for in Children First: National Guidance for the Protection and Welfare of Children 2017, which sets out how all reasonable concerns about a child should be reported to Tusla. The Act recognises that a child&rsquo;s welfare includes their emotional welfare while the Guidance sets out definitions of abuse, including emotional abuse, and signs for its recognition. <\/p><p>Referrals to Tusla regarding the possible harm to a child from a parent are assessed in line with Tusla&rsquo;s policies, procedures and best practice. Tusla has advised that its child protection and welfare assessment considers any past harm and any future danger to a child as a result of complicating factors in a child's environment. These factors include any parental behaviour that is deemed to have a negative impact on a child resulting in them being seriously harmed, including the behaviours that would indicate emotional abuse. Tusla also considers any strengths and existing safety present for the child in the context of the harm and then works collaboratively with parents, professionals and others to create effective safety for the child into the future.<\/p><p>However, parental alienation is a very challenging and complex issue. It generally arises in situations of extreme inter-parental conflict, which can result in children withdrawing from one parent without the other parent deliberately directing them to do so, but as a response to the conflict. Mediation can sometimes offer parents an opportunity to work through issues arising. <\/p><p>Tusla social work staff are supported in their professional and evidence informed assessments by access to an online evidence informed toolkit that provides detailed up-to-date research and recommended interventions on key areas such as attachment, critical analysis and thinking, child development, the impact of abuse, separation and loss and parenting capacity. Tusla also provides all staff with access to an entire research centre  with relevant current research and publications relevant to child protection and welfare practice. In addition to regular professional supervision, this ensures staff are supported in maintaining their expertise in an ongoing and supportive learning environment.<\/p><p>Tusla works collaboratively with child and adult mental health services, the Courts and other therapeutic services in respect of any relevant matters referred to it, including in relation to necessary interventions to support the safety and wellbeing of a child.  <\/p><p>The Programme for Government contains a commitment to enact a Family Court Bill. The Family Court Bill will be a key element in the development of a more efficient and user-friendly family court system that puts families at the centre of its activities, provides access to specialist supports and encourages the use of alternative dispute resolution in family law proceedings. The Department of Justice has recently established the Family Justice Oversight Group. This Group will agree a high-level vision and key medium and longer-term objectives for the development of a national family justice system, in parallel with the establishment of a dedicated Family Court structure, as envisaged by the forthcoming Family Court Bill.

The Bill is scheduled for Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il on 1 December 2020.   <\/p>  <p>  Yesterday, I secured Cabinet approval to bring forward amendments to the Harassment, Harmful Communications and Related Offences Bill to provide for two new offences to deal with the non-consensual distribution of intimate images. <\/p>  <p>  The first offence will deal with the taking, distribution, publication or threat to distribute intimate images without consent, and with intent to cause harm to the victim. It is intended to carry a maximum penalty of an unlimited fine and\/or 7 years&rsquo; imprisonment.<\/p>  <p>  The second offence will deal with the taking, distribution or publication of intimate images without consent without a requirement that the person intended to cause harm to the victim. It is intended that this offence will carry a maximum penalty of a &euro;5,000 fine and\/or 12 months&rsquo; imprisonment.<\/p>  <p>  The amendments proposed also provide that it will be irrelevant that a person may have consented to the taking of an image if it is subsequently published or distributed without their consent. It will be an aggravating factor for the purposes of sentencing if the perpetrator of the offence is or was in an intimate relationship with the victim of the offence.<\/p>  <p>  Further amendments approved by Cabinet will update harassment legislation to broaden the scope of the offence of harassment to cover all forms of persistent communications about a person, not just indecent images, and to increase the penalty from seven to ten years to reflect the harm that can be caused by most serious forms of harassment. <\/p>  <p>  Harassment and abuse in any form, whether online or otherwise, is utterly unacceptable and has no place in Irish society. I am, along with my Government colleagues, fully committed to tackling abusive behaviour in all forms. The standards of what is unacceptable in an online setting must be consistent with those in traditional settings, and cross government initiatives are underway to address this. <\/p>  <p>  Progression of the Harassment, Harmful Communications and Related Offences Bill is a priority action for me as Minister for Justice and I am committed to seeing it enacted as quickly as possible. I would like to acknowledge the cooperation of Deputy Brendan Howlin in advancing the proposed amendments and I very much welcome the support expressed by all for this legislation.

It provides residential care for up to 60 residents and approximately 120 day care places per week. All service users have a diagnosis of dementia. The majority of the residential places receive funding support through the Nursing Homes Support Scheme (NHSS). Separately, the HSE contracts for approximately 25 Day Care places per day at St Joseph&rsquo;s. <\/p>  <p>  The NHSS, commonly referred to as Fair Deal, is a system of financial support for people who require long-term residential care. Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost. The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings. <\/p>  <p>  The National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) has been designated by the Minister for Health pursuant to Section 40 of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009 as a body authorised to negotiate with proprietors of non-HSE registered nursing homes to reach agreement in relation to the maximum price(s) that can be charged for the provision of long-term residential care services to NHSS residents. <\/p>  <p>  As part of this function, the NTPF will enter into \"Approved Nursing Home Agreements\" with registered private and voluntary nursing homes to record the maximum price(s) that have been negotiated. It will be appreciated that particulars of all such negotiations and reviews are a matter between the nursing home and the NTPF. Accordingly, the NTPF does not discuss publicly the details of negotiations with individual nursing homes.  <\/p>  <p>  The NTPF has statutory independence and as Minister of State for Mental Health and Older People, I have no role in NHSS price negotiations.

The issue of granting medical cards based on having a particular disease or illness was previously examined in 2014 by the HSE Expert Panel on Medical Need and Medical Card Eligibility. The Group concluded that it was not feasible, desirable, nor ethically justifiable to list medical conditions in priority order for medical card eligibility.  In following the Expert Group&rsquo;s advice, a person&rsquo;s means remains the main qualifier for a medical card.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE has however a compassionate system in place for the provision of medical cards when it is informed that a patient is receiving end of life treatment &ndash; that is when patients&rsquo; unfortunately have a prognosis of less than 12 months. These applications do not require a means assessment nor are they reassessed. There are currently almost 1,800 such medical cards awarded. Separately, terminally ill patients who do not meet the end of life criteria may also qualify for a medical card under the general assessment processes. Every effort is made by the HSE, within the framework of the Health Act 1970, to support applicants in applying for a medical card and to take full account of the difficult circumstances, such as extra costs arising from an illness.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, since 2015 medical cards are awarded without the need of a financial assessment to all children under 18 years of age with a diagnosis of cancer.<\/p>  <p>  It should also be noted that the Programme for Government &lsquo;Our Shared Future&rsquo; contains a commitment to extend discretionary medical cards to those with a terminal illness. A HSE Clinical Advisory Group (CAG) was established in December 2019 to review eligibility for medical cards in cases of terminal illness. The final Report of the CAG was recently submitted to my Department and has been published. The Report notes that there are practical and legal challenges with extending eligibility for medical cards for terminally ill patients within the framework of the current process. <\/p>  <p>  However, I wish to assure the Deputy that I am committed to ensuring that terminally ill patients have access to the services they need.  In that regard, my Department has devised a work programme which has been initiated and which will look to address the policy and legal findings of the Report and deliver on the Programme for Government commitment. This will include an examination within the next 12 weeks of potential options on a legislative framework to extend eligibility in such cases.

There will be delays associated with the requirement to cease works on the site of the new Children&rsquo;s Hospital due to Covid-19 restrictions. As of March 2020, when the site closed due to Covid-19, the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board (NPHDB) was of the view that the Main Contractor was behind schedule on the construction works.   <\/p>  <p>  The current overall capital build cost of the project is &euro;1,433bn.  This includes all of the capital cost for the main hospital at St James's Hospital campus, the two Outpatient Department and urgent care centres at Connolly and Tallaght Hospital campuses, equipment for the three sites, and the construction of the carpark and retail spaces.  The &euro; 1.43bn figure on capital cost as set out above does not take account of the impact of COVID on the construction sector, including the NCH. <\/p>  <p>  In addition to the capital project there is a broader programme of activity associated with the integration and transfer of the services of the three children&rsquo;s hospitals to the new sites under development.

The timing and level of expenditure is dependent on the completion of approved works by the project promoters and the submission of claims for payment. <\/p>  <p>  Overall, the requirements for LEADER are managed year-on-year from within my Department's Vote. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020112500077#WRS04500","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic Supports","counter":721,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020112500078#WRT00300"},{"type":"question","counter":722,"qnumday":286,"qnumall":"[38923\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020112500078#WRT00400","dept":"Department of Rural and Community Development","minister":"Minister for Rural and Community Development","question":"the Covid-19 supports put in place to assist the charity sector since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1572","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":723,"content":"<p>Through our ongoing engagement with the Community and Voluntary sector including charities, my Department is keenly aware of the challenges faced by the sector whilst meeting increased demands on many of their services. My Department is providing additional vital supports to rural and community organisations in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. It is supporting the following initiatives:<\/p>  <p>  On 16 March 2020, my Department launched the COVID-19 Government Action Plan in partnership with other Departments, State agencies and our extensive network of community and voluntary organisations. These initiatives provide support for volunteering, funding to ALONE for their crisis telephone support line, and an email helpdesk facility to assist smaller community groups with their queries. <\/p>  <p>  On 11 May 2020, a &euro;40 million support package for the Community and Voluntary Sector, Charities and Social Enterprises was launched by Government and is administered by the Department. This funding is being made available through the Dormant Accounts Fund, which is specifically set aside to support initiatives which will benefit the most disadvantaged groups in society.<\/p>  <p>  The package included:<\/p>  <p>- A &euro;35 million COVID-19 Stability Fund providing a level of support to qualifying organisations who are most in need and have seen their trading and\/or fundraising income drop significantly during the crisis. An additional &euro;10M was allocated to this fund as part of the Budget 2021 process and my Department is currently finalising the distribution of this additional funding. To date 590 organisations including many charities have been allocated almost &euro;31M under this fund; and<\/p>  <p>- A &euro;5 million Government commitment to a Philanthropy Fund, (Innovate Together) which focuses on supporting responses to the COVID-19 crisis that require innovative and adaptive solutions to existing and emerging challenges. To date, 52 organisations have been allocated a funding value of approximately &euro;3.2 million. A second round of applications are currently being assessed and it is anticipated that the successful awardees will be announced in early December<\/p>  <p>  On 9 April 2020, an initial &euro;2.5 million COVID-19 Emergency Fund was introduced to provide immediate and urgently needed funding to community and voluntary groups that are participating in the Government&rsquo;s &ldquo;Community Call&rdquo; initiative which is being led by the Local Authorities. <\/p>  <p>  My Department currently supports over 420 community organisations under the Community Services Programme (CSP) to provide local services through a social enterprise model.  As a result of COVID-19 my Department also developed a &euro;1.2m Support Fund to assist all CSP supported organisations to continue to retain their CSP supported employees on their payroll, during this crisis period. The Fund provided additional funding for a number of weeks to many of these organisations. Pobal, who manage the programme on behalf of the Department, have undertaken a detailed review of the financial position of all the CSP supported organisations, as their ability to generate income has been greatly hampered by the Covid-19 crisis in many cases.  The outcome of this review will inform decision regarding any additional supports that might be required by these organisations.  The Department should be in a position to make an announcement on this matter very shortly and any additional supports to be provided will be considered in light of available resources.<\/p>  <p>  The CL&Aacute;R programme provides funding for small scale infrastructure projects in rural areas that have experienced significant levels of de-population.  In 2020, the supports provided through CL&Aacute;R have been tailored to help rural communities respond to the new COVID-19 environment, including the new Meals on Wheels and Linked Services measure. This measure provides funding to community organisations for the purchase of kitchen or food delivery equipment and vehicle adaptations that may be necessary as a result of new public health advice.  Funding of almost &euro;340,000 was announced for 45 successful projects on Friday, November 20th.<\/p>  <p>  The Department worked with Pobal to put in place guidance for community and voluntary groups regarding reopening after the initial lockdown.  This guidance is updated regularly by the Department as the situation develops, and is now focussed on operating safely.<\/p>  <p>  In respect of the Department&rsquo;s other programmes, funding commitments are being maintained, and though delays may be experienced in delivery for a period of time it is expected that all projects and initiatives will continue when safe to do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020112500078#WRT00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1563"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Procurement Contracts","counter":724,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020112500078#WRT00600"},{"type":"question","counter":725,"qnumday":287,"qnumall":"[39055\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020112500078#WRT00700","dept":"Department of Rural and Community Development","minister":"Minister for Rural and Community Development","question":"if her Department and any commercial or non-commercial State bodies and private entities subsidised by 50% or more of public funding under the aegis of her Department have implemented social clauses in their public procurement contracts in the past three years (details supplied); and if so, the nature of these social clauses.","asker":"1579","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":726,"content":"<p>I can confirm that Social Clauses, through public procurement processes, have been implemented by my Department and also by one entity under its aegis.<\/p>  <p>  Public Libraries, which my Department has policy responsibility for, issued a call for proposals to library authorities in December 2019 for the provision of sensory facilities and equipment in public libraries. <\/p>  <p>  The call advised that consideration be given to the inclusion of a social consideration clause that would encourage the engagement of Social Enterprises as part of the process of tendering for the supply of goods and services in this field. The call document provided examples of potential social consideration clauses that could be applied such as, reserved lots for social enterprises, or dedicated\/weighted marks for social enterprise applicants. <\/p>  <p>  My Department provided funding at a standard rate of 75% of total eligible costs incurred but the rate increased to 80% for library authorities who included a social consideration clause in their procurement process. <\/p>  <p>  In response to the call, the Department received applications for 49 projects from 30 library authorities, all of which were approved, and six of the projects submitted by four library authorities (Leitrim, Longford, Monaghan x2, Westmeath x 2) included a social consideration clause.<\/p>  <p>  Pobal, which works on behalf of Government is an agency under the aegis of my Department.
