Apologies have been received from Deputy Cormac Devlin.  In order to limit the risk of spreading Covid-19, I ask that all those in attendance wear face coverings when not addressing the committee.  The service requests that members continue to wear face coverings when moving about the campus and when in close proximity to others, and to be respectful of other people's physical space.  We urge people to heed the public health advice.  Members of the committee who are attending remotely must do so within the precincts of Leinster House.  This is due to the constitutional requirement that in order to participate in the public meetings, members must be physically present within the confines of the place the Parliament has chosen to sit.<\/p> <p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, is a permanent witness to the committee.  This morning we will engage with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to examine the 2020 appropriation accounts for Vote 20.<\/p> <p>  We are joined in the committee room by officials from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na: Mr. Drew Harris, Garda Commissioner; Dr. Shawna Coxon, deputy commissioner for strategy, governance and performance; Mr. Joseph Nugent, chief administrative officer; and Ms Kathryna Clifford, executive director, finance and services.  We are also joined by Ms Marianne Nolan, principal officer in the Justice Vote section of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  You are all very welcome.<\/p> <p>  I ask those attending remotely to mute their microphones when not contributing so that we do not pick up any background noise or feedback.  As usual, I remind all of those in attendance to ensure their mobile phones are on silent mode or switched off.<\/p> <p>  Before starting, I will explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses in respect of references witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  Within the precincts of Leinster House, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the presentation they make to the committee.  This means that they have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they may say at the meeting.  However, they are expected not to abuse this privilege and it is my duty as Cathaoirleach to ensure it is not abused.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue and it is imperative that they comply with such directions.<\/p> <p>  Members are reminded of the provisions within Standing Order 218 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government, or a Minister of the Government, or the merits of the objectives of such policies.<\/p> <p>  Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise, or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<\/p> <p>  I now call on the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, for his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022033100002#A00400","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648715400,"counter":9,"content":"<p>The 2020 appropriation account for Vote 20 - An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na recorded gross expenditure of &euro;1.93 billion.  This was an increase of almost &euro;134 million, or 7%, on the prior year.  Almost two thirds of the expenditure was related to payments of salaries, wages and allowances, which totalled &euro;1.23 billion in 2020.  A further &euro;354 million was spent on pension and gratuity payments to retired garda&iacute;.  These two areas account for over 80% of voted expenditure in 2020.<\/p> <p>  Most of the larger Votes are presented in terms of expenditure in relation to key functions or service areas.  In contrast, Vote 20 is presented mainly in terms of expenditure by resource type or input classifications.  These include standard administration input costs, as well as costs associated with construction and maintenance of buildings, vehicle purchase and operation, and IT and communication systems.  As a result of this budgeting and accounting approach, the account does not disclose the cost of individual Garda outputs and deliverables, such as community policing, traffic policing, white-collar crime investigation or other specialist functions. <\/p> <p>  At the end of 2020, approximately 17,800 whole-time equivalent staff were employed with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

My team has already been introduced to the committee.<\/p> <p>  The 2020 gross expenditure of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was &euro;1.94 billion.  After taking account of appropriations-in-aid of &euro;115 million, the net expenditure was just over &euro;1.8 billion.  Funding is provided to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na through Vote 20 and it supports all of our policing activities.  The year 2020 was an unprecedented year due to the Covid-19 pandemic and was an extremely challenging year for policing and for all of our citizens.  Public health was of the utmost importance and required unparalleled restrictions on freedom of movement of people, normal business activities, sporting and social activities.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was tasked with policing and supporting the Government, the community and businesses on the measures imposed due to Covid-19.  As an organisation, we responded quickly, and in doing so garda&iacute; and staff members demonstrated commitment, flexibility and resilience in this emergency, and dedication to the continued protection of our society and citizens.<\/p><p> Some immediate actions undertaken included maximising the availability of garda&iacute; for high-visibility community policing, which necessitated new roster arrangements, restrictions on annual leave, the postponement of some retirements, the acceleration of the attestation of some 300 student garda&iacute; and the allocation of additional garda&iacute; to front-line duties.  Operation Fanacht was put in place and this consisted of an extensive network of thousands of checkpoints established across the country, with more than 2,500 garda&iacute; involved with these checkpoints daily at the height of the restrictions.  Other activities included supporting members of the public and community who were cocooning.  We delivered essential supplies, including food and medicines, worked with the Government on Covid-19 emergency legislation and the provision of Covid-19 advice with our office of internal communications, OIC.<\/p><p> Importantly, 2020 also saw the launch of Operation Faoiseamh in response to the increase in domestic abuse-related calls received by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na during the Covid-19 pandemic.  The objective of this operation was to provide enhanced support and protection to victims of domestic abuse, and 22,795 contacts and attempted contacts were made by members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with victims of domestic abuse during 2020.  The organisation also responded to more than 43,000 calls for assistance in respect of domestic abuse incidents and more than 11,600 criminal charges were created in 2020 for crimes involving an element of domestic abuse, including breaches of domestic violence orders.  We also accelerated the implementation of technology across the organisation, providing the platform for personnel to move quickly to remote working and the provision of 3,000 mobile data stations to front-line garda&iacute;.  We also provided essential personal protective equipment, PPE, in an effective manner to our members and staff during this time, resulting in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na maintaining an employee resilience rate of approximately 95%.<\/p><p> In addition to policing activity related to Covid-19 measures, normal policing services continued.  This was essential for the prevention, detection and investigation of crime, which continued to be committed.  An example was the collection of more than &euro;45 million related to seizures of illicit drugs and cash.  Numerous firearms and thousands of rounds of ammunition were also seized.  Work also continued on cybercrime, with some 400 new cases reported and 333 cases closed in 2020.<\/p><p> Policing activity in Ireland is funded in the main through the Exchequer, and while the activities required due to the impact of Covid-19 pandemic can make comparisons with other times somewhat difficult, I am confident as the Accounting Officer of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that public moneys under my control were expended in 2020 in accordance with the ethos of value for money and investing in the future of our services on behalf of the Government and our citizens.  This investment included maintaining and building the capital structure to support our policing.  We continue to invest in our fleet, which is obviously an essential resource for Garda operations, and we reached a record number of 3,100 vehicles in 2020.  In line with Government policies on sustainability, climate change and low carbon emissions, we are in the process of developing strategies to move to a more sustainable fleet of electric vehicles, EVs, and a pilot programme is in place.<\/p><p> The property portfolio in use by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is extensive.  It includes more than 560 stations and a range of other national support, administrative and specialist facilities.  As the structure of the organisation evolves, there is also a need to ensure the estate aligns with evolving operational needs.  A number of refurbishments and upgrades were completed in 2020 and work commenced on the site of a new Garda security and crime operations centre at Military Road.  Not all the bureaux currently based in Harcourt Square will be transferring to the new centre at Military Road, with some being allocated elsewhere.  Accommodation solutions are being provided by the Office of Public Works, OPW, to meet the requirements of all these bureaux.  Accommodation is a crucial element of facilitating policing activities and we must further future-proof in this area.  Hence, my officials continue to engage with the OPW on capital and maintenance works across Ireland.  This includes an exciting project where we are working with the OPW in Dublin City Council on the proposed development of a substantial new Garda station and facilities on Dublin City Council lands at the corner of the R139 and Malahide Road at Northern Cross.<\/p><p> My officials have provided a written response on the implementation of the committee's previous recommendations.  While the pandemic has impacted the rate of progress on some of these matters, I assure the Chair and members that I take the committee's recommendations very seriously and that we are working on completing the implementation stage.<\/p><p> Tragically, we were all given a stark reminder in 2020 of the risks run by garda&iacute; while carrying out their duties when our esteemed colleague, Detective Garda Colm Horkan, was killed on duty on 17 June 2020.  Colm had served his local community for 24 years and was well known and respected for his police work and community work, particularly with his local GAA team.<\/p><p> I take this opportunity to thank most sincerely all the people who worked in and with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for the delivery of policing services during the Covid-19 pandemic and the Minister and the Department of Justice for their assistance and support.  I also thank the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, and his staff for their work and the committee for the time provided for this opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022033100002#A00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Drew Harris","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648715400,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I thank the Commissioner.

Has An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na increased the mental health supports it provides for members of the force serving on the front line?  Garda&iacute; on the streets are facing new challenges.  Unfortunately, we also saw a major increase in online abuse directed at garda&iacute;, which proved difficult for some members of the force to deal with.

As the Commissioner said, we recognise the need to engage with our members and to provide supports for members who are dealing with traumatic circumstances all the time.  In recent years, we have invested in a range of different options in providing those supports.  These have included matters like a confidential, independently-run 24-7 counselling service being made available to members.  Our chief medical officer, who takes the lead in this area, has got agreement for and has put in place a new well-being strategy for the organisation in general.  In the last year, we have launched a specific app that provides a range of supports and advice in this regard, including contact details for our existing services.  Our employee assistance service has officers around the country delivering that piece.  Peer supports are provided by colleagues who are in a position to provide guidance and assistance and technical supports are provided by independent agencies.  It is an area we feel we need to do more on, and certainly the well-being strategy will see us do more in this area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022033100002#B00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Joseph Nugent"},{"type":"speech","time":1648715400,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I thank the Commissioner and Mr. Nugent for their responses.

We have set in place a very high standard in respect of the response to domestic abuse.  In effect, what was happening was that our processes were not being followed in respect of those domestic abuse calls.  The actual act of cancellation of a call can be warranted because we have calls that can resolve themselves, for example, alarm calls, calls by other agencies for assistance which are then resolved and also multiple and duplicate calls for, say, a serious road traffic collision.  The numbers are huge but we found when we worked through the cases that the numbers distil down to 5,871 incidents that we had particular concerns about.  Of those, we found there was an invalid closure in 2,689 cases, in that a PULSE incident should have been opened.  A CAD incident was opened but in 2,689 incidents a PULSE incident was not opened.  Of those, we have created 2,316 incidents and have uncovered what we believe is 134 crimes not recorded.<\/p> <p>  All the reasons for invalid cancellations have been analysed.  There are almost 20 reasons, one of which is very prevalent.  In 28% of cases, or over 800 calls, the call was cancelled by the caller.  In other cases, there was either no offence, or the case was closed or cancelled by the car crew.  That is where we run into problems because if a caller rings back and says they want to cancel a call, it is our policy that we should still attend, investigate and follow through in completion of a PULSE incident.  There was a breakdown in terms of practice and behaviour within the control rooms but also among those responding.  We have addressed that in terms of processes around who can cancel - only supervisors can cancel - and then dip sampling and supervision.

We have very powerful women represented throughout the senior leadership team and senior management within the organisation.  All of that is positive with respect to the outlook, behaviour and culture within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  There is obviously more to do.  We hosted a recent International Association of Women Police conference and that really threw down the gauntlet about what else might be done in respect of increasing the number of women within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, particularly within the ranks of those who are sworn members.  I am very conscious I am sitting beside Deputy Commissioner Coxon.

When we speak to women across the organisation those things are pivotal to deciding how long they stay and whether they come into the organisation at all.  In addition, we have a women's support network now.  It was championed by the Commissioner and has been in place for just under two years.  The benefit of that is in women coming together and sharing what barriers they see from their lived experience in the organisation and in looking at how we can get those barriers out of the way in order to we can encourage women not only to come into the organisation but to stay in it.

Moreover, stations that may have been open only once or twice a week have had a member or maybe two members assigned to them.  All of that is positive.  We still have growth yet to come of some 700 to 800 members, and that is positive as well.  The number of Garda staff we employ should free up more Garda members for front-line duties but that will include staffing the national units as well.<\/p> <p>  There is always more demand than we can meet.

When he was first appointed, he stated that crime is not like rain and does not fall equally everywhere.  Unfortunately, the community I represent, which incudes Ballymun, Finglas, Glasnevin and Santry, has disproportionate levels of crime.  I was involved with Dublin City Council on the Ballymun - A Brighter Future report by Andrew Montague.  That report refers to the level of policing in our community and the level of crime.  For an area with such a high murder rate, we have one of the lowest rates of policing in the country.  The average rate is 2.8 garda&iacute; per 1,000 population.  Our rate is 2.3 garda&iacute; per 1,000 population.  If we discount from the district the 45 garda&iacute; in Dublin Airport because they are not accessible in a community sense, we drop down to 2.1 garda&iacute; per 1,000 population.  Has the Commissioner done work with the Pobal deprivation index on hotspots of crime and how resources are allocated?

I am sure if one is in a fit-for-purpose building, one's morale is that bit higher and so forth.<\/p> <p>  I support Deputy Colm Burke's point about the need to ensure resources are deployed.  I might have views with regard to Fermoy and Mallow, for instance.  I might be a bit parochial about the fact that we found it strange that it was going to Macroom, but that is a matter of policy.  We need to ensure that resources are deployed in terms of capital expenditure on buildings, however, and they need to be rolled out as quickly as possible.

My apologies if I have missed important points but I cannot attend both meetings simultaneously.<\/p> <p>  I wish to follow up on the questions of Deputy Catherine Murphy in respect of the Garda diversion programme and the JLO scheme.  I have an interest in this as I was on the section 44 committee from 2015 to 2019.  It was a valuable insight.  I really admire the work that Colette Quinn and others do in that section.  To my mind, it is a quasi-judicial office of significant importance where one is making decisions about children's lives and whether they go through the criminal justice system, but also whether they are getting appropriate welfare-based interventions An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has identified they need.  I have a concern in this regard.  This is important in terms of cost in an ongoing way because if these interventions can be identified and made appropriate at this stage, it can have significant effects.  I acknowledge the issue raised by Deputy Catherine Murphy but my understanding is that where a decision is made not to prosecute and that what is necessary is a welfare-based referral, that may take the form of anger management interventions or sexual awareness interventions, for example.  Those responses are largely Tusla-based or with another agency, such as addiction-based responses.  Deputy Bacik and I were in the D&oacute;chas Centre and in Mountjoy on Monday as co-convenors of the penal reform group.  The two big issues identified as being faced in both communities were addiction and mental health.  Difficulties in respect of training and education for those who were going to engage in that were preceded by an urgent need to deal with both those issues.  My concern is that I am not sure how much visibility An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has in respect of the follow-up to those welfare-based referrals.  Is it getting reports back that the young individual or child had access to the referral and attended it and what the outcome, if any, has been?  I am not sure whether it is the job of the Garda to have that information but it seems to me that if a quasi-judicial decision not to prosecute is being made on the basis that a referral is what the child needs, it should have the information in some way.  We have always argued that there should be a Tusla presence in the Garda youth diversion programme to provide for a seamless link between the programme office and Tusla to make sure the Garda is able to satisfy itself that those referrals have been completed.  I ask Mr. Harris to address that issue.

The Commissioner is quite right that the success of the Garda youth diversion programme is astoundingly good, but what we persistently end up with is a group of young offenders who are the most active offenders but also very much the most vulnerable children in the community.<\/p><p>We have the joint agency response to crime, JARC, for adults and we have constant calls for a JARC for young offenders, bringing the Garda youth diversion programme, GYDP, up to 21 or 24 to be able to target resources very effectively at a smaller group of people who have very challenged behaviours and very challenged lives.  A lot of the referrals that the GYDP gets are &ldquo;one child, one time&rdquo; or &ldquo;one child, a very small number of times&rdquo;.  If the Garda has the quasi-judicial power to make a decision for referral, there must be some mechanism to be able to check that that is so, rather than just information sharing.  In particular, a solution along the lines of &ldquo;If they come to our attention again, we will find out what happened last time&rdquo; is by definition insufficient and there must be a stronger way of linking that back in.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022033100002#O02200","speaker":"1480","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648715400,"counter":284,"content":"<p>I would need to take that back to the national office.

In the case of InterTradeIreland, the lead is the Northern Ireland Audit Office.

We discuss between ourselves the issues that might arise.  It is complicated and there can be further complications if explanations are required, particularly if a body has to go back to parent departments in two jurisdictions.  When the explanation comes through, there are processes of presentation of the financial statements on both sides of the Border that may contribute to the delay in submitting it to the Houses.<\/p><p> I refer to the recognition of a deferred pension funding asset.  Many third level institutions, particularly universities, have other sources of income apart from grants from the State.  They need to recognise that they have accrued pension liabilities but if they did not recognise a matching pension funding asset the picture on their balance sheets would be distorted and it would look like they were insolvent.  However, the expectation is that it might be 50 years before these liabilities are drawn down.  They are effectively assuming that the Exchequer will meet the pension liabilities as they arise.  Because they do not have a guarantee that the State will do that, I am drawing attention to it.  It is something we have been doing for many years.

It is possible to accrue leave of the amount in this example, which was 41 days.  I understand that in this particular case the chief executive expected to be leaving earlier in the year, which was 2020.

This is beginning with the presentation of accounts for 2021.  Members will recall that we wrote to the Department proposing a number of changes to the format and content of the appropriation accounts.  The Secretary General agreed to examine the proposal for the 2022 accounts, and it was subsequently requested that, in the interests of transparency and accountability, the remuneration of Accounting Officers should be included in the 2021 accounts.  It is welcome that this will be done and that will include a comparator for 2020.  The circular giving effect to this change was circulated to members yesterday.  I propose that the committee notes and publishes this item of correspondence; requests a progress update by the end of September this year on each of the changes to the appropriation accounts proposed by the committee and includes the matter on the agenda for our meeting with the Department of Expenditure and Reform on 19 May.<\/p> <p>  I will open this matter to the floor before seeking agreement on those proposals.

One of the things requested was remuneration details for the Accounting Officer.  It is well established as regards chief officers in other organisations that it is the actual payment in the year that is reported.  The Accounting Officer who replied regarding that on 6 January stated, in effect, the Department would consider the changes that were laid out but the circular had already issued for 2021.  In the context of changes for 2022, the Department is willing to engage in a dialogue and to look at how things might be measured and defined and so on.

Agreed.<\/p> <p>  No. 1139B is correspondence from Mr. Mark Griffin, Secretary General, Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, dated 21 March 2022, providing follow-up information requested by the committee arising from our meeting with the Department on 10 February 2022.  It includes information on the Department&rsquo;s expenditure on external advisory services relating to the national broadband plan, which amounts to in excess of &euro;16 million since 2020, and a short note on what the Department is doing to decrease its reliance on such services.  We also address this in our report on the Department&rsquo;s 2019 and 2020 accounts, which we will publish next week.  It is proposed to note and publish this correspondence.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Murphy and I wanted to raise this matter.  In reading this correspondence before the meeting, I noted that Analysys Mason received &euro;6.852 million, Ernst and Young received &euro;8.251 million and William Fry received &euro;1.3 million.  The Department sets out 28,309 interactions in total with the National Broadband Ireland contact centre and outlines the level of work.  The note in the correspondence relating to efforts to try to move away from that does not tell us an awful lot.  I wonder whether more details can be given.<\/p> <p>  On the rent and fees paid to other companies by National Broadband Ireland, despite the fact it is year one, there is already a &euro;9.4 million outlay relating to the rental of poles and ducts.  That is one we need to keep an eye on in the years ahead as the roll-out of the plan accelerates.  It was at a very early stage last year and was only barely starting.

Providing these services in house may well end up being a better option than employing consultants if the consultants are there in perpetuity.  The letter states that since the contract was signed with Analysys Mason, payments of &euro;6.95 million have been made.  I think we should ask about the duration of the contracts in each of the three cases, namely, with Analysys Mason, EY and William Fry.<\/p><p> The letter goes on to state that since the contract was signed with William Fry in 2020, payments of &euro;1.32 million have been made in respect of legal advisory services.

I take it they are.<\/p> <p>  The Accounting Officer for the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is also responsible for Vote 15 - secret service, which cannot be examined in any substantive way.  It is proposed to exclude that Vote from that agenda.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  That Vote has to do with State security.  As agreed earlier, we will also include the format and content of the appropriation accounts on the agenda for that meeting with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.<\/p> <p>  It was noted at last week's meeting that a response has not been received from Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to the committee's request for further information regarding the closure of the Benefacts database.  The Department provided a response yesterday and it will be circulated on Monday for consideration at next week's correspondence meeting.  It is also proposed to include the matter on the agenda for our meeting with the Department on 19 May.  We felt the Benefacts database was an important matter.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  As usual, if there is any specific area of interest to members and which they wish to raise, I ask them to notify the clerk so that briefing material can be requested in advance and the bodies can be prepared to engage on the issues.  Are there any other matters that members wish to raise for inclusion on the work programme?  There are not.  A list of subjects that members have mentioned is attached to the documents before committee members, if they want to review it and come back to future meetings with it.  That concludes our consideration of the work programme for today.<\/p> <p>  The final item on the agenda is any other business.  Do any members wish to raise any other matters?  If not, we will go into private session before adjourning until 7 April, when we will examine the 2020 financial statements of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission and the 2020 appropriation accounts of Vote 41 - the Policing Authority.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022033100002#HH00800","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1648715400,"counter":467,"content":"<p>The committee went into private session at 2.55 p.m. and adjourned at 3.08 p.m. until 9.30 a.m. on Thursday, 7 April 2022.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Joint Oireachtas Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine","time":1648681200,"counter":468},{"type":"unspoken","content":"<p>Th\u00e1inig an Comhchoiste le ch\u00e9ile ag 13:30<\/p><p>The Joint Committee met at 13:30<\/p><p>COMHALTA\u00cd A BH\u00cd I L\u00c1THAIR \/ MEMBERS PRESENT:<\/p><p>Teachta\u00ed D\u00e1la \/ Deputies Teachta\u00ed D\u00e1la \/ Deputies Alan Farrell, Lynn Boylan, Michael Fitzmaurice, Paul Daly, Jennifer Whitmore.

Dolan Industries is a limited small and medium enterprise, SME, company.  We are traditionally an agriculture-based company.  More than 60% of the products and services it supplies are agricultural in origin.  Today we will be discussing the massive advantages of variable rate prescription-based nutrient application in the agricultural sector.  The existing technology incorporated by Dolan Industries Limited can provide not only a monumental cost savings to Irish farmers, it can also mitigate and considerably reduce environmental impacts caused by nutrient and chemical fertiliser application.<\/p> <p>  Dolan Industries Limited is fortunate to be based in an area populated by some of the most intelligent and forward-thinking farmers on this island.  Because of the absence of vast areas of land in our area, farmers are constantly and consistently adapting to new methods to maximise their profits.  These farmers and customers have served as teachers, advisers and inspiration for the majority of the services Dolan Industries offers.  One of Dolan Industries services includes the supply and spreading of chemical-based fertilisers and it is this service that has brought us before the committee.  Dolan Industries supplies and spread between 1,300 and 1,800 tonnes of chemical fertiliser per annum.  This is a small amount in the grand scale of fertiliser sold throughout Ireland.<\/p> <p>  For this operation of almost 20 years, a simple blanket-based spreading system has been used, along with global positioning system, GPS, guidance.  This system is the most commonly used throughout Ireland.  While GPS has a good advantage in reducing overlap, it has become somewhat outdated and the old blanket-based spreading system, while adequate for its time, resulted in waste and sometimes possibly produced erratic spread patterns due to variation between granulated fertilisers and its prilled counterparts.  Dolan Industries Limited decided to begin to fully overhaul its existing fertiliser operation during the latter half of 2020 by buying the latest cutting edge technology and incorporating additional peer reviewed technology adapted from predominantly tillage-based farming.  This would include: additional upgraded GPS systems; automatic steering tractor guidance; variable rate section control; auto stop-start fertiliser spreading; and a utility vehicle, UTV, linking system from office to tractor.  Dolan industries has recently successfully incorporated and amalgamated this available technology into a grass-based setting.<\/p><p> The technology and service Dolan Industries now offers has huge benefits in reducing the negative effects on sustainability, biodiversity and environmental consequences associated with nutrient applications on farm level.<\/p><p> Prescription-based variable rate technology is the application of farm nutrients, such as compound chemical fertilisers, lime, slurry and alternative products, over a predetermined area of land utilising different precise targeted rates of application.  The advantages include a reduction in compound fertiliser.  Precise amounts of phosphorus, potassium and lime can now be applied and targeted over vast areas.  This method is used in conjunction with more environmentally-friendly nitrogen or urea-based accelerants such as protected ureas and terracan.  There is an accurate targeted approach.  Each area of land will get a precise level of various nutrients predetermined by prescription-based mapping software, which, in turn, is transferred wirelessly to the machinery to complete the application.<\/p><p>On the mitigation of environmental impacts, by pre-mapping external and internal field boundaries using specialised equipment or desktop software, we can mark areas sensitive to environmental impact.  The machinery doing the application will then be unable to spread near buffer zones and protected areas making water contamination almost impossible.  The accurate real-time uploadable and downloadable data is automatically recorded.  Utilising this technology can confidently save a farmer 15% of his annual fertiliser costs above standard nutrient application and 10% above standard GPS guided spreader application.<\/p><p> Characteristics of soil type, texture, soil pH and nutrient requirements are pinpointed to certain areas of land by collecting soil samples using GPS grid referencing and then uploaded to map-creating software.  Also marked and pinpointed are nutrient-sensitive zones, special areas of conservation, SACs, special protected areas, SPAs, water buffer zones, ground water courses, river banks and riparian margins.  Soil samples are analysed by the laboratory and the resulting data are returned and uploaded into a previously created map.  The farmer and landowner is consulted and a nutrient application plan is drawn up.  It is worth noting that data received by soil sampling enables farmers to forward buy fertilisers at different times of the year.  This may help in forward planning and improve cost savings.<\/p><p> The fertiliser, being a compound or straight depending on the best value and its application rate, is populated to the maps and then emailed or transferred to the tractor and machinery via USB.  When it is time to spread, the tractor and spreader arrives in the field and the data transfer is automatically uploaded and activated.  The tractor and spreader then automatically steers around the field and opens and closes the spreader according to the predetermined rate set through the mapping software.  A blanket spread rate using compound fertiliser is also possible.<\/p><p> It is also worth noting that any spreader using this type of technology will start and stop spreading at exactly the correct moment.  It will also continue to reduce its spreading width at angles and eventually shut off completely when nearing the sensitive areas of conservation, as previously discussed.  This removes all operator error completely.  The completed map area, rate applied, date and time is then logged and recorded.  This information can also be emailed back to the office or sent to a cloud server.<\/p><p> Dolan Industries understands fully the degradation of water quality in Ireland.  It can be associated with nitrates, phosphates and leaching from farm land.  It is the belief that, under our environmental and climate obligations, by adapting this technology water quality in Ireland can be improved as a result.<\/p><p> The benefits of using variable rate technology are not only improving but maximising crop yields; greater farm efficiency and productivity by harnessing better use of chemical and organic fertilisers; major cost saving benefits to farmers from accurate applications; no over or under application of fertilisers in each land parcel; improving soil indexes and fertility; less run off and soil leaching; greater protection of nutrient sensitive zones; and full transparency and data collection of work done.<\/p><p> Everybody here today is aware of the parabolic increase in chemical fertilisers over the past few months due primarily to the ongoing war in Ukraine.  Irish farmers, along with those in the rest of European Union, are under enormous pressure to be able to produce enough food.  While it is a precarious time, I believe it will allow for unprecedented opportunities in the agricultural sector.  The realisation that food security is of paramount importance is about to hit home shortly.<\/p><p>A percentage of farmers have not yet secured their fertiliser for this season.  Shortages, delayed delivery times and outrageous prices have resulted in a serious crisis.  The totality of this crisis has yet to play out and farmers, unable to either buy or secure fertiliser, will have no option but to de-stock and reduce production.  This will have significant unforeseen consequences for Ireland's rural economy and could have potential animal welfare repercussions this winter.<\/p><p> It should be the Government's objective to maximise food productivity in an environmentally-sustainable manner.  The technology we have incorporated can allow this immediately.  However, the immediate problem is the significant cost of fertiliser at this time.  Farmers need alternatives and they need them quickly.<\/p><p> There is one such alternative Dolan Industries Limited and Biocore Environmental Limited would like to put through its testing and analysis phase immediately.  Dolan Industries Limited along with Biocore Environmental Limited feel that Irish agriculture as a whole would benefit more from sustainable solutions by creating an indigenous supply of bio-fertiliser on the island through the use of dried digestate, liquid digestate and bio-solids from anaerobic digestion and bio-methane facilities which currently exist in the country.  This would help greatly in complementing the use of standard chemical-based fertilisers.  Currently these valuable sources of nutrients are highly sought after due to the current fertiliser crisis.  Unfortunately, these are classed as waste products and not by-products or, indeed, valuable sources of nutrients for farmers at a fraction of the price of current chemical fertilisers.  In order to change this, it is recommended that the Government fast-track legislation and classification of these highly valuable and environmentally-sustainable nutrients as products.<\/p><p> Currently the anaerobic digestion sector is in its infancy in Ireland.  However, it offers solutions in providing renewable sustainable locally-sourced and produced bio-fertilisers.  If legislation can be changed quickly, it would help avert some of the effects of this current fertiliser crisis.  This would also allow for Ireland to create its own indigenous supply of fertiliser as a result of also creating renewable energy, helping the country achieve its climate targets by the end of the decade.<\/p><p> On classifying digestates as a by-product and natural fertiliser, a reclassification would allow the anaerobic digestion industry to work side by side to grow and develop and with greater policy initiatives and measures developing the supply of renewable energy and fertiliser, tackling climate change and protecting soils and water quality.  With this in mind, combining the latest technology in terms of prescription-based variable rate nutrient application maps will offer full transparency to all relevant authorities and regulatory bodies on how and where the nutrients have been applied.  It is also recommended that these products are applied using only variable rate technology, data recording and prescription-based mapping in order to fully maximise best practice and ensure fully transparent traceability of all applications of nutrients regardless of location to all relevant authorities, locally, nationally and at European level.<\/p><p> Dolan Industries Limited is aware that there are proposals currently in place to allow farmers to get 25% of their payment through the pillar 1 eco-scheme by utilising GPS-controlled fertiliser spreading services, such as ours.  We strongly agree with and welcome this proposal which will serve as a catalyst in accelerating Ireland's environmental responsibilities.<\/p><p> Targets to reduce ammonium nitrate uses by 20% to 30% by 2030 is not only achievable by that time but, with correctly-targeted funding, can be achieved in a much shorter timeframe.  The technology incorporated by Dolan Industries Limited can be implemented and replicated on a national level in a very short timeframe as most new machinery and skilled professional contractors have the capability to achieve this.<\/p><p> Additionally, the spreader alone, while an advantage, is only capable of achieving a fraction of the economic and environmental advantages set out in this report.  Additional to the spreader, it is recommended to take and utilise up-to-date soil samples and use additional GPS receivers, mobile utility vehicles, UTVs, or desktop software for creating internal and external field boundaries, participate in equipment training and upload data to cloud software.  Only when all of this is achieved will the full extent of this technology be utilised.  As a result, Dolan Industries recommends registered agricultural contractors with appropriate training carry out this work on farms where it is unfeasible for farmers to purchase this level of machinery.<\/p><p> For Dolan Industries Limited and other agricultural contractors the initial cost of this service and equipment is intensive in both labour and resources.  Dolan Industries Limited is currently involved in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Government-backed soil sampling programme.  A joint venture between IAS Laboratories and Dr. Eoghan Finneran's company Farmeye indicates the soil test is of the utmost importance to the first stage of the variable rate technology, where and what to spread being the primary objective.  Dolan Industries Limited is aware of the continuation and expansion of the soil sampling programme and the additional funding allocated to it.<\/p><p>It is a very welcome addition to the farming and agricultural community.  Dolan Industries suggests that, along with the proposed Pillar 1 eco-scheme involving 25% additional extra funding being given to farmers willing to use the full totality this service, progressive environmentally concerned farmers should be, and must be, rewarded rather than penalised because viable alternatives are not yet mainstream.  Additional funds to be received by farmers will mitigate the large labour costs to the contractor on initial set-up.  Further payments over a three- to five-year period to maintain and continue the service are also recommended.  Without these supports in place, farmers will simply not avail of these services and will continue to apply nutrients using older outdated spreader and GPS systems.  This can only serve to subvert and undercut attempts by progressive businesses that are trying to move forward both technically and environmentally.   If environmental concerns are of paramount importance, Government support on this issue is needed quickly. <\/p><p> To summarise, Dolan Industries recommends that a Pillar 1 25% eco-scheme for GPS-guided spreaders be implemented along with the uploading of map data and information on work done to a central data server.  The reclassification of digestate and bio-solids as a by-product fertiliser, provided they are applied using a farm nutrient plan coupled with the uploading of mapping data and the use of variable-rate spreading technology, should be fast-tracked.  Additional funding should be given in stages to environmentally and economically concerned farmers who are utilising some or all of the services outlined, with the maximum funds available to those utilising the service in its totality.  Additional maintenance payments for the service's upkeep should be phased out over a three- to five-year period.  This will allow all farmers to enter the system, upload all farm data and output farm data.

Soil sampling is involved, as is mapping, the technology and the machinery.  We met farm contractors yesterday and, at the moment, they do not qualify for grants in respect of machinery whereas farmers may.

It is my personal opinion that the whole system is wrong.  A farmer goes out and spends &euro;50,000 or &euro;60,000 on a tanker but may not have the tractor or necessary skills to operate it correctly.  The contractor is not allowed any grants.  The contractor comes in and does the work.  He might have to move the new tanker the farmer got with grant support out of the way to complete his work.  I have heard lots of stories like that around the country.  This is definitely a system for contractors because they have the specialised tractors, machinery and staff to make use of it.  The dot-joining exercise should be done.  Instead of grant money for machinery he may not utilise, the farmer should be given grant money for work done.  Farmers should be given extra payments if they incorporate all of this technology because it is an environmentally sustainable way to spread fertiliser.  They would then be able to transfer money to the contractor who does the work, if that is the way the Department wants to pay farmers.

The regulations in this area go back to the late 1980s and early 1990s and classify by-products of this kind as waste.  We feel this is not correct.  Liquid digestate, dry digestate and biosolids all contain valuable nutrients, including nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium, that could be made available to farmers.  The farmers I have been dealing with and on whose farms we have spread have had very positive responses from using such products but the area is quite restricted because of the legislation classifying these materials as waste rather than as by-products, which would make it more usable for all farmers.

This presents both challenges and opportunities for the agrifood sector on this island.  By utilising new technologies and innovations, we can overcome the challenges we face and embrace the opportunities presented to us and indeed put Ireland the forefront of those.<\/p> <p>  I am the chief executive of Devenish.  At Devenish, we have a track record of agrifood innovation.  We continue to invest heavily in research and development to explore new solutions and technologies with the specific aim of reducing the environmental impact of the agriculture sector in the production of food.  <\/p> <p>  To introduce Devenish, it is a research, development and innovation company.  We are focused on developing solutions and technologies which ensure the most effective and efficient utilisation of nutrients in the production of food.  A large part of our business is focused on developing and producing nutrients for inclusion in feed, which not only improves animal health and performance, but has the added benefit of boosting human health and environmental health.  We term this concept: &ldquo;One Health: from soil to society&rdquo;.  We take a collaborative approach and strategy, working in partnership with researchers, institutions and Government bodies, our customers and suppliers, throughout the whole food chain.  We utilise practical research and development, making it commercially applicable in real time, to deliver sustainable food solutions in response to consumer demand for safe and nutritious food.  We believe in a science-based approach to developing sustainable solutions for agriculture and food.   <\/p> <p>  Through our &ldquo;one health: from soil to society&rdquo; strategy, we are looking at how we can positively influence human health and the environment through the provision of high quality, nutritious solutions, which is very much in line with Ireland&rsquo;s strategy on food.  Established in 1952, and acquired by the current management in 1997, we have grown the business from &pound;5 million annual turnover and 23 employees in 1997, to an international company with over 500 direct employees and &pound;228 million turnover. <\/p> <p>  Investing in that research and supplementing our manufacturing facilities across the UK, US, Turkey, Mexico and Uganda, we have invested in a range of performance or test houses and research farms, where farm trials are conducted to scientifically publishable standards.  Every year, we make a significant investment in research and development to develop solutions to solve the challenges faced by the industry, both today and tomorrow.  We have a team of over 40 PhDs and experts developing those products.  We regularly collaborate with universities and external centres of excellence, including Queen&rsquo;s University Belfast, University College Dublin, Harper Adams University, Wageningen University &amp;amp; Research, the Agri-Food and Biosciences Institute, AFBI, and Teagasc.<\/p> <p>  In 2013, we established our global innovation centre and ruminant research farm at the Devenish lands at Dowth, County Meath.  It is now an internationally recognised research farm dedicated to developing sustainable agriculture solutions and promoting human health through nutrition.  It acts as a platform for public engagement, as well as being designated as an international lighthouse farm that is leading the way in sustainable food production by Wageningen University &amp;amp; Research in the Netherlands, one of the leading agricultural universities in the world.<\/p><p>Our research farm at Dowth has been a platform for unique collaborations with partners such as Teagasc, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, academic partners such as Wageningen, University College Dublin, Queen's University Belfast and AFBI.  We have used it to showcase the research we are doing around climate smart farming, biodiversity, economics, and human health to farmers and industry groups.  We have formed wider collaborations to explore solutions to climate change including partnering with Gas Networks Ireland and KPMG on Project Clover.  We also recently signed a unique collaborative research initiative on climate action with the team at Teagasc, led by Professor Frank O'Mara.  We have also used the platform to engage with the Government and recently hosted a joint ministerial visit with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy McConalogue, and the Minister of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs, Mr. Edwin Poots, MLA, alongside the Ulster Farmers Union and the Irish Farmers Association.<\/p><p> Our research at Dowth has focused on measuring, reporting and verification of improved farming practices.  As part of this, we have developed a mitigation toolkit to help achieve carbon neutrality, including optimising soil nutrient flow; silvopasture or agroforestry trials; optimising animal nutrition; multispecies swards; and targeted planting of woody riparian strips.  We believe that to avail of all the tools in the net-zero toolbox, farm businesses need to be benchmarked on net carbon and not simply gross emissions per kilogramme of meat.  We see this as a significant opportunity for farmers and agriculture in Ireland.<\/p><p> In terms of developing new technologies and innovations, one of our key research projects at Dowth is the Heartland project, which was awarded &euro;1.4 million from the European Commission's Horizon 2020 programme.  One of the key areas where we have been developing new technologies is to reduce emissions.  This project has funded five PhD students to help build a farm management system that has a positive impact on the environment, meat quality and ultimately human health.  The students investigate the effect that changing sward diversity on farms can have on soils, sward production, animal performance, meat quality, the environment, social impact and farm economics.<\/p><p> Through this research, we have found that multispecies legume-rich swards offer an opportunity to reduce fertiliser usage, especially nitrogen, on farms while also improving soil structure, reducing nitrogen run-off and improving animal performance and health and farm profitability.  In studies at Dowth, we have reduced our nitrogen usage by 60% while still producing approximately 40% more dry matter herbage.  As well as improved animal performance, there are improvements in biodiversity, soil structure and water infiltration.  It is a win-win all round.  Helping farmers to measure and manage emissions is key to our strategy.  As well as products and practices that help reduce carbon emissions, we also help farmers assess their carbon balance and plan a route to net zero and beyond.  To be able to reduce emissions, farm businesses first need to have an accurate understanding of what their current emissions are, and then be able to effectively measure and manage them.  Over the past two years, we have been working in collaboration with Accenture to develop a new sustainable farming initiative that helps to support farmers to continue to produce nutritious meat and milk while improving their carbon balance.  By accurately measuring on-farm carbon emissions and, uniquely, carbon sequestration, it is estimated that if applied across the country, Agrinewal will enable more than 5 million tonnes of carbon to be sequestered by 2030.  This will create new value for farmers across the island of Ireland, and substantially accelerate the achievement of climate goals while also improving biodiversity, water quality and overall farm resilience and profitability.  Agrinewal provides a carbon balance sheet and identifies actions which will help the wider agricultural sector reach net-zero carbon emissions and beyond, boosting the environmental credentials for producers, processors and at every point on the food chain.  As the old saying goes: \"If you can't measure it, you can't manage it\".  Therefore, ensuring that farmers are encouraged and incentivised to establish their baselines and then supported to avail of all the tools in the net-zero mitigation toolbox is key to the future of Irish farming.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022033100002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Richard Kennedy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648681200,"counter":593,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Kennedy for his contribution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022033100002#H00200","speaker":"1666"},{"type":"speech","time":1648681200,"counter":594,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. Kennedy and thank him for his presentation.

I add to that the crisis we are in at the moment with the Ukraine situation and how obvious food security has become as an issue.<\/p> <p>  Moving on to technology and research, I am a firm believer in the carbon-leakage argument, but often when we put forward the carbon-leakage theory we are cut down and it is said that we are just using it as a defence for the continuation of agricultural output.  Mr. Kennedy rightly pointed out - it is obvious to the world today - how important it is that we maintain our output, but at the same time be cognisant of the climate issues and how we can reduce our emissions while, at worst, maintaining our current output.  Having visited Dowth, it is very impressive, but with the greatest of respect, a lot of it is based on what one could call laboratory conditions.

A key part of that is ensuring this is something farmers can do.<\/p> <p>  In terms of leakage, having met farmers recently, they are thinking they had better not look at their carbon footprint because if they do not know it, they do not have to do anything about it.  In fact, everybody has got a carbon footprint.  Once we exist, we have a carbon footprint.  Farmers have a carbon footprint inside their gate that has real value to the processors and the retailers because it is ultimately the responsibility of the retailers and processors.  What I mean by that is that the carbon footprint of the farmers is termed the scope 3 or tier 3 carbon that a retailer or processor will have and the farmer is the only one that can influence it.  There are several anomalies in a number of areas where this needs to be addressed.<\/p> <p>  To answer the Senator's question on how legislators can engage, it is very important that a clear policy direction is given on carbon in particular.  There is quite a bit of noise out there at the moment as to who owns the carbon.  From a legislative point of view, that should be clarified very quickly.  To me, farmers are the people who own the land, and they are also the people who can take the actions.  The Teagasc MAC curve shows what can be done around carbon and the environment.  The farmers are the people who will take the action.  Therefore, it is vitally important for me that farmers have ownership of their carbon.  The reason I say it is vitally important is because if they have ownership of it and there is a monitoring incentive or otherwise to have the best carbon footprint they can have, then they have the place and the time to do it.  Our structure plays to the ability to do that.  By proposing or suggesting that, it means that our current structure of farming has the potential to deliver on that basis.<\/p><p>What I mean by that is it will not just deliver in terms of carbon reduction for the environment but will also drive economy and business into the rural community.  I know the Senator is from a rural area, like me.  That approach can underpin the rural community.<\/p><p> I know concern is being expressed about how carbon will be counted on the national inventory and how to avoid double counting.  We need a clear policy and a clear infrastructure coming from legislators and Departments with a framework to deliver it.  Once carbon is measured, verified and reported in a robust manner, then it is more valuable.  It can then be allocated in the national inventory and will only be counted once.  However, in order to do all of those things, we must set out our baseline on the basis of individual farms.<\/p><p> The committee may have seen one piece of work that has come out of Devenish and Dowth farm, that is, the soil nutrient health scheme that has been launched in Northern Ireland.  Every hectare of soil in Northern Ireland is going to be analysed for carbon and other nutrients.  That will mean an immediate baseline across Northern Ireland so farmers know where they are and can build from there.  <\/p><p> I hope I have answered the Senator's question but a clearer policy direction is required.  Of course it will not be easy.  It will take courage and determination but it also has the potential to set us up as an island at the forefront of sustainable farming practices.<\/p><p> The Senator also talked about leakage.  Ireland has businesses throughout the world and considering how the rest of the world looks at us, we are positioned very well.  However, we are also vulnerable to being passed out by developing countries that will be able to implement changes to their infrastructure very quickly.  The consumer is now demanding such changes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022033100002#H00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Richard Kennedy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648681200,"counter":597,"content":"<p>There are some interesting ideas here but I am concerned about the overall frame.  It is great to hear about the level of scientific work that is being done and the support for PhDs in some of these areas.  Many of the areas our guests have talked about in the context of the mitigation toolkit are straightforwardly reducing emissions rather than trading emissions.  I have concerns about the net-zero aspect.  There are many measures at which our guests are looking, including soil nutrients, silvopasture and multi-species swards, that contribute to mitigating and reducing gross emissions from these particular areas of agriculture.  That is positive and useful.  I have some concern about inadvertent effects and perhaps our guests would elaborate in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022033100002#J00200","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1648681200,"counter":598,"content":"<p>(Interruptions).<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1648681200,"counter":599,"content":"<p>We have lost contact with the Senator.

May I be allowed to come back in?  I will have to leave in five minutes.  I have a concern about woody riparian strips.  Something we have talked about is ensuring we do not end up with thin areas because we know there are new grant schemes coming in that area from the forestry legislation that is going through at the moment.  We do not want people removing existing biodiversity in order to benefit from a grant to plant a woody riparian strip.  That is one concern I have in the mitigation area.<\/p> <p>  My main concern is the net-zero piece.  We need to consider these things in the context of land use, land use change and forestry, LULUCF.  There are measures and practices at UN and international level to measure that.  I am concerned by, for example, the partnership with Accenture and others.  I am concerned about individual accounting systems that are calculating things as net zero when we know Ireland is currently a net emitter in terms of land use and forestry.  We talk about incentives, and I am in favour of incentives and measures to support change in agriculture, but I am concerned about our carbon emissions in the context of the hard, ultimate science on which our survival depends.  I am concerned about moving carbon around on spreadsheets.  We are finding new ways to count carbon as sequestered, which is not helping us with our overall reduction targets but deals with carbon that was there already and is being relabelled.  I would like to avoid situations which allow us to treat carbon as the incentive and to treat the carbon emission measurement system as the incentive structure rather than regarding our carbon emission limits as the outside frame within which our economy and agricultural activity sits.  We must give people incentives in order to reduce those emissions.  I worry about the trading carbon piece.  When we make it a speculative commodity and find ways to offset emissions and get into that area, it is being used to incentivise economic change when economic change should be used to deliver the emission reduction budgets.  How that is framed is important.  I say that in the context of being in favour of investing in this area.  Much of the science is about land use.  Under the LULUCF approach, the idea of changing what we are doing with land is still a difficult subject in Ireland.  We may have to consider using more land for crops for reasons of food security.  We know that the current dairy model works very well for some businesses and large farmers but it does not work very well in giving security to many small farms.  Taking a similar approach and applying the same kind of great science that is at the moment focused on the livestock area to land change measures, and using public subsidies in that area, is something to pursue.  I know there is a bit of that in the silvopasture and targeted planting but there is space for further expansion in that regard.  I just wanted to indicate my concerns about the net zero piece.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022033100002#J00500","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648681200,"counter":601,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for her comments.  We would be proposing woody riparian strips in areas whether they would benefit the overland flow of phosphates.  It is not to incentivise but to show people where is the best place to plant them.  I am not proposing that is supported.  The current crisis has shown that nutrients are very valuable.  The best way for farmers and the food industry to react to the current situation is by standing and looking inside their own fences.<\/p><p>That is what we are talking about.  We propose that every farm would have its own footprint, but in order to do that first one must know and understand what it is.  This whole carbon economy is a very complex area.  I find it complex and I have been studying and working in it for years.  I believe that there are far too many assumptions made and not enough based on science and fact.  I would absolutely agree with the Senator that we should not and cannot play three card tricks, and we would be found out if it was smoke and mirrors.  It should not be smoke and mirrors - and some of the Senators' colleagues have been to Dowth to see - and this is not.  We look at the facts and data.  There are lots of ways to be there with facts and data.  It is unfair to say that Accenture are doing anything other than being involved in this than for the right reasons.  They are very focused on the fact that they are being requested around the world to develop and work on sustainable solutions.  They came to us and said \"What you doing?\" We said to them \"Come and have a look\".  That is why they are interested.  It is not the case that they are going to sell carbon credits.  They are looking at processes for their customers.  The customers have made the request.<\/p><p> From an economic point of view, I am seeing quite a lot how environmental, social and governance criteria, ESG, that companies must meet are driving economic impact and financial impact.  It may be a cruel parallel, but I would see this almost like the tobacco and smoking industry of the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s.  The evidence is there and the research is there show that we can do this without damaging the environment, or without damaging it as much as we are.  Forestry and farming the only two industries that actually have the ability to naturally sequester carbon.  In order to do this, and to the Senator's point, we should baseline farms to understand exactly what that are doing today: measure what they do; measure the outcomes of what they do; verify this; and then report it to a global standard so that one is not double counting.  That is what we would ultimately propose and it would put Irish farming in a different place and rather than an overall it would underpin.  It is like comparing a profit and loss account for a company for one year to the profit and loss account for a week or a month.  I say this because the variables, the variations, and the things that change, have the potential to ensure that Ireland can be most efficient, not alone in terms of our production or in underpinning an authentic transparent food production, but also in terms of a transparent and authentic carbon footprint for the food we produce.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022033100002#J00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Richard Kennedy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648681200,"counter":603,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Kennedy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022033100002#K00200","speaker":"1666"},{"type":"speech","time":1648681200,"counter":604,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Kennedy for the submission and, as usual, for helping us.   I was out at the Devenish place and learned a lot.  There are a few things that need to be grasped in this.  A lot of people think that they are carbon neutral within the city and that the only people who can solve a lot of this are the farmers.  This is the first thing that people need to realise, that from the minute they open their eyes in the morning in the city there is nothing they can do about it, and we are not blaming them, but it is others who have to try to offset their problematic experience, be it sewage which I spoke about earlier, and where it goes, be it the sludge from water or be it the electricity that is generated and all of that.  Every single bit of it is done in the countryside.  An appreciation first of all should come for the farmer communities who are willing to put their shoulders to the wheel to offset not alone the own situations but also for those who are living in the urban areas are not able to do anything about it.<\/p> <p>  When we were out with Devenish the mixed species grasses were going well.  Has more research come in on them?  At the time, Mr. Kennedy had said Devenish was doing research on the length of time they would last.  There was also a question mark, which I saw in one of the farming magazines, whereby some farmers believed that the butterfat might be down a bit.  Is there any research on the likes of that?<\/p> <p>  When Mr. Kennedy was before the committee previously, he mentioned that we need the LiDAR system to count what we have and count where we are going.  I believe the Office of Public Works is starting something in that regard this year.  At the time, Mr. Kennedy mentioned that a certain number of square metres would be needed in each photograph to ensure that it was right.  Will Mr. Kennedy remind us of that because we as a committee will probably write on that.<\/p> <p>  Does Devenish do anything on the different crops?  We see now where the likes of wheat is problematic.  Does Devenish do research on part of that for the farming community?  It was interesting to hear Mr. Kennedy's analysis on carbon and that the farming community, as I believe myself, needs to have the benefit of their own farm and that somebody else is not whipping carbon credits away from them.  I am aware that there is some research done on forestry in that regard.  At the moment we are in a situation where more forestry is being cut than grown.  The State can talk all it likes about the situation but the problem is that we have had a dysfunctional Department for a number of years that has let this deteriorate.  The heart is gone out of it.  If one mentions forestry now to farmers they run away because the paperwork is a mile long.  At the moment if farmers want to apply for a forestry licence it is all about the environmental impact assessment appropriate assessments and screening out.  It is all EU bureaucracy that is now coming in.  We have seen this in turloughs and farmers are seeing it day by day.  Is EU bureaucracy destroying a lot of this?  It is actually banging back against resolving some of the climate issues and farmers have walked about away from it with the stuff that is there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022033100002#K00300","speaker":"1508"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648681200,"counter":605,"content":"<p>I will leave the last issue to the end, but I will pick up on the Deputy's points in a different order.  With regard to the butterfat, I have not seen any work on that.  We will work with Teagasc on that.  That is very simple because one can do the analysis and follow through.  It is not something that we would have seen or expected.<\/p> <p>  On the persistency, I am not overly concerned about the persistency because of the performance we are getting.  The persistency is coming through.  It is more about getting farmers to adopt it and to change their management practices slightly.<\/p> <p>  I believe there is a real opportunity in crops.  Having spoken with people in the last while, I would be focusing on crops such as beans and fava beans in particular.  They are leguminous crops and within a good rotation it would be very valuable.  Not alone do we need cereals such as wheat, barley and maize to be replaced, we also need and it would be very valuable to have protein sources.  I commend the legislature on bringing through the crop incentives.  It is going to be tight this year but I believe it is something we should continue with.<\/p><p>If someone was to inquire what the ask is, it is a carbon soil analysis and LiDAR, light detection and ranging, analysis to the requisite level across the country that would be available to industry - not just to Devenish and farmers but to industry.  It is a phenomenal resource to farming because it measures what we have in the bank.  It shows us what we own, what we have and what we have worked for against guesswork or otherwise.  To be fair to the Northern Ireland Executive, it has done that and I think it is an incredible thing.  It would set this island apart.  It would be a very strong, definitive statement for us as a food-producing island to say we are taking this seriously, we are at the forefront of delivering sustainable solutions and we will build from here.  We should talk about investing in future generations and rural economies.  It is a little bit like some of the things that have been done in the past.  People look back and ask whether that was the right thing to do.  It is absolutely the right thing to do and particularly as we see the headwinds that are in front of us around carbon.<\/p><p> My fear of bureaucracy is that if we do not have strong policy and strong, positive proactive farming leadership on this then bureaucratic solutions will be imposed on us from outside, which is much worse.  We have things we can learn from in the past and maybe from some of what the Deputy talked about around how we did our forestry or whatever.  Consider what happened in terms of peat, however.  The picture was painted for us well in advance but we did not take the proactive positive steps I think we can now with this.  My concern is this.  We talk about bureaucracy.  Bureaucracy might be worse than where we are but when one is not allowed to do something, no matter how bureaucratic it is, that is the worst-case scenario.<\/p><p> As I said, we have the soils and we actually have the climate and temperatures.  We have an island that has the potential to be baselined to deliver a starting point as to how we can deliver sustainable solutions, and where farmers can work together with one another and their communities and also with their processors and co-operatives to really build a sustainable food production system from the ground up.  The world is changing at an incredible rate.  As I said to Senator Higgins, the pressures and challenges that are being exerted on very large food producing companies around their environmental, social, and governance, ESG, requirements - they are not just commitments, they are requirements now - will have a massive impact.  We can capitalise on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022033100002#K00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Richard Kennedy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648681200,"counter":607,"content":"<p>This was a really impressive presentation.

What if we were to look at that agency?  Look at what the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation, ICBF, did for the dairy industry.  It is now moving on to the beef industry.

We simply do what has been done in Northern Ireland because then once we have the baseline, we at least have a scope on which to set out what is required.  Industry is to a large extent being driven and forced.  There are two areas from a carbon point of view.  There is the emissions trading scheme where large industry for energy has a requirement.  That has developed itself but is being driven by the requirements.  Again, however, there are two really key parts to that.  One is the fact that it is verified.  If one makes savings in that area or changes, we will say, from fossil fuel to renewable energy, it is verified.  It is not just that someone says they did it.  It is verified.  Then, there is a monetary incentive to do that or a disincentive - whichever you want to call it.<\/p> <p>  My sense is that first of all, we have to identify what we must do and in doing that, we measure our baselines.  Then, certainly, as that information comes in, if we look at the scheme in Northern Ireland, it is very interesting.  They are now proposing that farmers do not have to join it but if they want to get the grants that are being constructed in Northern Ireland then they have to join.  It is not that I am necessarily advocating that aspect but the first thing is to set out, achieve or measure and understand that baseline.  Once we have that, we can set out the scope of what is required.  One has to eat the proverbial elephant in bite-sized chunks and that is the first bite.<\/p> <p>  In terms of putting together an ICBF equivalent, I would not have any issue with it.  Certainly, I agree that the ICBF's contribution has been phenomenal but I would first of all want to set out the scope.  That is why I think a clearer direction of travel on carbon and carbon policy is very important.  As I said, the other ask I would have is to baseline every hectare we have because as the Vice Chairman mentioned, it would pick up peatlands and others to understand where exactly we are on that.<\/p> <p>  I will make one other point.  Ireland is unique because 21% of the land base - I think it is 21% but I can be corrected - is organic base, so it is peat.  That is, therefore, unique in terms of other European countries and puts us in a unique position but it also is something we must address.  We would see it as an opportunity.  We would have spoken and met with Bord na M&oacute;na on this as well.

Dolan Industries is a limited small and medium enterprise, SME, company.  We are traditionally an agriculture-based company.  More than 60% of the products and services it supplies are agricultural in origin.  Today we will be discussing the massive advantages of variable rate prescription-based nutrient application in the agricultural sector.  The existing technology incorporated by Dolan Industries Limited can provide not only a monumental cost savings to Irish farmers, it can also mitigate and considerably reduce environmental impacts caused by nutrient and chemical fertiliser application.<\/p> <p>  Dolan Industries Limited is fortunate to be based in an area populated by some of the most intelligent and forward-thinking farmers on this island.  Because of the absence of vast areas of land in our area, farmers are constantly and consistently adapting to new methods to maximise their profits.  These farmers and customers have served as teachers, advisers and inspiration for the majority of the services Dolan Industries offers.  One of Dolan Industries services includes the supply and spreading of chemical-based fertilisers and it is this service that has brought us before the committee.  Dolan Industries supplies and spread between 1,300 and 1,800 tonnes of chemical fertiliser per annum.  This is a small amount in the grand scale of fertiliser sold throughout Ireland.<\/p> <p>  For this operation of almost 20 years, a simple blanket-based spreading system has been used, along with global positioning system, GPS, guidance.  This system is the most commonly used throughout Ireland.  While GPS has a good advantage in reducing overlap, it has become somewhat outdated and the old blanket-based spreading system, while adequate for its time, resulted in waste and sometimes possibly produced erratic spread patterns due to variation between granulated fertilisers and its prilled counterparts.  Dolan Industries Limited decided to begin to fully overhaul its existing fertiliser operation during the latter half of 2020 by buying the latest cutting edge technology and incorporating additional peer reviewed technology adapted from predominantly tillage-based farming.  This would include: additional upgraded GPS systems; automatic steering tractor guidance; variable rate section control; auto stop-start fertiliser spreading; and a utility vehicle, UTV, linking system from office to tractor.  Dolan industries has recently successfully incorporated and amalgamated this available technology into a grass-based setting.<\/p><p> The technology and service Dolan Industries now offers has huge benefits in reducing the negative effects on sustainability, biodiversity and environmental consequences associated with nutrient applications on farm level.<\/p><p> Prescription-based variable rate technology is the application of farm nutrients, such as compound chemical fertilisers, lime, slurry and alternative products, over a predetermined area of land utilising different precise targeted rates of application.  The advantages include a reduction in compound fertiliser.  Precise amounts of phosphorus, potassium and lime can now be applied and targeted over vast areas.  This method is used in conjunction with more environmentally-friendly nitrogen or urea-based accelerants such as protected ureas and terracan.  There is an accurate targeted approach.  Each area of land will get a precise level of various nutrients predetermined by prescription-based mapping software, which, in turn, is transferred wirelessly to the machinery to complete the application.<\/p><p>On the mitigation of environmental impacts, by pre-mapping external and internal field boundaries using specialised equipment or desktop software, we can mark areas sensitive to environmental impact.  The machinery doing the application will then be unable to spread near buffer zones and protected areas making water contamination almost impossible.  The accurate real-time uploadable and downloadable data is automatically recorded.  Utilising this technology can confidently save a farmer 15% of his annual fertiliser costs above standard nutrient application and 10% above standard GPS guided spreader application.<\/p><p> Characteristics of soil type, texture, soil pH and nutrient requirements are pinpointed to certain areas of land by collecting soil samples using GPS grid referencing and then uploaded to map-creating software.  Also marked and pinpointed are nutrient-sensitive zones, special areas of conservation, SACs, special protected areas, SPAs, water buffer zones, ground water courses, river banks and riparian margins.  Soil samples are analysed by the laboratory and the resulting data are returned and uploaded into a previously created map.  The farmer and landowner is consulted and a nutrient application plan is drawn up.  It is worth noting that data received by soil sampling enables farmers to forward buy fertilisers at different times of the year.  This may help in forward planning and improve cost savings.<\/p><p> The fertiliser, being a compound or straight depending on the best value and its application rate, is populated to the maps and then emailed or transferred to the tractor and machinery via USB.  When it is time to spread, the tractor and spreader arrives in the field and the data transfer is automatically uploaded and activated.  The tractor and spreader then automatically steers around the field and opens and closes the spreader according to the predetermined rate set through the mapping software.  A blanket spread rate using compound fertiliser is also possible.<\/p><p> It is also worth noting that any spreader using this type of technology will start and stop spreading at exactly the correct moment.  It will also continue to reduce its spreading width at angles and eventually shut off completely when nearing the sensitive areas of conservation, as previously discussed.  This removes all operator error completely.  The completed map area, rate applied, date and time is then logged and recorded.  This information can also be emailed back to the office or sent to a cloud server.<\/p><p> Dolan Industries understands fully the degradation of water quality in Ireland.  It can be associated with nitrates, phosphates and leaching from farm land.  It is the belief that, under our environmental and climate obligations, by adapting this technology water quality in Ireland can be improved as a result.<\/p><p> The benefits of using variable rate technology are not only improving but maximising crop yields; greater farm efficiency and productivity by harnessing better use of chemical and organic fertilisers; major cost saving benefits to farmers from accurate applications; no over or under application of fertilisers in each land parcel; improving soil indexes and fertility; less run off and soil leaching; greater protection of nutrient sensitive zones; and full transparency and data collection of work done.<\/p><p> Everybody here today is aware of the parabolic increase in chemical fertilisers over the past few months due primarily to the ongoing war in Ukraine.  Irish farmers, along with those in the rest of European Union, are under enormous pressure to be able to produce enough food.  While it is a precarious time, I believe it will allow for unprecedented opportunities in the agricultural sector.  The realisation that food security is of paramount importance is about to hit home shortly.<\/p><p>A percentage of farmers have not yet secured their fertiliser for this season.  Shortages, delayed delivery times and outrageous prices have resulted in a serious crisis.  The totality of this crisis has yet to play out and farmers, unable to either buy or secure fertiliser, will have no option but to de-stock and reduce production.  This will have significant unforeseen consequences for Ireland's rural economy and could have potential animal welfare repercussions this winter.<\/p><p> It should be the Government's objective to maximise food productivity in an environmentally-sustainable manner.  The technology we have incorporated can allow this immediately.  However, the immediate problem is the significant cost of fertiliser at this time.  Farmers need alternatives and they need them quickly.<\/p><p> There is one such alternative Dolan Industries Limited and Biocore Environmental Limited would like to put through its testing and analysis phase immediately.  Dolan Industries Limited along with Biocore Environmental Limited feel that Irish agriculture as a whole would benefit more from sustainable solutions by creating an indigenous supply of bio-fertiliser on the island through the use of dried digestate, liquid digestate and bio-solids from anaerobic digestion and bio-methane facilities which currently exist in the country.  This would help greatly in complementing the use of standard chemical-based fertilisers.  Currently these valuable sources of nutrients are highly sought after due to the current fertiliser crisis.  Unfortunately, these are classed as waste products and not by-products or, indeed, valuable sources of nutrients for farmers at a fraction of the price of current chemical fertilisers.  In order to change this, it is recommended that the Government fast-track legislation and classification of these highly valuable and environmentally-sustainable nutrients as products.<\/p><p> Currently the anaerobic digestion sector is in its infancy in Ireland.  However, it offers solutions in providing renewable sustainable locally-sourced and produced bio-fertilisers.  If legislation can be changed quickly, it would help avert some of the effects of this current fertiliser crisis.  This would also allow for Ireland to create its own indigenous supply of fertiliser as a result of also creating renewable energy, helping the country achieve its climate targets by the end of the decade.<\/p><p> On classifying digestates as a by-product and natural fertiliser, a reclassification would allow the anaerobic digestion industry to work side by side to grow and develop and with greater policy initiatives and measures developing the supply of renewable energy and fertiliser, tackling climate change and protecting soils and water quality.  With this in mind, combining the latest technology in terms of prescription-based variable rate nutrient application maps will offer full transparency to all relevant authorities and regulatory bodies on how and where the nutrients have been applied.  It is also recommended that these products are applied using only variable rate technology, data recording and prescription-based mapping in order to fully maximise best practice and ensure fully transparent traceability of all applications of nutrients regardless of location to all relevant authorities, locally, nationally and at European level.<\/p><p> Dolan Industries Limited is aware that there are proposals currently in place to allow farmers to get 25% of their payment through the pillar 1 eco-scheme by utilising GPS-controlled fertiliser spreading services, such as ours.  We strongly agree with and welcome this proposal which will serve as a catalyst in accelerating Ireland's environmental responsibilities.<\/p><p> Targets to reduce ammonium nitrate uses by 20% to 30% by 2030 is not only achievable by that time but, with correctly-targeted funding, can be achieved in a much shorter timeframe.  The technology incorporated by Dolan Industries Limited can be implemented and replicated on a national level in a very short timeframe as most new machinery and skilled professional contractors have the capability to achieve this.<\/p><p> Additionally, the spreader alone, while an advantage, is only capable of achieving a fraction of the economic and environmental advantages set out in this report.  Additional to the spreader, it is recommended to take and utilise up-to-date soil samples and use additional GPS receivers, mobile utility vehicles, UTVs, or desktop software for creating internal and external field boundaries, participate in equipment training and upload data to cloud software.  Only when all of this is achieved will the full extent of this technology be utilised.  As a result, Dolan Industries recommends registered agricultural contractors with appropriate training carry out this work on farms where it is unfeasible for farmers to purchase this level of machinery.<\/p><p> For Dolan Industries Limited and other agricultural contractors the initial cost of this service and equipment is intensive in both labour and resources.  Dolan Industries Limited is currently involved in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Government-backed soil sampling programme.  A joint venture between IAS Laboratories and Dr. Eoghan Finneran's company Farmeye indicates the soil test is of the utmost importance to the first stage of the variable rate technology, where and what to spread being the primary objective.  Dolan Industries Limited is aware of the continuation and expansion of the soil sampling programme and the additional funding allocated to it.<\/p><p>It is a very welcome addition to the farming and agricultural community.  Dolan Industries suggests that, along with the proposed Pillar 1 eco-scheme involving 25% additional extra funding being given to farmers willing to use the full totality this service, progressive environmentally concerned farmers should be, and must be, rewarded rather than penalised because viable alternatives are not yet mainstream.  Additional funds to be received by farmers will mitigate the large labour costs to the contractor on initial set-up.  Further payments over a three- to five-year period to maintain and continue the service are also recommended.  Without these supports in place, farmers will simply not avail of these services and will continue to apply nutrients using older outdated spreader and GPS systems.  This can only serve to subvert and undercut attempts by progressive businesses that are trying to move forward both technically and environmentally.   If environmental concerns are of paramount importance, Government support on this issue is needed quickly. <\/p><p> To summarise, Dolan Industries recommends that a Pillar 1 25% eco-scheme for GPS-guided spreaders be implemented along with the uploading of map data and information on work done to a central data server.  The reclassification of digestate and bio-solids as a by-product fertiliser, provided they are applied using a farm nutrient plan coupled with the uploading of mapping data and the use of variable-rate spreading technology, should be fast-tracked.  Additional funding should be given in stages to environmentally and economically concerned farmers who are utilising some or all of the services outlined, with the maximum funds available to those utilising the service in its totality.  Additional maintenance payments for the service's upkeep should be phased out over a three- to five-year period.  This will allow all farmers to enter the system, upload all farm data and output farm data.

We met farm contractors yesterday and, at the moment, they do not qualify for grants in respect of machinery whereas farmers may.

It is my personal opinion that the whole system is wrong.  A farmer goes out and spends &euro;50,000 or &euro;60,000 on a tanker but may not have the tractor or necessary skills to operate it correctly.  The contractor is not allowed any grants.  The contractor comes in and does the work.  He might have to move the new tanker the farmer got with grant support out of the way to complete his work.  I have heard lots of stories like that around the country.  This is definitely a system for contractors because they have the specialised tractors, machinery and staff to make use of it.  The dot-joining exercise should be done.  Instead of grant money for machinery he may not utilise, the farmer should be given grant money for work done.  Farmers should be given extra payments if they incorporate all of this technology because it is an environmentally sustainable way to spread fertiliser.  They would then be able to transfer money to the contractor who does the work, if that is the way the Department wants to pay farmers.

The regulations in this area go back to the late 1980s and early 1990s and classify by-products of this kind as waste.  We feel this is not correct.  Liquid digestate, dry digestate and biosolids all contain valuable nutrients, including nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium, that could be made available to farmers.  The farmers I have been dealing with and on whose farms we have spread have had very positive responses from using such products but the area is quite restricted because of the legislation classifying these materials as waste rather than as by-products, which would make it more usable for all farmers.

This presents both challenges and opportunities for the agrifood sector on this island.  By utilising new technologies and innovations, we can overcome the challenges we face and embrace the opportunities presented to us and indeed put Ireland the forefront of those.<\/p> <p>  I am the chief executive of Devenish.  At Devenish, we have a track record of agrifood innovation.  We continue to invest heavily in research and development to explore new solutions and technologies with the specific aim of reducing the environmental impact of the agriculture sector in the production of food.  <\/p> <p>  To introduce Devenish, it is a research, development and innovation company.  We are focused on developing solutions and technologies which ensure the most effective and efficient utilisation of nutrients in the production of food.  A large part of our business is focused on developing and producing nutrients for inclusion in feed, which not only improves animal health and performance, but has the added benefit of boosting human health and environmental health.  We term this concept: &ldquo;One Health: from soil to society&rdquo;.  We take a collaborative approach and strategy, working in partnership with researchers, institutions and Government bodies, our customers and suppliers, throughout the whole food chain.  We utilise practical research and development, making it commercially applicable in real time, to deliver sustainable food solutions in response to consumer demand for safe and nutritious food.  We believe in a science-based approach to developing sustainable solutions for agriculture and food.   <\/p> <p>  Through our &ldquo;one health: from soil to society&rdquo; strategy, we are looking at how we can positively influence human health and the environment through the provision of high quality, nutritious solutions, which is very much in line with Ireland&rsquo;s strategy on food.  Established in 1952, and acquired by the current management in 1997, we have grown the business from &pound;5 million annual turnover and 23 employees in 1997, to an international company with over 500 direct employees and &pound;228 million turnover. <\/p> <p>  Investing in that research and supplementing our manufacturing facilities across the UK, US, Turkey, Mexico and Uganda, we have invested in a range of performance or test houses and research farms, where farm trials are conducted to scientifically publishable standards.  Every year, we make a significant investment in research and development to develop solutions to solve the challenges faced by the industry, both today and tomorrow.  We have a team of over 40 PhDs and experts developing those products.  We regularly collaborate with universities and external centres of excellence, including Queen&rsquo;s University Belfast, University College Dublin, Harper Adams University, Wageningen University &amp;amp; Research, the Agri-Food and Biosciences Institute, AFBI, and Teagasc.<\/p> <p>  In 2013, we established our global innovation centre and ruminant research farm at the Devenish lands at Dowth, County Meath.  It is now an internationally recognised research farm dedicated to developing sustainable agriculture solutions and promoting human health through nutrition.  It acts as a platform for public engagement, as well as being designated as an international lighthouse farm that is leading the way in sustainable food production by Wageningen University &amp;amp; Research in the Netherlands, one of the leading agricultural universities in the world.<\/p><p>Our research farm at Dowth has been a platform for unique collaborations with partners such as Teagasc, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, academic partners such as Wageningen, University College Dublin, Queen's University Belfast and AFBI.  We have used it to showcase the research we are doing around climate smart farming, biodiversity, economics, and human health to farmers and industry groups.  We have formed wider collaborations to explore solutions to climate change including partnering with Gas Networks Ireland and KPMG on Project Clover.  We also recently signed a unique collaborative research initiative on climate action with the team at Teagasc, led by Professor Frank O'Mara.  We have also used the platform to engage with the Government and recently hosted a joint ministerial visit with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy McConalogue, and the Minister of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs, Mr. Edwin Poots, MLA, alongside the Ulster Farmers Union and the Irish Farmers Association.<\/p><p> Our research at Dowth has focused on measuring, reporting and verification of improved farming practices.  As part of this, we have developed a mitigation toolkit to help achieve carbon neutrality, including optimising soil nutrient flow; silvopasture or agroforestry trials; optimising animal nutrition; multispecies swards; and targeted planting of woody riparian strips.  We believe that to avail of all the tools in the net-zero toolbox, farm businesses need to be benchmarked on net carbon and not simply gross emissions per kilogramme of meat.  We see this as a significant opportunity for farmers and agriculture in Ireland.<\/p><p> In terms of developing new technologies and innovations, one of our key research projects at Dowth is the Heartland project, which was awarded &euro;1.4 million from the European Commission's Horizon 2020 programme.  One of the key areas where we have been developing new technologies is to reduce emissions.  This project has funded five PhD students to help build a farm management system that has a positive impact on the environment, meat quality and ultimately human health.  The students investigate the effect that changing sward diversity on farms can have on soils, sward production, animal performance, meat quality, the environment, social impact and farm economics.<\/p><p> Through this research, we have found that multispecies legume-rich swards offer an opportunity to reduce fertiliser usage, especially nitrogen, on farms while also improving soil structure, reducing nitrogen run-off and improving animal performance and health and farm profitability.  In studies at Dowth, we have reduced our nitrogen usage by 60% while still producing approximately 40% more dry matter herbage.  As well as improved animal performance, there are improvements in biodiversity, soil structure and water infiltration.  It is a win-win all round.  Helping farmers to measure and manage emissions is key to our strategy.  As well as products and practices that help reduce carbon emissions, we also help farmers assess their carbon balance and plan a route to net zero and beyond.  To be able to reduce emissions, farm businesses first need to have an accurate understanding of what their current emissions are, and then be able to effectively measure and manage them.  Over the past two years, we have been working in collaboration with Accenture to develop a new sustainable farming initiative that helps to support farmers to continue to produce nutritious meat and milk while improving their carbon balance.  By accurately measuring on-farm carbon emissions and, uniquely, carbon sequestration, it is estimated that if applied across the country, Agrinewal will enable more than 5 million tonnes of carbon to be sequestered by 2030.  This will create new value for farmers across the island of Ireland, and substantially accelerate the achievement of climate goals while also improving biodiversity, water quality and overall farm resilience and profitability.  Agrinewal provides a carbon balance sheet and identifies actions which will help the wider agricultural sector reach net-zero carbon emissions and beyond, boosting the environmental credentials for producers, processors and at every point on the food chain.  As the old saying goes: \"If you can't measure it, you can't manage it\".  Therefore, ensuring that farmers are encouraged and incentivised to establish their baselines and then supported to avail of all the tools in the net-zero mitigation toolbox is key to the future of Irish farming.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022033100002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Richard Kennedy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648681200,"counter":736,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Kennedy for his contribution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022033100002#H00200","speaker":"1666"},{"type":"speech","time":1648681200,"counter":737,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. Kennedy and thank him for his presentation.

I add to that the crisis we are in at the moment with the Ukraine situation and how obvious food security has become as an issue.<\/p> <p>  Moving on to technology and research, I am a firm believer in the carbon-leakage argument, but often when we put forward the carbon-leakage theory we are cut down and it is said that we are just using it as a defence for the continuation of agricultural output.  Mr. Kennedy rightly pointed out - it is obvious to the world today - how important it is that we maintain our output, but at the same time be cognisant of the climate issues and how we can reduce our emissions while, at worst, maintaining our current output.  Having visited Dowth, it is very impressive, but with the greatest of respect, a lot of it is based on what one could call laboratory conditions.  It is a research and development project and it has access to postgraduate students.  Based on the studies he has done in Dowth, could he explain to us as legislators what would be the best way for us to roll out the approach to the entire farming community, population and industry?<\/p> <p>  Going back to the point on carbon leakage, as a nation, with our current farming structure based on the farm-family model, our climate, our field size and our soil structures, where do we stand on a world scale with regard to our potential to be carbon neutral in agriculture as of today, or down the line with the inclusion of the standards, systems and technologies Mr. Kennedy is rolling out and developing in Dowth?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022033100002#H00300","speaker":"1651"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648681200,"counter":738,"content":"<p>First of all, in terms of what we do, I accept it is very much a research farm, but we have always done our research on the basis of it being commercially applicable, and at a very early stage.  A key part of that is ensuring this is something farmers can do.<\/p> <p>  In terms of leakage, having met farmers recently, they are thinking they had better not look at their carbon footprint because if they do not know it, they do not have to do anything about it.  In fact, everybody has got a carbon footprint.  Once we exist, we have a carbon footprint.  Farmers have a carbon footprint inside their gate that has real value to the processors and the retailers because it is ultimately the responsibility of the retailers and processors.  What I mean by that is that the carbon footprint of the farmers is termed the scope 3 or tier 3 carbon that a retailer or processor will have and the farmer is the only one that can influence it.  There are several anomalies in a number of areas where this needs to be addressed.<\/p> <p>  To answer the Senator's question on how legislators can engage, it is very important that a clear policy direction is given on carbon in particular.  There is quite a bit of noise out there at the moment as to who owns the carbon.  From a legislative point of view, that should be clarified very quickly.  To me, farmers are the people who own the land, and they are also the people who can take the actions.  The Teagasc MAC curve shows what can be done around carbon and the environment.  The farmers are the people who will take the action.  Therefore, it is vitally important for me that farmers have ownership of their carbon.  The reason I say it is vitally important is because if they have ownership of it and there is a monitoring incentive or otherwise to have the best carbon footprint they can have, then they have the place and the time to do it.  Our structure plays to the ability to do that.  By proposing or suggesting that, it means that our current structure of farming has the potential to deliver on that basis.<\/p><p>What I mean by that is it will not just deliver in terms of carbon reduction for the environment but will also drive economy and business into the rural community.  I know the Senator is from a rural area, like me.  That approach can underpin the rural community.<\/p><p> I know concern is being expressed about how carbon will be counted on the national inventory and how to avoid double counting.  We need a clear policy and a clear infrastructure coming from legislators and Departments with a framework to deliver it.  Once carbon is measured, verified and reported in a robust manner, then it is more valuable.  It can then be allocated in the national inventory and will only be counted once.  However, in order to do all of those things, we must set out our baseline on the basis of individual farms.<\/p><p> The committee may have seen one piece of work that has come out of Devenish and Dowth farm, that is, the soil nutrient health scheme that has been launched in Northern Ireland.  Every hectare of soil in Northern Ireland is going to be analysed for carbon and other nutrients.  That will mean an immediate baseline across Northern Ireland so farmers know where they are and can build from there.  <\/p><p> I hope I have answered the Senator's question but a clearer policy direction is required.  Of course it will not be easy.  It will take courage and determination but it also has the potential to set us up as an island at the forefront of sustainable farming practices.<\/p><p> The Senator also talked about leakage.  Ireland has businesses throughout the world and considering how the rest of the world looks at us, we are positioned very well.  However, we are also vulnerable to being passed out by developing countries that will be able to implement changes to their infrastructure very quickly.  The consumer is now demanding such changes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022033100002#H00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Richard Kennedy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648681200,"counter":740,"content":"<p>There are some interesting ideas here but I am concerned about the overall frame.  It is great to hear about the level of scientific work that is being done and the support for PhDs in some of these areas.  Many of the areas our guests have talked about in the context of the mitigation toolkit are straightforwardly reducing emissions rather than trading emissions.  I have concerns about the net-zero aspect.  There are many measures at which our guests are looking, including soil nutrients, silvopasture and multi-species swards, that contribute to mitigating and reducing gross emissions from these particular areas of agriculture.  That is positive and useful.  I have some concern about inadvertent effects and perhaps our guests would elaborate in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022033100002#J00200","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1648681200,"counter":741,"content":"<p>(Interruptions).<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1648681200,"counter":742,"content":"<p>We have lost contact with the Senator.

May I be allowed to come back in?  I will have to leave in five minutes.  I have a concern about woody riparian strips.  Something we have talked about is ensuring we do not end up with thin areas because we know there are new grant schemes coming in that area from the forestry legislation that is going through at the moment.  We do not want people removing existing biodiversity in order to benefit from a grant to plant a woody riparian strip.  That is one concern I have in the mitigation area.<\/p> <p>  My main concern is the net-zero piece.  We need to consider these things in the context of land use, land use change and forestry, LULUCF.  There are measures and practices at UN and international level to measure that.  I am concerned by, for example, the partnership with Accenture and others.  I am concerned about individual accounting systems that are calculating things as net zero when we know Ireland is currently a net emitter in terms of land use and forestry.  We talk about incentives, and I am in favour of incentives and measures to support change in agriculture, but I am concerned about our carbon emissions in the context of the hard, ultimate science on which our survival depends.  I am concerned about moving carbon around on spreadsheets.  We are finding new ways to count carbon as sequestered, which is not helping us with our overall reduction targets but deals with carbon that was there already and is being relabelled.  I would like to avoid situations which allow us to treat carbon as the incentive and to treat the carbon emission measurement system as the incentive structure rather than regarding our carbon emission limits as the outside frame within which our economy and agricultural activity sits.  We must give people incentives in order to reduce those emissions.  I worry about the trading carbon piece.  When we make it a speculative commodity and find ways to offset emissions and get into that area, it is being used to incentivise economic change when economic change should be used to deliver the emission reduction budgets.  How that is framed is important.  I say that in the context of being in favour of investing in this area.  Much of the science is about land use.  Under the LULUCF approach, the idea of changing what we are doing with land is still a difficult subject in Ireland.  We may have to consider using more land for crops for reasons of food security.  We know that the current dairy model works very well for some businesses and large farmers but it does not work very well in giving security to many small farms.  Taking a similar approach and applying the same kind of great science that is at the moment focused on the livestock area to land change measures, and using public subsidies in that area, is something to pursue.  I know there is a bit of that in the silvopasture and targeted planting but there is space for further expansion in that regard.  I just wanted to indicate my concerns about the net zero piece.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022033100002#J00500","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648681200,"counter":744,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for her comments.  We would be proposing woody riparian strips in areas whether they would benefit the overland flow of phosphates.  It is not to incentivise but to show people where is the best place to plant them.  I am not proposing that is supported.  The current crisis has shown that nutrients are very valuable.  The best way for farmers and the food industry to react to the current situation is by standing and looking inside their own fences.<\/p><p>That is what we are talking about.  We propose that every farm would have its own footprint, but in order to do that first one must know and understand what it is.  This whole carbon economy is a very complex area.  I find it complex and I have been studying and working in it for years.  I believe that there are far too many assumptions made and not enough based on science and fact.  I would absolutely agree with the Senator that we should not and cannot play three card tricks, and we would be found out if it was smoke and mirrors.  It should not be smoke and mirrors - and some of the Senators' colleagues have been to Dowth to see - and this is not.  We look at the facts and data.  There are lots of ways to be there with facts and data.  It is unfair to say that Accenture are doing anything other than being involved in this than for the right reasons.  They are very focused on the fact that they are being requested around the world to develop and work on sustainable solutions.  They came to us and said \"What you doing?\" We said to them \"Come and have a look\".  That is why they are interested.  It is not the case that they are going to sell carbon credits.  They are looking at processes for their customers.  The customers have made the request.<\/p><p> From an economic point of view, I am seeing quite a lot how environmental, social and governance criteria, ESG, that companies must meet are driving economic impact and financial impact.  It may be a cruel parallel, but I would see this almost like the tobacco and smoking industry of the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s.  The evidence is there and the research is there show that we can do this without damaging the environment, or without damaging it as much as we are.  Forestry and farming the only two industries that actually have the ability to naturally sequester carbon.  In order to do this, and to the Senator's point, we should baseline farms to understand exactly what that are doing today: measure what they do; measure the outcomes of what they do; verify this; and then report it to a global standard so that one is not double counting.  That is what we would ultimately propose and it would put Irish farming in a different place and rather than an overall it would underpin.  It is like comparing a profit and loss account for a company for one year to the profit and loss account for a week or a month.  I say this because the variables, the variations, and the things that change, have the potential to ensure that Ireland can be most efficient, not alone in terms of our production or in underpinning an authentic transparent food production, but also in terms of a transparent and authentic carbon footprint for the food we produce.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022033100002#J00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Richard Kennedy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648681200,"counter":746,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Kennedy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022033100002#K00200","speaker":"1666"},{"type":"speech","time":1648681200,"counter":747,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Kennedy for the submission and, as usual, for helping us.   I was out at the Devenish place and learned a lot.  There are a few things that need to be grasped in this.  A lot of people think that they are carbon neutral within the city and that the only people who can solve a lot of this are the farmers.  This is the first thing that people need to realise, that from the minute they open their eyes in the morning in the city there is nothing they can do about it, and we are not blaming them, but it is others who have to try to offset their problematic experience, be it sewage which I spoke about earlier, and where it goes, be it the sludge from water or be it the electricity that is generated and all of that.  Every single bit of it is done in the countryside.  An appreciation first of all should come for the farmer communities who are willing to put their shoulders to the wheel to offset not alone the own situations but also for those who are living in the urban areas are not able to do anything about it.<\/p> <p>  When we were out with Devenish the mixed species grasses were going well.  Has more research come in on them?  At the time, Mr. Kennedy had said Devenish was doing research on the length of time they would last.  There was also a question mark, which I saw in one of the farming magazines, whereby some farmers believed that the butterfat might be down a bit.  Is there any research on the likes of that?<\/p> <p>  When Mr. Kennedy was before the committee previously, he mentioned that we need the LiDAR system to count what we have and count where we are going.  I believe the Office of Public Works is starting something in that regard this year.  At the time, Mr. Kennedy mentioned that a certain number of square metres would be needed in each photograph to ensure that it was right.  Will Mr. Kennedy remind us of that because we as a committee will probably write on that.<\/p> <p>  Does Devenish do anything on the different crops?  We see now where the likes of wheat is problematic.  Does Devenish do research on part of that for the farming community?  It was interesting to hear Mr. Kennedy's analysis on carbon and that the farming community, as I believe myself, needs to have the benefit of their own farm and that somebody else is not whipping carbon credits away from them.  I am aware that there is some research done on forestry in that regard.  At the moment we are in a situation where more forestry is being cut than grown.  The State can talk all it likes about the situation but the problem is that we have had a dysfunctional Department for a number of years that has let this deteriorate.  The heart is gone out of it.  If one mentions forestry now to farmers they run away because the paperwork is a mile long.  At the moment if farmers want to apply for a forestry licence it is all about the environmental impact assessment appropriate assessments and screening out.  It is all EU bureaucracy that is now coming in.  We have seen this in turloughs and farmers are seeing it day by day.  Is EU bureaucracy destroying a lot of this?  It is actually banging back against resolving some of the climate issues and farmers have walked about away from it with the stuff that is there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022033100002#K00300","speaker":"1508"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648681200,"counter":748,"content":"<p>I will leave the last issue to the end, but I will pick up on the Deputy's points in a different order.  With regard to the butterfat, I have not seen any work on that.  We will work with Teagasc on that.  That is very simple because one can do the analysis and follow through.  It is not something that we would have seen or expected.<\/p> <p>  On the persistency, I am not overly concerned about the persistency because of the performance we are getting.  The persistency is coming through.  It is more about getting farmers to adopt it and to change their management practices slightly.<\/p> <p>  I believe there is a real opportunity in crops.  Having spoken with people in the last while, I would be focusing on crops such as beans and fava beans in particular.  They are leguminous crops and within a good rotation it would be very valuable.  Not alone do we need cereals such as wheat, barley and maize to be replaced, we also need and it would be very valuable to have protein sources.  I commend the legislature on bringing through the crop incentives.  It is going to be tight this year but I believe it is something we should continue with.<\/p><p>If someone was to inquire what the ask is, it is a carbon soil analysis and LiDAR, light detection and ranging, analysis to the requisite level across the country that would be available to industry - not just to Devenish and farmers but to industry.  It is a phenomenal resource to farming because it measures what we have in the bank.  It shows us what we own, what we have and what we have worked for against guesswork or otherwise.  To be fair to the Northern Ireland Executive, it has done that and I think it is an incredible thing.  It would set this island apart.  It would be a very strong, definitive statement for us as a food-producing island to say we are taking this seriously, we are at the forefront of delivering sustainable solutions and we will build from here.  We should talk about investing in future generations and rural economies.  It is a little bit like some of the things that have been done in the past.  People look back and ask whether that was the right thing to do.  It is absolutely the right thing to do and particularly as we see the headwinds that are in front of us around carbon.<\/p><p> My fear of bureaucracy is that if we do not have strong policy and strong, positive proactive farming leadership on this then bureaucratic solutions will be imposed on us from outside, which is much worse.  We have things we can learn from in the past and maybe from some of what the Deputy talked about around how we did our forestry or whatever.  Consider what happened in terms of peat, however.  The picture was painted for us well in advance but we did not take the proactive positive steps I think we can now with this.  My concern is this.  We talk about bureaucracy.  Bureaucracy might be worse than where we are but when one is not allowed to do something, no matter how bureaucratic it is, that is the worst-case scenario.<\/p><p> As I said, we have the soils and we actually have the climate and temperatures.  We have an island that has the potential to be baselined to deliver a starting point as to how we can deliver sustainable solutions, and where farmers can work together with one another and their communities and also with their processors and co-operatives to really build a sustainable food production system from the ground up.  The world is changing at an incredible rate.  As I said to Senator Higgins, the pressures and challenges that are being exerted on very large food producing companies around their environmental, social, and governance, ESG, requirements - they are not just commitments, they are requirements now - will have a massive impact.  We can capitalise on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022033100002#K00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Richard Kennedy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648681200,"counter":750,"content":"<p>This was a really impressive presentation.

We simply do what has been done in Northern Ireland because then once we have the baseline, we at least have a scope on which to set out what is required.  Industry is to a large extent being driven and forced.  There are two areas from a carbon point of view.  There is the emissions trading scheme where large industry for energy has a requirement.  That has developed itself but is being driven by the requirements.  Again, however, there are two really key parts to that.  One is the fact that it is verified.  If one makes savings in that area or changes, we will say, from fossil fuel to renewable energy, it is verified.  It is not just that someone says they did it.  It is verified.  Then, there is a monetary incentive to do that or a disincentive - whichever you want to call it.<\/p> <p>  My sense is that first of all, we have to identify what we must do and in doing that, we measure our baselines.  Then, certainly, as that information comes in, if we look at the scheme in Northern Ireland, it is very interesting.  They are now proposing that farmers do not have to join it but if they want to get the grants that are being constructed in Northern Ireland then they have to join.  It is not that I am necessarily advocating that aspect but the first thing is to set out, achieve or measure and understand that baseline.  Once we have that, we can set out the scope of what is required.  One has to eat the proverbial elephant in bite-sized chunks and that is the first bite.<\/p> <p>  In terms of putting together an ICBF equivalent, I would not have any issue with it.  Certainly, I agree that the ICBF's contribution has been phenomenal but I would first of all want to set out the scope.  That is why I think a clearer direction of travel on carbon and carbon policy is very important.  As I said, the other ask I would have is to baseline every hectare we have because as the Vice Chairman mentioned, it would pick up peatlands and others to understand where exactly we are on that.<\/p> <p>  I will make one other point.  Ireland is unique because 21% of the land base - I think it is 21% but I can be corrected - is organic base, so it is peat.  That is, therefore, unique in terms of other European countries and puts us in a unique position but it also is something we must address.  We would see it as an opportunity.  We would have spoken and met with Bord na M&oacute;na on this as well.  Bord na M&oacute;na only owns roughly 7% of that peatland; it does not own 7% of that 21%.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022033100002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Richard Kennedy"},{"type":"speech","time":1648681200,"counter":752,"content":"<p>I do not think there are any other contributions.

Before we start, I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses regarding references witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected pursuant to both the Constitution and statute by absolute privilege.  However, the witnesses are giving evidence remotely from a place outside of the parliamentary precincts and, as such, may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness who is physically present does.  Witnesses may think it appropriate to take legal advice on this matter.  The witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if any of their statements are potentially defamatory with regard to an identifiable person or entity, witnesses will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that the witnesses comply with any such direction.<\/p> <p>  Before we hear from the witnesses, I propose we publish the opening statements on the committee's website.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  On behalf of the committee, I extend a warm welcome to Ms MaryRose McGovern, the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman, and Ms &Aacute;ine Carroll, director of corporate and communications services.  I suggest that the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman should make her opening statement for approximately ten minutes.  We will then have questions and comments from members.  Each member will have approximately ten minutes and members may speak more than once.  If we all adhere to the allotted time we can get in a second round of questions.  I now invite Ms McGovern to make her opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2022033100002#A00400","speaker":"1613"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648681200,"counter":760,"content":"<p>I am pleased to have the opportunity, together with my colleague, Ms &Aacute;ine Carroll, director of corporate and communication services, to engage with the committee today in relation to the work of the Office of the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman.  The office was established on 1 January 2018, by the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman Act 2017.  It is the FSPO's mission to provide an impartial, accessible and responsive complaint resolution service that delivers fair, transparent and timely outcomes for all our customers and enhances the financial services and pensions environment.  When any consumer, whether an individual, a small business or an organisation, is unable to resolve a complaint or dispute with a financial service provider or a pension provider, they can refer their complaint to us.  We deal with complaints informally at first, by listening to both parties and engaging with them to facilitate a resolution that is acceptable to both parties.  Where these early interventions do not resolve the dispute, we formally investigate the complaint and issue a decision.  That decision is legally binding on both parties, subject only to a statutory appeal to the High Court.<\/p> <p>  The Oireachtas has given the FSPO an important statutory role, namely, to provide consumers, including small businesses, with an avenue of redress. The need for the FSPO's services can arise in challenging and difficult circumstances where consumers' complaints against financial service providers or pension providers remain unresolved.  Against this background, the FSPO strives to provide the best possible services to all our customers and to effectively and efficiently manage every complaint we receive.  In our first years in operation, since 1 January 2018, the FSPO has received more than 21,000 complaints.  There continues to be a strong demand for the services of our office and in 2021, we received more than 4,600 complaints and closed more than 5,000 complaints.  During both 2020 and 2021, we have succeeded in closing more complaints than we received.  This enables us to continue to reduce the number of complaints on hand, to conclude complaints more quickly and to respond to the changing needs and expectations of all our customers.<\/p> <p>  As set out in the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman Annual Report 2020, this office reported a significant improvement in the number of complaints addressed and the quality of the service we provided in the year.  During 2020, we closed the highest number of complaints since the office was established, against the background of the global pandemic and the move to remote working by our staff, in accordance with Government guidelines.<\/p> <p>  I have provided some statistics from the 2020 annual report that I will be happy to discuss with the committee.  In March 2020, we began to receive the first complaints arising from the circumstances surrounding the Covid-19 pandemic and by the end of 2020 we had received 600 complaints where the complainant identified Covid-19 as an element of the complaint.  Due to the measures that we put in place to ensure the efficient management of these new complaints and to prioritise the progression of complaints concerning business interruption insurance, by the end of the year, 305 of the 600 complaints received, had been concluded.  Our business continuity plan ensured that we exceeded the targets we set for 2020, while ensuring the safety of our staff, customers and suppliers.<\/p> <p>  Earlier this week, I published the overview of complaints for 2021 in accordance with our governing legislation.  This publication details the 4,658 complaints we received in 2021 and the outcomes we delivered that year, including the conclusion of 5,010 complaints.  During 2021, the total sum of compensation or settlements that complainants benefitted from, through the various stages of our services in mediation, formal investigation and on-the-record offers made by providers, amounted to more than &euro;7 million.  This does not include the very significant but unquantifiable benefits, in terms of redress by rectification, secured by complainants.  I have given the committee some statistics from the overview of complaints, which I will be happy to discuss with the committee.<\/p> <p>  The overview of complaints contains numerous case studies of complaints concluded in 2021 across our service.  These case studies highlight a noticeable increase in the number of complaints made to the FSPO in the area of investment fraud and cryptocurrency where the financial and personal impact of these fraud incidents remains very significant.  Again, I have given some examples that I would be happy to discuss.<\/p> <p>  Global advances in technology over the past ten years have left many consumers at a disadvantage when accessing digital financial products with which they may be unfamiliar.  The complaints we have received highlight, in stark terms, the need to be mindful of the risks posed by investing in unregulated activities, such as apparent cryptocurrency trading, which very often carries a higher risk and level of volatility, than regulated product offerings.  The widespread availability of financial services online creates opportunities for consumers to gain access to a wide variety of financial products.  However, this also carries significant risks.<\/p><p>When a consumer purchases an unregulated product, he or she may not have the benefits afforded by the consumer protection framework and may not be able to make a complaint to our office about it.<br\/><br\/>It is notable that the Central Bank of Ireland issued, earlier this month, a warning on investing in cryptocurrency.  It is clear, from the complaints we receive and concerns at a regulatory level, that every opportunity should be taken to highlight the risks for consumers so that they can make informed decisions.<br\/><br\/>Our Overview of Complaints 2021 provides information on the reasons for complaints brought to our office.  Almost a quarter of the complaints made to the office in 2021, or 23%, were about poor customer service from financial service providers.  Many customers experience frustration over the level of customer service offered by their provider.  It seems a more responsive approach from providers could resolve such complaints more quickly or, indeed, prevent many of these from arising.<br\/><br\/>In this regard, one of our strategic priorities &mdash; sharing and influencing &mdash; recognises that the insights and data that the FSPO shares can positively influence how financial service providers interact with their customers, including in dealing with complaints, and can promote the more-adequate resourcing of complaint-handling.<br\/><br\/>Our current strategic plan, launched by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, last year and entitled Connecting and Innovating, includes our strategic priority of evolving and innovating, which entails renewing our commitment to continuing to adapt and evolve our service to both anticipate and respond to the changing needs and expectations of all our customers.  In delivering on this priority, we will shortly publish a new customer charter and customer action plan, which have been developed through a consultative process with our internal and external customers.<br\/><br\/>I recognise that the customer experience of our own service users is a continuation of a consumer&rsquo;s journey in seeking to resolve his or her financial service or pension complaint and that the provision of good customer service is not something that we can hold financial service providers and pension providers alone accountable for.<br\/><br\/>This office continues to work to place the consumer at the heart of its processes and to contribute to making his or her complaint journey a fair, efficient and effective one, regardless of the eventual outcome.  To this end, our new customer charter and customer action plan will strengthen our existing commitments by going further than ever before to enhance our service quality, accessibility and choice, along with broadening our information-sharing and stakeholder-engagement activities.<br\/><br\/>The customer charter introduces further commitments in areas such as service evaluation and sustainability, which will increase our transparency, demonstrate our accountability and underpin our commitment as an environmentally conscious public sector body.  Most especially, the customer action plan will ardently reflect our commitment, under our strategic plan, to equality and human rights as well as our public sector duty.  It will espouse our values of fairness and integrity by positively influencing access to our services for all our customers equally, promoting fairness and welcoming diversity.<br\/><br\/>The Oireachtas has granted this office the power to publish anonymised legally binding decisions regarding complaints against financial service providers.  To date, more than 1,500 such decisions have been published and are available online through our website.  In addition, our governing legislation allows for the publication of case studies of pension complaints.  I believe the publication of FSPO decisions and case studies greatly helps to broaden the awareness of the role of the office and promotes a greater understanding of how we deal with complaints against financial service providers and pension providers.<br\/><br\/>To date, we have published seven digests of decisions, which include short summaries or case studies of a selection of legally binding decisions.  These digests enable us to highlight particular categories of complaints.  Our must recently published one, our digest of travel insurance complaintspublished in February 2022, highlighted important factors for consumers to consider if buying travel insurance and identified examples of where complaints were upheld because of a failure by the insurer.<br\/><br\/>In 2021, we published a digest of decisions relating to complaints from businesses.  Included are summaries of 12 decisions relating to declined business-interruption insurance claims arising from the Covid-19 pandemic.  In 2021, we continued to receive complaints where the complainant introduced Covid-19 as an element of their complaint.  In addition to 600 complaints received in 2020, a further 275 new complaints of this nature were received in 2021, and we continued to prioritise complaints concerning business-interruption insurance in recognition of the importance to policyholders of achieving a swift understanding as to whether they were entitled to policy benefit payments.<br\/><br\/>In addition to publicly sharing our decisions, case studies and publications, the Act facilitates the sharing of information by the FSPO with the regulatory authorities &mdash; the Central Bank of Ireland, the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, and the Pensions Authority &mdash; in a way that contributes to promoting the best interests of consumers and actual or potential beneficiaries of financial or pension services and to the efficient and effective handling of complaints.<br\/><br\/>Sharing information is a crucial part of ensuring the effective operation of the consumer protection framework, alerting regulatory authorities to potentially systemic issues that may warrant further consideration by those authorities.  Our relationships with the regulatory authorities are marked by close co-operation and positive interaction, recognising our individual roles in the consumer protection framework.<br\/><br\/>In 2021, in addition to the two legally binding decisions we referred to the Pensions Authority and the 13 legally binding decisions referred by our office to the Central Bank of Ireland, we shared a copy of every legally binding decision issued concerning a complaint about a tracker mortgage interest rate with the Central Bank of Ireland.  The same approach was adopted for legally binding decisions issued in complaints concerning declined insurance claims for business interruption losses.<br\/><br\/>In addition to sharing our data and insights with the regulatory authorities, providers and their representative bodies, the FSPO recognises the value of its information to consumers.  Our strategic plan establishes connecting and engaging as a strategic priority for us in the coming period.<br\/><br\/>Since 2021, we have worked to enhance our website, focusing on providing information on our services in an accessible way.  This has included the creation and promotion of a series of online animated videos designed to communicate with our customers and prospective customers on how our processes work.  These videos use clear language and subtitles to ensure accessibility for all our customers.<br\/><br\/>In delivering against this strategic priority, the FSPO has begun to utilise social media as a communications tool in addition to more traditional communications channels.  We are growing our audience online so that those who may have less familiarity with our services can find us when they need us and learn more about our role.<br\/><br\/>Interestingly, 74% of complaints to the FSPO in 2021 were received online, by comparison with 50% in 2019.  There is no doubt that the pandemic has further accelerated the transition to digital engagement for many.  However, we are very conscious of the risk of digital exclusion.  In that regard, we are developing our communications strategy, which will include actions to engage across the country, including with groups of consumers who may have lower levels of awareness of our services, and working with stakeholders to do so.<br\/><br\/>I thank the committee for the opportunity to engage with it today.  Our office plays a key role in Ireland&rsquo;s consumer protection framework.  We perform our statutory role guided by our values of fairness, integrity, independence, accessibility and effectiveness.  We are committed to delivering for our customers and continuing to improve the quality of our service.  For the FSPO, as for all organisations, the impact of Covid-19 has continued to feature over the past two years.  I pay tribute to our staff, whose dedication to our work and customers continues in spite of the personal challenges posed over that period.  We will be very happy to answer any questions members may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2022033100002#A00500","nonspeaker":"Ms MaryRose McGovern","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648681200,"counter":762,"content":"<p>I thank Ms McGovern.

In both 2020 and 2021, the vast majority of complaints that we closed were closed informally.  We have a very high percentage of closures using our dispute-resolution service, whereby the parties themselves, through the assistance of the FSPO mediator made available to them, get the opportunity to design their own solutions.  They can then choose the terms on which they can resolve their complaints.  It is very much within their own control.  It is our default process.  It is our absolute preference that the parties themselves be able to resolve their complaints.  However, if that does not prove possible, we move on to the formal investigation process.  That takes a good bit longer.  It is a very detailed process involving the gathering of evidence and information from both parties and ensuring both have a comprehensive opportunity to make their submissions about the issue that gives rise to the complaint, because ultimately the outcome of that process is a legally binding decision.<\/p><p>For that reason, we want to make sure those parties are thoroughly heard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2022033100002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Ms MaryRose McGovern","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648681200,"counter":765,"content":"<p>In regard to business interruption insurance, what seems to be the issue?

Insofar as the legally binding decisions are concerned, the outcomes of those complaints very much depend on the wording of the policy provisions.  The Chairman may have seen today that another High Court decision has been delivered by Mr. Justice McDonald in a similar situation.  Again, the very specific wording of the policy was at the heart of the comments made by the judge.  The wording of the particular policy is very important.  As with any other policy, whether for travel insurance or household insurance, it is useful for consumers purchasing a policy to take a little bit of time to get familiar with the policy wording and to try to develop an understanding of precisely what cover they are purchasing and will be paying for.  To come back to the Chair's original question, the outcome of those complaints very much depends on the wording of the policy itself.  That is why we chose to include 12 decisions in that digest to enable people to compare those outcomes, which were based on the policy wording at play in each case.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2022033100002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Ms MaryRose McGovern"},{"type":"speech","time":1648681200,"counter":767,"content":"<p>In this day and age, why is it that banks do not allow people to use their bank cards to purchase cryptocurrency but those same banks will give people a loan to buy it?

Anything we publish is anonymised.  Cryptocurrency is a highly risky and volatile investment product.  In saying that, I am very conscious that people who believe they are investing in cryptocurrency are probably not doing that but are rather investing in something that is in some way linked to the price of cryptocurrency.  However, unless you have the key to Bitcoin or Ethereum, you do not really own cryptocurrency.  When you are lured onto one of these sites and encouraged to invest in these online platforms, you may be given the option to invest in what are really contracts for difference or it may turn out that the platform is fraudulent and induces you to start trading with, perhaps, $200 or &euro;250.  You can then feel quite empowered by the results the fraudulent website leads to you to believe you are achieving.<\/p> <p>  Philippa, the subject of one of the other case studies we included in our recent publication, actually received money into her account on foot of trades she believed she was entering into.  It was on the strength of this that she began to have faith in the process and ultimately borrowed quite a large amount of money, which was not as much as the investment manager had been encouraging her to borrow but was still &euro;20,000, and placed it in what she believed to be a cryptocurrency investment.  When the whole thing crumbled away, there was nothing there and the money was gone.  There was nothing behind all of the lovely visuals she was seeing on her screen.  There was no substance.  It is probably a good thing that a bank does not permit the purchase of cryptocurrency with a credit card because it is a high-risk purchase and declining a transaction of that nature and asking people whether they are sure they want to do that is probably a good thing for a bank to do.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the particular case study the Chairman has talked about, the parties themselves agreed to a resolution within the mediation space.

I thank the ombudsman for her statement and for sharing her insights with us.  One of my roles within Fine Gael is that I am the spokesperson on finance technology.  That is because I worked in the area before I became a Deputy.  I will focus my contribution and questions on cryptocurrencies.  We all know about the prevalence of phishing scams, fraudulent phone calls and malicious text messages.  They are discussed widely in the communities we represent.  Innovations like online trading and cryptocurrency sales are not immune from fraud either.  Trading in cryptocurrencies is quite a high-risk activity, which is why I believe that, at the very least, we need to have warnings on cryptocurrencies.  Government absolutely supports the development of new financial technologies, as we should because that spurs innovation and digitalisation, but the warnings from the Central Bank, which the ombudsman has spoken about here, are clear.  The Central Bank has highlighted the risks involved in buying or investing in virtual currencies.  Cryptocurrencies are not guaranteed by the Central Bank.  There are no guarantees and no safeguards such as those in respect of regulated financial services.  As the ombudsman's case studies have shown, there is a chance of losing one's investment.  As I have said, it is a high-risk activity and people need to know that before they consider investing.  I was quite struck by what the ombudsman said with regard to it not being possible to use credit cards for that purpose.  That is something I was not aware of but I was very pleased to hear it.<\/p> <p>  Anecdotally, I see a rise in interest among young people, particularly young men, in buying and investing in virtual currencies.  While I would not like to quell anyone's interest in investing or financial pursuits in any way, it is very important that all investors fully understand the risks involved.  Virtual currencies have no status as legal tender for payments in Ireland.  They are not guaranteed or regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland.  Unfortunately, as many of the people who have come to the ombudsman have found, this can lead to losing one's investment or being the victim of fraud.  The ombudsman's case studies are really important in showcasing this issue.  Tom lost &euro;60,000, Paul and Philippa lost &euro;20,000 each and Noah lost almost &euro;30,000.  These are big-figure sums and we do not know the personal circumstances of these people who lost all this money.  We do not know the impact that loss had on their household budgets or on their mental health.<\/p> <p>  Since 23 April last year, providers of certain services relating to virtual assets have had to meet anti-money laundering obligations and obligations in respect of countering financial terrorism.  Virtual currency providers established here in Ireland are required to register with the Central Bank.  It is important to say we should not lose sight of the fact that sanctions against Russia are changing this landscape even further day by day.  The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission updated its advice on purchasing and investing in digital currencies and cryptocurrencies last year.  While steps are being taken to make people aware of the risks associated with cryptocurrencies, I am honestly not sure they are enough.  We need a sustained information campaign and visible warnings on all advertisements for virtual currencies.  That includes online advertisements on social media.  Does the ombudsman think that would be helpful?  Would it be practical and enforceable?  Does she have any other advice as to what the Government or the Central Bank should be doing to tackle this?<\/p> <p>  Before I give her the opportunity to respond, I will commend the ombudsman and her team on all they are doing to connect and engage online.  All of the investment in videos, the online complaints mechanism, the online presence and social media is positive and progressive.  The fact that three out of every four complaints are now being made online shows her strategy is working, especially when combined with the continuing outreach and communication with people who are not IT literate, about whom the ombudsman has spoken.  That is a very comprehensive and holistic campaign and strategy for engaging with people.  Well done on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2022033100002#C01000","speaker":"1566"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648681200,"counter":774,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  Coming back to crypto-assets, the first point I would like to highlight is that they are not a regulated product.  Any issue arising out of cryptocurrency, therefore, is not necessarily a complaint that can be made to our office.  One can see from the case studies that we have published in the overview that, in most instances, the reason a complaint came to the office was because, after money had been transferred, the nature of the complaint was one against that person's bank for having transferred the money, or for failing to successfully charge back or pullback the money after a single euro payments area, SEPA, or Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, SWIFT, transfer.  Insofar as the providers of cryptocurrency are concerned, however, this office has no jurisdiction because they are not regulated financial service providers.<\/p> <p>  Having said that, the market in crypto-assets, MiCA, regulation is making its way through Europe at the moment.  However, I do not expect it to become effective until 2023-2024.  Even at that stage, there will be a transitional period of, I believe, 18 months.  This is not something that will happen overnight.  The approach to be adopted with the MiCA regulation is a little bit like the markets in financial instruments directive, MiFID, with a cooling off period and an actin-in-the-best-interests-of-the-customer approach, but we are a long way from that.  One of the issues with investing is that consumers who are going online will not find themselves necessarily investing with providers that will be covered under MiCA or regulated by any particular competent authority.<\/p> <p>  This is probably a good opportunity to say that the office expects regulated financial service providers to take the steps to establish suitability with their customers as to whether a product is regulated.  I say that because although the office does not have jurisdiction over unregulated financial service providers, there are some regulated financial service providers that also make unregulated product offerings.  In that context, before introducing an unregulated product, we would expect the regulated providers to ensure that they have established suitability.  From a consumer point of view, it is very important to take the time to try to develop an understanding as to who one is engaging with, are they regulated or unregulated, will one have the benefit of the consumer protection framework if something goes wrong, and will one be able to make a complaint to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman?<\/p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned young men, and why this is happening.  It certainly appears that the ability to use one&rsquo;s mobile phone makes this a very friendly, easy and comfortable interaction.  We carry our mobile phones around in our pockets.  They do not threaten us and seem like perfectly trustworthy devices.  Being able to engage online in what appears to a person to be an investment platform with a view to earning money or finding some way to yield some profit creates, perhaps, a comfortable space, whereas one might otherwise perhaps think twice about taking some of those steps to transfer money.<\/p> <p>  One of the things mentioned by the Deputy is the personal impact on people, which is not just financial, there is also a mental impact.  She mentioned that we do not know what their personal circumstances are.  One of the other case studies in the overview that was published this week was the case of Cathal, who sent money to England for the purposes of buying a tractor.  Things did not go right and neither the tractor nor the money were recoverable by Cathal.  It was on foot of that loss that he then engaged in online trading with a view to recovering his losses.  There is an element of people perhaps not making the wisest decisions when they are under pressure financially from other sources.<\/p> <p>  There is also the case of Pavel, who was feeling a little bit alienated from his children who were living in a different country and were reaching life stages where he wanted to give them some money.  He felt a little bit under pressure and wanted to earn some money fast and, unfortunately, things did not go right for him either.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned Noah.  I will also mention him because this was not a crypto-investment but was a loss of &euro;29,000 because Noah transferred funds using an international bank account number, IBAN, which he believed to be the correct one but which, it transpired, was incorrect.  Noah&rsquo;s bank moved very quickly to try to recall that money and managed to get &euro;9,000 back, but the complaint was made to our office against the bank for having failed to recover all of the moneys.  I would like to highlight that case study if I could for the Deputy because it is important for consumers to understand that an IBAN is a unique identifier in accordance with the payment services regulations.  There is no cross-matching process and the bank is obliged to carry out the instructions that it is given by way of the identification of that IBAN.  The bank had no way of knowing that it was a fraudulent IBAN.  It is very important to double-check the IBAN details because that combination of letters and digits is very critical to ensuring that the money will end up where one wants it to go.  There are practices I see taking place where an IBAN is received in writing, and then there is a phone call to validate that verbally as well as in writing.  That is probably a good thing, particularly if one is transferring a large amount of money.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2022033100002#D00100","nonspeaker":"Ms MaryRose McGovern"},{"type":"speech","time":1648681200,"counter":775,"content":"<p>I do not know if the Ombudsman can get into this level of detail, but did somebody intercept their communication and put it into-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2022033100002#D00200","speaker":"1566"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648681200,"counter":776,"content":"<p>Yes, his email account had been hacked.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2022033100002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Ms MaryRose McGovern"},{"type":"speech","time":1648681200,"counter":777,"content":"<p>Wow.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2022033100002#D00400","speaker":"1566"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648681200,"counter":778,"content":"<p>I do not think that is an isolated incident; it tends to happen a great deal.

No matter how patient one is, to have to hold on for more than ten minutes is frustrating, let alone when it goes over half an hour.<\/p> <p>  I was conscious of that research when I was looking at the statistics in terms of complaints to this office.  Customer service was identified as an issue in 23% of complaints.  That seems to bear out that research.  I was pleased to see the Central Bank has indicated it would have certain expectations from financial service providers in terms of customer support access.<\/p> <p>  Having said that, many customers are quite happy to engage online, whether it is through a chat forum or by way of email.  However, the demographic that wants to pick up the phone and talk to a human being should be able to receive a service within a reasonable period of time.  I am not in disagreement with the Senator.<\/p> <p>  In terms of our own engagement with the Central Bank of Ireland, we have a very good working relationship.  I was conscious that the Governor, Mr. Makhlouf, was speaking yesterday at the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach.  He indicated that one of the Central Bank's priorities for its work plan this year was the review of the consumer protection code.  It is reaching a stage where it will go out for further comments and consultation from stakeholders.<\/p> <p>  Happily, we have been on notice of the work being undertaken for quite a period.  I wrote to the Cental Bank in 2020 and again in 2021 to identify some issues of which we took the view that it would be useful to take account in the work being undertaken on the review of the consumer protection code.

The submissions made to the Central Bank are available on our website if anyone would like to have a look at them.<\/p> <p>  One of the issues we identified was the online purchase of insurance policies and we took the view that the duty of disclosure is a two-way street.  It works both ways.  The concept of filling in an application form and providing certain information and then being asked to accept assumptions which form the basis of the contract, without being required to acknowledge each of them individually, was likely to give rise to complaints.  We did not take the view that the consumer would necessarily understand what assumptions they were agreeing to.<\/p> <p>  We took the view that there was an emerging difficulty arising out of auto-renewal of motor insurance policies; namely, the lack of clarity around whether auto-renewal would involve the same contract, the same premium or the same terms, and the question of whether one could withdraw from it.  We thought it would be useful to look at those sorts of questions.<\/p> <p>  One of the significant issues for this office is the use of branding.  It is increasingly difficult for consumers to understand with whom they are in a contractual relationship.  If you went off today and spoke to your broker about incepting a household insurance policy, you might make a claim in a few months' time only to get correspondence from somebody to say the claim had been looked at and declined.  If you wanted to make a complaint, you might get a letter, and then you might come to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman.  Typically, consumers in those circumstances are completely confused as to who they should make a complaint about.  Some will believe they should make a complaint against the broker that sold the policy.  Others will believe the complaint should be made against the entity that wrote to decline the claim.  In a large number of cases, it transpires that the complaint should be made about be a third party, the insurer, which has outsourced its claims handling or management to a claims-handling company.  It is very difficult for consumers to understand who they should complain about.<\/p> <p>  It should not be a struggle for consumers to understand with whom they are in a contractual relationship.  In the context of that branding piece, in our submission of April 2021 we asked the Central Bank, in its work on the consumer protection code, to have a look at the regulatory obligation when issuing final response letters to give better information to consumers in order that they might understand who is responsible for the conduct about which they are complaining, and whether that relationship is complicated by an outsourcing, an intermediary or whatever it might be.<\/p> <p>  I know the Central Bank has questions in its own mind about information overload.  However, one of the issues we raised with it was the issue of communications.  People can become quite upset when they receive periodic notifications and they do not necessarily understand that they are mandatory and that the bank really has no option but to send them out.  Perhaps the solution is to say that they are mandatory and that might help people to understand, but we think there are lots-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2022033100002#E00500","nonspeaker":"Ms MaryRose McGovern"},{"type":"speech","time":1648681200,"counter":796,"content":"<p>My apologies.

I am conscious of time and I do not want to hold up the meeting.  I thank the witnesses for their engagement, which has been very positive.  In her presentation to us today, Ms McGovern spoke about how almost one quarter, that is, 22%, of the complaints made to her office were about poor customer service.  I say to the ombudsman, Chairman and members that this is something on which I am actually very strong.  Does the ombudsman have any role, and again, this is a bit like the last question I asked, in terms of making a requirement on the banks?  Is it a Central Bank of Ireland requirement to engage with and be conscious of the needs of customers in the case of service but also in the mundane nature of simple information?<\/p> <p>  I will finish on this.  The whole context of travel insurance is fraught with hardship for people.  Ms McGovern made a comment that in the context of travel insurance, ensuring the appropriate cover should be straightforward and do what it says in the print, and that we should not have to go through the small print where people can, if you like, be tripped up.  As Ms McGovern will know, many people come to us and to the ombudsman about insurance policies when they do not have the cover they think they have.  Has she any advice on what the ombudsman can do in terms of working with providers of travel insurance, but also with the banks, in terms of customer service?  I will conclude on that point.  Again, I thank the witnesses for their courtesy and their presentation today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2022033100002#F00100","speaker":"1637"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648681200,"counter":802,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator.  Starting with the customer service piece, the role of this office is to investigate individual complaints.  Where any complaint is received that has a customer service element, we will investigate that and if we find that the complaint should be upheld, we will direct compensation as appropriate.  We share our insights and outcomes around that piece to do with customer service complaints and those 1,500 decisions are available in our database of decisions.  We want all providers, consumers and consumer bodies to be familiar with those decisions in order that there can be an understanding as to how we approach the sorts of issues that arise when customer service is delivered in a way that is poor.<\/p> <p>  Coming back to travel insurance, whatever the size of the print, our expectation is that the wording should be clear.  It should not be a struggle for the policyholder to read the provisions and understand whether they are covered.  One of the case studies in our travel insurance digest concerned Mark and Sandra, who were abroad and headed off on a three-hour hike.  When they came back, their rental car had been broken into and their valuables were gone.  One policy provision said in that instance that valuables that were left in a locked car would not be covered.  Not too far away, however, was another policy provision that indicated that valuables left in a locked vehicle would only be covered if it was between daylight hours of 9 a.m. and 9 p.m.  Those were completely and utterly in conflict.  That is simply not acceptable.  A person should be able to pick up his or her policy and be able to see the headings and negotiate it.  I would urge and encourage consumers, and I am conscious it is that time of year, which is why we published the travel digest at that time, who are looking at accepting travel insurance policies to have a look at the digest and some of those other case studies.<\/p> <p>  Sometimes, there is not an understanding as to the cover one is putting in place and particularly around the issue of pre-existing medical conditions.  We can be very optimistic about our own health.  We might think we are absolutely fine but if a person had blood tests last month or X-rays or whatever it might be, even if his or her condition does not have a name, it may be a pre-existing condition because there is something at play that is under investigation at the moment.  Before I finish up with the Senator, I might ask my colleague, Dr. Carroll, to come in on issues arising out of some of those questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2022033100002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Ms MaryRose McGovern"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648681200,"counter":803,"content":"<p>With regard to the queries Senator Buttimer raised around the sharing of information with the regulatory system, as the ombudsman outlined, that is a key focus for us in the FSPO.

In Ms McGovern's opinion, should there be a national warning campaign on the dos and don'ts of this but to have it, as we say in the House, in plain English with the risk factors laid out?

If there is a complaint about a failure to recognise or pay out on an insurance policy, that is a sort of complaint we can have a look at to see if it is coming.  There may be an issue around time limits.  I do not know how long ago it is but we would certainly be able to look at that and assess it, and, if it comes within the jurisdiction and time limits of the office then certainly, we would be able to investigate it then.  The starting position would need to be to follow the usual process to make the complaint to the bank in question and get the final response letter.  If the person is still not satisfied then, she can fill in the complaint form and we will pick it up from there.  We would be happy to do that.<\/p> <p>  I will ask my colleague to talk to the Deputy a little bit about the disability liaison officer question but I might just come back to the Covid complaints.  There are 600 complaints that are referred to in the overview of complaints.  Those are complaints where the complainants themselves identified Covid-19 as an element.  They are not necessarily business interruption complaints.  Of the 600 complaints we received in 2020, we saw those thankfully peter off a little bit.  Then, we received 275 Covid complaints in their entirety in 2021, of which 75 were business interruption complaints.<\/p><p>I do not know if that answers the questions.  We have tagged them.  We tried to make sure we kept an eye on these as soon as they started coming in.  We tagged them once the complainant indicated there was a Covid-19 element so we could keep an eye on whether there were business interruptions or payment break issues arising.  If somebody was looking for a payment break against a background of Covid-19, we could keep an eye on those and prioritise as appropriate, depending on what was going on with those complaints.

If we are doing a very good job and sharing our insights, we should be trying to put ourselves out of business.  We should have no complaints.  However, complaints will be received and if we can possibly encourage the parties to engage and achieve a settlement through mediation, that preserves the relationship in a better way than if the complaint proceeds to a legally binding outcome.

We are constantly scanning the horizon to see how we can improve our processes and work smarter with a view to moving those things along.

I am probably of the old school in that I do not have Revolut and I barely have the mobile app on my phone.  It is discommoding to people.  It is not just a rural issue.  It is an urban issue as well in terms of bank closures.  Today I saw that a bank in Cork was selling off three of its properties, and that is their prerogative.  I know the ombudsman probably has no role in this, but we need to make a stand in terms of the provision of services for people.  It goes back to the whole issue of customer care and customer service.  If the dilution of customer care and customer service continues, the ombudsman's office will be inundated and there will be a deluge of complaints.  I am genuinely concerned that there is a diminution of service.  We are moving to an online platform, which I know will happen eventually in total, but I am concerned about that and I hope the ombudsman's office would promulgate, advise and advocate that we should also have an element of customer care and customer service physically on the ground.  The banks cannot just use the words \"change\" and \"Covid\" to herald that sort of movement away from the on-street banks to the online platform.

We have a broad and growing remit.  However, our core focus has always stayed the same: to drive improvements in the quality and safety of care provided to the public.  The Act sets out the services, also known as designated centres, that are subject to regulation, which include nursing homes, residential services for people with disabilities and children&rsquo;s special care units.  HIQA&rsquo;s role as the independent regulator is to ensure people living in designated centres are provided with a safe living environment and have a good quality of life.<\/p> <p>  Social care is evolving, and based on our 15 years&rsquo; experience as a regulator, we believe changes to the legislative framework are required to better support people who may be vulnerable.  We have previously highlighted the need to reform the Health Act 2007 and associated regulations.  For example, the Act contains a narrow definition of a designated centre that limits the regulatory protection for people with a disability to the confines of the centre&rsquo;s footprint.  We need a broader definition that takes a more holistic view of the supports people with disabilities require, providing greater protection and enhancing their quality of life.<\/p> <p>  The 2013 regulations made under the Act, which set out the minimum legal requirements for the providers of disability services, must also be reviewed to better reflect new and innovative approaches to meet the needs of people with disabilities.  HIQA has made submissions to the Department of Health regarding its work on deprivation of liberty arrangements, which are another key component for the implementation of the UNCRPD, and which should be reflected in the 2013 regulations.  Furthermore, we are informed the relevant sections of the Assisted Decision Making (Capacity) Act 2015, under which the decision support service was established, are due to be commenced in June this year.<\/p> <p>  HIQA has always continued to campaign for the introduction of strong and effective adult safeguarding legislation to ensure the most vulnerable people in our communities are protected.  Everyone has the right to be safe and to live a life free from harm.  Placing adult safeguarding on a statutory footing acknowledges the State&rsquo;s commitment to adults at risk and the duty of civil society to adopt a zero tolerance approach to adult abuse.  In the absence of safeguarding legislation, HIQA is committed to using the current regulatory framework to minimise risk for people living in designated centres.  However, ensuring people with disabilities are free from exploitation, violence and abuse can only be achieved when all parties understand and exercise their responsibilities.<\/p> <p>  The primary responsibility for protecting people with disabilities in designated centres rests with providers, who must ensure their staff can recognise and report any suspicions of abuse and that residents are empowered to do the same.  When suspicions are reported, it is essential that providers have measures in place to prioritise the protections of residents and to investigate these allegations.  HIQA&rsquo;s role is to examine the safeguarding measures in place to ensure they are as robust as possible and, where there are inadequate arrangements, to require the provider to take action to improve them.<\/p> <p>  Another aspect of safeguarding relates to the accommodation of residents who do not wish to live together or who are living in large groups, sometimes in overcrowded environments.  This has led residents in some centres to express their distress and unhappiness behaviourally.  It has also, on occasion, led to residents hurting and harming themselves or their fellow residents, sometimes on an ongoing basis, and to residents living in fear of their peers.  This is not acceptable and has been a major challenge for the disability sector.<\/p> <p>  Sadly, we not only witness examples of residents abusing other residents but also of sustained organisational abuse where the provider has failed adequately to protect residents and meet their needs.  While this situation can occur in any setting, there is a higher risk of organisational abuse in congregated settings than in community-based houses.  Residents who live in congregated or campus-based settings often experience inequalities in the quality and safety of their services, control over their own lives and the ability to exercise their rights and choices independently.  While there has been a continued effort within the disability sector to reduce the number of large congregated settings, many residents continue to be accommodated in these living arrangements.  Some 2,419 people currently live in congregated settings, and while this is a reduction of 422 people on 2020, further work is required to ensure the reliance on congregated settings is reduced.<\/p> <p>  Finally, I assure the committee of HIQA&rsquo;s commitment to promote and protect the rights of people with a disability to live in a safe environment.  I will continue to engage with the Department of Health and the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth to support the development of safeguarding legislation and to update the Health Act 2007 and associated regulations to ensure they continue to provide protection for people with disabilities and reflect changes in the legal landscape, including the implementation of the UNCRPD.<\/p> <p>  I thank the members for their attention this morning, and we look forward to answering any questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022033100002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Carol Grogan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648681200,"counter":857,"content":"<p>I represent Sage Advocacy, but I am also the programme director of Ireland&rsquo;s only dedicated, multidisciplinary and multisectoral adult safeguarding programme, which is hosted in the school of nursing and midwifery in Trinity College Dublin.  Safeguarding may be defined as, &ldquo;Putting measures in place to reduce the risk of harm, promote and protect people&rsquo;s human rights and their health and well-being, and empowering people to protect themselves.&rdquo;<\/p> <p>  Sage Advocacy is an independent organisation, operating across Ireland to provide information, support and advocacy for older people and adults who may be at risk, be they in the community, residing in long-term care or other settings.  We seek to promote social inclusion, equality and social justice in all aspects of our work.  We engage with policymakers, civil society partners and media to raise awareness of systemic issues in the public interest as well as conducting research in these areas.  The service provides information and support and individual case-based representative advocacy.  Annually, we provide advocacy support to almost 1,500 people as well as information and support to 2,000 people.<\/p> <p>  The right of a person to have his or her voice heard and to participate in making decisions that affect him or her is a fundamental principle in a democratic society.  It is a principle that can be simply stated as: nothing about you without you.  For people at risk, having independent advocacy is crucial.  This is the process of supporting people to make and communicate decisions and to participate in decisions about their lives, such as access to finances, accessing services, planning ahead, support when there is desire to move residence, issues relating to abuse and-or neglect, and barriers to decision-making.  Consequently, our work maps to the objectives of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disability, which Ireland ratified in 2018.  The work we undertake provides an important resource for individuals at risk of abuse, yet statutory advocacy support on an independent basis, despite being available in other jurisdictions, is not within Ireland&rsquo;s safeguarding responses.<\/p> <p>  It is a fact of life that some adults will find themselves at risk.  While thousands of adults receive care at home, with family members acting as a principal carer, more still receive care in a variety of residential care settings.<\/p><p>It must be acknowledged that though many caregivers discharge their responsibilities conscientiously and to the best of their abilities, this does not guarantee that the rights, will and preference of the individual are front and centre.<\/p><p> The pandemic is unprecedented in living memory and Sage Advocacy has observed that it has exacerbated existing safeguarding concerns while enabling new ones.  This strengthens the argument to take action and we refer, based on a number of years of experience in this area, to two imperative areas.  These are safeguarding legislation and attending to the deprivation of liberty.  We strongly support a legislative framework to protect adults at risk from abuse.  What we know from other countries that nobody is getting it completely right but the presence of legislation, such as the Care Act 2014 in the UK or Nova Scotia's Protection for Persons in Care Act 2004, as amended in 2017, are useful instruments in prevention, intervention and ongoing case management. <\/p><p> Abuse and neglect of vulnerable adults is significantly under-reported in Ireland due to a lack of public awareness of what constitutes abuse, cultural issues and a lack of comprehensive policy and legal safeguards to prevent the abuse of adults at risk and to protect them from abuse.  Current safeguarding policies are limited, resulting in inconsistent approaches across sectors and organisations and gaps in responses from State agencies and other parties to adequately safeguard the person at risk of abuse.  In the absence of primary safeguarding legislation, guidance and information is required to ensure personal sensitive information and data can be shared securely for the purposes of safeguarding a person at risk.  This contrasts with the suite of legislation available for safeguarding children.<\/p><p> In addition, we have an obligation to address explicitly liberty protection.  Everyone has the right to liberty.  This means persons cannot have their liberty taken away unless it is in accordance with law.  This might seem to be something that is taken for granted but our experience demonstrates blurring of lines and supports the impetus for overt robust safeguarding responses in this regard.<\/p><p> We wish to make a number of key points.  A deprivation of liberty is defined as an oppressive restriction by a third party.  People are de facto detained if they are in residential care and the building is secured, requiring residents to ask permission to leave the premises.  Where a person&rsquo;s liberty is being restricted, they should have access to an independent advocate to ensure their will and preference is heard.  Any process to safeguard a person's liberty should apply to all people equally.  Individuals who are residing in a care setting may not have made the choice to do so but are there due to a lack of a statutory right to homecare, a lack of flexible models of care to meet individual's needs, and lack of adequate homecare service provision.  In supporting the case for exercise of the right to liberty by a person at risk, care should be taken to ensure that the situation of persons whose rights might be disproportionately harmed by such an exercise are fully considered and discussed with all relevant parties.<\/p><p> Having structures of legislation and policy are important but oversight of the process translates to its efficacy and quality, especially for the adult at risk.  Observing the work of safeguarding in the UK, Sir James Munby, former president of the Court of Protection, commented on the importance of actively supporting the will, preference, values and beliefs of individuals.  When judging a case a number of years ago he asked, \"What good is it making someone safer if it merely makes them miserable?\"  Working through a human rights lens by authentically using the principles of safeguarding developed by HIQA, the Mental Health Commission and other agencies will underpin supporting each individual's will, preference, value and beliefs, regardless of physical or cognitive ability, biased influence from others or domicile.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022033100002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Amanda Phelan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648681200,"counter":859,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for this opportunity.  My evidence reflects my views as an academic clinician and not necessarily the views of my employers.  I am professor of psychiatry at Trinity College Dublin and consultant psychiatrist in the public mental health service.  My chief interest is social justice and safeguarding mental health, freedom, autonomy, and social well-being as reflected in Articles 16 and 19 of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  I submit that Ireland is failing to safeguard these rights for people with severe mental illness such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.  These failings, although not deliberate, are widespread, systematic, predictable and preventable.  They constitute a form of structural violence that amplifies disability, stigma and social exclusion.  I will outline three challenges and solutions.  These are treating mental illness, safeguarding liberty and safeguarding social and medical well-being in the community.<\/p> <p>  Mental illness is treatable, mostly by primary care and community teams.  Ireland devotes 5.1% of the health budget to mental health.  Sl&aacute;intecare recommends 10%.  The World Health Organization suggests 12% and in the UK, it is almost 13%.  Ireland has the third lowest number of psychiatry inpatient beds per 100,000 population in the EU.  Recruitment problems are endemic.  Consultant posts commonly attract zero applicants.  These deficits severely impact rights, especially full inclusion and participation.  That is the first challenge, namely, treating mental illness.  What are the solutions?  Mental health services require 10% of the health budget.  The division between mental health and addiction services needs to be resolved.  Addressing service deficits will help recruitment.<\/p> <p>  With regard to safeguarding liberty, in the 1950s Ireland had more than 20,000 people in psychiatric hospitals, the highest rate in the world.  By 2020, we had 1,826 adult psychiatry inpatients and 50 inpatients aged under 18.  This is a dramatic reduction.  Our involuntary admission rate is half that of England.  This is very positive but low admissions come at a price, which is people with mental illness in prison, homeless or at home and too ill to accept treatment but not ill enough for treatment without consent.  My colleague Professor Gautam Gulati led reviews of mental illness in Irish prisoners and found elevated rates of mental illness, substance misuse, homelessness and intellectual disability.  Prison is toxic for people with mental illness.  That is second challenge, namely, disproportionate deprivation of liberty.  What are the solutions?  Proposals before the Oireachtas to update the Mental Health Act 2001 should be revised and progressed.  The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 is due to commence in full.  The HSE national office for human rights and equality policy is doing superb work to ensure it helps safeguard autonomy.  In 2021, the Inspector of Mental Health Services noted we have an excellent but under-resourced and overworked court diversion service.  He added that we \"still have people who are severely mentally ill locked in isolation units and other areas of prisons awaiting mental health care in appropriate settings\".  We need prison in-reach and court liaison services in all areas.<\/p> <p>  With regard to safeguarding social and medical well-being, Article 19 of the UNCRPD articulates the equal right of all persons with disabilities to live in the community.  A study at one psychiatry unit found that 38% of all inpatients and 98% of delayed discharge patients had unmet accommodation needs.  Data from other countries confirm that men and women with schizophrenia die 15 years and 12 years earlier, respectively, than the general population.  The chief causes are cardiovascular disease and cancer, both amenable to risk reduction, screening and early treatment.  Antipsychotic medication is associated with reduced risk of early death in schizophrenia.  In 2019 the Inspector of Mental Health Services pointed out that \"Patients with serious mental illness experience reduced access to health care\".  US data confirm that people with a recent diagnosis of depression or schizophrenia are seven times more likely to get Covid than people without mental illness, are more likely to require hospital admission and are more likely die of the infection.  This is the third challenge, namely, safeguarding social and medical well-being in the community.  What are the solutions?  They include systematic co-working between mental health services, primary care, and social care.  Individual health identifier numbers would help connect services.  Psychiatric treatments work well but they are no substitute for a roof over your head and a community that values you.  Safeguarding matters, including the work of Safeguarding Ireland.  We need legislation that balances protection with autonomy.<\/p> <p>  I am very happy to address legislators today.  Rudolf Virchow, the 19th century German pathologist and politician, said \"medicine is a social science, and politics is nothing but medicine on a large scale\".  Closer to home, in 1977 Charles Haughey concluded that healthcare is about good government and cannot, in the words of the clich&eacute;, be taken out of politics.

I am joined by Ms Celine O'Connor, who is a social worker with experience of working in and managing safeguarding services, and we are joined by video link by Ms Sin&eacute;ad McGarry, a social worker experienced in safeguarding practice.  I acknowledge the specific input of Dr. Sarah Donnelly from the UCD school of social policy, social work and social justice, who is the Irish Association of Social Workers' academic safeguarding adviser and who worked with us on today's submission but cannot be with us this morning.<\/p><p> The Irish Association of Social Workers, IASW, was founded in 1971.  There are almost 5,000 registered social workers in Ireland and the IASW is the national representative body of the profession.  We have members working in various service areas, including children and families, mental health, probation, primary care, disability, hospitals, and with migrants among others.  Social work is the named lead profession for child protection and adult safeguarding in Ireland tasked with the primary responsibility for policies that support people at risk of abuse and neglect, including children and adults with disabilities.  Social workers work with people with disabilities in their homes and communities, disability services, nursing homes, homeless services, direct provision centres, prisons and other settings across Ireland.  We work with many adults with disabilities who have never been formally assessed or supported by a disability service.  In this context, adult safeguarding failures in any setting may impact upon people with disabilities.<\/p><p> Focusing on safeguarding in congregated settings and the requirements of Articles 16 and 19 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD, social work champions a human rights-based approach to safeguarding recognising that safeguarding is equally about promoting the rights, autonomy and well-being of a person as it is about protecting people from abuse and neglect.  It is in scenarios and cultures where rights are overlooked, well-being is ignored and a person lacks choice and autonomy in his or her own life that abuse is most likely to occur.  The values of the social work profession, therefore, very much align with the values of the UNCRPD.<\/p><p> Adults with disabilities in congregated settings comprise one of the least protected groups and, compared with children, have far less legal protection in their own home.  It is a stark fact that legal protection from abuse, neglect and exploitation decreases for every person, including a person with disability, when he or she turns 18 years of age in Ireland.  Our separate written submission document elaborates our position, which is that Ireland is not meeting the requirements set out in Articles 16 and 19 of the UNCRPD.  Our move toward de-institutionalisation, where people can live according to their will and preferences, is unacceptably slow and safeguarding within existing services is far too weak.<\/p><p> We have limited data on safeguarding in Ireland.  While we know 51,000 concerns about the abuse and neglect of adults have been reported to the safeguarding and protection social work teams since 2015, it is unknown how many of these relate to people with disabilities. The IASW has established that apparently 143 sexual assaults against residents in care settings were reported to HIQA from 2015 to 2022.  Eighty-seven of these reported sexual assaults were in nursing homes, where many people with disabilities reside, and 56 were in disability centres.  We have also established that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na cannot provide figures about the rates of abuse and neglect of residents in nursing homes or disability centres reported to it.<\/p><p> Concerns about the response to the abuse of adults, including adults with disabilities, regularly enter the public domain.  The media reported concerns in Leas Cross in 2006, in &Aacute;ras Attracta in 2014 and in the Grace and Brandon cases, the events of which spanned decades.  Media reports also highlighted delays in reporting alleged sexual abuse of unconscious patients in Naas hospital, failures in the management of safeguarding concerns in HSE community healthcare organisation, CHO, area 7, and reported a pattern of safeguarding failures in HSE CHO area 1.  Despite a recurring national outcry in the aftermath of each revelation, little seems to have changed for the better, and events of recent months alone show how little Ireland is adhering to the principles set out in Articles 16 and 19 of the UNCRPD.<\/p><p> In comparison with child protection and despite being lead profession in adult safeguarding, social work faces very real challenges in influencing the governance and management of adult safeguarding and practice through our human rights lens and approach. We encounter the same medicalised model at strategic and practice level as that described by people with disabilities, which does not adequately address their needs.  Our separate submission document details our views on the key challenges and solutions. These include the urgent enactment of safeguarding legislation based on appropriate principles, including the UNCRPD; the establishment of an independent statutory adult safeguarding authority; appropriate legal mechanisms to support social workers to do their work; mandatory reporting of abuse and neglect of adults; and adequate data collection and research.<\/p><p> In respect of the gap involving new adult safeguarding legislation, we also call in our more detailed submission for a number of interim measures that should be taken as a matter of urgency.  The rights of people with disabilities to live lives where their will and preferences are respected, where their well-being is supported and where they are protected from abuse and neglect must be vindicated and upheld.  This is not happening, in the view of the IASW, and it will take a collective effort across all relevant bodies and wider society to change this.<\/p><p> I again thank the committee again for its time and attention.  We welcome the opportunity to answer any questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022033100002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Vivian Geiran","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648681200,"counter":862,"content":"<p>I have a number of questions and will start with HIQA.

Does HIQA cover all services, public and private?  Does it only act on reports?  When it receives reports and investigates them, does it document all reports?  Some of these reports are quite serious while others could be addressed within the service itself, something I presume HIQA would speak to the management about.  What if the matter is more serious, for example, financial abuse?  One case involved staff claiming expenses from the residents' accounts for meals, takeaways and so on.  Was that rectified?  Were the residents reimbursed?  Was it reported to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na?  If the report relates to physical or sexual abuse, is it reported to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or social protection teams?<\/p><p>Professor Phelan from Sage Advocacy mentioned that work on awareness of abuse is needed, meaning what abuse is.  I presume people might not know how to report it so what does Professor Phelan propose we do about that?  What is the best way to get that message out about what abuse there is?<\/p><p>Professor Kelly spoke about mental health.  Obviously, the percentage we spend on mental health needs to increase.  He said it is very difficult to recruit consultant posts within inpatient psychiatry.  Will he explain why this is the case?  He also spoke about health and addiction services.  I thought the issue of dual diagnosis was being addressed because, usually, if there is an addiction problem, mental illness will be found and <i>vice versa<\/i>, where there is mental illness, addiction is often found, so the two need to be addressed together.  Professor Kelly also spoke about the lack of joined-up thinking between the different aspects of the health service and individual health identifier numbers.  Would personal public service, PPS, numbers not be sufficient to ensure there is joined-up thinking?  In this world of IT, that should not be an issue.<\/p><p>If the safeguarding protection teams receive a complaint, for example, from a member of staff in a service, can they act on this?

Centres for people with a disability constitute one type of designated centre.  I must assess compliance with the standards and regulations.

My colleague, Mr. Colfer, can give the committee some detail around the numbers relating to that.<\/p> <p>  We conduct announced and unannounced inspections.  Announced inspections are announced four weeks in advance.  This is really to give residents and their families opportunities to make arrangements to meet with us if they so wish so we feel this is also an important aspect.  During Covid, we had to slightly adjust our approach to announce more inspections to ensure we could safely inspect services and not put residents at risk as a result of the inspections.  However, so far this year, only 8% of our 325 inspections have been announced so we are reverting to the majority of inspections being unannounced.  <\/p> <p>  The regulations require that providers notify us of any suspicion or allegation of abuse.  However, we did take a very proactive approach while on inspection.  To ensure safeguarding is appropriate, we need to hear from the people living in the centres, find out from them whether their rights are being upheld, whether they are being supported to make those rights real and whether they feel the care and support they get are dignified and respectful to them.  That is a key focus.  We also follow up on any allegations of safeguarding concerns, which we take really seriously.

In terms of voluntary and State-provided services, the HSE operates 162 of those centres directly and funds the rest.  There are 734 centres operating under section 38 of the Health Act 2004 while 524 are operating under section 39 of the Act.<\/p> <p>  Ms Grogan is correct.  We have reverted to primarily conducting inspections on an unannounced basis and 80% of our inspections this year to date have been unannounced.  During those inspections, we look at safeguarding in the fullest sense of that term in terms of people's rights and quality of life and any allegations or suspicions of abuse and how they have been responded to.  Where we find inadequate arrangements, we use our regulatory powers to require providers to address those issues.  Where providers fail to do that, we take further escalated action where we specify what providers need to do and give them a timeframe to do that.  If there is a significant level of risk to residents, we give consideration to cancelling registration.  We are very careful about taking that action because cancelling registration of a centre causes a lot of distress for people living in the centre and people who are important in their lives like their families.  It is an action we take very carefully.  In 2021, we cancelled the registration of two designated centres because we were not satisfied that the provider was addressing the safeguarding issues for residents.  In most of the situations we encounter, providers do take successful action to address the issues we identify.  Since 2013, whenever we commenced registration and inspection, there was an ongoing incremental improvement in safeguarding in centres.  It is still something we monitor and observe.  Last year, out of 1,420 centres, we carried out 1,220 inspections.  In community-based services, we found a 7% rate were non-compliant with regarding to safeguarding arrangements while in congregated settings, the non-compliance rate when it came to protecting residents from abuse was 16%.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022033100002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Finbarr Colfer"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648681200,"counter":865,"content":"<p>The Deputy's question to Sage Advocacy concerned raising awareness.  There are a number of domains in that regard.  The beliefs in our society contribute to safeguarding concerns, for example, the idea that next-of-kin have a right to make decisions.  There is no legal basis for that.  There is also a cultural assumption that families are entitled to money.  The Deputy mentioned financial abuse.  Someone could think that if he or she is getting money in a will, he or she will take it earlier because he or she does not see that as extortion of money.  It is about looking at all of those aspects of how we culturally view safeguarding.<\/p> <p>  This also needs to be looked at in organisational culture.  Many organisations talk about person-centred care.  I teach on this topic and no student who has come through this course has said we were doing it right.  At the end of the programme, students would say they did not understand it and yet their organisations have lovely mission statements.  You must transform people's understanding of person-centred care so that they understand it is a way of thinking, not just something that is lovely on a wall.  That is important from an organisational point of view.  <\/p> <p>  The individual needs to know he or she has equal rights, that he or she is not beholden to somebody else and that there are helping organisations that are independent.  Professionals have a particular organisational orientation and families have an orientation and biases so somebody who is an independent advocate would support that person to navigate through what he or she authentically wants.  They can look at issues such as the variables influencing his or her decisions, whether any undue influence is being placed on him or her, if there are ways of thinking that are aligned to gendered ways of thinking and things like the intersectionality of gender, safeguarding and disability and how that impacts that individual.  <\/p> <p>  Some jurisdictions have developed specific safeguarding for adults at risk.  The police service in Toronto has specific safeguarding police officers who work in that domain and have developed expertise.  Scotland was the first part of the UK to have adult protection legislation.  It has developed ways of operating with adult safeguarding and that knowledge is important because it is not the same as other domains.  While there are overlaps with child protection and domestic violence, it is different.  <\/p> <p>  In terms of addressing issues as a whole, what we know from case review after case review in Ireland, where it is more related to child protection, and the adult safeguarding boards in England is there is a continued silo approach with nobody taking a macro perspective and looking at the historical origin and development of cases.  Individual aspects happen but nobody is knitting them together and taking an overall view.  The UK has followed the idea of creating professional curiosity within safeguarding, which is important in Ireland, and ran a campaign called Making Safeguarding Personal some years ago.  <\/p> <p>  Within the legal system, we need to be able to process these cases because very often, safeguarding is breaking the law but it is not always brought to that domain because of a number of issues.  Regarding family members committing safeguarding breaches, there is a love-hate relationship.  The person loves the individual but hates what he or she is doing to him or her.  Regarding legislation, we also need a gateway - a right of entry if there is suspicion of abuse happening within a home or any environment and a right of assessment of that person and working with that person because the welfare of that individual is paramount, not what everybody else says, and that is what we need to keep at the front of our minds.<\/p><p>We are here as the servant of that person, not as their master.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022033100002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Amanda Phelan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648681200,"counter":867,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for the questions.  She asked about consultant recruitment.  It is an enormous issue.  It is common for there to be no applicant for a consultant job, or sometimes one applicant, leaving very little choice in what occurs.  It is part of a broader difficulty with recruitment across the health service in other grades of doctors, nursing and other professions.  Doctors are particularly mobile.  Consultants are offered jobs elsewhere and we get emails every day about jobs in Australia, New Zealand and other largely English-speaking jurisdictions, where these jobs are embedded in health services that offer more support, more multidisciplinary working and therefore more opportunities for professional flourishing.  A great majority of the graduates and people leaving medical school go directly to Australia.  It then becomes a task not of retaining them but enticing them back, which is something to which we devote an enormous amount of time.  A broader resourcing of the health service, particularly in mental health, would help with that.<br\/><br\/>The Deputy asked about the distinction between mental health services and addiction services.  She correctly pointed out that many people have both problems.  For example, the vast majority of the young men I see with psychosis or severe mental illness involving a significant break with reality use cannabis pretty much every day.  It is very unusual for me to encounter a case of psychosis or severe mental illness in a young man who is not misusing cannabis.  The misuse of cocaine is also very widespread and results in mental health problems.  The 2006 policy, A Vision for Change, stated that mental health services were to be focused on people whose mental health problem was primary and that addiction services would be a separate entity.  This does not make much sense, certainly in my day-to-day practice.  The revised 2020 policy, Sharing the Vision, says: <\/p> <blockquote> \t[A Vision for Change] recommended that specialist mental health services should support only individuals &lsquo;whose primary difficulty is mental health&rsquo;.  This recommendation is now reversed. <\/blockquote> <p>In practice, two services cannot simply be united by saying it is so.  A great deal needs to happen to connect things up a little more and that has not happened yet, even though it clearly needs to.<br\/><br\/>The Deputy also asked about the unique health identifier number and whether the PPS number would serve that purpose.  Yes, one would imagine it would.  However, Ireland has gone down a slightly different path.  According to the HSE website: <\/p> <blockquote> \t[Everyone is] given an Individual Health Identifier (IHI) number the first time you use health or social care services in Ireland.<br \/><br \/>It is used to identify each person that has used, is using or may use a health or social care service.<br \/><br \/>The [number] lasts for your lifetime. <\/blockquote> <p>These numbers appear to exist for almost everybody in the country.  However, for reasons I do not understand, they are not used in clinical or day-to-day practice.  There appears to be a structure there.<br\/><br\/>This brings me to the final point, about legislation.  I am interested in initiatives that have been started but maybe not completed.  These seem like low-hanging fruit for us to make improvements.  If these individual health identifier numbers exist, it would seem useful to introduce them, even though they do not appear to be the same as PPS numbers, for some reason.  It is the same with legislation.  We have the Mental Health Act 2001 and proposals are being scrutinised for revision.  These could be revised a little and advanced.  The College of Psychiatrists of Ireland has made this point elsewhere about the need for revision.  The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 is about to be commenced, pretty much in full, and that requires support after commencement.  It will introduce possibilities for supported decision-making and advance healthcare directives but these things will not happen overnight.  They require education programmes, encouragement and roll-out and hopefully we can reap the benefits of that.  There is also a need for dedicated safeguarding legislation but I am pointing to the two initiatives that are very much under way and appear to be near the finish line.  They would help enormously.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022033100002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Professor Brendan Kelly"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648681200,"counter":868,"content":"<p>I want to respond to a couple of the general questions and then I will ask Ms O'Connor to deal with the specific one on social work.  So many of the issues and questions that have been raised overlap in a lot of areas.  As Professor Kelly pointed out, the issues around recruitment within the medical profession are echoed across other sectors of the health and social care professional groups, and specifically for social workers in our case.  There is a national shortage.  Looking at the pool of social workers engaged in the various areas in which we work, collectively there is a shortage in Ireland.  There are two issues in relation to that.  When initiatives such as new legislation, like we are talking about here, new policies and structures are being considered, we need to bear in mind that there is not a national social work strategy in Ireland.  There is not a plan for how Government policies will be implemented and delivered where they depend on social workers and where social workers will have to be in place to do that.  There is not a social work strategy or a social work workforce plan at a national level, which needs to be in place.<\/p> <p>  With regard to strengthening the legislation, there is widespread agreement on the need for adult safeguarding legislation.  The Deputy asked how that would help.  There are so many ways, which we have included in our written submission.  To add to that, in our history to date we have operated a light-touch approach to adult safeguarding in Ireland.  As has been said already, the approach in terms of services and structures is also extremely siloed.  The legislation we implement in this area should not be siloed because, as Professor Kelly and others have pointed out, it needs to dovetail and connect with the assisted decision-making legislation, and legislation relating to child protection, domestic violence and mental health.  Too often we end up with legislation and structures that do not communicate or talk with each other.  We have a long and not very positive history of institutionalisation in Ireland.  Professor Kelly referred to the history of huge numbers in psychiatric institutions.  At that time, we had a couple of hundred people in prisons.  As one figure went dramatically down, the other went dramatically up.  That gap or nexus between the criminal justice system and mental health services is clear and is further evidence of the need to join up the various elements that currently operate in too much of a silo, unfortunately.  I will ask Ms O'Connor to address the question on how social workers can and do respond to complaints.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022033100002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Vivian Geiran"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648681200,"counter":869,"content":"<p>There are multiple answers to this because it depends where the complaint is coming from and where the person is located.  If it is a concern from somebody living in their own home in the community, we can access them with permission.  We knock on the door and ask for permission to come in.  There is no special legislation or law that grants us access.  While we would look for legislation, we do not want social workers to be able to knock at a door at any stage and say they are coming in to have a look.  That needs to be a judicial process because people's homes are their protected space.  The complaint could also come from a public service.  Social workers are often employed in many of our public services so there may be a social worker in those services or in one of the disability voluntary bodies that the person can access.<\/p> <p>  We have significant issues in the private services and particularly in private nursing homes.  In the past there was a HSE elder abuse service which would go in if a concern came in.  Oftentimes those were in the private nursing homes.  When safeguarding was established, that seemed to change things because the process did not require direct social work involvement in the assessment of concerns about abuse anymore.  Instead, social workers on the safeguarding teams had oversight of what the service was doing to protect people.  There was a significant difference there.  Since the safeguarding policy came in, HSE-funded section 38 and 39 services are meant to safeguard the residents of their services and let the safeguarding team know what they do.  There is a paper process and a preliminary screening that is sent in.  Within three days of the concern arising, the safeguarding team will review it, make comment on it and ask for more feedback and information to ensure that safeguarding plan is as robust as it can be.  Ultimately, the service that reports the concern is responsible for safeguarding.  In those services, there may be multidisciplinary teams or there may not be.<\/p><p>There may also be people who have experience of working in safeguarding or protecting.  For many services, though, there was a steep learning curve when this was established.<\/p><p> I believe what HIQA is saying is that it is seeing improvements as services are coming to grips with the situation.  Training for staff in recognising abuse has been very important.  Before Covid, three and a half hours of face-to-face training was provided to everyone in all of the services.  It is important all levels of staff be aware because it may be the porter, the cleaner or even the visitors coming in who see something.  Unfortunately, training stopped during Covid.  There is a 30-minute training video available on HSeLanD.  It is useful and accessible to people, but the lack of face-to-face training where people have the ability to ask questions has been a concern.<\/p><p> Another concern for us is that, during Covid, the lack of visiting meant there was no family safeguarding, that is, those externalised who come in and ask what this or that is about.  Sometimes, staff in an institution do what they are taught.  That is normal.  It takes an external eye to ask why we are doing something this way and if there is a better way of doing it.  Professor Phelan spoke about person-centred care.  When we ask staff about person-centred care, they sometimes tell us they got a coffee machine in the staff room and it was lovely, but when we ask whether the residents can use it, they tell us \"No\" because it is just for staff.<\/p><p> This comes down to services' understanding and the training they are getting about what person-centred care is and what abuse is.  Abuse is when someone is being left for a long time, the bell is not being responded to and his or her needs are not being met.  Abuse is when, instead of getting a 20-minute walk in the garden because he or she needs to use the commode, the person will miss out on a walk that day.  Abuse is when people's money is being used to pay for things that have nothing to do with themselves.  We have had services that have paid for units to be painted rather than for residents to go on activities or get new clothes.<\/p><p> There are many small types of abuse.  We know about the big issues &ndash; the sexual and physical assaults &ndash; but abuse sometimes takes the form of very small issues, for example, units where milk and sugar are still added to pots of tea because that is the way one person likes it and it does not matter that someone else does not, so that is the way he or she is getting it.  This culture in services is challenging.<\/p><p> It is great if a service has a social worker.  We hope social workers will examine and highlight these issues, although that is difficult to do for a lone social worker working in a service.  We have duty social workers on our safeguarding teams, which anyone can ring in to &ndash; the Garda, members of the public, the family, services or staff.  If concerns like these are raised with the safeguarding teams, the teams will follow them up and contact the services in question.  Whether they have direct social work contact is an issue, though.  If it is a service, it will be asked what it is going to do about the issues raised with it.  Someone in the community or a social worker from a safeguarding team will triage the situation and may knock on the door to ask how he or she can help.  If it is a private nursing home, the services will contact it and look to engage with it, but there is no right of access and a private nursing home is not obliged to engage with the HSE services.  It can thank us kindly for contacting it and raising the concern while telling us it does not need us.<\/p><p> During Covid, though, there seems to have been a significant change in this regard.  Supported by HIQA, there has been far more contact and collaboration on ensuring people are safe regardless of where they live.  That last point is key.  Whether someone lives in a private or public nursing home, disability service, homeless service or prison, he or she should have the same rights as everyone else.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022033100002#F00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Celine O'Connor","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648681200,"counter":871,"content":"<p>I thank Ms O'Connor for her comments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022033100002#G00200","speaker":"1456"},{"type":"speech","time":1648681200,"counter":872,"content":"<p>I thank the three organisations and Professor Kelly for their thought-provoking and detailed submissions and opening statements.

It is not something that I had thought about as much until I listened to the witnesses.  I thank them for that.<\/p> <p>  Ms Grogan referred to HIQA's new annual overview report and how residents living in congregated settings experienced a poorer quality of life compared with those in community settings.

What key measures must be included in the new national safeguarding policy?<\/p> <p>  Professor Phelan spoke about advocacy and nothing about us without us.  Consultation is important.  While listening to her, it struck me that people in these settings may sometimes not have been aware they were being abused, even through the small types of abuse Ms O'Connor mentioned.  We need to do more to educate people &ndash; those in positions of control and those who have vulnerabilities and are being protected &ndash; about what abuse is.  This is a significant cultural challenge.<\/p> <p>  The lack of sexual education for women with intellectual disabilities was mentioned.  The previous Oireachtas education committee worked on making recommendations on a new relationships and sexuality education, RSE, programme.  We made a strong recommendation to the then Minister for Education and Skills on how there was a complete lack of sexual and relationship education for people with disabilities, particularly intellectual disabilities.  This has to do with vulnerable people being exploited without necessarily realising what boundaries should be in place.<\/p> <p>  Professor Phelan might comment on the need for greater regulation of the social welfare payment agency system.<\/p> <p>  It was mentioned we could examine the role of the public and society in safeguarding.

Could our guests elaborate on what they were talking about with regard to the systemic co-working that is needed in mental health between mental health services, primary care and social care, which is crucial?

The figures that have been mentioned speak for themselves.<\/p><p> Ms Geiran and Ms O&rsquo;Connor spoke about promoting autonomy and the rights and well-being of people, which is of great importance.  They said that social workers face very real challenges.  On influencing the governance and management of practice, if they had influence, what would be the key areas where they would propose to take action?  They have recommended some interim measures.

Everybody spoke about culture.  There is a shift from thinking about safeguarding in a negative way.  The change in culture involves considering it in a positive way.  It is very important that there is an holistic view which takes in the rights and involves a human rights-based approach.<\/p> <p>  We believe the national safeguarding policy needs to be introduced in tandem with other legislation, including reform of the Health Act.  We must look at the changing pace of legislation.  It is about meeting the needs of people now and into the future.  We know that people who are living in disability services now needed different types of care and support in the past, and we know they will need different types of care and support in the future.  It is important that we keep pace with that.<\/p> <p>  The introduction of legislation and regulatory reform across all of the areas, including the decision-making capacity legislation, brings with it protections for those whom it is intended to protect.  In addition, it affords them the same rights as you and me.  There should not be a conversation about people having these rights; they should just have them.  It should be about supporting them in the best way we can.  All of the legislation coming together would support that.<\/p> <p>  On congregated settings, on the community-based side we find that people enjoy a greater quality of life and can express and exercise their rights more freely.  They become active participants in their communities to the extent that they wish.  We believe that every person with a disability who is living in a residential care service should be afforded that same opportunity.<\/p> <p>  I will hand over to my colleague Mr. Colfer, who might tell the committee some of the human stories of people moving out of congregated settings because the most powerful message is to hear from people themselves.  Before I do so, I emphasise that we prioritise the registration of new centres to facilitate people moving out of congregated settings.  When an application comes in from a provider to help with such a move, we prioritise that and move as quickly as possible on those settings.  Mr. Colfer will discuss the congregated settings in more detail.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022033100002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Carol Grogan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648681200,"counter":875,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for her questions.  First of all, there is no prohibition in the regulations against the operation of a congregated setting.  Our focus has been on the experience of people living there and the outcomes for people living in centres.  We all know from international research that people are at much greater risk in terms of their safety, their quality of life and their ability to engage in their local community when they live in congregated settings.  Over recent years, we have identified the number of registered places in congregated settings, which is the first time that an independent number has been set out there.  We can now see whether there is movement of people out of these settings and we can quantify that movement.  The other aspect we have looked at is people&rsquo;s experience of life.  Our inspection reports will detail some of the limitations on people&rsquo;s quality of life in congregated settings compared to their counterparts living in community-based settings.<br\/><br\/>As part of our annual engagement with stakeholders, we engage with residents as a fundamental part of our inspection activity.  Outside of our inspection activity, we meet with advocacy and residents' groups across the country.  Last year, we met with 20 groups, including a significant number of people who had moved out of congregated settings.  We have found for the most part that a very positive improvement in people&rsquo;s safety and quality of life has been reported to us by residents and staff.  In one of those groups, we spoke to a person who gave us a very good description of her experience.  She said that when she was living in the big house she had a small voice, but now that she is living in a community house she feels she has a big voice.  That was a very poignant capturing of people&rsquo;s experience for me.<br\/><br\/>We have seen examples of people who had significant behavioural presentations when they were living in congregated settings, but when they moved out into community-based services the intensity and frequency of those behavioural issues significantly reduced.  We have seen that <i>pro re nata<\/i>, PRN, medication has been reduced where people have moved into a different environment.  This affects all aspects.  We saw another poignant description of a person's experience.  We met a resident in a house who had been treated for malnutrition in a congregated setting for many years, was on all sorts of supplements and did not eat very regularly.  The staff described how this person came into the kitchen in the new house as meals were being prepared and started to taste food.  It was the first time this person had actually seen a raw pepper and started to taste it.  The staff found that by allowing the resident to become part of food preparation and purchase - to be part of what we take for granted every day - that person started to eat more and their physical well-being improved.  People experience a broad range of improvements when they move from congregated settings.  We are seeing those improvements and residents are telling us about them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022033100002#H00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Finbarr Colfer"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648681200,"counter":876,"content":"<p>There is a golden opportunity here to create the conditions of possibility for prevention, early intervention and ongoing comprehensive management of cases of safeguarding adults.  We have the opportunity.  We know from various approaches in other countries internationally what works and what needs to be improved.  I strongly believe that independent advocacy should be a right of everybody.  People do not know what they do not know.  If a person who has been in a system of care where other people have been making decisions, and that is the only thing the person is familiar with, is offered a choice to move out, it may not be comprehensively understood.  Things might be piloted for a while to see what can be done.<\/p> <p>  We also have an approach within nursing homes that it is a one-way system.  Many older people have said that once they go in, the only way they will be coming out is in a coffin.  If someone who goes in for treatment receives three meals a day and is cared for, his or her health may improve.  There should always be a possibility of going out back into the community.  For some people who are there for palliative and end-of-life care, it just has to be managed.  There is an idea and fear for older people that going into a nursing home is not their first choice.<\/p><p>We need to look at the structures in community care which are not affording someone a menu of choice and there are many issues.<\/p><p> I would go back to the Citizens' Assembly in 2017 and listen to the testimony of a lady who was admitted to a nursing home and whose family refused to take her home.  She was in Dublin and had to pay for a taxi to drive her back to Cork because none of her family would bring her.  What Mr. Colfer has alluded to is that we have to take the happiness of the person into account.  It is not always about the system doing the right thing.  If the voice of that person is not included and if you are not listening and hearing that voice then that happiness is at risk.<\/p><p> I refer to the evolution of our understanding of safeguarding and protection that has happened over time.  If one looks at rape within marriage, for example, it was not seen as an issue prior to the introduction of legislation on same.  We need to learn and ensure we have a dynamic and flexible system that can adapt.  Just because we have a policy or just because we have new legislation does not mean we should not continually try to improve there.  We are not getting there.  The statistics we have on safeguarding in any age group would indicate that it follows this idea of an iceberg theory and that we are only looking at the top of that.  We need to make sure that people know they have rights; where to go; who to access; that it is safe for them; and that making a report will not impact them.  For example, if I report that my caregiver is the person who is abusing me then the answer of the system should not be to put me into a nursing home or a congregated setting because then the system would be abusing me as well.  We need to look at all of those cultural issues.  An interesting study from New York shows that we are only seeing one in 20 cases in formal systems.  This is a study on the elderly and it states that 19 of those cases never come to anyone's attention and those people die having been abused in some way.  That is unacceptable for society in the 21st century.<\/p><p> The Senator also alluded to the social welfare payments and I know Safeguarding Ireland is doing a lot of work with the Department of Social Protection on how we frame that.  There is the risk of those payments being abused in some way by a third party and that must be addressed.  We are hoping to do some research in that area during the summer.  We must always keep the happiness of this person in mind and follow his or her will, preference, values and beliefs.  Supporting these people is paramount.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022033100002#H00600","nonspeaker":"Professor Amanda Phelan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648681200,"counter":878,"content":"<p>The Senator referred to a grim picture in her comments and there is a lot of grimness in the picture.  I want to bring a note of positivity and optimism that change is possible.  We have seen this large de-institutionalisation occurring in the field of psychiatry and in the dismantling of the large mental hospitals.  Some 30% of people admitted to psychiatric hospitals are discharged within a week, 70% are discharged within a month and 95% are discharged within three months.  Change is possible, therefore.  There are difficulties with the community services that are in place to replace the institutions.  The Senator asked about co-working in the mental health services and housing and primary care are key parts of that.  Deputy Tully asked about the unique identifier and that would help significantly with that.  Primary care is a structure that already exists and there is enormous opportunity there.  There is a counselling and primary care service, where anyone with a medical card attending a GP can access low threshold psychological care such as counselling.  Unfortunately that is not open to people who do not have medical cards, nor is it open to people under the age of 18 years, and there is a waiting time.  That would be one accessible way that mental healthcare could be provided; through expansion and improvement of an existing initiative rather than trying to invent something new.  There has been this big de-institutionalisation but the community structures need some work.<\/p> <p>  On the housing front, the mental health service operates community residences with smaller numbers of people in them and the Office of the Inspector of Mental Health Services reports that in 2018 there were 119 community residences, often housing small numbers of people with enduring mental health problems who would, in another era, have been in a psychiatric hospital for all o their lives.  The inspector is good at keeping an eye on them and at ensuring that institutional practices do not emerge within community residences because in the mental health setting we have become aware of how old practices can creep back in.  It is another possibility and solution now that the institutions are gone and the main problem is not protection from over-exuberant care but accessing the system in the first place.<\/p> <p>  The Senator mentioned intellectual disability and mental illness.  There is a mental illness in intellectual disability service but those services are mostly resourced to see people with moderate or severe intellectual disability who develop mental health problems, not people with mild intellectual disability who develop mental health problems.  It is fair to say there is a general agreement that those services need to be resourced to take on that wider brief so that people with mild intellectual disability and whatever mental health problems they might have get a dedicated service, similar to if they had moderate intellectual disability.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022033100002#J00200","nonspeaker":"Professor Brendan Kelly"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648681200,"counter":879,"content":"<p>I want to respond to the Senator&rsquo;s questions on social work challenges in governance and then there were a number of specific areas that relate to social work that Ms O'Connor might respond to in terms of education, training, the role of the public and society, and whatever else.  To go back to governance, there are a number of areas and we have highlighted some of these in our written submission but the Senator referred to some of the interim measures that could happen fairly soon and even ahead of the proposed legislation.  We urgently need more and greater transparency and accountability and we have been calling and would continue to call for the publication of inquiry reports and audits, a number of which are not available, and as a result the people who need to learn from the outcomes of those inquiries and reports, including social workers, do not get the opportunity to do that.  In governance and strategic responses, we need to learn, as has been referenced already, from the developments of recent decades on child welfare and protection, not just insofar as the legislation is concerned but also in terms of the structures and strategic approaches.  In that, I strongly urge that the unique social work voice and expertise need to be recognised and incorporated because it is valuable and it is currently under-recognised in that area.<br\/><br\/>I will give two examples.  First, in the child protection and welfare area we have learned and put in place a good system as far as governance and strategic planning and so on are concerned in the way the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth operates <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>Tusla and so on.  From a social work point of view there is a head social worker in Tusla and a chief social worker in the Department, which means that at both an operational and strategic level the voice of social workers, among others, is heard.  Second is my experience from the criminal justice area.  I was the director of the Irish Probation Service for seven years and I am a registered social worker.  On the operational and other responsibilities for that national team the buck stopped with me operationally.  At a strategic level I also had a significant input, on behalf of the organisation, to the development of policy and strategy and so on, which was set from within the Department.  That is lacking in the area we are talking about and it needs to be addressed.<br\/><br\/>Some of the specific areas we have referenced are that we need mandatory training in adult safeguarding for all HSE personnel.  As I mentioned earlier, there is no general strategy for social work at a national level in Ireland or for workforce planning.  We need stronger links between adult safeguarding and protection, social work teams and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  That could and should happen quickly.  We also need home care legislation to establish a right to home care package.<\/p><p> The last point I will make is about measures that could and should be taken urgently.  Data and research are grossly lacking in the field of adult safeguarding in Ireland.  I refer in particular to learning from research that fully takes on board and asks for the voice of the service users and their families.  We have a gulf in and a dearth of research in that area.  That should be rectified straight away.  That would inform how things will develop in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022033100002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Vivian Geiran","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648681200,"counter":881,"content":"<p>Social workers are often told we focus on what goes wrong as opposed to what goes right, but it is when something significantly horrible happens that we get involved.  We look at the strengths of everybody around us, that is, the victim, the team, the staff, family members and communities.  We have safeguarding plans that involve local postmen and the neighbour down the road.  Everybody can be involved in protecting our most vulnerable members of society.  We sometimes find that communities are already involved in safeguarding.  We will get a phone call from a neighbour or the postman who has not seen somebody to say he or she is a bit worried and to ask whether we can get involved.  There is that knowledge on the ground.  During the Covid pandemic we have seen our communities grow again.  We have seen those community call services come together and start looking out.<\/p> <p>  We do not have a memorandum of understanding, MOU, with the Garda in respect of sharing information in the same way Tusla and the Garda share information about perpetrators and victims.  The staff of the HSE are obliged to report all sexual offences and physical assaults causing harm under the Criminal Justice (Withholding of Information on Offences against Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012.  That is a type of mandatory reporting, but that same reporting does not have to come to the HSE safeguarding teams.  Again, it is a matter of information sharing back and forth.<\/p> <p>  Senator O'Loughlin asked about timelines in respect of working with perpetrators.  It is very difficult because when we have to interview people who have a disability, their recollection of what might have happened may be impacted.  Their speech and their cognitive abilities can be quite significantly impaired.  Their knowledge of sexuality and sex and what has happened to them can be challenged because they may not be aware that what has happened to them is wrong.  Senator O'Loughlin talked about education.  Looking around the room, I see there are many of us of a certain age who would have got very limited sex education in school.  There are women our age in disability services who are now being moved out to decongregated settings and who have had no sex education.  Preparing people to move is really important.  This is not just a once-off education.  It needs to be repeated because, again, people's cognitive abilities to hold information may be very impaired.  We have seen a lot of romance scams whereby people chat up people online.  Senator O'Loughlin and I, who have a decent level of education, will see through the messages, but they are written in such a way that they seek to pick up people who have vulnerabilities and who do not understand.  We deal with people in romances with people who could be anywhere in the world.  They send them money.  Their quality of life is impacted because they feel they need to send that money or the person will not be in touch with them.  We have seen people with disabilities brought into criminal gangs, prostituted and used to deliver drugs.  It is getting more and more complex, and we are seeing only the tip of the iceberg.<\/p> <p>  There is so much hidden abuse in our services and in our communities, so training is really important.  I refer to training staff to look out for the various types of abuse, drilling down into what is abuse and what are the signs and symptoms of financial abuse, sexual abuse and physical abuse.  Sometimes they are not that obvious.  Particularly in residential centres, there will be people with unexplained bruising, but they may be on medication or may have thrashed around a bit.  However, staff need to ask questions or use body maps if they keep seeing the same bruises, looking at them, recording them and looking at what the situation leads to.  There may be repeated urinary tract infections.  There may be a comment that the person has a certain condition, but could the infections be a result of repeated sexual assault?  It is a matter of asking those kinds of questions and that curiosity, keeping one's mind open as to whether there could be another explanation for something.  We frequently have clients who tell us they told people repeatedly they were being hit, assaulted or sexually assaulted but that nobody believed them because maybe the language was not right.  We have the cultural idea that older women, in particular, or women with a disability are not sexually attractive to others.  We know, however, that for perpetrators of sexual offences it is not necessarily about attractiveness but about power and control and getting away with it.  They groom the person, they groom the system and they groom everybody around them.  How many stories have we heard of people who were pillars of society?  They were in the local GAA, worked in the services, always did the extra shifts, were there for everybody and covered for staff.  Again, it is a matter of asking why they are covering or why they are doing only the night shifts.  Why do people flinch when they come in the room?  Why do people say they do not want that person with them?  Why do we not listen to those messages and have a chat with the person and look at the matter?<\/p> <p>  We have a fantastic workforce throughout our service.  We know that offenders are a tiny part of our population, but they can do awful damage.  We want to, and have to, trust our colleagues when we go to work.  If there is a question, however, or if somebody makes us feel uncomfortable, we should report that to our line managers and should challenge those people.  Often when we have reviews we will hear that everybody knew about someone or everybody had a sense as to what was happening but that they thought somebody else would report the matter.  Training needs to tell people not to be bystanders.  When we give training we often talk to staff about being brave, standing up, being counted and being the voice for people who do not have a voice.  I loved the comment about the big voice and the small house.  What we see is that when people get out, they get more control over the small things in their lives.  They start being able to raise the bigger issues.  They are allowed to choose whether to have a cappucino or a latte or whether to go to the park or to put a bet on a horse - all those small things we would not even consider.  They will start to tell us the bigger things.  They will start to say they do not like when a certain person is on shift or do not like it when a brother or sister visits.  That builds up the trust, that listening ear and that curiosity, and that is what will help protect lives.<\/p> <p>  The other thing that will help protect adults is all the early intervention services, getting those skills in place and having the diagnoses done early.  That is ongoing.  It is a lifetime support for the person, not a once-off.  With mental health services, there is now the Housing First model.  That is what disability needs as well: wrap-around housing supports for people in the community.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022033100002#K00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Celine O'Connor"},{"type":"speech","time":1648681200,"counter":882,"content":"<p>We are an hour and a half into the meeting.

What has been said has been so truthful.  All of us would recognise that from our own areas, where we come across these issues, so it is important that they are highlighted and that we do all we can.<\/p> <p>  I had a few questions about recruitment but a lot of them have been answered.  Where there is an issue with recruitment, there is a broken system.  I know that everybody is doing their best and that there is funding there, but the issue is that when people are overworked and doing maybe the job of two people because there are not enough staff, straight away there is a failure.<\/p><p>It is no one's fault, but a fault of the system.  That must be addressed.  How we recruit and keep our people within the system also needs to be sorted.  I agree completely on this point.  <\/p><p> Safeguarding is extremely important, and this is another issue I wish to address.  Regarding safeguarding policies, as someone who works on the ground, like my colleagues, I firmly believe it is necessary to listen to the representatives of disability organisations, service providers and advocacy organisations, because that is where change will come from.  In the formulation of any safeguarding policy, we all have a remit to include the people in the know.<\/p><p> I am working with people who come to talk to me about carers and respite.  If we examine this issue, we have more than 400 carers aged over 80.  We are promoting a system where people will continue to live at home, but I will give examples of two cases absolutely breaking me at this stage.  We talk about the lived experience in this context.  I have many other cases, but these are just two examples of situations I am dealing with now.  The lady in question in one of these cases is in her 90s and she forgets things.  Her son is her carer and he is in his 70s.  This lady is in hospital now.  She has said she would like to go home.  The family does not want that because they are so upset.  The lady herself is forgetful and does not remember things.  Yet the hospital has said she can go home.  I reiterate, however, that this lady is well into her 90s and forgets things, while her son is in his 70s and he is very sick.  I have told the family members they must go back to the people overseeing the system and say that.  The family members are upset about this situation.  They are fighting the system because they need to get this lady into a nursing home.  They do not want to do that.  Do not get me wrong in this regard, because this family is dedicated and committed.  There is a concern when situations like this arise, where we have a system that says a lady like this can go home but, technically, she cannot.  How do we try to get a system that works?<\/p><p> Another case I have come across involves a lady in her 80s with motor neurone disease.  She has been told by the hospital authorities that she can go home but there is no care package for her.  When people ask me about care packages, I tell them they will get half an hour, three times a day if they are lucky and get a care package when someone comes home from hospital.  If not, the family concerned will be fighting to get that person into a nursing home.  These are the realities.  I could point to many other people in similar situations.<\/p><p> We need policies and we must examine the system, but if we do not work with the families in the system, then how is this going to work?  Families are greatly tormented by what their loved ones are going through.  These are good families living this experience every day.  They are telling the hospital authorities they want to take their mam or dad home, while wondering how they can do it.  They ask about home care packages, only to be told that none are available.  That is the case now, even though private providers are being considered.  The best efforts are being made in this context because those private providers are being considered.  I refer to the HSE.  I am not blaming anybody here because I do not know where to start.<\/p><p> My issue is that our society is one where families have parents who are living longer, but we are unable to cater for this reality.  We are dealing with situations where families are trying to get their loved ones into nursing homes and it is necessary to engage with the system to do so.  This is another battle people face.  How do we fix this system?  It is failing at certain times and we must examine this.  I cannot say this is the situation in all cases, because everybody is doing their best and I am not here to be the bad guy in this context.  <\/p><p> We must also explore the culture that exists in this regard.  The committee meets weekly.  I also work with people on the ground and I am very much involved with the different disability groups in County Carlow.  They do a great job, by the way.  The reality in this context, however, no matter what is being sought, whether it is a grant for a bathroom adaptation, a stairlift or an extension, is that there is nearly another battle to be faced.  I just feel every day in my life is a battle.  I come in here then and I am constantly giving out.  I feel I am living the reality of what is happening on the ground and listening to the groups and families who have these experiences.  In this context, it is important that we have HIQA and the inspections it undertakes to know if things are correct.  Regarding those inspections, however, what are the timescales involved if funding is needed?  What is the process that follows from there?  I ask this because it is important that we have these processes and I welcome them.<\/p><p> I could raise so many other issues, but there are time pressures.  I thank the witnesses for attending.  What they said today is true and it was important for us to listen to it.  In turn, I ask the witnesses to listen to the representatives of all the different groups and to us, as representatives of the people who feel they are breaking point.  I feel I am almost at breaking point myself sometimes, because I am fighting with everybody to try to get everything done.  I thank the witnesses again.  Perhaps they could respond to me later and there might be some solutions to these problems.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022033100002#K00600","speaker":"1511","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648681200,"counter":889,"content":"<p>Returning to safeguarding, I note from one of the briefings provided, and this information comes from one of the reports, a table setting out the profiling of safeguarding concerns, by year and by CHO, between 2016 and 2020.  CHO 7, which covers my home area of Dublin South Central, comes out as having the highest number of safeguarding concerns, with 8,743 for that period.  Is that because we have a higher population, a higher concentration of disability services or something else?  I would appreciate an answer to that query.<\/p> <p>  The representatives from HIQA might be best placed to answer this next question.  Is there a difference in safeguarding reporting between section 38 and 39 organisations and service providers?  Is there a difference in the numbers reported and in the likelihood of issues arising?  I ask that because I am conscious there are staffing concerns in the context of the two differently funded organisations.  A migration is under way from section 39 providers into section 38 organisations.  That is because members of one group of staff are considered to be public servants, and having all the attendant supports of that status, whereas the others are employed by private providers and do not have the same pensions and opportunities.  Do consequences arise from that disparity in funding?  I ask that because it certainly causes difficulties in other areas.  <\/p> <p>  Concerning the interaction of the macro policies with the personalised plans in respect of the needs and wants expressed by individuals, where a safeguarding issue has been established and clearly flagged, is there a policy conflict as that process is gone through?  If a person needs to be supported on his or her own or in a different way, do we then end up with a conflict in how that person is catered for and how his or her needs are met?  I refer to his or her personal requirements and wants being met.  When a safeguarding issue is identified, what is the exact pathway of response?  <\/p> <p>  We are having high-level conversations here and I appreciate the powerful testimonies we have heard.  I refer, however, to situations where HIQA notes that a safeguarding issue exists and what happens from that point.  I am aware of several incidents in the context of different organisations around the country - and the nature of our role means we hear of such incidents nationwide - where safeguarding issues have been identified, but where nothing has changed several months down the road, if not longer.  There have been conversations, applications to the HSE and further discussions, but nothing has changed.  My question, then, concerns a situation where a service provider is reliant on funding to deal with a safeguarding issue.  I heard much in the contributions concerning service providers having to do X, Y and Z, but service providers do not always have the discretion or funding to do all that.  Where is the urgency in the system?  How is urgency injected into the system?  How do we ensure there is an immediacy of response and ensure that someone is not languishing in an abusive situation for a long time, while discussions about policy and funding are ongoing?  None of us would want to experience someone's daily lived experience in that kind of situation.<\/p><p>I have heard of some intolerable cases from throughout the country.  It is just appalling and outrageous.<\/p><p> The HIQA report refers to 20% non-compliance.  Will our guests unpack that for me?  I am familiar with the childcare sector, where someone might get a report from the childcare inspector to say a matter amounts to non-compliance but the matter might be very trivial, while something else that has also been recorded as non-compliance may be considered a very serious matter relating to a failure of staffing or proper staffing ratios.  When our guests refer to non-compliance, can we have some idea of the range of the issues that arise?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022033100002#L00200","speaker":"1682","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648681200,"counter":891,"content":"<p>On what we could examine, HIQA produced a report on regulatory reform in early 2021 in which we highlighted the need for a social care policy that will take account of the continuum of care throughout the social care spectrum.  In the context of the issues the Senator raised, the research we produced in regard to home care identified the issue's complexity and called for a root-and-branch review of the provision of home care services to ensure the future home care scheme would be fit for purpose and meet the needs.  It would also allow for that continuum of care where people may not be able to be cared for at home and may need to move into longer term facilities, with help to be given for that decision-making, which goes back to the rights-based approach.<\/p> <p>  As for what happens in the context of inspection and the timeframe after that, the function of our inspections is to assess compliance with the regulations and standards, and we take a rights-based approach to that.  It is very much about the impact of compliance or non-compliance on the people who live in those centres.  There are three categories of compliance, namely, compliant, substantially compliant, which means the provider is almost there but there are some improvements to be made, and non-compliance, which means that the provider has not met the requirements of the regulation, each of which comprises a number of sub-regulations.  We ask providers to consider not just the one issue we might have identified on inspection but the entirety of the regulation in order to see how they can come back into compliance and to determine whether there are other areas they need to address.<\/p> <p>  Not all non-compliance cases are the same.  Some might have a greater impact on residents, while others might relate to, for example, a documentation issue.  We look at what the impact of the non-compliance is on residents.  We take action and, as Mr. Colfer outlined, that action can include the cancellation of a registration as a result of the residents being put at risk, but providers are asked to submit their plans to us.  If we believe the risk to the residents has increased, we will outline a timeline by which the provider it must comply.  We review the compliance plans.  Members will see from our inspection reports where sometimes we have not been assured by a provider's response to us, and we publish that and it is transparent.  If we are not assured, we will go back out and not wait, and we will seek updates from the provider.<\/p> <p>  On the exact response and pathway, Mr. Colfer might outline exactly what happens when we get a notification.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022033100002#M00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Carol Grogan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648681200,"counter":892,"content":"<p>Where we receive information or learn there is a concern about an impact on residents, we do not allow that situation to continue.  Our inspectors, when they are carrying out an inspection, risk-assess the situation.  We have plenty of examples where our inspectors have required providers to put immediate actions in place to deal with the immediate, high-level risk to residents, and providers are then required to respond in the ongoing addressing of that risk, or its elimination where possible.<\/p> <p>  As for the funding, the Senator is correct.  We are detached from the funding side of things.  The regulations set out the minimum requirements - they are minimum requirements - that all providers are required to implement to ensure the safety and the quality of life of residents.  Our role is to assess whether they are meeting those requirements, and the provider and the funder then have to discuss how to address those matters.  Our actions are not informed by that part.  If there is an immediate risk and there is a requirement for immediate action, we require the provider to take that action.  Providers are in the difficult position of having to engage with their funder to ensure they have funding to do that.  Our focus is on the impact of the people living in the centres.<\/p> <p>  I have worked in the disabilities sector throughout my working life, but I was shocked by some of the cases we found in 2013 when we started carrying out inspections.  It was the first time an independent authority had gone into many of these centres and reported publicly on what we found.  There has been progress.  Our compliance and non-compliance levels, which are set out in our annual overview reports, show that for the vast majority of providers, a good population of service providers works hard to deliver good-quality care.  There is also a cohort of centres, however, that does not manage to achieve that, and regulation is very important in that we publicly state that and require providers to take action to address it.<\/p> <p>  Our pathway is such that when we receive information, it is assessed within three days.  We consider the seriousness of the information and base our actions on that.  Those actions might involve asking the provider to investigate the circumstances and to report back to us, but it may also be that we have a concern or the issue has been identified at a previous inspection and we now have more information on it.  We will then perform an unannounced risk inspection and, if the information is substantiated, require the provider to take action in respect of it.

Furthermore, there is a higher level of attrition in places such as nursing homes that are heavily reliant on, say, Filipino or Indian nurses and which recruit in that way.  If we are looking at care provision, we have to take a step back and ask ourselves how we can make it attractive for people and ensure they will be paid properly for the care they deliver.<\/p> <p>  One impact of the pandemic, I presume, is that the numbers of CAO places for nursing and midwifery dropped this year.  I think that is because people are continually hearing about how difficult it is to work in the healthcare system at the moment and during the pandemic, and people have caught Covid up to four times.  They want to continue but it is a very difficult situation.  We need to look at the conditions of providing care that are adequate and will provide sufficient care for covering safeguarding.  Methods of care are also implicated in safeguarding.  If there is neglect in a nursing home, for example, or if there is simply missed care, whereby the pressure on the staff is so great that they cannot complete routine tasks whether in part or in full, that can lead to issues such as pressure ulcers.<\/p><p>When we talk about long-term care, therefore, we are looking at that from the home environment, the whole spectrum, and how can we put in measures that will have the right professional at the right time in the right place for the right individual.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022033100002#M00400","nonspeaker":"Professor Amanda Phelan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648681200,"counter":895,"content":"<p>I thank all of the members for their questions and interest in this important topic.  From the perspective of the association, I must make it clear that, at the moment, we have a piecemeal response to adult safeguarding in a way we do not have but used to have in terms of child safeguarding.  While the two issues are not directly comparable, the kind of responses we need from the State are.  It is heartening to hear all of the things that have been mentioned today, yet, not to negate the optimism Professor Kelly introduced to the room, these messages have been delivered repeatedly.  Some of these speakers have repeated these messages for many years.  We are not seeing a response from our systems and legislators in terms of adopting these measures and translating them into practices that would change the lived experience of the people who have been mentioned by the Senator Seery Kearney.<\/p> <p>  To bring it back to the person in a congregated setting, if somebody today experiences abuse or his or her family is concerned about abuse, if it is a residential setting for children, they can ring Tusla.  In the case we are talking about, they can ring HIQA that will do all of the fantastic and important measures Ms Grogan and Mr. Colfer have outlined, but at the moment HIQA does not have the authority to investigate individual complaints.  Therefore, the system will be looked at overall and there will be that overarching piece, which is vital, important and has transformed our services.  The person may then be advised to ring the Ombudsman, who does not investigate clinical complaints.  The person might ring his or her safeguarding and protection social worker, who will, if he or she can, look at some aspects of the concern if it is in a public setting, but that social worker does not have a right of access to somebody who lives in a private service provider.  It is very important to note that 80% of older people, of whom a significant number may have a physical or an intellectual disability, live within the nursing homes sector and 80% of those homes are owned by the private sector.  In terms of accessibility to the supports that they need and safeguarding supports, I do not know if we would accept a situation in this country where 80% of children lived in a home where they could not access safeguarding social worker expertise.  I do not think that would be acceptable at any level.  A person could also go to the confidential recipient who manages concerns related to HSE services only.<\/p> <p>  As I list these, I am sure Deputies and Senators, as committee members, may have some familiarity with the services I am talking about.  Again, I ask them to go back to the perspective of the residents and their families having experienced some form of abuse or infringement of their rights and the complexity of the system we expect them to navigate.  We have options, knowledge and measures, but what we need from the perspective of social workers is political expediency to put these solutions in place.  We are talking about governance structures and having a one-stop-shop, as we have in other parts of the State.  Tusla has all of the centralised expertise.  It is one central authority that will allow the services to respond to all of the issues we have talked about.  When things go wrong, one can operate and put in preventative measures and, as needed, safeguarding social work experts, the guards or whoever can come in.<\/p> <p>  We are missing the holistic piece.  As Ms Grogan alluded to, people with disabilities sometimes need additional supports to report their experiences of abuse.  It is exceptionally challenging.  We reference those 143 sexual assaults that were reported.  These were not necessarily substantiated but these were concerns that came to the attention of HIQA.  Specific measures are required to support somebody, not just to disclose it but also report it to the relevant authorities such as the Garda.  I believe Professor Phelan referenced the specialist policing units that are available elsewhere.  We need the same sort of supports here across the investigative units, whether it is social work or the Garda, to ensure people are given every opportunity to tell their story and to have equal access to justice and protection.<\/p> <p>  We have outlined measures in our submission.  As per usual, it is a reasonably lengthy submission but there are very quick easy wins around governance and easy wins around legislative measures that can be taken in the interim.  Ultimately, until our systems and laws value this and reflect what we believe, as a society, should be the response regardless of where a person who experiences abuse lives, we are not going to progress as much as we can.  The missing ingredient is political expediency and we would love to see that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022033100002#N00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Sin&eacute;ad McGarry"},{"type":"speech","time":1648681200,"counter":896,"content":"<p>Why has community healthcare organisation, CHO, 7 the highest level of safeguarding issues?

I have one overall question for them but will first outline what I have gleaned from today's proceedings.  From what Sage Advocacy shared with us, it is clear there is international best practice.  It is clear that without reinventing the wheel, we could take on some of what is being done in, for example, Toronto and Scotland.  It is imperative that we, as a committee, understand what is successful in these regions and see how we can lift and shift those policies, processes or procedures to make a real difference in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  I thank all of the social workers throughout Ireland for the tremendous work they do.  From the perspective of Ms Geiran and Ms O&rsquo;Connor, I got a sense of deep frustration from them that reports just identify problems.  They identify problems and garner a lot of press and media attention and political commentary, but when the dust settles they do not act as a catalyst for change, which is what everybody across the political divide wants.  All of us in different parties share the goal of wanting to change things.<\/p> <p>  I was struck by what Ms O'Connor said about the lone social worker and how that can be a difficult position to be in if he or she is in a situation where he or she is surrounded by, as she put it, smaller signals of abuse.  They, too, need to be identified and called out.<\/p> <p>  From a HIQA perspective, I am pleased to hear about the move back towards unannounced inspections, that they now happen an awful lot of more and are a priority.  Ms Grogan explained the benefits of announced inspections from the perspective of collaboration and access to HIQA by families and service users.  However, I think unannounced inspections, unfortunately, often throw up dark cases and it is the dark cases that require intervention.<\/p> <p>  I was struck by what Professor Kelly said about recruitment and how being under-resourced can lead to a situation where signals of abuse are missed.  I was particularly struck by his comment that it is not just retention that is an issue and that there is a need to entice people back from Australia or wherever.<\/p><p>I was also struck by the comment on how difficult it is to do that without a reform package and without being able to show we can provide better support and career opportunities.  That leads me to the question I would like to ask all our witnesses.  How can we change the culture?  Nearly all the witnesses have brought up culture at this point.  We have talked about changes that need to happen, institutionalisation, the gap between the criminal justice system and mental health services, the gaps in communication with service users and families, and the gap between PPS numbers and our unique hospital identification numbers.  These all boil down to a need for cultural change throughout the HSE, Tusla and other agencies set up to deliver the interventions that the vulnerable absolutely need.  My question is a broad one but I would really value all the guests' perspectives on it because the committee needs to understand the practical changes that could help to change the culture and create and implement a better service for all service users.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022033100002#N00600","speaker":"1566","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648681200,"counter":901,"content":"<p>I had to step out to the Chamber, so I hope I do not repeat anything.  I thank the delegates so much for attending.<\/p> <p>  The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities requires the State to put appropriate measures in place to protect persons with disabilities from all forms of exploitation, violence and abuse.  That is an important obligation given the vulnerabilities involved for some groups; however, there is also a balance to be reached to avoid being too paternalistic in our attitudes.  Generally, the issues raised at meetings of this committee concern not a lack of safeguards but a lack of supports that prevents disabled people from living as independently as possible.  However, it makes sense to state those experiencing safeguarding issues may not be in a position to appear before the committee.  It is very concerning that of the more than 10,000 safeguarding concerns notified in 2020, 78% related to older people and the disability sector.<\/p> <p>  My first question is for Professor Phelan.  Sage Advocacy casework includes issues related to coercive control exercised by relatives over vulnerable adults, from not allowing people to manage their social welfare payments to isolating people intentionally.  The intersections of domestic violence and disability are not discussed enough.  Could Professor Phelan elaborate on the issues in this area, as she understands them, and the potential interventions that could help to protect people?  She mentioned the financial abuse of vulnerable adults.  The assisted decision-making legislation is being amended currently.  The Joint Committee on Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth just produced its pre-legislative scrutiny report, and the codes of practice are being drawn up.  Could Professor Phelan discuss changes that are necessary or measures that should be included?  What could new safeguarding legislation add that cannot be achieved through better implementation and monitoring of existing laws protecting whistleblowers and requiring reporting of criminal offences against children and vulnerable adults?<\/p> <p>  My next question is for Professor Kelly.  The clarity of his opening statement was eye-opening in its understanding of overlapping areas concerning safeguarding in mental health services.  I was especially struck by his articulation of how Ireland is failing to safeguard the rights of people with severe mental illness.  He helpfully provided several solutions.  Could he elaborate on the point on safeguarding social and medical well-being?  He mentioned systematic co-working between mental health services, primary care and social care.  Could he outline what that would look like in practice?  He also mentioned the need for legislation that balances protection and autonomy.  This is a key theme, especially regarding the assisted decision-making Bill and efforts to increase community-supported living.  Could Professor Kelly discuss this type of balance and, perhaps, the challenges involved?<\/p> <p>  My next question is for the delegates from the Irish Association of Social Workers.  How can new safeguarding legislation ensure that a person's will and preference are at the centre of any safeguarding process and that reporting cannot occur without a person's consent?<\/p> <p>  My final question is for the representatives of HIQA.  In its annual overview report concerning 2022, HIQA notes that residents who live in congregated settings are at increased risk of being exposed to safeguarding issues.  Could the representatives elaborate on the types of risks and issues they have encountered and the progress made by providers in addressing these?<\/p> <p>  The committee has heard that when it comes to discussions on congregated settings, the individuals concerned and their families can feel sidelined.  Are there methods to ensure their voices are central in the safeguarding process?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022033100002#O00200","speaker":"1525"},{"type":"speech","time":1648681200,"counter":902,"content":"<p>We will start with Professor Kelly and then proceed to Mr. Geiran, who is to be followed by Ms Grogan and Professor Phelan.

Culture will change you far quicker than you will change it, which is the big problem.  My optimism was referred to earlier.  I will return to this because there are many people working in our health and social care systems who are doing fantastic work.  There are many organisations doing their best, and committees such as this one are trying to keep the matter on the political agenda.  Therefore, there is a great deal that is good.<\/p> <p>  With regard to recruitment, my experience is mainly in medicine, particularly psychiatry.  There are many things going on.  For example, the College of Psychiatrists of Ireland, of which I am a member but not a spokesperson, is working hard on recruitment, reforming training processes and streamlining.  It is also trying to work on implementing policy and updating the Mental Health Act.  All these matter quite profoundly in building a system that will entice people back, although we are competing all the time with pictures of beaches in Australia and landscapes that are very compelling.  Nonetheless, we have a very committed generation of medical students who will, indeed, return.<\/p> <p>  I thank Deputy Cairns for her questions.  She talked about the need to protect social and medical well-being.  Some of the specific measures I have mentioned would help.  I cannot overstate the need for electronic medical and social care records linked by a unique identifier number.  This is possible.  All of our hospitals have an electronic radiology system, and everyone is identified no matter what hospital they go to.  We do not have the same for medicine or social care.  For example, if someone is discharged from an inpatient psychiatry unit to a homeless hostel, there is no way for me to know, without a great deal of telephoning, where he or she is two nights later.  My prescribing of treatments, while very useful and helpful, is really no substitute for somebody having a bed somewhere and knowing where he or she lives.<\/p> <p>  The other point on medical well-being, which I mentioned earlier, is that we need an expansion of the counselling and primary care scheme, whereby primary care practices and general practitioners can give people with medical cards, and those without them who are almost eligible, access to the counselling scheme.<\/p> <p>  The balance between protection and autonomy is a very difficult one to reach.  There is a tradition of paternalism.  The assisted decision-making (capacity) (amendment) Bill will help in striking a better balance.  The programmes of the HSE national office for human rights and equality policy are really focused on this.  My main message, however, is that even the passage and commencement of that legislation will not necessarily make what I describe happen in practice.  We need an education programme rolled out for staff so people will know the options available to them regarding supported decision-making.  Evidence from other jurisdictions on advanced healthcare directives shows that before implementation 90% of people say they are a good idea and that after implementation fewer than 10% actually produce them.  That has all got to do with people feeling empowered and supported and staff understanding how to make it happen.  My social work colleagues are nodding vigorously at this because they play a key role in this kind of thing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022033100002#O00400","nonspeaker":"Professor Brendan Kelly"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648681200,"counter":904,"content":"<p>I will respond to some of the questions that relate to the Irish Association of Social Workers.  Deputy Murnane O'Connor made the point that the system as a whole is failing.  That is a very important point.  All the words in her statement - that the system as a whole is failing - are important.  That is because of the siloed nature of our responses, which we have spoken about.  Deputy Murnane O'Connor also referred to the cultural issues, as did Deputy Higgins.  The really important question of how we can change the culture was raised.<\/p><p>Professor Kelly referred to the old saying that culture eats strategy for breakfast.  I was going to put it slightly differently.  It probably eats legislation with its morning coffee.  It is a very difficult thing to change but we have to grapple with that.  <\/p><p>  As regards Senator Seery Kearney's question on how we inject change, urgency in starting and delivering that change is really important.  Much, but not all, of the power is in this room, both actually and figuratively, in the sense of the Legislature progressing the much-needed legislation, for example.  There is also a responsibility on the Executive side to follow up with urgency.<\/p><p> A couple of members asked what the legislation will change.  As I stated, I come from a background in the criminal justice system, in which for many years a significant number of people, including me, recognised the need for much better inter-agency co-operation and working.  For many years I operated under the unfortunate illusion that because people recognised that, they would work really hard to change it.  Unfortunately, the reality is that many of these problems are not really addressed unless there is legislation and a statutory basis and mandate for that type of co-operation.  I refer again to the example that has been cited many times of the situation in respect of child welfare and protection.  The changes did not happen because people knew we needed to work better and in a more co-ordinated way or because of all the scandals that occurred; they only happened when appropriate legislation was put in place.  I am not saying that legislation can answer or deal with everything - it cannot - but I do think it is a fundamental foundation.  As was evidenced in the context of children, we need appropriate structures and responsibility, accountability and transparency to follow on from the legislation.<\/p><p> Professor Phelan or Ms O'Connor may wish to come in on some of the points raised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022033100002#O00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Vivian Geiran","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648681200,"counter":906,"content":"<p>The recurring question here relates to how we change culture.  Legislation can change culture.  We have seen that in respect of teachers slapping children, people wearing seatbelts and smoking, for example.  It can change culture and transform the way we see things because culture is a reflection of our values and beliefs.  Discursively, we say we value everybody as a citizen of Ireland but, practically, all animals are equal but some are more equal than others.  It is about looking at the hard facts in terms of how we treat people who are risk populations within our group and are marginalised because of that.<\/p> <p>  We need to put a significant focus on prevention.  Much legislation in Ireland has been reactive in nature.  We have reacted to scandals and crises and so on and things have happened thereafter.  We have an opportunity now to be proactive and to focus on prevention and early intervention.  What is needed along with that is changing the way people think.  Legislation has a significant focus on that.  I trained as a public health nurse when the childcare legislation was being fully enacted in 1995.  There was a significant refocus of people's responsibilities because there was then a mandate that one had to respond.  The same thing should happen in the context of adult safeguarding.  There is also the societal obligation that everybody has a duty of care to other citizens.  That is enshrined in Article 41 of the Constitution in particular, which refers to the widowed, the aged and orphans.  Regardless of naming different sections of the population, we have a responsibility to look after each other.  It is incomprehensible that we seem to be trying to learn the same lessons all the time.  The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act is a significant step forward but we are still working under the Lunacy Regulation (Ireland) Act 1871.  Members should think about that.  The wardship legislation dates from 1871.  It is archaic and unsuitable.  It is to be hoped that by June, we will have a lot of work done on that.  The Government needs to support the decision-making support service to fulfil that obligation to Irish people.  We have the advanced healthcare planning.  We also need to push out things like powers of attorney such that people can make those decisions when they have decision-making capacity.  It is hugely under-used in comparison with the UK.<\/p> <p>  We have learned from other countries.  I led on a report with Mazars that considered safeguarding structures in nine countries around the world and looked at interventions, legislation, policy outcomes and things like that.  One can consider what the Office of the Public Advocate does in Australia, for example, or what happens in Canada.  I would not pay particular attention to what is happening in Norway because it does not have any structures in responding.  Japan has quite an interesting response as the police force there is quite involved in safeguarding.  We can learn from those structures.  The Child Care Act is founded on the principle of well-being.  There are various safeguarding principles that are usually generic in the context of policies on autonomy, self-determination and things like that.  There are templates out there.  We just need to decide what is suitable for our structure and how we will put it into a process that gets us to the outcome we desire.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022033100002#P00200","nonspeaker":"Professor Amanda Phelan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648681200,"counter":907,"content":"<p>In response to Deputy Higgins, I make the point that we have all referred to the need for safeguarding legislation.  In the absence of such legislation, our key focus is to ensure that people living in designated centres are active participants in their own care and decisions.  That can happen now.  We advocate for it all the time.  We have seen the change because we have widened the conversation.  We are talking about safeguarding and everything it encompasses.  That, in itself, is changing the narrative in respect of how people can be active participants in their own care.  It has to be proactive but it can only be proactive if everybody knows and understands their responsibilities.  That can be done now in preparation for any legislation that is coming in.  In addition, reporting and transparency are so important.  There is a statutory responsibility on providers to report to HIQA.  That transparency is crucial.  We publish our inspection reports in the hope that services will use them to learn from the experiences of others, such as providers that have good practices and systems in place.<\/p> <p>  I ask Mr. Colfer to address the issues in respect of congregated settings and the importance of the voices in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022033100002#P00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Carol Grogan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648681200,"counter":908,"content":"<p>There is a process for transitioning people from congregated settings but, in the interim, it is about maximising the safety of people who currently live in such settings.  In the context of the cultural question, what struck me when the questions were being asked is that we have engaged with many providers and we have seen changes not just in terms of reducing the incidence of safeguarding issues but also in terms of promoting people's rights and quality of life.  I gave some examples of that earlier.  One of the interesting things is that when one engages with a situation such as a congregated setting, the main cultural issue is usually institutionalised care practices.  People who work in those centres have a certain perspective on what their job is and how they should do it.  People who live in the centres get their food from a centralised kitchen and their clothes are washed in a centralised laundry.  They have no sense of engagement with or control over their day-to-day living.  We challenge that in our inspections.  We try to maximise within that environment how people can be promoted in terms of engaging with their own self-care.<\/p><p>In some centres, for example, providers have installed kitchens in their units and involve residents more in the preparation of their day-to-day meals.  A difference for residents can be seen arising even from that small action, but what is interesting is that staff, too, begin to see the impact of that action and start to take some pride in what is being delivered, the changes that are happening and the enhancement from what is happening.<\/p><p> Culture is really important, and I agree with the previous speakers in respect of the role of legislation in that culture.  I mentioned earlier the kinds of issues we were seeing when we started carrying out inspections, particularly in congregated settings.  We have challenged that, including by cancelling a registration in some congregated settings.  We have required providers to implement improvements in all those congregated settings and that has driven cultural change.  We have seen staff change their approach to practice and to the support of residents.  Nevertheless, the difficulty is that over time in congregated settings, there can be a reversion to previous practices and there is a high risk of that.  Professor Kelly referred to the issue of people who move from congregated settings to community-based settings, where the practices can follow them.  It may, therefore, become an institutionalised practice in a small home in the community.  Again, that is something we will and do challenge in our engagement.  One organisation whose centres we have registered and which we monitor moved a large number of people to community settings.  We have found we are now challenging that organisation in terms of institutionalised care practices within the community settings, but it has made very good progress on improving the rights of the remaining residents within the congregated setting.  Culture is the key to all of this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022033100002#P00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Finbarr Colfer","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648681200,"counter":910,"content":"<p>I welcome our guests and thank them for their contributions.  This issue is so important.  It is clear we need to raise awareness and let people know what safeguarding is.  We also need to ensure people will know that everyone has the right to their own advocacy.  This shows the importance of the Assisted Decision Making (Capacity) Act 2015 and the need to change the paternalistic culture that exists in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  The education of our population is critical.  Someone made a point earlier about the existing laws.  Accountability is very important to me.  When something is a criminal offence, it is a criminal offence whether it happens in a congregated setting or not.  Moreover, certain laws protect our vulnerable persons.  The briefing note we received referred to 444 people who in 2020 had alleged sexual abuse.  How many of those allegations have been investigated?  Were all the cases given to the Garda, given that it is the obligation under the current law to do so as quickly as possible?  Our guests might correct me if I am wrong in respect of the safeguarding legislation, which I might be misreading.  I am sure all those alleged sexual abuse cases were immediately sent to the Garda.<\/p> <p>  To follow up on Senator Seery Kearney's questions, when HIQA instructs an organisation to put in place a plan to mitigate a safeguarding risk, what threshold is used to measure the adequacy of that measure?  We do not want only the bare minimum to be applied to deal with an issue.  We want to ensure every issue will be implemented in order that the matter will be resolved.<\/p> <p>  Many of the other questions I had intended to ask have been covered.  In the context of our guests as practitioners and the importance of the safeguarding legislation, perhaps we need to enhance our existing legislation and widen its scope.  Often, that is the way in which the Department of Justice likes to work.  Should we consider adding a Schedule to the Criminal Justice (Withholding of Information on Offences Against Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012 to include more offences and impose higher obligations on people who care for vulnerable adults?  As practitioners, what are our guests' opinions on expanding the offence of coercive control?  The offence relates only to people who are in an intimate relationship together, but the idea of coercive control covers much of what we are talking about in respect of safeguarding legislation.  Now that, thankfully, there is a law in the form of domestic violence legislation, that could be a place where we could add an amendment to include this issue.  Should we mainstream our legislation to take in our entire population instead of pigeonholing our vulnerable population with one item of legislation?<\/p> <p>   One of our guests quite rightly stated the HSE has no authority to enter a private nursing home and ask questions, but HIQA does, I presume.  If the HSE fears something is not right in a private nursing home, is there an automatic transfer of knowledge to HIQA to enable it to investigate an alleged breach of good practice and basic human dignity?<\/p> <p>  I thank our guests.

Clearly, that, in and of itself as a legislative measure, either is not in place as a measure or is not being used effectively.<\/p><p>We need to ask how that can occur over such a long period in one congregated setting and not have any legal consequences for those who are seeing people being harmed in their care.  That is not specific to Brandon; it could happen in any service.  Clearly, the legislation is not working.<\/p><p> In terms of HIQA and the HSE safeguarding protection teams, it is very important to note that HIQA has a very distinct and separate role to the safeguarding protection teams, as does the Garda in the investigation of abuse.  They are distinct, separate and equally vital, and it is important that a person living in a centre receives access to all three services.  That would very much be our position.  HIQA comes in and does the overall systems regulation, but it cannot look in detail at individual complaints.  Mr. Colfer outlined very clearly the significant safeguarding measures that it takes, but HIQA has also called for strengthened powers.  We need to start to see that this is not just an either-or scenario.  One service should not substitute for another.  We do not do that with children and we should not be doing it in respect of adults who are at risk.<\/p><p> Very quickly, to go back to Deputy Cairns point on how safeguarding legislation can align with the will and preferences of people and ensure that reporting does not happen against the consent of somebody, social work is a relationship-based profession.  We look to build trusting relationships over time with people.  It is really important that safeguarding legislation does not actually worsen the well-being of people by introducing paternalist measures which mean that the State can start to intervene for the sake of stopping abuse, but leaving someone, as Professor Phelan discussed earlier, in a less happy state.  The will and preferences of people have to be at the centre of what we do, but we also need to recognise that the lessons from domestic violence carryover.  We are working with people impacted by domestic violence all of the time.  We are not making reports that are putting their well-being in a worse state.  We are supporting people and we are working with them to make the changes that they want to see in their lives at the right time.  It is very important that legislation values that intervention so that if somebody declines a legal intervention to prevent the risk from reoccurring, we are recognising they should, if they wish, have access to a service that will support them in managing how they cope with it, increasing their safety so they know that they can come back or engage and get the help that they need at the right time for them.  A lot of people are experts in their own lives.<\/p><p> The final caveat is on mandatory reporting.  It is that piece that some people do not have the ability to speak up for themselves and seek help for themselves.  Our legislative measures have to recognise and respond to that.  We should not be leaving people in situations where they would like to be helped but cannot access it due to lack of mandatory reporting.  That is it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022033100002#Q00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Sin&eacute;ad McGarry","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648681200,"counter":913,"content":"<p>We are under a time constraint because we have been in the room for so long.

There is precedence in terms of Colette Kelleher bringing a Bill in 2017 to set up a national adult safeguarding authority.  We are seeing gaps and we want the responsibility to be solely within an organisation that will actually map and avoid all of those gaps.  It will follow the person and co-ordinate that interdisciplinarity between, say, police, safeguarding teams, the legal system, front-line workers and all of that.  That demands that we do it right and do the right thing, which is safeguarding the decision.  Members will see the many facets of what could be incorporated in that in the Lower Reform Commission&rsquo;s 2019 report, where it did a position paper on safeguarding and drew on the many aspects.  What came up earlier was something as simple as sharing data, which is not permissible in what we do now.  Therefore, we need to make sure that responding to safeguarding concerns is made as accessible as possible for professionals as well as people who are reporting that they are concerned about somebody else or perhaps reporting on a brother or sister who is not letting another sibling visit, because they are the gatekeeper.  That is coercive control.<\/p> <p>  Coercive control has a huge impact because, again, as Ms O&rsquo;Connor said earlier, much of this is about power control, and that power control can be between people out in the community, but also the power systems and dynamics that happen in the traditional systems of healthcare, where there are powerful people who are nurses, doctors or others who are coming and saying what needs to be done.  We need to move away from that.  We need bespoke legislation that firmly protects adults.  It is not only about adults who are at risk now; we may all be at risk at some point of our lives.

It is worth highlighting Ms O&rsquo;Connor&rsquo;s point that we have good people in the system and good staff and so on.  I would emphasise the need for all of that system, the staff and other people in it, to be supported by legislation, by the role of oversight, governance and monitoring bodies, such as HIQA, or otherwise, is very important.<\/p> <p>  We have a broadly shared understanding of what is needed.  We definitely need legislation that is underpinned by human rights.  We need an independent, statutory social work led adult safeguarding agency.  We need to clarify, right now and into the future, responsibilities and accountabilities within the system, mandatory reporting from, right away, better data, research and co-ordination, and also in the interim, better information being made available to people at all levels and better and more training.

Special rapporteurs are human rights experts who are appointed by the Human Rights Council for a six-year non-renewable term.  We are part of what are called UN special procedures.  We are not paid for our work and many of us are university academics with specialties in our areas of appointment.  We are autonomous from the council and while we work within our specific mandates, we are free to explore themes that we choose ourselves and free to come to our own conclusions and recommendations in the reports that we deliver to the UN.  Kofi Annan, the former Secretary General of the UN, called special procedures the &quot;crown jewel&quot; of the UN human rights system.<br\/><br\/>Before I explain my role and report, may I say that Ireland and its policy towards the Israeli occupation of Palestine have been a shining north star in the EU and the west.  I commend the resolution adopted by the D&aacute;il last May with regard to de facto annexation and salute the principled stance Ireland and its Government have taken in support of Palestinian civil society in general and the defence it has offered to the six Palestinian organisations that were designated as terrorist organisations by the Israeli Government last October, with very thin evidence to support this alarming claim.  I acknowledge the fact that Ireland, in its statement to the UN Security Council in February, specifically stated that the Israeli occupation has become illegal, which makes it among the very first European countries to officially adopt this stance as part of its foreign policy.  I am aware that this committee has discussed the topic of Palestine on a number of occasions and produced a well-regarded report last summer on home demolitions and displacement in the occupied Palestinian territory.<br\/><br\/>I am completing my six-year term as special rapporteur for the occupied Palestinian territory at the end of April.  The past six years while I have served as special rapporteur have been momentous with regards of developments in the occupied Palestinian territory.  Alas most of these developments have been disheartening and an affront to our international human rights standards.  There have been several periods of intense and destructive violence with great loss of life and property against the Palestinians under occupation by the Israeli military, particularly in Gaza during the Great March of Return in 2018 and the short explosive war on Gaza in May 2021.  The Israeli occupation, which is in its 55th year with no end in sight, has become ever more entrenched and repressive.  In terms of Palestinian deaths at the hands of the Israeli military, 2021 was the deadliest year since 2014.  The instances of settler violence towards Palestinians in 2021 was the highest level of recorded attacks since statistics were first assembled in 2012.  The demolition of Palestinian homes by the Israeli military has also been spiking continuously upwards.  We must also recognise and condemn the deaths of innocent Israel civilians during this period.  Too much bloodshed on all sides of this occupation have been shed.<br\/><br\/>In 2014, when the last serious peace process efforts under the then US Secretary of State John Kerry collapsed, there were 370,000 Israeli settlers living in the West Bank.  Today, there are close to 480,000 settlers, which is an increase of 23%.  Add to that the 230,000 Jewish Israeli settlers in Jerusalem and there are now 710,000 Israeli settlers, over 10% of the Israeli Jewish population, living in occupied territory in settlements that the UN Security Council has declared to be a &quot;flagrant violation under <br\/><br\/>international law&quot;.  <br\/><br\/>In terms of Palestinian civil society and international human rights observers, the news is equally discouraging.  In October 2021, Israel designated six Palestinian civil society organisations as terrorist organisations and has not rescinded this attack notwithstanding the consistent statements from member states and international donors that Israel has not presented persuasive evidence to back up any of its claims.  As well, Israel has refused to renew the visas of a number of international staff officers working in the occupied Palestinian territory for the Office of the High Commission for Human Rights, thereby forcing them out of the country.  This unjustified interference with the legitimate work of the UN are actions not worthy of a democracy or a UN member state.<br\/><br\/>The dedicated theme of my 12th report as special rapporteur addresses the question as to whether Israel's acquisitive and repressive practices over the course of its 55-year-old regime have curdled from an endless occupation into something darker, harsher and more ominous.  In recent years and months, distinguished voices have concluded that the inexorable facts of Israel&rsquo;s occupation - the relentless land confiscation, the ever-expanding Jewish-only settlements, the dual legal system, the vast gap in living conditions between Israeli settlers and the Palestinians living among them, the vast separation in political rights, the use of torture, home demolitions, collective punishment and the depleted Palestinian economy &ndash; have amounted to, or resemble, apartheid.  Former UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon wrote in 2021 that Israel&rsquo;s &quot;structural domination and oppression of the Palestinian people through indefinite occupation arguably constitutes apartheid.&quot;  Nobel laureate Desmond Tutu stated in 2014 &quot;I know first-hand that Israel has created an apartheid reality within its borders and through its occupation.&quot;  South African Foreign Minister Naledi Pandor spoke in 2022 about her country's &quot;significant dismay at the continued apartheid practices of Israel against the <br\/><br\/>long-suffering people of Palestine&quot; and perhaps most revealing, the former Attorney General of Israel Michael Ben-Yair wrote last month in an Irish publication:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIsrael's ongoing domination over these territories is a gross injustice that must be urgently rectified.  It is with great sadness that I must also conclude that my country has sunk to such political and moral depths that it is now an apartheid regime.  It is time for the international community to recognise this reality as well. <\/blockquote><p>He continues:<\/p><blockquote>\tYou simply cannot be a liberal democracy if you operate apartheid over another people.  It is a contradiction in terms because Israel's entire society is complicit in this unjust reality. <\/blockquote><p>My report asks whether this 55-year-old occupation has become indistinguishable from apartheid.  Applying the accepted three-part test taken from the 1973 UN Convention against apartheid, and the 1998 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, I concluded in my report from last week that the political system of entrenched rule in the occupied Palestinian territory satisfies the prevailing evidentiary standard for the existence of apartheid.<br\/><br\/>First, an institutionalised regime of systematic racial oppression and discrimination has been established.  Israeli Jews and Palestinian Arabs in East Jerusalem and the West Bank live their lives under a single regime which differentiates its distribution of rights and benefits on the basis of national and ethnic identity and which ensures the supremacy of one group over, and to the detriment of, the other.  The differences in living conditions and citizenship rights and benefits are stark, deeply discriminatory and maintained through systematic and institutionalised oppression.<br\/><br\/>Second, this system of alien rule has been established with the intent of maintaining the domination of one racial-national-ethnic group over another.  Israeli political leaders, past and present, have repeatedly stated they intend to retain control over all of the occupied territory to enlarge the blocks of land for present and future Jewish settlement while confining the Palestinians to barricaded population reserves.  Under this particular system, the freedoms of one group are inextricably bound up in the subjugation of the other.<br\/><br\/>Third, the imposition of this system of institutionalised discrimination with the intent of permanent domination has been built upon the regular practice of inhumane acts: arbitrary and extra-judicial killings; torture; the violent deaths of children; the denial of fundamental human rights; a fundamentally flawed military court system and the lack of criminal due process; arbitrary detention; collective punishment; and the desperate living conditions in barricaded Gaza.  The repetition of these acts over long periods of time and their endorsement by the Knesset and the Israeli judicial system indicate they are not the result of random and isolated acts but integral to Israel's system of rule.<br\/><br\/>This is apartheid.  It does not have some of the same features as practised in southern Africa before the mid-1990s.  In particular, much of what has been called &ldquo;petit apartheid&rdquo; is not present.  On the other hand, there are pitiless features of Israel's apartness rule in the occupied Palestinian territory that were not practised in southern Africa, such as segregated highways, high walls and extensive checkpoints, a barricaded population, missile strikes and tank shelling of a civilian population, and the abandonment of the Palestinians' social welfare to the international community.  With the eyes of the international community wide open, Israel has imposed upon Palestine an apartheid reality in a post-apartheid world.<br\/><br\/>I want to address one of the most important and neglected issues dealing with the Israeli occupation of Palestine: the remarkable unwillingness of the international community to impose any accountability measures on Israel for its forever occupation, which has been conducted both in absolute defiance of international law and with the eyes of the international community wide open.  The UN Security Council has adopted more than 30 resolutions in the past 50 years critical of Israel and the occupation.  The General Assembly and the Human Rights Council have adopted hundreds more resolutions.  According to international law, the Israeli settlements are illegal.  Annexation is illegal.  The denial of Palestinian self-determination is illegal.  Human rights abuses are rife.  The Fourth Geneva Convention applies in full and has been honoured in its absence.  None of these countless resolutions have been obeyed by Israel and nothing has been imposed on Israel to bring it into compliance with the rules-based international order.<br\/><br\/>When the international community allows a member state permission to go rogue, it is going rogue itself.  I would not be here in front of the committee today presenting my recent report on how an unrelenting occupation has metastasized into apartheid if the international community had taken its own laws seriously 40 years ago or even 30 years ago when the Security Council and the General Assembly began to adopt the first of their many resolutions critical of the Israeli occupation.  International law is not meant to be an umbrella that folds up at the first hint of rain.  Had the international community accompanied these resolutions with resolute accountability and consistency decades ago, in the same way it is doing today with great urgency in respect of the invasion and occupation of Ukraine, then we would have likely already had a just and durable resolution to the question of Palestine and no one would have to be talking about apartheid today in the Palestinian territories. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2022033100002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Professor S.

Apartheid is a violation of public international law, a grave violation of human rights and a crime against humanity under international law.

The definition of apartheid is the systematic, prolonged and discriminatory treatment by one racial group of another racial group with the intent to control, segregate, oppress and dominate them.

He might expand on his visits to the occupied territories and the Gaza Strip.  He might also outline his communications with the occupying forces and the assistance they gave him in compiling this report.<\/p><p> The professor's opening statement also dealt with the designation of the six Palestinian civil society and human rights groups.  Even in the worst days of apartheid, the South Africans did not go as far as banning human rights or civil society groups.  What are the professor's views on the designation of those civil society and human rights groups as terrorist entities?  As I see it, this is an attempt to turn out the spotlight that is being shone on the apartheid policies and the brutality of the actions of the illegal occupation being perpetrated by Israel.  Why does the professor think Israel has now moved to ban such organisations?<\/p><p> The professor might also touch on the policies we see being put into practice by the Israelis in the West Bank.  We know there are now 169 enclaves of disconnected land.  There are segregated roads to which only Israelis have access.  We know that for Palestinians to travel from one of these enclaves to another, they must go through many Israeli military checkpoints.  The professor might give evidence about that issue and what it means to be a Palestinian in the occupied territories and living in one of these enclaves.  How do they go about their lives?  What are the barriers facing Palestinians living under occupation?<\/p><p> The professor also mentioned the statement made by the Irish ambassador to the UN, which is important.  The professor said that was the first time the term \"illegal occupation\" has been used.  What is the significance and importance of that?  We know about the occupation, annexation and apartheid.  I hope the position of the Irish Government is that it is an illegal occupation.  I imagine that is the Government position but we have yet to hear the Minister for Foreign Affairs, or any Government member, using that particular wording.  What is the significance and importance of the ambassador's use of that phrase?<\/p><p> The Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch reports, and the professor's report, adopted evidence-based approaches to all of the investigations that have been carried out into apartheid, based on the yardstick of international human rights law and humanitarian law.  That being the case, does the professor believe those who refuse to use the term \"apartheid\" and refuse to acknowledge that reality could be accused of being negligent, at best, or perhaps even culpable as a result of their denials or inaction?  I note in the professor's statement there is criticism of the international community for the many resolutions that have been adopted, not just by the Security Council but also by the General Assembly, and the failure to follow up with action to ensure those resolutions mean something.  Ireland was the first EU country to declare the land grab, the illegal settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories, as annexation.  Does that mean anything without the actions to follow through and hold Israel to account?  Does that inaction mean the international community is culpable in the apartheid reality in which the Palestinian people are living?<\/p><p> We sit here and consider the three different frames for how we arrive at the issue of apartheid.  Last night in the Palestinian territories was similar to many nights that preceded it.  Two Palestinian teenagers were shot dead in their homes.  Two Palestinian brothers were shot in the legs following an Israeli raid on their shop.  I am conscious that as we sit here, Palestinians are still suffering.  Palestinians homes are still being demolished.  Palestinian schools are also being demolished.  Irish aid we give to the Palestinian people is being disrupted, destroyed and demolished.  What will it take, in the professor's mind, to force the international community to take action now to tackle head on the crime against humanity that is apartheid?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2022033100002#C00300","speaker":"1625","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648681200,"counter":934,"content":"<p>I counted approximately six questions in the Deputy's contribution if Professor Lynk could go through them as succinctly as he can.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2022033100002#D00200","speaker":"1515"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648681200,"counter":935,"content":"<p>I also counted six questions.  The first related to the comment of Kofi Annan which I quoted.  The Deputy asked how I gather my evidence.  What I did not say, and I am sorry if I left any mistaken impression, is that I am not allowed into the occupied Palestinian territory or Israel, nor were two of my immediate predecessors as special rapporteur.  It is the policy of Israel to ignore this mandate and not to co-operate.  I am not the only UN position holder or body with which Israel does not co-operate.  I went to Amman in Jordan once a year, until Covid-19 hit, and received the UN officials and Palestinian and Israeli civil society and human rights activists who would come to meet me there.  When Covid hit, my dealings with those organisations were primarily by remote meetings on Zoom.<\/p> <p>  Plan A, the most desirable situation, would allow me to go to the occupied Palestinian territory to witness what is going on, to see the growth of the settlements and the expropriation of the land, to meet families whose homes have been demolished and to meet families whose members have been imprisoned or put into administrative detention.  I do have experience in the occupied Palestinian territory.  I worked for a period of time in the late 1980s for the United Nations in Jerusalem on refugee and human rights issues.  If I am not allowed into the territories as special rapporteur, then plan B is to rely upon the excellent documentation that comes from civil society and human rights organisations.  This is the best documented conflict of the modern world.  It is not the best reported but it is the best documented.<\/p><p>Therefore, I have a wealth of information arising from a range of relationships that I have developed, as well as from the quality of our reporting by Palestinian, Israeli and international human rights organisations, with respect to that.  That is basically how I acquire my evidence with respect to the reports that I deliver.  While I wish I had plan A, I think plan B has worked fairly well for the reports that I have written.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2022033100002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Professor S.

Every year there is silence; nothing, <i>nada<\/i>, crickets.  Nothing comes back with respect to that.  They have never responded to any of the requests for the ability to travel.  I am not the only special rapporteur to whom that happens.  North Korea does not allow the rapporteur in there.  Myanmar does not either.  However, other special rapporteurs are allowed into the countries they monitor.  Most special rapporteurs who have global mandates are permitted by those countries to visit the countries and to report as favourably, or as critically, as they so wish.<br\/><br\/>The Deputy&rsquo;s second question has to do with the six Palestinian civil society organisations.  In October they were designated as terrorist organisations by the Israeli Minister of Defence, Benny Gantz.  That designation is still hanging like a sword of Damocles.  Israel has on two separate occasions assembled a range of documents that it have presented, primarily in Europe.  This has been to try to persuade member states with whom it has good relationships that these organisations are beyond the pale, that one should not be funding them and that their work is integrally tied up with terrorism and with terrorist attacks.  The response to both batches of information by virtually every country that has received this, has been that Israel&rsquo;s evidence is thin, that it is unconvincing, that it is not compelling, that the countries will not change their relationship with these organisations and that they will not stop the funding on the basis of the information that Israel has presented. <br\/><br\/>Last week, when I was in Geneva, I met with the director of Al-Haq.  If Israel had meant to finally impose the designation, he would not be able to travel.  If that designation ever did come to fruition, it would mean the instant banning of these organisations, the possible arrest and trial in military courts of the staff and the leadership of these organisations, as well as the probable freezing of all their funds.  Because most of the funds have to reach the organisations through some form of operation with the Israeli banking system, no funds could ever be transferred from Europe, from North America or from wherever else they would come to these organisations.<br\/><br\/>If that happened, it would cripple Palestinian civil society.  These organisations primarily focus their work on the occupation and on analysis of what they consider to be the gross violations associated with it.  Some of these organisations also do examinations with expected Palestinian leadership.  In any society in the world, there cannot be a strong, vibrant, democratic exchange of ideas in the way in Ireland and Canada are used to, if there is not a strong civil society.<br\/><br\/>For years there have been reports, including one of my early ones, that talk about this shrinking space for Palestinian, but also Israeli, civil society organisations that work on the occupation.  This is a matter of defence of their right to be able to do this work.  I think there are four Irish citizens who act as special rapporteurs.  Many members will know the name Mary Lawlor, who is the special rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders.  She has been sterling in her defence of the right of these Palestinian organisations to exist, to thrive and to make their reports as critical as possible.  That is one of Ireland&rsquo;s gifts to the broader world.<br\/><br\/>The Deputy&rsquo;s third question had to do with the 169 enclaves of Palestinian land that are separated from each other in the West Bank.  If I can extend the Deputy&rsquo;s question, these Palestinians in the West Bank are separated from each other.  They are also separated from the 360,000 Palestinians living in East Jerusalem by the separation wall.  They are separated from the 2.1 million Palestinians living in Gaza.  There is no other comparable situation in the modern world that I can think of - if members of the committee can think of one let me know - where a population is so divided and is so strategically fragmented by a ruling power in order to keep them separate from one another. <br\/><br\/>James Wolfensohn was the president of the World Bank in the late 1990s and in the early 2000s.  After he retired from the World Bank, he was appointed by the Quartet to be its special envoy in Jerusalem.  He said that there is no such thing as an operating economy where there is no freedom of individual and commercial movement.  He said that with specific reference to the Palestinian territory.  This strategic fragmentation, aside from the miracles of Zoom or virtual connection, means that Palestinians are increasingly not knowing each other, because they are separated from each other.  I have mentioned the separations within the Palestinian territory.  It also means that Palestinians are separated from one another with respect to the 1.6 million Palestinians living as Israeli citizens, as well as with respect to the 5 million to 10 million Palestinians who are living abroad, outside of Palestine and outside of the region itself.  This is not by accident.  This is not an incidental aspect of the occupation.  This has to be a grounding strategy to keep the Palestinians apart from one another so that their society will decay and their ability to develop strategic, political direction will also decay.  <br\/><br\/>The fourth thing the Deputy has raised is the issue of illegal occupation.  I thank him for that.  While all of his questions are very good, I am really glad that he has raised that particular position.  I mentioned in my opening remarks that was used by the Irish ambassador in late February in her remarks to the United Nations Security Council.  I point the Deputy to page 47 the joint committee&rsquo;s report from July 2021.  One of its recommendations, which I want to speak about for a minute, is that Ireland would support an International Court of Justice opinion on the illegality of the prolonged occupation and de facto annexation of the occupied Palestinian territory.  I had not realised that until today.  Again, I say an additional, &ldquo;Thank you&rdquo; to Ireland with respect to that.  <br\/><br\/>In one of my early reports, I think it was my third or fourth report back in 2017, I laid out the case and the argument that the Israeli occupation has now become illegal.  Most of the world thinks of Israeli occupation as lawful, albeit with some illegal aspects to it, via these settlements, to the annexation, to the wall and so on.  Since I released this report in the fall of 2017, I have been pushing for the United Nations General Assembly to adopt a resolution to seek a new advisory opinion to the International Court of Justice in The Hague.  This is in order to pose the question as to whether Israel's occupation has now become illegal.  Additionally, if it has become illegal, what legal consequences flow from that?  This will be one of the activities I will continue beyond the end of my mandate, in a private capacity.  I will try to see if we can gather bright international law thinkers and a coalition of the willing, who would lobby and push for this resolution to pass the General Assembly and then be put to the International Court of Justice.<\/p><p>If the International Court of Justice were to find that the occupation was illegal, it would substantially raise the stakes for the international community to break out of its political and diplomatic stupor and begin imposing the kinds of accountability measure that are needed and are indispensable to changing the tables on what is happening.<\/p><p> In light of the evidence in last year's report and what the Irish ambassador has said, I hope that Ireland sees itself as one of the leaders in Europe and, indeed, the world in pushing this forward.  This would be a tremendous advancement in diplomacy and a great mark that Ireland could leave in its remaining eight months on the Security Council.<\/p><p> The Deputy's fifth point had to do with the Amnesty report, the human rights report and my report.  He stated that they were all evidenced based and grounded in law, particularly international law.  He asked me whether those who refused to use the word \"apartheid\" were negligent.  I believe there is a compelling case to call this apartheid.  These reports have made that case.  I have simply piggybacked on them in terms of their analysis and evidence finding.  I hope that this accumulation of reports, which were issued within a two-year period, will change minds and that people will find it more difficult to avoid using the term.<\/p><p> I will make a confession that I have made several times this week in Ireland.  When I began my job six years ago, I said that I would not use the word \"apartheid\" because it would put people off and I would not be able to talk to diplomats or political decision makers.  For many reasons, and two compelling ones in particular, I was driven to this and I finally decided about a year ago that either my 11th report or my 12th and last report would have to address this question.  The first and foremost reason is that this occupation is being built with concrete, not wood.  International law demands that it be temporary and built with wood, yet there is nothing to indicate that it is being built with anything but reinforced steel and concrete.  It is meant to be permanent.  If there is to be a permanent occupation of the land, it means a permanent division of rights between those of your own people and those of the people you have to wind up subjugating.  If the committee can find for me a better word in the English language than \"apartheid\" to describe this, I will use it, but I have thought about this and cannot find one.<\/p><p> The second compelling reason is that, all of a sudden, the avalanche of reports from Palestinian, Israeli and international human rights organisations that the Deputy cited as well as people with esteem and respect in the world &ndash; the Desmond Tutus and Ban Ki-moons of the world &ndash; are now using this term.  Who am I to say that it cannot be used?  Let us think of the distance and time.  I was one year into my mandate &ndash; it was the spring or summer of 2017 &ndash; when the UN Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia, based in Beirut, commissioned and released a report on apartheid written by one of my predecessors, Professor Richard Falk, and an American professor, Professor Virginia Tilley.  That report was probably up on the UN website for a total of 48 hours before &ndash; I have to say this with regret &ndash; the UN Secretary-General ordered that it be taken down.  Five years later, my report is up and is staying up.  It has been widely read and widely cited in the weeks since its release.  This in itself shows that there is a different climate of opinion around this issue.  Let us hope that that continues.  Regarding those who the Deputy says are not using the word yet, let us hope that this avalanche of evidence and legal reasoning will be an incentive for them to use it.<\/p><p> Regarding the Deputy's sixth and final comment, this is something that has to be at the top of the agenda.  I do not know if he used this word, but the word I am using is \"accountability\".  Accountability is missing.  We are discussing a 55-year-old occupation imposed by a country with a population of a little more than 9 million people on 5 million other people and where Europe is the leading trading partner, with 40% of Israeli exports going to Europe.  Europe has so much power in this respect.  If Europe and the wider world can impose upon Russia, which is a country of 140 million people and a major nuclear quasi-superpower, crippling sanctions and accountability measures - beginning in 2014 and with much more ferocity now - over an invasion and violations of international law, why can that not be done in respect of Israel?  Israelis of conscience raise this issue constantly.  Nothing is going to change and break this \"paradise\" feeling unless and until the international community steps in with vigour and courage to get Israel to bring this situation into compliance with international law.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2022033100002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Professor S.

I am just saying that I will have to leave.<\/p> <p>  I welcome Professor Lynk and thank him for his presentation.  I have heard him speak at another forum.  He makes a lucid presentation.  People watching this meeting online should be cognisant of the fact that, apart from being a respected professor and academic, he is a UN-designated rapporteur.  People should understand that this is not something whimsical that he took on as a personal project.  He is the official UN rapporteur.  That gives extra weight to what he says and should make us conscious of his comments.  We should also be cognisant of how what he says tallies with our committee's report, which he kindly alluded to, and the recent Amnesty report.  All of that has to be factored in.<\/p> <p>  I wish to ask Professor Lynk some questions.  An issue arose in our report and has arisen again recently.  The figures around the illegal settlements are stark.  I will cite some from his report, which states that there have been 300 Jewish-only illegal civilian settlements since the occupation began and that 700,000 Israeli Jewish settlers are now living in East Jerusalem and the West Bank and apart from 3 million Palestinians.  In Gaza, which is a physically small area, there are 2 million Palestinians.  The report also quotes a former UK Prime Minister.  This backdrop is worth citing.  An issue that arose when our committee was working on its report was that the nature of the settlements was almost calculated to make it difficult to achieve our ambition of a two-state solution.  Does Professor Lynk believe that to be the case?  If a two-state solution is no longer achievable because of the nature of the settlements, what does he suggest can be done?  Would he suggest resettlements or other structures?  Now that the settlements are dotted throughout the occupied territories, it makes the creation of a two-state solution more difficult.<\/p> <p>  Professor Lynk used the term \"apartheid\", as did the Amnesty report, if I recall correctly.  He rationalised that on three bases.  Can he posit reasons for this not being accepted terminology for governments and internationally?<\/p><p>Why does Professor Lynk think officialdom does not interpret it that way?  Does he think it is political pressure in America or whatever?  Is it a question that there is a lacuna in the level of convincing of external sources?<\/p><p> I will mention a very concerning issue.  We are all very anxious to state that there is not a scintilla of anti-Semitism in anything we present or say.  There is not one of us who does not have an extraordinary consciousness of the horror, suffering and barbarism that was experienced by the Jewish people, notably at the time of the Second World War and immediately before but right through the ages at times.  We are conscious of that.  That guilt and remembrance is a big issue for us all collectively who want something done about what is wrong in the occupied territories.  That consciousness and guilt is a residual issue that very good people are affected by.  In fact, I would say colleagues of mine and all of us here, who are very good individuals, are affected because they live with the memory, horror and recognition.<\/p><p> Could Professor Lynk suggest anything to overcome that?  Does he think that is getting more contextualised now?  One thing I always attend if I am available is International Holocaust Remembrance Day.  The point I am trying to make is whether we can get ourselves to a point where that is put in context, understood and recognised by every remotely human individual or sensitive person.  The parallel with that, however, is that two wrongs do not make a right and we need to deal with the occupied territories.<\/p><p> Professor Lynk cited the former Attorney General of Israel making an article in the Irish newspapers.  The obvious greatest catalyst, as we are trying to achieve in Russia at the moment, would be internal pressure, if it could be arrived at, to get change.  Obviously, there is a moral duty and an imperative we cannot avoid for us, the UN and all bodies to deal with this as an international community.  Does Professor Lynk see anything bubbling up apart from the NGOs he cited, which are important?  Are they gaining more traction?  Is there any sign of internal opposition within Israel that would be the ultimate catalyst in getting a solution?  That is an interesting question.<\/p><p> I would like Professor Lynk to comment on something that occurred to me in recent days.  I feel very strongly about this issue and it is important.  Anyone who is on this committee is on it because he or she is concerned about issues like this one.  This is one is very serious.  Wonderful international solidarity has been exercised by the UN and the EU against the barbaric, illegal and wrong activities of Russia in Ukraine now.  There may come a degree post conflict and ultimately, please God, we hope we will live in a post-conflict world sooner rather than later, when maybe there will be confidence and solidarity in the world and we will start to move on to other areas of injustice.  This is a glaring area.  Does Professor Lynk think there is potential there?  Is that wishful thinking?  There might be potential for confidence in the world and a sort of almost policing role by international bodies, which will be enhanced if we are successful on this occasion.  Those are the thoughts of the committee.  There is no point nor is it helpful that I start chronicling the issues now.  We know them but this is to get Professor Lynk's response to those issues.  Again, I welcome him.  We cannot discuss this tragic situation often enough at this committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2022033100002#F00700","speaker":"1692","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648681200,"counter":947,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Joe O'Reilly.

The first question has to do with settlements.  If I understood the gist of the Senator's question, he asked in what way the settlements, of which there are 300 Israeli settlements with 700,000 plus settlers, stand in the way of a two-state solution and what the prospects are of a two-state solution.  I could easily say that this has pretty much obliterated the possibility of a two-state solution.  One of the worst things that can continue to happen is for those who pay attention to the Middle East and Israel and Palestine to continue to issue the rote statement that we want to do everything we can to preserve a two-state solution and get the parties back to the negotiating table.  If people are willing to continue to wave a cardboard wand or sword at Israel thinking that will be enough to stop the settlements and preserve the land the Palestinians and the world thought was going to be the land base for a genuine Palestinian state, then I am afraid we are engaged in self-deception with respect to this.<\/p> <p>  The settlements are the engine of the occupation.  They are there for two reasons.  One is to be able to establish the demographic facts on the ground to be able to create an illegitimate and unlawful sovereign claim for Israel to say this is its land and it is planting its flag on it.  The second reason is to be able to ensure there is no Palestinian state or if there is, it is a statelet that defies every definition-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2022033100002#G00500","nonspeaker":"Professor S.

I want to make it clear that a number of people have said there is no path to a two-state solution any more.  In 2013, as he was about to launch his then unsuccessful peace initiative, Mr. John Kerry, the then US Secretary of State, told the American Congress that the window for a two-state solution was only one year or two years, or it was over.  That was nine years ago.  UN Security Council Resolution 2334 in 2016 stated that Israel's settlement activities were \"dangerously imperilling the viability of the two-State solution based on the 1967 lines\".  The European Union has stated that the situation has devolved into \"a one-state reality of unequal rights\".  My final quote is again from Mr. Ban Ki-moon, who wrote in 2021 that \"Israel has pursued a policy of incremental de facto annexation in the territories it has occupied since 1967, to the point where the prospect of a two-state solution has all but vanished\".

The possibilities of wanting to remove 700,000 or a vast bulk of those 700,000 Israeli settlers is minimal.<\/p> <p>  A second solution would be what I would call a state-and-a-half solution, which is what the Trump plan was.  A little rump area of land in the middle of the West Bank where the major Palestinian cities are would be given to the Palestinians, all the rest of East Jerusalem and the West Bank would be annexed to Israel and Gaza would be left in its orphan state of 2 million people of a surplus population.  A third solution is one apartheid state, if you like, from the river to the sea, which is actually what I am now proclaiming has happened.<\/p><p>It does not matter, and this was made clear in the resolution from the D&aacute;il last year, whether there is a formal declaration of sovereignty over the land between the Jordan and the Mediterranean or it is continued <i>de facto<\/i>annexation.  Let me be clear as a lawyer - <i>de facto<\/i>annexation is just as illegal in international law as <i>de jure<\/i>annexation.  It is, in fact, a continuation of what it is now, without even the pretence of saying the Palestinians will have a state.  They may have municipal powers to collect garbage in Ramallah, to look after the streetlights in Hebron and to have a sewer line in Jenin, but that is all they will have.<br\/><br\/>The last solution would be a one-state, democratic, one-person-one-vote solution.  With the demographic parity between Israelis and Palestinians, the population today is 6.9 million Israeli Jews and 6.9 million Palestinian Arabs.  I do not know if many of the members know of Professor Avi Shlaim, an Israeli-Anglo professor of history who is now retired from the University of Oxford.  He said he believed in a two-state solution for a long time when it was possible.  He says he no longer believes in that because he is not going to tell himself fairy tales.  He asked what could be more consistent with 21st century values than a state that is democratic, believes in human rights and believes in the equality of everybody in the population.  What a one-state democratic solution would offer would be much more consistent with what I believe the world is moving towards in this century than any of the other solutions.<br\/><br\/>For a long time I believed that a two-state solution would be the best.  It would work because it would separate the populations and Palestinians would have a majority state where they would be able to rule.  However, Israel, its settlements and its encroachment have made a two-state solution impossible, unless one starts removing 500,000 to 700,000 Israeli Jews from settlements that have been established.  If one looks across the Israeli political spectrum from the centre through to the far right, two thirds of the seats in the 120-seat Knesset are controlled by parties that do not say there should be a Palestinian state.  It is not in their programme.  There have been four elections in Israel in the past two and a half years and the future of a Palestinian state was not part of any of the debates in any of the four elections, so I so not see that occurring.<br\/><br\/>The Senator asked a very timely question about anti-Semitism and the Holocaust, and it is an eternally timely question.  I will try to keep my answers short on this.  There are two different, separate lessons one can draw from the Holocaust.  One is that the brutality of the murder of 6 million European Jews means never again to Jews, or it can mean a more universal lesson of never again to anybody with respect to gross violations of human rights.  My view is that the best tribute we can pay to the victims of the Holocaust and all the victims of the Second World War and what happened afterwards is to enforce and entrench a regime of human rights everywhere in the world.  Professor Edward Said, the famous Palestinian-American, once said the Palestinians are the victims of the victims.  That is one of the most apt ways I can think of to describe that situation.  Jews in general, but Israeli Jews in particular, many of them coming from families that escaped the Holocaust, bear deep wounds, but Palestinians bear deep wounds as well.  Any type of compassionate peace that we will reach has to recognise addressing the deep wounds that both have, but also make sure that the final resolution is on the basis not of subjugation or domination but on the basis of some form of creative equality.<br\/><br\/>The fourth question has to do with accountability and I believe the Senator is asking me what we should be doing in this respect.  Israel will not change its position.  Perhaps I am repeating the answer I gave to the question from Deputy Brady in this regard.  International accountability is the prerequisite to get moving on change here.  There is no such thing as a diplomatic magic sauce that is going to bring a genuine durable solution that is acceptable to the Palestinians and the Israelis without pressure on Israel.  As long as Israel does not feel the cost of maintaining this type of occupation and as long as it faces no diplomatic cost, no trade cost or economic cost, I am afraid it is not going to be moving its policies with respect to this.<br\/><br\/>The International Committee of the Red Cross, the guardian of the four Geneva Conventions and a relatively conservative international organisation, has created a long list of acceptable sanctions and accountability measures that have long precedent in the world over the last 70 years to be applied to countries or organisations that step outside the international legal order.  If it can come up with sanctions such as limitations to or ends of arms sales, limitations to or ends with respect to trade deals and other forms of sanctioning of countries diplomatically or economically and those are acceptable methods in the modern world, they are acceptable in a method with respect to Israel.  I have heard the argument often used to me or anybody else that what we are really doing by raising these is attempting to delegitimise Israel, the only Jewish state.  What I and Israelis of conscience are trying to do is delegitimise an illegal occupation and to be able to bring about equality between them.<br\/><br\/>The final point the Senator raised, which is again a very good question, has to do with Ukraine.  The fact that we are now talking about international law, the breaches of international law and the swiftness with which we impose accountability measures on a country going rogue gives hope with regard to Israel and Palestine and that we will begin to make the necessary parallels between the two.  I am torn in that respect.  I have been around long enough to know that, in a positive way, George H. W. Bush in 1991, after the end of the first Iraq war and the removal of Iraq from Kuwait following its invasion and occupation, moved immediately to address the issue of Israel and Palestine by creating the Madrid process, which led to the Oslo process.  Sometimes turning points in history can wind up meaning something positive.  At least there was a formal recognition of the question of Palestine and the start of a peace process, however flawed.  However, I am also old enough and around long enough to know that sometimes history comes to a turning point and does not turn.  I would not be surprised if a year from now, if we have some type of resolution in respect of Russia and Ukraine, we have forgotten about the Palestinians again, unless and until something dramatic and awful happens again there.  That is why we need to keep the issue of accountability in mind.<br\/><br\/>I thank the Senator for his questions.

That is much appreciated.  Our actions to date have been commented on and that is good to know.  I accept Professor Lynk's definition of apartheid and his finding regarding apartheid.  He quoted a number of sources in respect of the definition of apartheid, but it is absolutely clear for anybody who wishes to know that Israel is practising apartheid in the occupied Palestinian territories.<\/p><p>Most of the questions I had intended to ask have already been posed.  I will zone in on one or two, however.  I am sorry if Professor Lynk has answered my first question but perhaps I did not hear the answer.<\/p><p>Why has the international community, in particular the European Union, not acted to date regarding this matter?  Ireland has joined with some EU member states to make different declarations and so on, and initiate various actions, but why has the EU not been stronger on this question?  If Professor Lynk wants, he can mention individual member states that may be holding up progress in that regard.  He has answered the question of what the international community should do; he mentioned the International Court of Justice and the question of sanctions.  Can anything else be done?  Are sanctions the main accountability measure that can be taken in this regard?  Professor Lynk answered the question about the two-state solution and stated that we have gone beyond the point of no return.  That is quite stark and certainly something that I will take on board arising from what he said, and what he quoted others as saying, regarding this matter.  He mentioned the four solutions and where we go from here.<\/p><p> On the basis it has not been asked - it may be the elephant in the room - what role has the US Administration to play in this regard?  Is that a problem, traditionally, regarding Palestine?  Has there been a significant change in emphasis following the election of President Biden?  In an earlier presentation this week, Professor Lynk ended on a hopeful note.  He quoted Seamus Heaney's \"hope and history rhyme\".  Is he still of that view later in the week?

I recognise the importance of time to the committee.  The Deputy has asked me four questions.  Why has the international community, particularly the EU, not acted with more resolve in defending the rules-based international order?  A lot of it has to do with the United States, quite frankly.  Europe bows or pays tribute to the United States by stating it will allow the US to take the lead on this.  As a result, we do not see a lot of sunlight between what the US does and what Europe winds up doing in respect of it.  I wish there was more independence, more imaginative diplomacy and more courage from the Europeans to separate themselves from the Unites States regarding policy towards Israel and Palestine.  The EU has brought in some small, tapered measures, especially as regards differential policies, that make sure the money it sends to Israel as part of various cultural or economic agreements does not go to the occupied Palestinian territories for the support of Israeli settlements.  However, it has barely begun putting labelling onto settlement goods, which is one of the tiniest of measures of retribution with respect to that.<br\/><br\/>Kofi Annan, in his 2012 memoir, <i>Interventions<\/i>, which I highly recommend to anybody, stated it is the excessive possessiveness of the United States - I believe those are his exact words - that has deterred the Security Council and the international community from taking the kinds of steps required to try to bring a successful resolution to Israel-Palestine, specifically to the Israeli 55-year-long occupation of Palestine.  That is agreed upon by a number of commentators.  If committee members looked at last year's op-ed by Ban Ki-moon, they will see he stated the same thing regarding the role of the US being that of retarding the ability to find a just and final solution consistent with the UN.<br\/><br\/>The Deputy asked what else can be done regarding accountability measures.  I state in the recommendations in several of my recent reports that it is important for international states, and I again particularly push this on Ireland, to be supportive of the ongoing investigations at the International Criminal Court in The Hague.  It is one of the few effective accountability measures currently in place.  Since the Palestinians joined the court in January 2015, backdated to June 2014, they have raised allegations of war crimes and crimes against humanity contrary to the Rome Statute, with respect to the wars in Gaza in 2014, 2018 and 2021.  Of course, they have also complained about the settlements, which are defined in the Rome Statute, and in Irish law when that statute was incorporated into it, as a war crime.  Legally speaking, that is very low-hanging fruit.  It is important for Ireland to be clear, consistent and regular in stating that it supports the ICC investigation of this, and that it hopes as the investigation goes on to the third and final stage, there will be litigation and trials with respect to this.<br\/><br\/>I would like to see Ireland state clearly that it supports the continuation of the UN database concerning businesses that have dealings in the occupied territories with Israeli corporations or with the settlements.  The settlement economy could not be nearly as successful as it is, if it was not for the regular international relationships it has formed with a number of international and Israeli companies in order to be able to lubricate itself.  If we start putting sand in the machinery that supports the Israeli settlement economy, it suddenly becomes much more costly for Israel to maintain its defiance of the international community.  As I said, if a new advisory opinion is going to the International Court of Justice, it would be wonderful for Ireland not only to support that but to be one of the leaders in seeking the support of the General Assembly and, if it reaches the International Court of Justice, to take a position and enter an argument with respect to that.<br\/><br\/>The Deputy asked me about the Biden Administration.  The Trump Administration that preceded it took four or five step backwards on the American position towards Israel and Palestine.  The Biden Administration has walked back two or three of those steps.  To its credit, it restored funding to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, UNRWA, and reopened a relationship of sorts with the Palestinian National Authority, but the latter's office in Washington is not yet open.  The Americans have not reopened the consulate in East Jerusalem closed by the Trump Administration.  The Biden Administration has not undone the recognition by the Trump Administration of the illegal annexation of the Golan Heights by Israel.  It has not undone the moving of the American Embassy to Jerusalem.  For any close observer, it is clear there is no desire by the Biden Administration to launch any kind of peace process on its watch.  Its major issue with respect to the Middle East is keeping its relationships with Israel and Saudi Arabia firm and ensuring that a new nuclear weapons control agreement is reached with Iran.  If Israel is able to keep the situation in the occupied Palestinian territories quiet, the US will not disturb this continued growth of settlements and the deepening entrenchment of the occupation. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2022033100002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Professor S.

I believe it was a recommendation of both the Human Rights Watch report and the Amnesty International report.  I claim no originality with respect to this, as long as the Deputy does not accuse me of plagiarism.<\/p> <p>  It was important to join these other reports and add this because the word \"apartheid\" to many people is an historical term.  It is thought we now find it only in the history books on southern Africa.  We have lost understanding of its definition, of how it can be practised and that it is not limited to southern Africa.  When the international community created the Rome Statute of 1998, it was a forward-looking document.  It was four years past the collapse of apartheid South Africa.  It was meant to apply in a forward-looking way anywhere apartheid winded up existing in the world.  The UN committee against apartheid had been around since the 1960s or 1970s and closed shop in the early or mid-1990s with the end of the final settler colonies in southern Africa that practised it.<\/p> <p>  To re-establish the committee would show the world's commitment to the recognition that apartheid can and, in at least one situation, does exist in the 21st century.  The committee, like the occupied territories Bill, may have the Palestinian occupied territories in mind as a lead example, but it is not the only example of where goods coming from occupied territories, or illegally coming from civilian settlements therein, can exist.  That is one of the beauties of the occupied territories Bill and it is the same thing with respect to the committee against apartheid.<\/p> <p>  The committee should be re-established and one of its features would be looking at the allegation that apartheid exists in the occupied Palestinian territories but it could look elsewhere as well.  I am not in a position to say in detail or with confidence where else it may exist but, if these ugly features of history can re-emerge to our surprise in the 21st century, it is possible that they exist elsewhere as well.  It is putting a stamp on the international community's expression of abhorrence that this still exists in the 21st century.

That Bill was brought in to have consequences for the illegal settlements and what is going on over there.

The way in which the EU operates as a legal system is very different from what I know and teach in respect of Canadian constitutional law.  I will not offer an opinion on this.  I would like to see it referred, as a legal and political matter, to find some way to end this stand-off.  If both sides are sincere in saying they believe in their respective opinion, either that Ireland can do this by itself, or cannot do it unless in conjunction with the European Union, then there must be a way for political creativity to be used to find an independent legal decision-maker to offer a comprehensive decision, whether \"Yea\" or \"Nay\", on these competing legal opinions.  The situation is unsatisfactory to me as an outside special rapporteur on such an important question on which Ireland has led in many other ways.<\/p> <p>  I thought when the occupied territories Bill was first introduced that it was a brilliant step forward in imposing accountability on a largely unaccountable occupation.  It has been taken through ten of the 12 steps in order to become law.  Those remaining couple of steps are preventing it having the impact of law.  I do not think the occupation would fall the day after Ireland passed that, but it would set a wonderful example for the rest of the world.  I will not stretch the committee's politeness in having me here by commenting on things Irish because I am commenting on its impact on the world.

If it is not in Irish competence to do it, then everybody knows they have to put their emphasis on Strasbourg and Brussels.  The value of passing a Bill like this would be a beacon to the rest of the world.  There is active discussion on a Bill modelled after the drafting in Ireland by the new Government in Chile.

Those of us who are old enough to remember all this will recall the League of Nations gave South Africa a mandate to govern Namibia until it reached a certain stage of civilisation.  Following the Second World War, after the League of Nations became the United Nations, South Africa began to introduce apartheid in Namibia and to treat Namibia as annexed territory, viewing it as its fifth province.  Two African countries that were in 1945 original members of the General Assembly, namely, Ethiopia and Liberia, brought a series of questions and advisory opinions from the General Assembly or Security Council to the International Court of Justice asking whether South Africa's continued rule as a mandate holder over Namibia was now illegal under international law.  The very clear answer, in one of the most determinative decisions ever issued by the International Court of Justice, was \"Yes&rdquo;.  In fact, the court used the term \"illegal occupation\" with respect to South Africa over Namibia.<\/p> <p>  That raised the stakes, although, of course, it took a further 19 years for Namibia to gain independence.  I do not think it would take that long if there were a declarative decision on an advisory opinion coming from the International Court of Justice in this context.

I do not doubt this will be difficult or that the United States will not be firmly opposed to having this issue litigated before the International Court of Justice.

While it has a symbolic measure, it would end up building on the tally of the approximately 135 states that have recognised the state of Palestine, that is, something like two thirds of the membership of the General Assembly, although very few are European states.  In fact, the only one I am aware of is Sweden.  I spoke to a Swedish diplomat who said Sweden had been told that if it went ahead first, it would crack the ice and other states would follow, but Sweden is still looking back for others to end up following.  Recognising the state of Palestine would, of course, be another important political statement with respect to the absolute necessity, insisted on by the world community, of ending this prolonged occupation.  Doing so should, therefore, form part of the foreign policy of any country that recognises what is going on in Israel and Palestine.<\/p> <p>  As for publishing the advice of the Attorney General, my advice, however simplistic, is that one way out of the stalemate could involve putting the issue before a respected, agreed-on legal decision maker.  That would require everybody to put forward their best legal arguments, including what the advice of the Attorney General has been.  Democracy breathes in sunshine, and this is one kind of issue on which we would want to see the Government putting forward its best argument.  While I have been getting my crash course in Irish politics this week, I have not encountered anybody who opposes the self-determination of the Palestinians, or who denies the harsh realities of the occupation or the fact this has become a one-state reality of unequal rights.  Nobody I have come across, among either Senators or Deputies, seems to disagree with that.  Accordingly, this reluctance strikes me as more of an unnecessary barrier to advancing even further with respect to an enlightened policy that will hasten the end of the occupation and the realisation of self-determination.

Senator Joe O'Reilly asked the question earlier on, and reference was made to the level of awareness that is bubbling up from society among the Israeli people as to what is happening.  As politicians, we note that we reflect our voters.  Will Professor Lynk speak to that level of awareness among the general population in Israel about what is happening in Palestine, as he described in his report, which, as I said at the outset, makes for harrowing reading.<\/p> <p>  The one-state solution that Professor Lynk mentioned, as one of his four alternatives, is quite radical in some ways.  I had not really heard this being put forward very strongly previously.  Professor Lynk indicated that a two-state solution seems now to not be really possible.  How would the special rapporteur see this one democratic State actually working?  Would it be acceptable by the Palestinian side?  Has it been discussed with them in any shape or form?  It looks attractive in theory but we know how difficult this kind of power-sharing can be.  There is a lot of hard work involved in that.<\/p> <p>  Senator Joe O'Reilly also asked about what governments accept \"apartheid\" as a term?  The term is used here in respect of what is happening in the Palestinian territory and so on.  Obviously, it was also used in Africa as we know in the past historical context.

I will keep my comments short on that.  It is impossible to look at photographs and pictures of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict without coming across pictures of the 18 m wall that the Israelis have built, 85% of which is within occupied Palestinian territory and which was pronounced upon by the International Court of Justice in 2004.  That wall not only keeps Palestinians out from being able to enter into Israel, as I have been told by Israeli colleagues and friends, it also keeps out Israeli imagination: they do not need to know what happens on the other side of the wall.  \"Us here and them there\" has become an attitude, but not among all Israelis.  There are lots of Israelis of conscience who are bothered deeply by the range of the conflict.<\/p> <p>  Let us look at the range of Israeli voting over the past four elections.  There were four elections between 2019 and 2021.  The parties that had a right or far-right agenda polled around two thirds of the seats, and it varied only within a couple of seats with each of these four elections that occurred.  While 20% of the Israeli population are Palestinian-Arab citizens of Israel, this voting range tells me that for the Israeli voting population and particularly the Israeli Jewish population they are content with the present situation and endorse the idea of keeping Palestinians in the West Bank isolated.  The way in which a significant number of Israelis wind up interacting with Palestinians since the wall was built more than 20 years ago are as military.  In other words, in the form of military as soldiers.  Virtually most Israelis between the ages of 18 and 21 are conscripted for three years to serve in the Israeli army.  It is impossible to be able to be a soldier guarding a checkpoint and deciding to allow one car through every 20 minutes, carrying out night raids on refugee camps or arresting children in Hebron without thinking that the population you are governing and ruling over as a military power are somewhat lesser then you.  It is going to take a long time to break down those kinds of impressions that Palestinians have of Israelis, which is defined by the occupation and is incomplete, and the impressions that Israelis have of Palestinians, which is defined by their domination of the Palestinians but which is also incomplete.  We have a system that encourages stereotypical views of Jews by Palestinians, and views of Palestinians by Jews.<\/p> <p>  On the Chairman's comment about the one-state solution, and how it would work, this would be the kind of task that creative constitutional minds would wind up working on.  On the positive side we have a number of positive examples of how multinational States have worked with some success.  It is not without difficulty.  I come from a multinational State that is not only French and English but now also recognises the nationhood of our indigenous peoples.  It is not an easy country to govern but we have done it largely through solid democratic institutions that have wound up building trust by everybody, and where there is a sense of accommodation in that regard. Belgians do it, with some difficulty, the Swiss do it with some difficulty, but we can see that it is certainly becoming more catastrophic in multinational countries such as Sri Lanka or India.  These are possible, however, and even though there are those who throw their hands up and say it is impossible to have a one-state solution with Israelis and Palestinians, each having a single vote and living as equals, that is in theory a much better starting point than what exists now or even what is proposed around domination.<\/p> <p>  I am not sure I entirely caught the Chairman's third question.  It had to do with apartheid elsewhere.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2022033100002#M00300","nonspeaker":"Professor S.

Although domestic, sexual and gender-based violence was not initially included in the Oireachtas resolution, once it was given due consideration the assembly, through its recommendations, conveyed why DSGBV is a gender equality issue.<br\/><br\/>In the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre we aim to prevent the harm and heal the trauma of all forms of sexual violence.  We provide services, including running the national 24-hour helpline, one-to-one therapeutic counselling and support for victim-survivors; accompaniment to those attending sexual assault treatment units, Garda stations and court; and education, training and advice to a wide range of people.  In addition, we use our expertise and experience to provide reports, analysis and policy proposals to those tasked with action on behalf of victim-survivors of sexual violence.  Through our work in the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre we see first-hand the lifelong consequences of the trauma and harm caused by sexual violence of all kinds.  These serious consequences negatively impact health, family, relationships, social well-being, education and work.<br\/><br\/>In 2020, as in previous years, about 80% of those who contacted the national 24-hour helpline were women and about 90% of those who availed of our therapeutic services were women.  While sexual violence is no respecter of gender and while the power imbalance in relationships can impact on all genders, the impact of sexual violence on women as a gender is disproportionate to their representation in the population.<br\/><br\/>I turn our attention to the assembly&rsquo;s specific recommendations.  In response to recommendation No. 37, Dublin Rape Crisis Centre welcomes the recent announcement by the Minister, Deputy McEntee, of the establishment of a new statutory agency to oversee the implementation of the Government&rsquo;s approach to tackling domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.  To achieve this, the governing legislation of the new agency must have sufficient reach and power to ensure an integrated cross-departmental response will be adopted.  We are still some 12 to 18 months away from that agency taking charge.  In the years it will take the new domestic, sexual and gender-based violence agency to be built, an <i>ad hoc<\/i>agency should be established to ensure there is no risk of sidelining the work in this sector.<br\/><br\/>In regard to recommendation No. 38, we agree it is essential to promote awareness through campaigns and education, and to ensure the public is fully informed of the various forms of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.  The Istanbul Convention obliges governments to promote and conduct awareness-raising campaigns in conjunction with civil society organisations.  Awareness, prevention and education campaigns aimed at eliminating the tolerance of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence in society must be both inclusive and accessible by all.  The real consent study, commissioned by Dublin Rape Crisis Centre, is the first national study of its kind to examine attitudes to and an understanding of sexual consent in Ireland across all adult age groups.  A collaborative campaign now under way in Dublin Rape Crisis Centre is grounded in equality and will lead to a deeper understanding of consent, the impact of gender inequality on sexual violence, and the impact of sexual violence on survivors and their communities.<br\/><br\/>In regard to recommendation No. 39, the assembly identified five specific areas in which to support justice for victim-survivors.  In respect of the review and reform of the courts system, the credibility and reputation of the complainant in sexual offences cases is regularly the main focus of the defence of an accused person.  Thus, harmful stereotypes about how a person looked or dressed can influence how an investigation and trial proceeds.  This in turn means that victim-survivors of sexual violence may be reluctant to access appropriate remedies in our legal and justice system.  It is vital that legal professionals, including the Judiciary, working within sexual offence trials receive appropriate and ongoing training on best practice in the treatment of victim-survivors.<br\/><br\/>Regarding the development of guidelines and specialist training for judges and lawyers, issues surrounding the disclosure of victim-survivors&rsquo; counselling records is now a feature of many sexual offence trials and only sexual offence trials.  In the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act, a regime to regulate disclosure of counselling records was introduced for the first time.  However, many victim-survivors waive the application of this scheme and permit disclosure of their counselling records without going through the process.  This waiver provision has significantly undermined the potential of the new regime for disclosure of counselling records to protect victim-survivors from being questioned about private matters within their counselling notes.  The recommendations put forward by the assembly in regard to excluding counselling records in cases is one with which we in the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre are firmly in agreement.<\/p><p>In 2009, research was undertaken on behalf of the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre, which was based on an analysis of 40 rape cases tried in the Central Criminal Court between 2003 and 2009.  The study showed that judges granted defence application to introduce evidence about the sexual history of rape victims pursuant to section 3 of the Criminal Law (Rape) Act 1981 very frequently, despite the highly prejudicial nature of the reasons being offered by the defence.  One commonly used defence argument was that the victim-survivor was promiscuous.  This sort of argument, unfortunately, strengthens myths about rape and has the potential to undermine the victim-survivor's evidence in court.  Such unnecessarily aggressive cross-examination and the introduction of evidence of victim-survivor's sexual history, results in an unduly traumatic court experience for victims.  The trial judges who preside over sexual offence trials and the legal professionals who prosecute and defend these cases play a vital role in ensuring fair treatment of victim-survivors while they give their testimony.  Thus, it is vital that any judge or legal professional working within these trials have received appropriate training on key concepts such as, but not limited to, consent, rape myths, and unconscious bias.<br\/><br\/>Regarding the introduction of tougher sentences, one of the things that victim-survivors want to know when they engage in the criminal justice process is what the outcome is likely to be.  They will of course know that the defendant may be acquitted or convicted.  However, in the absence of sentencing guidelines and a sentencing database, it is hard for them to know the consequences of a conviction.  Report 1 of the sentencing guidelines and information committee of the Judicial Council of Ireland states that sentencing data in Ireland still has profound limitations.  The sentencing database known as the Irish Sentencing Information System, ISIS, needs to be reinstated and resourced.<br\/><br\/>No one size fits all in regard to specialised confidential healthcare and other support services, but our experience as a rape crisis centre of more than 40 years highlights that decent, proper services must be conceived in a victim-survivor-centred way so that those delivering the services are trained and understand the emotional, traumatic impact of sexual assault and harassment, preferably in specialist services where they do not have to keep reporting and reliving the sexual assault again and again.  This is particularly true for children and especially vulnerable people.  In addition, services must be available in a timely way, be that healthcare or counselling within a short timeframe or getting a case to court within a reasonable timeframe.<br\/><br\/>The Dublin Rape Crisis Centre, along with member organisation of the Victims' Rights Alliance, VRA, has long been lobbying for the establishment of a victim-survivors' commissioner who is dedicated to protecting and upholding the rights of victims.  The appointment of a dedicated commissioner for victim-survivors of crime would ensure their voices and experiences were at the forefront of decision-making, in addition to proactively shaping a balanced and fair criminal justice system.<br\/><br\/>In response to recommendation 40, we must also consider the need for shelters and accommodation for victims of trafficking for sexual exploitation.  Trafficked women recovering from sexual exploitation need safe and appropriate shelter and accommodation that recognises and treats them as victims of human trafficking and victims of violence against women.<br\/><br\/>Through its comprehensive recommendations, the assembly has highlighted how much remains to be done, but it also offers a clear pathway for achieving a much more equitable society, including one that is free from gender-based violence.  The words used by the assembly in its open letter to the Oireachtas are striking and very clear:<\/p><blockquote>\tThere is no place in our society for gender-based violence.  We support the aspiration of the Istanbul Convention to create a Europe free from violence against women and all forms of domestic violence.

I also thank the Deputies and Senators.  I am delighted to be here on behalf of Rape Crisis Network Ireland.  We endorse almost everything that Ms Scott has just spoken about in detail.  I do not propose to repeat what she said.  I want to focus on what is important and additional about looking at domestic, sexual and gender-based violence, DSGBV, through the lens of gender equality in particular because, for once, it is quite a busy landscape.  The national strategy is imminent.  The audit to which the Government committed has been conducted and is being woven into the national strategy and there are significant changes coming.  In sexual violence terms, we also have the public outcry around the Belfast rape trial.  We have the O'Malley report and Supporting a Victim's Journey and a significant number of other undertakings are in motion.<\/p> <p>  What is it about gender equality and what is the reason that the citizens' assembly focused in on this issue?  We should not take it for granted that we are here today.  We were not on the agenda for the assembly to begin with.  That was a hard-fought conversation to add DSGBV on to the agenda of the assembly.  That linkage between gender inequality and domestic, sexual and gender-based violence is not something we should take for granted.  That was an argument that was made and that was won, but it is one that we can lose again.  We are very grateful to be here today, and we are very grateful for the attention that the citizens paid to this issue in their deliberations.  The reason I say it is important is that for us, and it comes through in all of the submissions that the DSGBV organisations made, we all understand that this type of violence is both cause and effect of gender inequality.  It is impossible to talk about it, address it and to mitigate against gender inequality unless we talk about the violence that supports it.  That violence is primarily in the area of domestic and sexual violence.  That is why that focus is critical, because it gets that prevention and the long-term prevention and if we are not connecting those two, we are not connecting the dots.<\/p> <p>  We are also doing a piece of incrementalism without looking at structures.  In terms of gender inequality, that big structural cultural change needs to happen for the long-term sustainable changes that we are all looking for here.  The first place we go to when we talk about that sort of cultural change in terms of gender inequality and DSGBV is our culture and society, which brings us to focus in on children and the largest institution we have engaged in the reproduction of our culture, if one likes, which is our education system, as it gets loaded with this task over and over again.  That is the location where we have that capacity.  The citizens' assembly made a number of recommendations regarding our education system and the curriculum and what is happening in the system.  We endorse those but we also add the political choices that are made because this is a space of activity as well.  A new curriculum is being written as we speak.  That has been a long journey, but we will see the new curriculum imminently.  There are a number of things that we are concerned about and we must pay attention to them.  What I mean is that it requires us to stay actively engaged and actively attentive to what is happening, for example, in informing the curriculum within schools and how that is meant to create the change we are looking for in gender equality.<\/p> <p>  One of the areas that needs attention in the curriculum is where we lose the aspects that are about the structure of how sexual violence is the violence that supports gender equality.  What I mean by that is sometimes we end up not talking about issues such as sexual exploitation, pornography, prostitution and we need to add to the list today.  We have rehearsed the list a few times and we need to add to it the normalisation of violence and begin to talk about it, in particular men's violence against women in normal sexual activity where sexual violence is now a function of sexual pleasure and that having become normalised in our culture in how we understand sexual violence.<\/p><p>Unless we are talking about those aspects of the structure of misogyny, we will not be dealing with gender equality in our curriculum.  For much of our curriculum, many important, powerful tools have been developed that focus on individuals' self-development.  While these are incredibly important and progress should be made on them, we should also pay attention to when structure and misogyny fall off the table and when we essentially move the labour of the prevention of sexual violence on to individuals, particularly individual children, essentially recycling the cultural message that we have given people the tools and that they should now go out and not get raped.  That is essentially the cycle we will be repeating if we do not talk about gender equality as a structure of violence.<\/p><p> I believe I have exceeded my time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022033100002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Cl&iacute;ona Saidl&eacute;ar","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648681200,"counter":993,"content":"<p>It has been a great intervention.

However, I fully endorse the statements just made by my colleagues in Dublin Rape Crisis Centre and Rape Crisis Network Ireland.<br\/><br\/>With respect to recommendation 38, Women's Aid appreciates that the draft third national strategy on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence includes important actions on healthy relationships and education at all formal educational levels, as suggested in recommendation 27 of the Citizens' Assembly, as well as actions on delivering awareness-raising and prevention campaigns on gender-based violence for the general public.  We believe that, as per recommendation 38, specific prevention campaigns<b><\/b>targeting young people should also be carried out.  These should be based on research and collaboration with young people to make them relevant to them and hopefully more effective than general campaigns.<br\/><br\/>Any awareness, prevention and education campaigns mentioned in this recommendation should include a specific focus on young people's dating relationships and be informed by the social context of gender inequalities and negative gendered stereotypes, which have to be redressed to effectively combat the gendered nature of much dating abuse itself.  The careful crafting of campaigns to prevent gender-based violence in young people's relationships will also contribute to accelerated gender equality among younger generations.<br\/><br\/>Intimate partner violence is often publicly framed as an issue for established married or cohabiting couples, or as an issue that does not really impact very much on young people and their dating or intimate relationships.  However, a recent WHO global prevalence review has found that intimate partner violence starts early, with 24% of women aged between 15 and 19 years having already experienced physical or sexual violence, or both, by an intimate partner.  Women's Aid has been active on this issue for several years.<br\/><br\/>Too Into You is a national public awareness campaign aimed, since 2011, at raising awareness of intimate relationship abuse against young women aged between 18 and 25.  As part of this work, we have commissioned two national research studies with young people over the last two years.  What we have found in this research is extremely troubling.  One in five young women, compared with one in 11 young men, has suffered intimate relationship abuse by a male partner.  Of the young women who had suffered abuse, 50% had been targeted through online abuse, 75% had been subjected to sexual coercion by a male partner, and one in three had never spoken to anyone about the abuse suffered.  A particular concern is that 50% of the young women affected were abused by a male partner or ex-partner when under the age of 18.<b><\/b>Unfortunately, very little has been done in Ireland to date to understand and address dating violence in this young age cohort.<br\/><br\/><b><\/b>In our 2021 research report, we identified the need for more work to be done with young people on their awareness and understanding of intimate relationship abuse, as well as on how to be an ally and support to peers.<b><\/b>We need to raise awareness and challenge and disrupt abusive behaviour early before it becomes acceptable and normalised for both victims and perpetrators alike in relationships.<b><\/b>We must support young people's desire to support their friends who experience abuse and give them the knowledge and confidence to do so safely and effectively.  We have to support all young people, particularly young men, with knowledge and tools to foster healthy egalitarian behaviours in friendships and intimate relationships, and enhance their abilities to initiate positive, respectful relationships with healthy mutual intimacy.<br\/><br\/>Women's Aid strongly agrees with recommendation 39, on supporting justice for victims and survivors, and all the five actions outlined.  In our experience, access to justice for victims of domestic abuse, including coercive control, continues to be problematic, both in the family courts and criminal courts.  Article 31 of the Istanbul Convention requires that domestic abuse be taken into account when determining custody and access, and that these arrangements be safe for children and the non-abusive parent.  Unfortunately, this is not always the case in Ireland.<br\/><br\/>The Government is currently doing important work on family law, including establishing a dedicated family law court, developing the family courts Bill and developing a family justice strategy.  Women's Aid believes that in order to be successful, any reform of the family courts must be designed with the safety of victims of domestic violence, including children, at its heart, with the latter actively consulted.  We need adequate training for all stakeholders in the family courts, including expert reporters themselves, on the reality and impacts of coercive control, greater regulation, accessibility and transparency of child welfare reports.<br\/><br\/>There is a concerning disconnect between the family and criminal courts: in cases of domestic violence and child abuse, these courts may deal with the same families but do not work together to protect women and children from an abusive partner or father.  There is an urgent need to improve co-ordination and linkages between family courts, criminal courts and child protection, ensuring the voice of the child is heard, improving eligibility for legal aid, and developing models for screening, fast-tracking and risk-assessing domestic abuse and child abuse cases.<br\/><br\/>There can be an assumption in the family courts that abuse ends with separation, but in many cases the reverse is true.  Abuse can continue and even escalate after separation, which is a particularly hazardous time for women and children in the context of domestic abuse and coercive control.  We hear of cases in which a history of domestic abuse, including convictions for criminal offences against the mother, is minimised, ignored or dismissed in custody and access proceedings as a separate matter.<br\/><br\/>In the criminal justice system, unfortunately we also know that this often fails survivors of domestic abuse.  Our research in 2019 found that for the majority of women surveyed, the criminal justice system did not provide adequate justice or increase their feelings of safety.  Sadly, most of the women interviewed said they would not, or were unsure if they would, go through the process again, including in cases where a conviction was obtained against their partner.  There is a need to redesign the court process, without prejudicing the rights of the accused to a fair hearing, to minimise delays and adjournments and put at its centre the victim's safety and recovery.<br\/><br\/>A review of how the criminal justice system responds to victims of domestic abuse is long overdue.  It should account for the need for improved data systems that could give visibility on sentencing levels where the perpetrator is a current or former partner.  The work by the Department of Justice in Supporting a Victim's Journey presents a very promising model for victim-centred reform that will also benefit victims of domestic violence and abuse who have suffered sexual abuse by a partner.  It must ensure the specific dynamics and broader relationships and stakes that may be in play where the perpetrator is a current or former partner of the victim are accounted for in all criminal cases.<\/p><p>Women&rsquo;s Aid also supports the establishment of a victims' or survivors' commissioner as an independent advocate and voice for victims and survivors.<\/p><p> On recommendation 40, Women&rsquo;s Aid welcomes this recommendation, and we are pleased to note that it has been included in the third national strategy on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence, DSGBV, with commitments to develop strategic accommodation solutions in conjunction with the recommendations from the Tusla review of emergency accommodation.  Additional to overall bed spaces, however, one of the reasons refuges are full, is because there is not enough movement on accommodation.  There are challenges with accessing local authority housing and a housing crisis that makes finding a home in the Irish market extremely difficult.  We need to do more than build refuges and give victims of domestic violence and abuse the option of remaining safely in their own homes with specialist support.  We need to make clear the link between domestic violence and homelessness and to include a medium- and long-term accommodation action specifically for victims of domestic violence and abuse in the national Housing for All strategy.  <\/p><p> I will finish by touching very briefly on recommendation 24 which, while not being in the gender-based violence strategy category, is extremely relevant.  Domestic abuse and stalking are not confined to the real world but increasingly also happen in the virtual world.  Women and girls disproportionately experience severe kinds of cyber-harassment, including cyber-stalking, online sexual harassment and image-based sexual abuse.  While image-based sexual abuse has been made illegal in the Harassment, Harmful Communications and Related Offences Act there is still no efficient way to have image-based sexual abuse content removed from the Internet quickly.  It is essential that this content is removed quickly before it can go viral and therefore this removal has to happen independently of any criminal proceedings.  Women&rsquo;s Aid has been calling for swift take-down orders, particularly for image-based sexual abuse, as opposed to the protracted mechanisms that are currently proposed to be included in the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill.  We believe this is necessary as a tool to combat the devastating consequences of this form of gender-based violence.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022033100002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Sarah Benson","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648681200,"counter":996,"content":"<p>I would like to thank the committee again for the opportunity to present today on these important matters.  I am very happy to take any questions.<\/p> <p>  I thank our three witnesses and stakeholders.  We appreciate their clear and concise presentations to us.  We appreciate the benefit of their expertise and their experience on this issue.  I acknowledge that we are discussing recommendations 37 to 41 on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.  We on this committee have taken the view that the Citizens&rsquo; Assembly has provided us with a superb blueprint for achieving gender equality.  Our focus as a committee is on how to implement those recommendations.  We see ourselves as forming a bridge between the recommendations and their being put into effect.  We aim to recommend to Government an action plan to take those into effect.  Our questions and our engagement with stakeholders are on that practical basis.  We are conscious that members of the Citizens&rsquo; Assembly are engaging with us online as well, which we are delighted about.   For the information of witnesses, I will also say that we will meet with other stakeholders on these recommendations next week.  We will then hear from the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, on 28 April, at our next meeting after Easter.  At this point she will have published the next strategy on DSGBV.  We will speak with her about how its implementation will take further those recommendations, in particular, 37 to 41.  We are grateful to all witnesses also for touching on other recommendations that have a bearing on gender-based violence.  We are grateful for putting a clear gender lens on this pervasive issue.  As the witnesses have said, it is an issue that has come to the fore particularly with the horrific murder of Ashling Murphy, as well as with other recent events as the witnesses described.  We are very grateful to the witnesses again.  <\/p> <p>  I will now ask for questions from members for engagement with the stakeholders.

I would like to see it rolled out more intensely in some areas where the need for it has been identified.  Ms Benson spoke of integrating the research campaigns that groups such as Women&rsquo;s Aid have done.  Does she think that the third national strategy to combat domestic sexual and gender-based violence contains adequate measures, based on the research that Women&rsquo;s Aid has done?  In other words, is Women&rsquo;s Aid seeing the research that it has undertaken and published being reflected in the new strategy that is being brought forward?  If not, are there other areas that need attention?<\/p> <p>  I have a question for Women&rsquo;s Aid on the recommendation.

It should not be used in any shape or form to further damage or to further traumatise any individual.  We have to recognise that the end of a relationship does not signify the end of abuse.  I have spoken with individuals who have told me that they have been advised to be extra careful and extra vigilant after the relationship has ended.  This is because most perpetrators&rsquo; actions will increase at that point.  Now that Ireland has ratified the convention and now that there is a legal obligation to uphold its provisions, is it the view of Women&rsquo;s Aid that further legislation is required to ensure that that abuse is taken into account when determining custody and access?  How do we take the Istanbul Convention and implement it into our legal system to ensure that it is not used to re-traumatise, to re-injure or re-damage people?<\/p> <p>  I have two brief questions about the O'Malley review and to the Judicial Council.  Are the witnesses of the opinion that the pace of implementation of the O'Malley review is sufficient?  Are there areas that need to be expedited?  What engagements have the witnesses had as organisations with the Judicial Council in relation to the shortfalls that exist in the courts at the moment? <\/p> <p>  Finally, I have one specific question for the representatives of the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre.  They spoke of survivors&rsquo; and victims&rsquo; counselling records being brought before the court, as well as the waiver.  These are very personal records.  They are records of meetings where trauma will be disclosed and where harm is being disclosed.  The ultimate object of those counselling sessions is healing.  Can the Rape Crisis Centre explain the usual outcome for people in court, arising from the decision, in view of the fact that the 2017 Act needs to be amended for the purpose of excluding counselling records from court cases?  I ask this because one of the concerns that I have is when people seek counselling it is based on an event that has happened in their life.  For that counselling to be as effective as it can be, there must be full and open disclosure in the process.  If there is the potential for that to be brought before the court, are we creating a situation whereby those who want to heal and those who are seeking support are less likely to engage in a process, because they know that the information could at future dates be brought before a court?  They are thereby being re-traumatised by going to court.  As well as this, they are not getting the maximum benefit from the counselling, for fear that it will eventually be brought before a court.  It therefore creates a circular system whereby no full healing can take place at the end of it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022033100002#E00700","speaker":"1495"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648681200,"counter":1002,"content":"<p>I will try to be succinct.

We also had the benefit of an additional consultation.  We await with particular interest the implementation plan, which will be published alongside it.  There is material in there that may be sufficient, although that depends on how it is interpreted in the implementation plan.  There are a number of welcome inclusions in this strategy, which had been completely omitted from previous strategies.  This is particularly the case for the area of prevention.  There is an explicit acknowledgement of looking at the impact of looking at pornography, for example, particularly on young boys.  This is extremely welcome.<\/p><p>There is a direct acknowledgement of the need to connect with policies like the anti-bullying strategy, which is currently under review.  I am one of several representatives on the steering committee for that.  There is the opportunity there to do the kind of fundamental structural work that Dr. Saidl&eacute;ar referred to, regarding identifying a baseline of a gender-unequal society and then looking at it in an intersectional way, where there is additional discrimination, prejudice and vulnerability that may be due to sexuality, gender identity, race or ethnicity.  The baseline, however, is the gender-unequal society.  Unfortunately, so far, many of our strategies that can directly influence better outcomes for gender equality start with this gender-neutral position.  This kind of signposting is valuable because it gives us the mandate to continue to press for recognising, with our eyes open, that this is the society we are now born into and this is the incremental work under way.  There is also the commitment with the relationships and sexuality education, RSE.<br\/><br\/>Therefore, there are tools to work with.  There have, however, been missed opportunities concerning looking sensitively and carefully at prevalence data regarding the intersection in this regard.  Our research survey of 18 to 25-year-olds added retroactive questions, which told us that of the one-fifth of young women who were abused by the age of 25, that 51% of them had been underage.  That process involves interviewing women for whom that is an experience of some years past.  The real situation currently, therefore, requires indepth studies and that can dovetail with the likes of the anti-bullying strategy, where there is an urgent need to consider not just the modes of bullying, because there is focus on cyberbullying, etc., but also the content, in respect of who is targeted and what is the underlying focus.  Is it sexist, is it sexual harassment or is it racist?  There are great opportunities there, which, hopefully, will be followed through.<br\/><br\/>Regarding the family law courts, recommendation 39 and whether legislation is required, I do not know that legislation is necessarily required, because we already have legislation in this regard that we are not really meeting our obligations on, such as on the voice of the child, for example.  The Domestic Violence Act 2018 had guidance to say that where a crime is committed against somebody and the relationship is one where that person is a current or former partner, that should be considered an aggravating and not mitigating factor.  Regarding our experience with the courts, research is under way, funded by the Department of Justice, to examine the siloing effect and disconnect between the criminal courts and the family law courts.  We must explore if there are ways to resolve that.  There is also inconsistency in this context, where matters in criminal proceedings are, in some cases, allowed to be heard in <i>in camera<\/i>proceedings, but the existence of a safety order in place is not.  What is involved here is guidance and structures, and part of addressing that issue would examine whether legislation is required or only procedures and guidance.<br\/><br\/>We must also look at the issue of the real lack of understanding of what coercive control is.  I refer specifically to custody and access.  A great body of research shows that if coercive control is being exerted against an adult member of the household, the non-abusing parent,<i>de facto<\/i>, then that it is also being exerted against children.  Often, it is being done to further target and harm the adult, but it is also very damaging and harmful to the children.  This point is not well understood, and it should be an assumption that if there is abuse against the mother in that situation, that the children, by virtue of being in that environment, are not witnesses.  They are also victims and survivors, and that is not being well understood.  Now that we have the legislation on coercive control, it supports a mindset shift to look not at single acts of violence, criminal damage or threats, but at the pattern of such behaviour.  Further work remains to be done in this regard.<br\/><br\/>There was also a question about the Judicial Council.  I am pleased to say we have had contact with the council specifically on the understanding of coercive control and how that can show up in the family law courts.  We are collaborating with the Judicial Council on supporting an input as part of its mandate to initiate and then invest in peer-to-peer training on how coercive control can show up.  I am pleased to note that.  I commend the director who has been appointed, Judge Mary Rose Gearty, on her leadership on this endeavour.  I understand the Judicial Council is now getting greater resources to drive this initiative forward.  I also acknowledge there is a gap here in this regard compared to many other jurisdictions in that we do not have a judicial training college.  Even Northern Ireland has such a college, but we do not.  Extensive work is being done from a baseline of limited structures to facilitate this initiative, and we are optimistic that there is more work to be done in this regard as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022033100002#E01000","speaker":"1495","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648681200,"counter":1006,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Benson, and I should have explained we have a time limit on contributions to ensure everybody can get in.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022033100002#F00200","speaker":"1698"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648681200,"counter":1007,"content":"<p>My apologies.

How we get this right is a subject of key interest not just to the committee but to the Government and to society more broadly.  Returning to what Ms Benson was talking about regarding coercive control in the context of the family law courts, I will give two quick examples from my constituency clinic on Friday to illustrate how much this issue affects people.  This speaks to court processes, how they can minimise ongoing coercive control, or at least be aware it is happening, and how we can change that context.  The first lady I spoke to in my clinic is separated and has children at home.  She cannot get agreement on anything from her ex-partner.  I refer to the reality of that situation.  She cannot progress to the next stage until her ex-partner has put in his affidavit.  It means she cannot get anywhere in accessing therapeutic supports for her children, getting agreement on play therapy, or anything else like that.  Therefore, everything Ms Benson is saying about the impact of ongoing abuse on individuals and families is real.  It arises as an issue in everybody's constituency clinic, as it was in mine on Friday.  One of the first subjects I raised in the D&aacute;il in my maiden speech was the impact of court processes and how they can either contribute to and facilitate ongoing coercive control or how they can try to limit it.  I would like to hear the witnesses' views on that aspect.<\/p> <p>  The other side of this matter is the enforcement of court orders.  Crucially, this relates to maintenance.  Better proposals have been made regarding a different way to manage this aspect to try to surmount the issue of the enforcement of court orders.  I refer as well to the enforcement of court orders on access, which is just as important in respect of children being able to have relationships with both parents, where those are good and positive relationships, as many of them will be.  <\/p> <p>  Specifically, how do we get into the court processes?  Is it through the District Court and Circuit Court rules?  In the context of the conversations being had with the Judiciary, how can we get to that level of granularity concerning the impact of the timing of the filing of different documents and how that affects everything else, as well as how we can put in place systems that overcome the worst in people, whether they are unwilling to engage or whether the court system allows a case to drift?  How can we introduce structures that do not enable that sort of ongoing abuse through simply not co-operating with the rules of the courts as they stand?  How can we introduce limits in this regard, especially on time, and how might that contribute to catching this type of behaviour more tightly from courts' perspective?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022033100002#F00500","speaker":"1480"},{"type":"speech","time":1648681200,"counter":1010,"content":"<p>This question is one for Ms Benson to answer briefly, and then we will go to Dr. Saidl&eacute;ar and Ms Scott.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022033100002#F00600","speaker":"1698"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648681200,"counter":1011,"content":"<p>On parental consent, the RCNI can deal with that subject on behalf of several agencies that have concerns in this area.  Turning to court orders, regarding safety and protective orders, serious concern is emerging around the lag in this regard and the lack of a clear, defined structure and relationship between the courts and the Garda in respect of serving such orders.  A legal precedent is now emerging, which was not there before, where breaches of orders are being challenged if those orders were not served by a Garda.

Women's Aid, along with many of our colleagues in the family and child organisations, strongly endorses the establishment of a separate maintenance structure that lifts responsibility out of the courts, makes it less adversarial and takes away from the victim responsibility to pursue maintenance or, where there are breaches of maintenance orders, the obligation to keep going back to court.  This has very real-life consequences for applications for means-tested social welfare benefits.  I highlight this as something at an advanced stage of review.

Women's Aid and the Rape Crisis Network Ireland work together with a number of NGOs and we are particularly concerned about how family law courts, in particular private family law courts, intersect with domestic and sexual violence.  We are concerned based on what is coming to us with regard to sexual violence but is anecdotal and this is a problem.  Committee members have spoken about the issues that come to their clinics.  We have a set of anecdotes available to us but we do not have full insight.  We do not have good data or evidence coming out of them.  This is the first step in how we begin to come up with solutions and answer the questions that have been asked about the specifics we need to put in place.  One of the specifics is that we need transparency.  Private family law courts are essentially a black box through the <i>in camera<\/i>rule.  There is no reason we cannot have data coming out of such cases, even while we protect the identities and safety of the people involved in the cases, which are incredibly painful.  The first issue is that we need more data and evidence.  This is something that can be looked at.<br\/><br\/>In terms of the particulars, something that has been raised is how coercive control plays out.  The name of the coalition of NGOs is the Children Living with Domestic and Sexual Violence group.  We are looking at issues such as dual consent for a child's access to therapy or services that professionals have indicated would be of benefit to the child, and how this access is blocked in ways that are used in coercive control.  This is, of course, incredibly complex because there is a set of assumptions around it.<br\/><br\/>With regard to solutions, the first step is that we need the evidence.  We need more data and evidence.  We need to know the patterns because what we have are anecdotes.  The charities and NGOs that work with children and families can add in our various lines of sight to begin to understand what is happening between the three systems.  There are essentially three systems that are, in part, blind to one another.  There is the criminal justice system, the public and private civil law systems and the child protection response.  Particularly with regard to sexual violence and disclosures of sexual violence against children, we are very concerned about what happens when an allegation of child sexual abuse in or around the family disappears into private family law and, indeed, how coercive control begins to happen around the particular allegation.  These are all very serious issues in terms of gender equality.  I do not think we can understand how our system operates gender inequality and discrimination unless we have insight into what is happening in our family law courts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022033100002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Cl&iacute;ona Saidl&eacute;ar"},{"type":"speech","time":1648681200,"counter":1015,"content":"<p>It is very difficult for a Member of the Oireachtas to ask too many searching questions about the operation of the courts and the administration of justice lest we step over the separation of powers.

To be clear, counselling notes are only ever introduced if the defence wants them.  Often medical records are brought to court but it is only in sexual offence trials that they are brought in to discredit a prosecution witness.  This is the only time they are every used.  Therefore, this is a great opportunity for us.  The Citizens' Assembly did not like them.  It has crept in over 30 or 40 years as an extra tool to discredit witnesses, principally women, in sexual offence trials.  This is its only purpose.<br\/><br\/>The difficulty with the 2017 Act is that it assumes we can have a reasonable discussion about this in the course of a trial, or at least at the start of a trial.  This is not the case.  As many survivors have said, most recently in Sarah Grace's recently published book <i>Ash + Salt<\/i>, they are asked by the investigating garda&iacute; or the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, to make a decision about releasing their counselling notes.  This is because they need to know in advance of the trial whether these notes might in some way contradict or cast any aspersion or doubt whatsoever on the statement the witness made to the garda&iacute;.  This is only in sex offence trials.  It is a discrediting method.  It is done in absolute ignorance of the therapy process, the need to heal and the impact of trauma on memory and people's recognition.  We would be very pleased if the committee were to pull it away.  It is not done elsewhere.  Deputy Clarke is right.  It is deeply traumatic.  It can impact on healing and survivors tell us it does so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022033100002#G00900","nonspeaker":"Ms Noeline Blackwell"},{"type":"speech","time":1648681200,"counter":1021,"content":"<p>This is a very important point.

What will be core is that when the third national strategy is announced by the Minister, and before the Senator sees her, that he will be able to see clear direction that Departments are being brought together and that there is oversight and a coherent responsibility for all of the work that is to be done in the future when these are formally combined.  An ad hoc system is necessary to effectively say to people that we will bring the legislation in place in due course but in the meantime we need somebody in overall charge and running this.

Therefore, I may have lost some of my original questions in the processes.  There are a few interesting threads that I want to take up, the first jumping from Ms Blackwell's point.<\/p><p>She spoke about the importance of action on this new national strategy immediately.  It should start immediately looking at everything that is already in play and how it should be done differently or better and at things that need changing, rather than waiting for a new body in the future.  That puts massive pressure on the organisations before us.  One clear thing is that we have recommendations 37 to 41 in this area.  We also have the letter we received from the citizens, in which they are very clear in referring to the Istanbul Convention and saying that is their vision.  Some of that is covered by the recommendations, but there is that wider vision.  In terms of being able to provide the services that are required by the Istanbul Convention, the fact is that we have a lack of shelter places and now there will be massive pressure because more women are coming from conflict and difficult situations in Ukraine and elsewhere.  There will be more pressure and many more factors.  However, the advocacy work these organisations do is crucial, particularly when lots of decisions are being made in a short space of time.  I imagine, and hope, they are being asked for their opinions on many things.  In that regard, it is about almost turbo-powering the capacity of organisations working in this sector to be a voice in respect of this suite of decisions being made at national level.  However, even at local level there are many decisions being made as well.  That is the wider question.<br\/><br\/>There are a few specific matters.  The maintenance piece is very interesting.  My colleague Senator Ruane has put forward good legislation to improve and strengthen maintenance, and it has been taken up by the women's caucus.  That is a core area and it is an example of where people are dragged through the courts in a way that is often punitive and unrewarding and that retraumatises.  I am interested in the court piece.  This is where we all are awash with anecdotes.  People are coming to us all the time.  Regarding counselling, I know people who experience the appointment of psychologists by courts for assessing things.  That seems to be a whole area.  This is separate to the criminal piece.  In the courts, one is torn between the counselling experience one has had in trying to heal versus a court-appointed psychologist.  In some cases, I have been told that one party is able to suggest a psychologist and have that applied to the partner.  There is almost the adversarial use of psychology and counselling, when it should be counselling.  Then one is in that dilemma.<br\/><br\/>That leads to another issue which is, for example, where one is not sharing one's counselling records, things being said about it that are not true.  I am thinking of people coming through previous traumas, such as the refugee process and people having won refugee status.  Aspersions have been cast on their past experiences which are not true, but how do they demonstrate that?  That is another part.  We talked about the family courts and child protection, but another space where women are being asked to discuss their trauma is in the asylum and refugee process.  I know that AkiDwA will be in to discuss FGM strategy, but it is a wider issue.  The FGM recommendations of the citizens point to a wider issue, which is the experience of domestic or sexual violence, including for those who are LGBT.  They are things that are perhaps not always necessarily in the laws of a country but are in the experiences of an individual who is seeking asylum.  There is a really hard burden in respect of talking about one's experiences in that regard.  Perhaps the witnesses will comment on that.  FGM, itself, is an example of a form of control and abuse.<br\/><br\/>On coercive control, because the Seanad pushed to get it in I am very interested in how it is being implemented.  I have a fear about the opportunity piece.  Obviously, Ireland is limited in terms of sentencing guidelines.  With regard to data on sentencing, on one level I can see that being very useful because it shows the patterns, but I also have a fear of it setting a bad precedent whereby bad decisions that appear on that database are used as the excuse for more bad decisions.  We want to identify the patterns and to ensure decisions are not made in an <i>ad hoc<\/i>manner.  It sometimes seems to be the case that it can depend on luck of the draw in terms of which judge one gets.  We want to make sure we do not have one bad decision setting the precedent for another bad decision.<br\/><br\/>That is enough for now, although I have a few other issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022033100002#H02000","speaker":"1662","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648681200,"counter":1044,"content":"<p>I am conscious of time.

I echo what Ms Blackwell said earlier.  We have this new agency coming, but the strategy in the draft form we have seen was just empty on describing what the process is going to be regarding how we get to this new agency, which will take the next two years.  That is somewhat anxiety-inducing because we are currently way beyond our capacity in terms of what is being asked of us in advocacy.  Yes, we are being asked.  We are here and we are very grateful for all the times we are asked and included for our advice and our best thinking, but we are certainly put to the pin of our collar and stretched in being able to give all those the time they need.  We do not have the resources and capacity to do the work that is being asked of us at present, not to mind the work that will be asked of us in the next two to three years as we build into this.<\/p> <p>  As part of our thinking in looking at sexual violence as a structural issue in terms of part of the infrastructure that will change and address gender inequality, we need to look at taking seriously the analysis, thinking and advice that are available to us and the sustained specialisation that is available.  I can speak for the RCNI organisation; we really have struggled to sustain and to build.  The three of us have been in the sector for a long time, working and focused on this subject.  The type of specialisation being looked for here, and the type of commitment and investment in individuals to build up the skills and the specialisation, require security of employment and organisations that are able to support the focus on those issues.  That is always precarious, and it continues to be precarious for us.<\/p> <p>  In terms of service delivery and not just the advocacy piece, obviously in the service delivery for us part of our commitment to every survivor who walks through the door is that we will take what we understand from them and bring it to the committee, and that requires the translation.  We did a mapping halfway through the year last year and, at that point, there were 1,000 survivors on waiting lists somewhere in this country waiting to start counselling in a rape crisis centre.  There is that aspect of capacity as well.<\/p> <p>  Moving to the courts question, there are some concrete things.  I echo, and emphasise we are seeing it as well, a concern about instruments such as the invitation for people to undergo psychiatric assessment, for example, as part of family law cases.  It is an invitation but if one does not take it up, it is kind of coerced.  There really is not much by way of choice there.  We know of people who have been subjected to psychiatric assessments multiple times.  We see that as coercive and as a punishment.  When the wrong outcome has not been found, they are put through the cycle again.  There is something there about the professional standards of the professions involved.  I draw the committee's attention to the assessors who are not necessarily psychiatrists at all.  In fact, their professional qualification is uncertain.  It is an area that is unregulated.  Again, people are sent to these assessors.  It is unregulated and perhaps the Oireachtas could look at the regulation of the assessors and the protection of people going through that system in terms of how they are referred to it.<\/p><p>I reiterate that the issue in respect of sentencing guidelines is we need transparency, which is very lacking.

They probably think I am a jack-in-the-box jumping up and down but I am attending the committee next door and my speaking slot came up.  Bilocation is a key skill for a Member.<\/p> <p>  I have a few questions.  Like Deputy Carroll MacNeill, I have engaged with people who have come to my clinic, in addition to the family members of those who have been involved in these situations.  Will the representatives reiterate or confirm some of the issues that have been reported to me?  When victims report an issue in the system, it can often just be a result of their individual experiences, but I have seen a pattern building up, especially regarding the issue of the protection order and the seven or eight days it covers.  The feeling is it is issued for too short a period when it is very clear the threat will be there for much longer.<\/p> <p>  The second issue raised with me is the renewal of barring orders, when the new safe location often has to be disclosed.  Some of the people involved felt that put them in an even more vulnerable position.  The other issue is around the garda dealing with the overall case being the one to pursue the breach of the barring order.  Have the representatives experience of that?  Again, that does not seem to make sense.  It might seem like a short distance to many people, but the service for a barring order is available in Dublin city centre.  If the victim is in Finglas or Ballymun in my constituency, and is so controlled that every aspect of his or her life is being monitored or watched, where does such an individual get the five-hour window to get into town to apply for the barring order, get back home and then justify where he or she has been for that period?  Have the representatives discussed other options as to where a barring order might be sought?  Is it possible that local Garda stations might be a place where that could happen?  Has any consideration been given to the idea of Garda superintendents proactively seeking a barring order on behalf of a victim?  There might be an understanding that previous incidents have happened.  We do not want the State stepping into people's lives, but where might the Garda be more proactive in seeking a barring order on behalf of a victim who possibly does not want to pursue it because that person is so controlled and so limited?<\/p> <p>  The other area is the idea of a domestic violence register.  This has been implemented in the UK.  It is the idea that somebody in a domestic violence situation might have an inkling that something is happening and that his or her partner is becoming more and more controlling.  If that person was aware that this happened in a previous relationship involving that partner, he or she would either be more aware or more proactive at an early stage.  How can we do that with all the controls around the general data protection regulation, GDPR, and people's right, despite committing a crime, to be able to move on and put that behind them?  Has a domestic violence register been discussed?<\/p> <p>  I appreciate I am throwing a lot at the representatives.  My last question concerns the area of education, especially for young men in schools, in addition to youth clubs and other places.  From speaking to Ms Blackwell, I know her organisation has done quite a lot of work in schools with younger people, as I am sure other organisations have.  What recommendations does she have for the Government?  The Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, is looking at this area.  What are the recommendations on where the best place is to engage young people on the issue of violence?  Often, other young men are just as much victims of toxicity, especially if any sort of difference is exploited.  How do we tackle the toxic culture that often exists in GAA clubs, schools or youth groups?  I ask whoever would like to address any of those points to do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022033100002#K00300","speaker":"1568"},{"type":"speech","time":1648681200,"counter":1052,"content":"<p>There is a lot there.

I affirm everything my colleagues said regarding data being good.  We are not scared of the data.  I ask that we have it.  Coercive control has been legislated for.  Cases have been taken and there has been progress.  We welcome that the initial cases that came to court, including at least one brought to trial where there was a jury, did so in conjunction with additional charges, usually for quite extreme physical and-or sexual violence.  We were watching for stand-alone coercive control cases without those additional aggravating factors, notwithstanding decisions in such cases all have to be based on each individual crime.  We have started to see cases and convictions proceeding, including against even serving members of the Garda.  We commend the Garda on pushing forward on those.<\/p> <p>  Our legislation on coercive control has a focus on the impact on victims, which will possibly be problematic in the future.  In Scotland, for example, the actual behaviour is defined as the criminal act.  The impact on victims can differ, depending on their resilience, support networks and other intersecting factors.  That is something we should watch for but we see progress being made in that regard and we welcome it.  It is a game changer for the legislative system because it is based on a multifaceted pattern of events rather than a single action.  Even psychologically, that is something the courts need to take on board in understanding it so having that law is great.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy raised many issues.  To clarify, with respect to temporary orders, only two are limited to eight days, which are the interim barring order and the emergency barring order.  That is because of the legislative requirement that if somebody is going to be taken out of his or her home, that person has a right to be represented and say his or her piece.  In those instances, a hearing will be convened in that timeframe for either a safety order or a full barring order.  It does not create a gap in that sense.  A person would be issued a protective order, which does not require somebody to leave the premises, but that will last until the hearing for the full order, whether that is for a safety order or barring order.  It is possible the Deputy's contact specifically related to an emergency barring order or an interim barring order.<\/p> <p>  The Garda can already apply for an emergency barring order.  We are not aware of almost any cases of that happening.  We have already fed into some of the different Garda structures, including the inspectorate and the Policing Authority, particularly the inspectorate, around how Garda members are made aware of this right and what they can do.  They can apply for an emergency barring order out of hours and they can contact a judge.  Again, it is a very finite solution.  It also offers a solution if there is an imbalance, such as an applicant not having the right to a tenancy.  In effect, it is an exercise in buying the applicant time to find an alternative place to go because if the person does not have the property rights to have somebody removed, he or she has to find somewhere else.  The other circumstance relates to hospitals.  For many years now, social workers can also make an application on behalf of somebody, for example, an individual who is hospitalised.  Medical social workers tend to be aware that they can make applications, but there is no consistency.  Those rights and possibilities are already there.<\/p> <p>  With respect to the Garda, courts and who has the jurisdiction, the Garda do not have legal jurisdiction to issue orders.  That is probably something that would be----- <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022033100002#K00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Sarah Benson"},{"type":"speech","time":1648681200,"counter":1054,"content":"<p>Could the local Garda station be a location?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022033100002#K00600","speaker":"1568"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648681200,"counter":1055,"content":"<p>That is a separate matter.  Remote orders and a mechanism for applying for them came up as a proposition during the Covid-19 pandemic and was welcomed by Women's Aid and our colleagues in Safe Ireland.  The Garda was not necessarily overjoyed about the idea of stations being used.  We do not disagree because they are not necessarily conducive spaces.  They are limited and they do not have connectivity and so on.  We have looked at different pilots of remote proceedings that have been used for separation and divorce matters, for example, in the Circuit Court.  A pilot is under way in Limerick court that is looking at this.<\/p><p>It has slowed down.  There was excellent leadership from the President of the District Court during Covid and, perhaps just with other matters, it has not accelerated.  However, it has certainly been under consideration and is something we would welcome.  We recognise that practical logistical issues can be a serious constraint.  We would also not want it restricted to someone having to leave their own home.  We would like to see a mechanism for the temporary orders, which can be done <i>ex parte<\/i>and do not require a legal representative, that could be facilitated when he is at work perhaps.  That is something we would like to see pursued.<br\/><br\/>I refer to the other question around what is referred to in the UK as Clare's Law.  It is legislation that, with everything that we have been trying to keep our hands in, we possibly have not been actively lobbying for but it is something we would welcome examination of here.  The legislation in the UK, which has been in place since 2015, was introduced after the death of a young woman called Clare at the hands of a partner who had a serious history of violence against previous partners.  That legislation gives two really important tools.  It provides the right to ask the relevant body if a current partner has a history and the police have a right to tell if they have a fear.  We believe it is something that would be welcome.<br\/><br\/>I am sure I will concur with my colleagues on the education piece and I might give them the time on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022033100002#K00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Sarah Benson","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648681200,"counter":1057,"content":"<p>Perhaps Ms Blackwell will respond on education.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022033100002#L00200","speaker":"1568"},{"type":"speech","time":1648681200,"counter":1058,"content":"<p>I will bring in Ms Blackwell and then Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith because I am conscious she has been waiting.

I want to touch on two matters raised by Senator Higgins.  One was in relation to tribunals.  It is an important reminder that it is not only courts where people are traumatised in giving their evidence.  The Senator mentioned refugee tribunals.  One will also find the same in work tribunals where people have been victims of sexual harassment.  This is really important.  The International Protection Office, for instance, is getting training from our training team in a trauma-informed approach and understanding the impact of trauma on memory in regard to asylum claims.  That kind of training, which is also happening in the Judicial Council, is really valuable.  It needs to be consistent and continued because it is quite valuable.<\/p> <p>  The other point I would make is that Senator Higgins's point about capacity should be made as often as one can.  If this committee is going to do good work, if the current reforms are going to do good work and if the strategy is going to good work, we will not see a reduction in the need for our services or the services of our colleagues around the country.  We will see an enhanced need for them, which will increase our obligations and our need to help people.  Yes, we will need extra funding for that but we also need upscaling in so many ways to deal with what we hope will be an exponential growth in people being able to access our services.  We put in something in our submission in respect of the third national strategy.  We need the equivalent of Enterprise Ireland to allow us to have resources, the general management, communication, and analysis resources that we have never been given in a sector that has always been scraping the ground in terms of resources.  Money is important but it will not be everything. <\/p> <p>  To respond briefly to Deputy McAuliffe, what he articulated is what we hear consistently, that is, how worried people, teachers, schools and parents are about the lack of emotional frameworks that are given to young people to help them navigate the world they live in.  There is a real challenge in this regard to the Department of Education and a curriculum, including recommendations made for changing curriculum that have sat there since 2019 without being implemented across this area.  The Department of Education has not, in our view, taken on board what it needs to do.  The truth is, we do not have the language in Ireland.  Our teachers do not have the language.  Our parents do not have the concepts.  Nobody has the understanding in order to help our young people navigate a world in which they are mainly depending on their smartphones and peers for information.  On their smartphones they are getting pornography, including hard abuse pornography.<\/p> <p>  There is a huge piece of work to be done on this.  I believe it is a breach of children's rights not to be given the emotional formation they need in our formal education system, as well as more informally.  There are over 40 groups like our BodyRight programme out there.  It is a matter of discretion what a school gets in.  It is a matter of discretion what schools do.  I know that, after the very tragic death of Ashling Murphy, teachers were coming to us in absolute despair, particularly teachers of boys, about what they were going to do to talk about this.  They had to say something but did not know what to say, how to say it or how to keep a conversation going.  It definitely has not been addressed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022033100002#L00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Noeline Blackwell"},{"type":"speech","time":1648681200,"counter":1060,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Blackwell for her really important words.

I thank the Chair for letting me in.  This is a really interesting and important conversation.  While I understand we are under pressure with time, I want to ask two short questions of Women's Aid.  The first is on the issue of victims being able to stay in their own accommodation rather than the perpetrator being able to stay and the victim having to move.  What kind of work could we do around that?  Are there any ideas of how we can eliminate the possibility of the victim being driven out?  As that is the norm, it means there will be fewer victims reporting the domestic violence situation because they will hide behind the fact that we have a housing crisis etc.<\/p> <p>  That leads me into my next question on the Housing for All plan by the Government.  It was mentioned that there needs to be a medium and long-term consideration of accommodation for victims within that plan.  How do witnesses think that can happen and what sort of measures would they envisage going into the Housing for All plan to deal with domestic violence?  I ask this because in my area, Dublin South-Central, our councillors are getting funding from Dublin City Council for a domestic violence service worker to be in the area full time to help victims navigate the services that are available to them.  That might be a model we could follow if we manage to secure the funding for that.<\/p> <p>  I was struck by what Dr. Saidl&eacute;ar said earlier about the need for funding to allow the witnesses to do a professional and permanent job, and that they would not always be on the precarious footing of wondering whether they will we get funding this year, this terms of the other.  I am fully aware that has been the case with the historical record of domestic violence rape crisis services in the State.  How should we argue for budgeting around these services?  What would the witnesses recommend?  Ms Blackwell provided this to a certain degree in her contribution but if they were properly funded, what services could be provided in the future, which cannot currently be provided and that would have a major impact on this entire issue?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022033100002#L00600","speaker":"1486"},{"type":"speech","time":1648681200,"counter":1062,"content":"<p>We will go to Ms Benson first for Women's Aid and then I will invite Dr. Saidl&eacute;ar, Ms Scott and Ms Blackwell to make a final summing up.

We also have been inundated by schools and we made a conscious decision not to be the ones who go in, do a talk, and then the talk is done.  We have linked up with University College Cork, which has been doing the third level bystander programme and is now piloting it in 70 schools.  It is only a pilot that started with seven schools but after Ashling Murphy's death, it increased to 70 schools.  We have woven in our material in to Munster Technological University with the object of ensuring the context of intimate relationships, as well as the broader issues around consent are included.  We are very interested to see how that progresses.  That trains the teachers to work with the young people.  It is also supporting the teachers.  It is sober work but it is the work that is important to ensure culture and an integrated feed-in of these issues because that is required.  Excellent short-term training does not actually help if the culture of the school is not there to support disclosures and the young people to struggle with the concepts.<\/p><p>As regards the questions of Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith, I will start with the strategy itself.  The fact is that victims, particularly women and children, and their experience of homelessness, which is connected directly and, in many cases, inextricably with domestic violence, have never been given proper visibility in the housing strategy, even in terms of counting the housing and homeless numbers.  Refuges have been siloed off as something separate and different.  That is a fatal flaw in terms of responding responsively and in a gender-informed way to homelessness.  This encompasses women who are homeless for other reasons.  Trinity College Dublin has conducted several research projects that show domestic and sexual violence in childhood, as a young adult or in intimate relationships as being a factor in homelessness.  Homeless provision is overwhelmingly geared towards couples and men.  There is almost no women-only homeless accommodation.  Domestic violence can occur in homeless accommodation.  We are working with several services in respect of how they tackle that issue of domestic violence in homeless services they are providing.  Where do women go if they are homeless and need to be separate with their children?  In the context of prescription in respect of local authority areas, where is it recognised that women who want to leave their abusive partners may specifically need to leave their local authority area?  That needs to be given visibility.  An influence that is sensitive to gender as well as domestic and sexual violence is needed and will require different thinking and different prioritisations.  It is about naming it, giving it visibility and seeing where that leads in the strategy.<\/p><p> As regards safe home initiatives, several of our colleagues in the sector have initiated what are referred to as safe home initiatives and they are crucial.  Why should victims or survivors have to be the ones to vacate when they are not the cause of the problem?  That is recognised in the Tusla accommodation survey.  It is not just about refuge spaces; it is about all of the multifaceted approaches and facilitating those as part of the new strategy and the implementation we think will be vital to ensure that will happen.  Our colleagues in Safe Ireland will speak to that in more depth next week.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022033100002#L00800","nonspeaker":"Ms Sarah Benson","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648681200,"counter":1065,"content":"<p>The committee will hear from Safe Ireland next week.

In many ways, one of the ambitions, expectations or hopes we had for Tusla was that there would finally be national planning.  After more than 40 years of services in this area, we hoped we would have national planning rather than being dependent on the capacity, goodwill and activism in towns and villages across the country where people built services from the ground up.  That national planning still has not happened.  We still do not have national planning of the delivery of services on domestic and sexual violence.  Obviously, that will be part of the expectation in respect of the new agency, but it will be two years before we have that new agency.  The Department of Justice, to which this is all transferring, is certainly aware of this and is beginning to put in place multi-annual funding, which gives us a little more security.  A mindset shift is required in terms of the type of resources we are considering here.  For example, we should not be afraid to say that as a starting point we need to double the funding.  It is not about another &euro;1 million here or another few hundred thousand euro there.  Let us start with that figure, double it and not be afraid of that.  That is the mindset we need.<\/p> <p>  As regards rape crisis centres across the country, one of the things to which we are being asked to respond right now is the influx of refugees from Ukraine.  For us, there is obviously a question in respect of the trauma people are bringing with them and how we, as specialists in the area of sexual violence, might be able to contribute in that regard.  One of the things that is clearly needed right now relates to the fact that the rape crisis centres on the ground can do inter-agency work with all the local actors that are engaging with those Ukrainian refugees coming into the country, but where are they meant to find the spare capacity to spend their day out with their partners in the community doing that support work and ensuring good practice, safe disclosure and safe referral pathways?  There is a need to think more broadly about the type of capacity needed in centres rather than counting, if one likes, the units of service delivery in terms of counselling hours, for example.  A much more creative and broad understanding of the type of services rape crisis centres and domestic violence services offer on the ground is needed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022033100002#M00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Cl&iacute;ona Saidl&eacute;ar"},{"type":"speech","time":1648681200,"counter":1067,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Saidl&eacute;ar.

I was struck by the UN line that it is both a consequence and a cause of gender inequality and, if we want to get to gender equality, the link in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022033100002#M01200","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speech","time":1648681200,"counter":1076,"content":"<p>I invite Ms Blackwell to sum up and to respond on that point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022033100002#M01300","speaker":"1698"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648681200,"counter":1077,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman.  Senator Higgins summed it up perfectly; there is probably no need for me to speak further.  All present are certain in respect of the need to deal with this form of violence, which has been hidden, and to identify and build respect and understanding of the abuse it causes and the impact of that abuse on people.  Society needs to accept that such violence cannot be tolerated.  People must not be of the view that if it is happening behind closed doors or in one's friend group, we do not have to care about it or address it.<\/p><p>It is only 30 years since we delegitimised rape by a husband of his wife when we removed the defence of being a husband in respect of the offence of rape.  All of that is ultimately where we are going.<\/p><p> Dr. Saidl&eacute;ar has been on the representative organisation of the rape crisis centres for a long time.  I will take the liberty of speaking on behalf of the rape crisis forum, which is another similar construction that we are part of.  All of us know what to do when somebody can disclose.  It can take a long time for a victim of sexual violence to disclose that they have suffered violence, given the traumatic impact of sexual violence.  Most people do not disclose it and feel threatened in disclosing it.  Some people just do not have the facility to get to us.  Those who do sometimes cannot get the therapeutic help they need.<\/p><p> We believe we have the tools we need right now.  We have the capacity.  People can call the helpline or engage in a web chat.  Just as Women's Aid does with domestic violence, we now offer services in more than 100 languages so that at least people can say the words in their own language if they can say them at all.  We know how to do the therapy.  For instance, we have now effectively introduced a social worker to deal with issues such as housing that might arise for somebody who is getting therapeutic help.  We know that education is needed.  We know that other people need the language as well.<\/p><p> I often compare it to an old Ford Fiesta I had.  I used to have to ask people to get out when climbing up a high hill because the thing would have fallen apart otherwise.  Our sector has been denied investment.  We have been denied an understanding of our importance.  However, between domestic and sexual violence, the State almost fully outsources its obligations in this area to us.  We are happy to accept that because we are specialists in the area.  We need to reach everybody who needs us, when they need us and where they need us.<\/p><p> Dr. Saidl&eacute;ar spoke about creative ways.  That will require us to do better than we are doing now.  It needs to be recognised that we need to build that professional approach, including management structures that nobody wants to give us money for.  Everybody wants to give us money to heal people, but nobody wants to facilitate us building a strong viable set of organisations.  That is what the citizens asked for.  They recognised that we are dealing with something that was previously hidden and people could not talk about.  It is great that we are talking about it now and we are talking about it all the time.  It would be absolutely brilliant if we could bring to reality what we know can make a happier, healthier and safer society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022033100002#M01400","nonspeaker":"Ms Noeline Blackwell","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648681200,"counter":1079,"content":"<p>That is a good positive note on which to end.
