Apologies have been received from Deputy Cormac Devlin.  In order to limit the risk of spreading Covid-19, I ask that all those in attendance wear face coverings when not addressing the committee.  The service requests that members continue to wear face coverings when moving about the campus and when in close proximity to others, and to be respectful of other people's physical space.  We urge people to heed the public health advice.  Members of the committee who are attending remotely must do so within the precincts of Leinster House.  This is due to the constitutional requirement that in order to participate in the public meetings, members must be physically present within the confines of the place the Parliament has chosen to sit.<\/p> <p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, is a permanent witness to the committee.  This morning we will engage with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to examine the 2020 appropriation accounts for Vote 20.<\/p> <p>  We are joined in the committee room by officials from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na: Mr. Drew Harris, Garda Commissioner; Dr. Shawna Coxon, deputy commissioner for strategy, governance and performance; Mr. Joseph Nugent, chief administrative officer; and Ms Kathryna Clifford, executive director, finance and services.  We are also joined by Ms Marianne Nolan, principal officer in the Justice Vote section of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  You are all very welcome.<\/p> <p>  I ask those attending remotely to mute their microphones when not contributing so that we do not pick up any background noise or feedback.  As usual, I remind all of those in attendance to ensure their mobile phones are on silent mode or switched off.<\/p> <p>  Before starting, I will explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses in respect of references witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  Within the precincts of Leinster House, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the presentation they make to the committee.  This means that they have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they may say at the meeting.  However, they are expected not to abuse this privilege and it is my duty as Cathaoirleach to ensure it is not abused.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue and it is imperative that they comply with such directions.<\/p> <p>  Members are reminded of the provisions within Standing Order 218 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government, or a Minister of the Government, or the merits of the objectives of such policies.<\/p> <p>  Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise, or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<\/p> <p>  I now call on the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, for his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022033100002#A00400","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648715400,"counter":9,"content":"<p>The 2020 appropriation account for Vote 20 - An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na recorded gross expenditure of &euro;1.93 billion.  This was an increase of almost &euro;134 million, or 7%, on the prior year.  Almost two thirds of the expenditure was related to payments of salaries, wages and allowances, which totalled &euro;1.23 billion in 2020.  A further &euro;354 million was spent on pension and gratuity payments to retired garda&iacute;.  These two areas account for over 80% of voted expenditure in 2020.<\/p> <p>  Most of the larger Votes are presented in terms of expenditure in relation to key functions or service areas.  In contrast, Vote 20 is presented mainly in terms of expenditure by resource type or input classifications.  These include standard administration input costs, as well as costs associated with construction and maintenance of buildings, vehicle purchase and operation, and IT and communication systems.  As a result of this budgeting and accounting approach, the account does not disclose the cost of individual Garda outputs and deliverables, such as community policing, traffic policing, white-collar crime investigation or other specialist functions. <\/p> <p>  At the end of 2020, approximately 17,800 whole-time equivalent staff were employed with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

My team has already been introduced to the committee.<\/p> <p>  The 2020 gross expenditure of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was &euro;1.94 billion.  After taking account of appropriations-in-aid of &euro;115 million, the net expenditure was just over &euro;1.8 billion.  Funding is provided to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na through Vote 20 and it supports all of our policing activities.  The year 2020 was an unprecedented year due to the Covid-19 pandemic and was an extremely challenging year for policing and for all of our citizens.  Public health was of the utmost importance and required unparalleled restrictions on freedom of movement of people, normal business activities, sporting and social activities.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was tasked with policing and supporting the Government, the community and businesses on the measures imposed due to Covid-19.  As an organisation, we responded quickly, and in doing so garda&iacute; and staff members demonstrated commitment, flexibility and resilience in this emergency, and dedication to the continued protection of our society and citizens.<\/p><p> Some immediate actions undertaken included maximising the availability of garda&iacute; for high-visibility community policing, which necessitated new roster arrangements, restrictions on annual leave, the postponement of some retirements, the acceleration of the attestation of some 300 student garda&iacute; and the allocation of additional garda&iacute; to front-line duties.  Operation Fanacht was put in place and this consisted of an extensive network of thousands of checkpoints established across the country, with more than 2,500 garda&iacute; involved with these checkpoints daily at the height of the restrictions.  Other activities included supporting members of the public and community who were cocooning.  We delivered essential supplies, including food and medicines, worked with the Government on Covid-19 emergency legislation and the provision of Covid-19 advice with our office of internal communications, OIC.<\/p><p> Importantly, 2020 also saw the launch of Operation Faoiseamh in response to the increase in domestic abuse-related calls received by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na during the Covid-19 pandemic.  The objective of this operation was to provide enhanced support and protection to victims of domestic abuse, and 22,795 contacts and attempted contacts were made by members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with victims of domestic abuse during 2020.  The organisation also responded to more than 43,000 calls for assistance in respect of domestic abuse incidents and more than 11,600 criminal charges were created in 2020 for crimes involving an element of domestic abuse, including breaches of domestic violence orders.  We also accelerated the implementation of technology across the organisation, providing the platform for personnel to move quickly to remote working and the provision of 3,000 mobile data stations to front-line garda&iacute;.  We also provided essential personal protective equipment, PPE, in an effective manner to our members and staff during this time, resulting in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na maintaining an employee resilience rate of approximately 95%.<\/p><p> In addition to policing activity related to Covid-19 measures, normal policing services continued.  This was essential for the prevention, detection and investigation of crime, which continued to be committed.  An example was the collection of more than &euro;45 million related to seizures of illicit drugs and cash.  Numerous firearms and thousands of rounds of ammunition were also seized.  Work also continued on cybercrime, with some 400 new cases reported and 333 cases closed in 2020.<\/p><p> Policing activity in Ireland is funded in the main through the Exchequer, and while the activities required due to the impact of Covid-19 pandemic can make comparisons with other times somewhat difficult, I am confident as the Accounting Officer of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that public moneys under my control were expended in 2020 in accordance with the ethos of value for money and investing in the future of our services on behalf of the Government and our citizens.  This investment included maintaining and building the capital structure to support our policing.  We continue to invest in our fleet, which is obviously an essential resource for Garda operations, and we reached a record number of 3,100 vehicles in 2020.  In line with Government policies on sustainability, climate change and low carbon emissions, we are in the process of developing strategies to move to a more sustainable fleet of electric vehicles, EVs, and a pilot programme is in place.<\/p><p> The property portfolio in use by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is extensive.  It includes more than 560 stations and a range of other national support, administrative and specialist facilities.  As the structure of the organisation evolves, there is also a need to ensure the estate aligns with evolving operational needs.  A number of refurbishments and upgrades were completed in 2020 and work commenced on the site of a new Garda security and crime operations centre at Military Road.  Not all the bureaux currently based in Harcourt Square will be transferring to the new centre at Military Road, with some being allocated elsewhere.  Accommodation solutions are being provided by the Office of Public Works, OPW, to meet the requirements of all these bureaux.  Accommodation is a crucial element of facilitating policing activities and we must further future-proof in this area.  Hence, my officials continue to engage with the OPW on capital and maintenance works across Ireland.  This includes an exciting project where we are working with the OPW in Dublin City Council on the proposed development of a substantial new Garda station and facilities on Dublin City Council lands at the corner of the R139 and Malahide Road at Northern Cross.<\/p><p> My officials have provided a written response on the implementation of the committee's previous recommendations.  While the pandemic has impacted the rate of progress on some of these matters, I assure the Chair and members that I take the committee's recommendations very seriously and that we are working on completing the implementation stage.<\/p><p> Tragically, we were all given a stark reminder in 2020 of the risks run by garda&iacute; while carrying out their duties when our esteemed colleague, Detective Garda Colm Horkan, was killed on duty on 17 June 2020.  Colm had served his local community for 24 years and was well known and respected for his police work and community work, particularly with his local GAA team.<\/p><p> I take this opportunity to thank most sincerely all the people who worked in and with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for the delivery of policing services during the Covid-19 pandemic and the Minister and the Department of Justice for their assistance and support.  I also thank the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, and his staff for their work and the committee for the time provided for this opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022033100002#A00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Drew Harris","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1648715400,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I thank the Commissioner.

Has An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na increased the mental health supports it provides for members of the force serving on the front line?  Garda&iacute; on the streets are facing new challenges.  Unfortunately, we also saw a major increase in online abuse directed at garda&iacute;, which proved difficult for some members of the force to deal with.

As the Commissioner said, we recognise the need to engage with our members and to provide supports for members who are dealing with traumatic circumstances all the time.  In recent years, we have invested in a range of different options in providing those supports.  These have included matters like a confidential, independently-run 24-7 counselling service being made available to members.  Our chief medical officer, who takes the lead in this area, has got agreement for and has put in place a new well-being strategy for the organisation in general.  In the last year, we have launched a specific app that provides a range of supports and advice in this regard, including contact details for our existing services.  Our employee assistance service has officers around the country delivering that piece.  Peer supports are provided by colleagues who are in a position to provide guidance and assistance and technical supports are provided by independent agencies.  It is an area we feel we need to do more on, and certainly the well-being strategy will see us do more in this area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022033100002#B00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Joseph Nugent"},{"type":"speech","time":1648715400,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I thank the Commissioner and Mr. Nugent for their responses.

We have set in place a very high standard in respect of the response to domestic abuse.  In effect, what was happening was that our processes were not being followed in respect of those domestic abuse calls.  The actual act of cancellation of a call can be warranted because we have calls that can resolve themselves, for example, alarm calls, calls by other agencies for assistance which are then resolved and also multiple and duplicate calls for, say, a serious road traffic collision.  The numbers are huge but we found when we worked through the cases that the numbers distil down to 5,871 incidents that we had particular concerns about.  Of those, we found there was an invalid closure in 2,689 cases, in that a PULSE incident should have been opened.  A CAD incident was opened but in 2,689 incidents a PULSE incident was not opened.  Of those, we have created 2,316 incidents and have uncovered what we believe is 134 crimes not recorded.<\/p> <p>  All the reasons for invalid cancellations have been analysed.  There are almost 20 reasons, one of which is very prevalent.  In 28% of cases, or over 800 calls, the call was cancelled by the caller.  In other cases, there was either no offence, or the case was closed or cancelled by the car crew.  That is where we run into problems because if a caller rings back and says they want to cancel a call, it is our policy that we should still attend, investigate and follow through in completion of a PULSE incident.  There was a breakdown in terms of practice and behaviour within the control rooms but also among those responding.  We have addressed that in terms of processes around who can cancel - only supervisors can cancel - and then dip sampling and supervision.

We have very powerful women represented throughout the senior leadership team and senior management within the organisation.  All of that is positive with respect to the outlook, behaviour and culture within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  There is obviously more to do.  We hosted a recent International Association of Women Police conference and that really threw down the gauntlet about what else might be done in respect of increasing the number of women within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, particularly within the ranks of those who are sworn members.  I am very conscious I am sitting beside Deputy Commissioner Coxon.

When we speak to women across the organisation those things are pivotal to deciding how long they stay and whether they come into the organisation at all.  In addition, we have a women's support network now.  It was championed by the Commissioner and has been in place for just under two years.  The benefit of that is in women coming together and sharing what barriers they see from their lived experience in the organisation and in looking at how we can get those barriers out of the way in order to we can encourage women not only to come into the organisation but to stay in it.

Moreover, stations that may have been open only once or twice a week have had a member or maybe two members assigned to them.  All of that is positive.  We still have growth yet to come of some 700 to 800 members, and that is positive as well.  The number of Garda staff we employ should free up more Garda members for front-line duties but that will include staffing the national units as well.<\/p> <p>  There is always more demand than we can meet.

When he was first appointed, he stated that crime is not like rain and does not fall equally everywhere.  Unfortunately, the community I represent, which incudes Ballymun, Finglas, Glasnevin and Santry, has disproportionate levels of crime.  I was involved with Dublin City Council on the Ballymun - A Brighter Future report by Andrew Montague.  That report refers to the level of policing in our community and the level of crime.  For an area with such a high murder rate, we have one of the lowest rates of policing in the country.  The average rate is 2.8 garda&iacute; per 1,000 population.  Our rate is 2.3 garda&iacute; per 1,000 population.  If we discount from the district the 45 garda&iacute; in Dublin Airport because they are not accessible in a community sense, we drop down to 2.1 garda&iacute; per 1,000 population.  Has the Commissioner done work with the Pobal deprivation index on hotspots of crime and how resources are allocated?

I am sure if one is in a fit-for-purpose building, one's morale is that bit higher and so forth.<\/p> <p>  I support Deputy Colm Burke's point about the need to ensure resources are deployed.  I might have views with regard to Fermoy and Mallow, for instance.  I might be a bit parochial about the fact that we found it strange that it was going to Macroom, but that is a matter of policy.  We need to ensure that resources are deployed in terms of capital expenditure on buildings, however, and they need to be rolled out as quickly as possible.

My apologies if I have missed important points but I cannot attend both meetings simultaneously.<\/p> <p>  I wish to follow up on the questions of Deputy Catherine Murphy in respect of the Garda diversion programme and the JLO scheme.  I have an interest in this as I was on the section 44 committee from 2015 to 2019.  It was a valuable insight.  I really admire the work that Colette Quinn and others do in that section.  To my mind, it is a quasi-judicial office of significant importance where one is making decisions about children's lives and whether they go through the criminal justice system, but also whether they are getting appropriate welfare-based interventions An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has identified they need.  I have a concern in this regard.  This is important in terms of cost in an ongoing way because if these interventions can be identified and made appropriate at this stage, it can have significant effects.  I acknowledge the issue raised by Deputy Catherine Murphy but my understanding is that where a decision is made not to prosecute and that what is necessary is a welfare-based referral, that may take the form of anger management interventions or sexual awareness interventions, for example.  Those responses are largely Tusla-based or with another agency, such as addiction-based responses.  Deputy Bacik and I were in the D&oacute;chas Centre and in Mountjoy on Monday as co-convenors of the penal reform group.  The two big issues identified as being faced in both communities were addiction and mental health.  Difficulties in respect of training and education for those who were going to engage in that were preceded by an urgent need to deal with both those issues.  My concern is that I am not sure how much visibility An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has in respect of the follow-up to those welfare-based referrals.  Is it getting reports back that the young individual or child had access to the referral and attended it and what the outcome, if any, has been?  I am not sure whether it is the job of the Garda to have that information but it seems to me that if a quasi-judicial decision not to prosecute is being made on the basis that a referral is what the child needs, it should have the information in some way.  We have always argued that there should be a Tusla presence in the Garda youth diversion programme to provide for a seamless link between the programme office and Tusla to make sure the Garda is able to satisfy itself that those referrals have been completed.  I ask Mr. Harris to address that issue.

The Commissioner is quite right that the success of the Garda youth diversion programme is astoundingly good, but what we persistently end up with is a group of young offenders who are the most active offenders but also very much the most vulnerable children in the community.<\/p><p>We have the joint agency response to crime, JARC, for adults and we have constant calls for a JARC for young offenders, bringing the Garda youth diversion programme, GYDP, up to 21 or 24 to be able to target resources very effectively at a smaller group of people who have very challenged behaviours and very challenged lives.  A lot of the referrals that the GYDP gets are &ldquo;one child, one time&rdquo; or &ldquo;one child, a very small number of times&rdquo;.  If the Garda has the quasi-judicial power to make a decision for referral, there must be some mechanism to be able to check that that is so, rather than just information sharing.  In particular, a solution along the lines of &ldquo;If they come to our attention again, we will find out what happened last time&rdquo; is by definition insufficient and there must be a stronger way of linking that back in.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022033100002#O02200","speaker":"1480","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1648715400,"counter":284,"content":"<p>I would need to take that back to the national office.

In the case of InterTradeIreland, the lead is the Northern Ireland Audit Office.

We discuss between ourselves the issues that might arise.  It is complicated and there can be further complications if explanations are required, particularly if a body has to go back to parent departments in two jurisdictions.  When the explanation comes through, there are processes of presentation of the financial statements on both sides of the Border that may contribute to the delay in submitting it to the Houses.<\/p><p> I refer to the recognition of a deferred pension funding asset.  Many third level institutions, particularly universities, have other sources of income apart from grants from the State.  They need to recognise that they have accrued pension liabilities but if they did not recognise a matching pension funding asset the picture on their balance sheets would be distorted and it would look like they were insolvent.  However, the expectation is that it might be 50 years before these liabilities are drawn down.  They are effectively assuming that the Exchequer will meet the pension liabilities as they arise.  Because they do not have a guarantee that the State will do that, I am drawing attention to it.  It is something we have been doing for many years.

It is possible to accrue leave of the amount in this example, which was 41 days.  I understand that in this particular case the chief executive expected to be leaving earlier in the year, which was 2020.

This is beginning with the presentation of accounts for 2021.  Members will recall that we wrote to the Department proposing a number of changes to the format and content of the appropriation accounts.  The Secretary General agreed to examine the proposal for the 2022 accounts, and it was subsequently requested that, in the interests of transparency and accountability, the remuneration of Accounting Officers should be included in the 2021 accounts.  It is welcome that this will be done and that will include a comparator for 2020.  The circular giving effect to this change was circulated to members yesterday.  I propose that the committee notes and publishes this item of correspondence; requests a progress update by the end of September this year on each of the changes to the appropriation accounts proposed by the committee and includes the matter on the agenda for our meeting with the Department of Expenditure and Reform on 19 May.<\/p> <p>  I will open this matter to the floor before seeking agreement on those proposals.

One of the things requested was remuneration details for the Accounting Officer.  It is well established as regards chief officers in other organisations that it is the actual payment in the year that is reported.  The Accounting Officer who replied regarding that on 6 January stated, in effect, the Department would consider the changes that were laid out but the circular had already issued for 2021.  In the context of changes for 2022, the Department is willing to engage in a dialogue and to look at how things might be measured and defined and so on.

Agreed.<\/p> <p>  No. 1139B is correspondence from Mr. Mark Griffin, Secretary General, Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, dated 21 March 2022, providing follow-up information requested by the committee arising from our meeting with the Department on 10 February 2022.  It includes information on the Department&rsquo;s expenditure on external advisory services relating to the national broadband plan, which amounts to in excess of &euro;16 million since 2020, and a short note on what the Department is doing to decrease its reliance on such services.  We also address this in our report on the Department&rsquo;s 2019 and 2020 accounts, which we will publish next week.  It is proposed to note and publish this correspondence.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Murphy and I wanted to raise this matter.  In reading this correspondence before the meeting, I noted that Analysys Mason received &euro;6.852 million, Ernst and Young received &euro;8.251 million and William Fry received &euro;1.3 million.  The Department sets out 28,309 interactions in total with the National Broadband Ireland contact centre and outlines the level of work.  The note in the correspondence relating to efforts to try to move away from that does not tell us an awful lot.  I wonder whether more details can be given.<\/p> <p>  On the rent and fees paid to other companies by National Broadband Ireland, despite the fact it is year one, there is already a &euro;9.4 million outlay relating to the rental of poles and ducts.  That is one we need to keep an eye on in the years ahead as the roll-out of the plan accelerates.  It was at a very early stage last year and was only barely starting.

Providing these services in house may well end up being a better option than employing consultants if the consultants are there in perpetuity.  The letter states that since the contract was signed with Analysys Mason, payments of &euro;6.95 million have been made.  I think we should ask about the duration of the contracts in each of the three cases, namely, with Analysys Mason, EY and William Fry.<\/p><p> The letter goes on to state that since the contract was signed with William Fry in 2020, payments of &euro;1.32 million have been made in respect of legal advisory services.

I take it they are.<\/p> <p>  The Accounting Officer for the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is also responsible for Vote 15 - secret service, which cannot be examined in any substantive way.  It is proposed to exclude that Vote from that agenda.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  That Vote has to do with State security.  As agreed earlier, we will also include the format and content of the appropriation accounts on the agenda for that meeting with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.<\/p> <p>  It was noted at last week's meeting that a response has not been received from Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to the committee's request for further information regarding the closure of the Benefacts database.  The Department provided a response yesterday and it will be circulated on Monday for consideration at next week's correspondence meeting.  It is also proposed to include the matter on the agenda for our meeting with the Department on 19 May.  We felt the Benefacts database was an important matter.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  As usual, if there is any specific area of interest to members and which they wish to raise, I ask them to notify the clerk so that briefing material can be requested in advance and the bodies can be prepared to engage on the issues.  Are there any other matters that members wish to raise for inclusion on the work programme?  There are not.  A list of subjects that members have mentioned is attached to the documents before committee members, if they want to review it and come back to future meetings with it.  That concludes our consideration of the work programme for today.<\/p> <p>  The final item on the agenda is any other business.  Do any members wish to raise any other matters?  If not, we will go into private session before adjourning until 7 April, when we will examine the 2020 financial statements of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission and the 2020 appropriation accounts of Vote 41 - the Policing Authority.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022033100002#HH00800","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1648715400,"counter":467,"content":"<p>The committee went into private session at 2.55 p.m. and adjourned at 3.08 p.m. until 9.30 a.m. on Thursday, 7 April 2022.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
