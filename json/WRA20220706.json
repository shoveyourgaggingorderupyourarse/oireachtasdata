The AMBER area represents the area to be served by the network to be deployed under the NBP State led intervention.  <\/p>  <p>  I appreciate people's frustration when they are living so close to a fibre network but cannot get a connection to that network, particularly given the heightened importance of connectivity during the Covid-19 pandemic. The NBP will ensure that in all such cases a future proofed high speed broadband network will be built to serve these premises and work to deliver on this is underway.  <\/p>  <p>  I am advised by National Broadband Ireland (NBI) that, as of 24 June 2022, construction is complete or underway across 26 counties demonstrating that the project is reaching scale. Over 70,700 premises can order or pre-order a high-speed broadband connection across 23 counties, with over 61,500 premises passed across 23 counties and available for immediate connection. To date, the level of connections is increasing on a daily basis and is in line with projections with some areas exceeding expectations. In County Kildare, NBI has advised that 1,242 premises are available to order or pre-order and 796 premises are passed with a high-speed fibre broadband network and available for immediate connection.<\/p>  <p>  Further details are available on specific areas within County Kildare through the NBI website which provides a facility for any premises within the intervention area to register their interest in being provided with deployment updates through its website www.nbi.ie.  Individuals who register with this facility will receive regular updates on progress by NBI on delivering the network and specific updates related to their own premises as works commence. NBI has a dedicated email address, reps@nbi.ie, which can be used by Oireachtas members for specific queries.<\/p>  <p>  NBI has made recent improvements to their website to enhance the provision of information to Oireachtas members. NBI has now completed a suite of changes, creating a portal that will serve as a means for Oireachtas members to proactively search for information relevant to their county\/local area. The portal provides an up-to-date picture of NBI&rsquo;s deployment schedule across the 227 Deployment Areas (DAs) in all 26 counties. A particular county can be selected to view an update of the overall number of premises in the Intervention Area, the overall NBP investment in the county, the number of premises passed to date and the status of each of the Deployment Areas with the anticipated date for connection over the lifetime of the project. The dedicated webpage can be accessed here: www.nbi.ie.<\/p>  <p>  Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network. Some 636 BCP sites have been installed by NBI to date and the high speed broadband service will be switched on in these locations through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development for publicly accessible sites and the Department of Education for school BCPs. In County Kildare 3 BCPs have been installed by NBI to date.  The site at Lullymore Heritage Park is located approximately 16km from the premises and is fully connect with a high-speed broadband service.  Further details can be found at nbi.ie\/bcp-locations\/. <\/p>  <p>  In County Kildare 4 schools have been installed by NBI to date for educational access.

The ETD is transposed into national law in Finance Act 1999 (as amended). Under the ETD, Member States are obliged to exempt from excise duty, certain mineral oils used for commercial aviation purposes and all mineral oils used for commercial maritime navigation. <\/p><p>In relation to aviation fuels, the scope of the ETD exemption covers jet fuel, also described as heavy oil, which is the most commonly used fuel type in air navigation. The exemption must encompass all jet fuel used for intra-Community and international air transport purposes. A Member State may however waive this exemption for intra-community flights but only where it has entered into a bilateral agreement with another Member State to tax fuel. Ireland has no such agreements at present and therefore the exemption from taxation is applied to all jet fuel used for commercial intra-community flights. No other Member States currently have bilateral agreements in place to allow for taxation of jet fuel.<\/p><p>The ETD provides that Member States may opt to fully or partially exempt from taxation jet fuel used for commercial domestic air navigation. Currently Ireland&rsquo;s Mineral Oil Tax (MOT) law provides for a full relief to apply to jet fuel used for all commercial air navigation, including domestic, intra-community and international. <\/p><p>Light oil, referred to as aviation gasoline, is also used as an aviation fuel, although much less commonly than jet fuel. Under the ETD, Member States may opt to fully or partially exempt aviation gasoline used for international or intra-community commercial air navigation.  They may also opt to fully or partially exempt fuels used for domestic commercial aviation. MOT law currently provides for a partial exemption for aviation gasoline used for commercial air navigation. There is no distinction in national legislation between domestic, intra-community and international commercial aviation in the operation of the partial relief.<\/p><p>With regard to aviation fuel for commercial international transport, the scope for a Member State to take a unilateral approach on taxation of aviation fuels is limited not only by the ETD but by international law and a range of bilateral and multilateral agreements that operate under the 1944 Convention on International Civil Aviation (known as the Chicago Convention). <\/p><p>Jet fuel and aviation gasoline used for private pleasure flying, i.e. non-commercial purposes, are mandatorily taxed under the ETD. The relevant standard rates of MOT apply to all such fuel uses in the State.<\/p><p>The table below summarises the mandatory exemptions and excise duty measures for aviation fuels required under Article 14 of the Energy Tax Directive.

Pension abatement is an important aspect of the Public Service Pensions (Single Scheme and Other Provisions) Act 2012 (the Single Scheme Act).   <\/p>  <p>  The Act provides for the abatement of a public service pension where a retired public servant, whose pension is in payment, is re-employed in the public service such that no more of the pension when combined with the remuneration in the new position shall exceed the pensionable remuneration of the old position.  It should be noted that it is the pension which is abated and not the salary in the new position.  The measure applies across the public service, including the Defence Forces. <\/p>  <p>  Abatement policy remains a key component of Public Service pension policy and addresses valid concerns about simultaneous payment of both pension and salary in the Public service.  While the high level operation of abatement is monitored on an ongoing basis, there are no current plans to review pension abatement policy as it applies to specific sectors of the public service.<\/p>  <p>  There are no specific public service roles which are excluded from current pension abatement arrangements.  However, Section 52(4) of the legislation provides for a waiver of abatement, in exceptional circumstances where the position requires a person with particular training and experience and that position cannot be filled other than by the employment of the pensioner.  Applications for waivers of abatement are assessed on their own merits on a case by case basis and subject to approval by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. <\/p>  <p>  Following consideration of updated legal advice on the application of the wording of Section 52(1) of the Public Service Pensions (Single Scheme and Other Provisions) Act 2012 in the context of members of the Oireachtas, it was determined that abatement could not be applied to persons elected to the Oireachtas.  It should be noted that this advice had no implications for public servants appointed to other public service positions including former members of the Oireachtas who take up position elsewhere in the public service.  Abatement continues to be correctly applied to former Pensionable Public Servants re-employed elsewhere in the public service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070600080#WRD00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1459"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":152,"content":"<p>Question No. 51 answered with Question No. 50.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":153,"content":"<p>Question No. 52 answered with Question No. 50.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic Supports","counter":154,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070600080#WRD01200"},{"type":"question","counter":155,"qnumday":53,"qnumall":"[36576\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070600080#WRD01300","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if special leave with pay will continue from 1 July 2022 for cases of long Covid-19 beyond the period of isolation; the number of front-line workers who have availed of this payment for an extended period of 12 weeks or more; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1603","askee":"1459"},{"type":"speech","counter":156,"content":"<p>Special leave with pay for COVID-19 arrangements were introduced by my Department in March 2020 as a temporary measure in response to the unprecedented circumstances presented by the COVID pandemic.

The Government, local authorities and others are making every effort to reduce homelessness. Key to this is the delivery of new social housing and boosting overall housing supply. <\/p>  <p>  The Government is investing significantly in social and affordable housing, with record funding allocated for current and capital investment in housing this year and for the duration of Housing for All until 2030. This year, funding is in place to deliver 11,800 social homes including 9,000 new build homes; this builds on 2021 delivery of  9,183 new social homes (which was a 17% increase on 2020 delivery). <\/p>  <p>  More specifically, I have established the National Homeless Action Committee with initial key priorities being the advancement of additional measures to prevent Homelessness and of the Youth Homelessness Strategy.  <\/p>  <p>  I am working with Government colleagues and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to provide for an increase in the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) discretion rate to 35% and to expand the couple&rsquo;s rate to single persons for new tenancies. This will secure more tenancies and prevent new entries to homelessness.  Local authorities are prioritising tenancy support services, homelessness prevention and promoting the use of the Placefinder service for HAP tenancies. <\/p>  <p>  My Department has undertaken a review of Housing Delivery Action Plans, which were submitted by local authorities. These Plans include specific provision for one-bed units which are critical for exits from homelessness for single persons, and for the delivery of 4-bed units which are key in supporting exits from homelessness for larger families.  <\/p>  <p>  There will be a new Voids programme for 2022, with an emphasis on quick turnaround and re-letting of vacant social housing stock. In addition, in line with the commitment in Housing for All to support local authorities to drive take up of the enhanced Repair and Leasing scheme, the Government has recently approved a pilot expansion which will open the scheme to a wider range of owners, by removing the criterion that a property owner must be unable to fund or access funding to bring former vacant commercial and institutional buildings back into use under the Repair and Leasing scheme. These measures will increase supply of homes to those on social housing waiting lists, including those in emergency accommodation. <\/p>  <p>  Recently, I also reinstated the delegated sanction to local authorities in respect of social housing acquisitions that meet certain criteria.

In addition, the household must be deemed eligible for social housing support. The concept of the scheme is that a household with an unsustainable mortgage goes from being a homeowner to being a social housing tenant.  <\/p>  <p>  Under the MTR scheme, the borrower surrenders their property to their lender and it will be then sold to an MTR provider who can be either an Approved Housing Body (AHB) or since 2018 a private company, Home for Life Ltd. The AHB or local authority (in the case where the property is sold to a private company) becomes the landlord and the borrower remains in the property as a tenant paying a differential rent to the landlord based on his or her income.  <\/p>  <p>Mortgage to Rent is one of the solutions available to a borrower under MARP and it is not an Alternative Repayment Arrangement.  An Alternative Repayment Arrangement may be a possible solution for a borrower who has difficulty in paying their mortgage, whereby they may be able to restructure their mortgage with their lender.

In 2020, 363 Mortgage to Rent cases were completed and in 2021, 678 cases were completed.

The NPF strategy is to shift the spatial development pattern towards more regionally balanced, city-focused and compact growth, over time, and the pattern to date may be summarised under three spatial headings:- <\/p>  <p>  1) Regional Balance &ndash; this is to achieve more regionally balanced population growth, split roughly 50:50 between the Eastern and Midland Region (EMRA -which includes Dublin, Kildare, Louth, Meath and Wicklow), and the rest of the Country; <\/p>  <p>  2) City and Regional Growth Drivers &ndash; to underpin regional balance, this is to target 50% of projected population growth in the five cities as drivers of regional development, with the balance of growth targeted throughout the Country. As part of this, there are also five cross-border and regional driver towns identified in parts of the Country that are not wholly within city catchments; <\/p>  <p>  3) Compact Urban Growth &ndash; targeting 50% of new housing growth in the five cities within the existing built-up footprint, on either &lsquo;infill&rsquo; (may not have been previously developed), or &lsquo;brownfield&rsquo; (previously developed) lands. The NPF also targets 30% of new housing growth in settlements elsewhere, on infill and brownfield lands. <\/p>  <p>  Approximately 35,000 new homes per annum are required over the next 10 years. The Housing Supply Target (HST) methodology breaks this down for each local authority and enables planning and monitoring of housing delivery on a continuous, rolling basis, while also allowing for flexibility. When HST was applied to local authorities in 2021, all but one  needed to significantly increase overall housing output, with 22 out of 31 needing to do this by more than 100%.  <\/p>  <p>  CSO Data from the 3-year period 2019-21 provides early indication of the recent regional pattern of alignment.  While housing development activity has increased to more than 30,000 new homes started in 2021, just over 60% of this activity in terms of permissions and completions, as well as commencements, remains concentrated in Dublin and the EMRA region.<\/p>  <p>  While this indicates a divergence in the pattern of residential development against the NPF strategy, it reflects legacy pre-NPF County Development Plans that were in place during that period. The first round of post-NPF development plans are being adopted from 2021 and most will be completed in 2022 and 2023.  In addition, more regionally balanced, employment and skills-led and infrastructure-supported economic growth will underpin regional housing demand, but will take time to achieve, through implementation of investment set out in the National Development Plan 2021-30, in conjunction with the NPF which will be reviewed in 2023.<\/p>  <p>  While the proportion of housing commencements in Dublin as a whole in 2021 (single year) is broadly in line with the NPF target, both the proportion and level of housing growth in the four regional cities are significantly less than that targeted. Only around 30% of housing overall is being delivered in Cities and their suburbs, whereas the target is 50%, although both planning permission and commencement data indicate a shift in the pattern towards the target. Housing commencement data for Cork City in 2021 is up 86% over the preceding three years and is an early indication that the pattern is changing &ndash; there are similar positive turns in Limerick, Galway and the regional growth driver towns, albeit from a very low base in each case.  <\/p>  <p>  Within Dublin, there has been a deficit in housing starts into 2020 and 2021 below the level required to meet projected demand arising in the City. This in part continues to manifest as completions and commencements over and above the level for which there is projected local demand, in outlying counties such as Kildare, Meath and Wicklow.  <\/p>  <p>  My Department is pursuing a range of planning and housing-related policy initiatives and actions to address particular constraints surfacing on more brownfield\/urban compact growth areas. These measures are embodied in the continued implementation and roll-out of Housing for All, especially housing affordability and viability, land activation, the enhanced role of the LDA and planning reform more broadly, through the AG-led review of the Planning Act.<\/p>  <p>  In the cities and urban areas where housing development is being delivered, more compact forms such as apartments are now apparent, with apartments comprising 25% of national completions overall, 31% in urban areas as a whole and 37% of all commencements nationally, in 2021. In Dublin, 76% of housing starts were for apartment development in 2021 and the corresponding figure for the four regional cities was 42%.  The trend beyond 2021 is similar, with 61% of permissions granted in 2021 to date for apartments, including 90% in the five cities.  <\/p>  <p>  In summary, NPF compact growth targets within cities and urban areas are close to being met, but only where housing development is actually taking place in such areas.  There is still a significant gap between actual city and suburbs-focused growth and NPF targets, especially in parts of Dublin and the four regional cities, in favour of increased housing output in the commuter hinterlands surrounding the cities, in particular the counties around Dublin.  Notwithstanding an overall upward trend in terms of completions, commencements and permissions, balanced regional growth targets remain challenging, although the implementation of the NPF and the NDP are at an early stage, with most County Development Plans yet to be updated. <\/p>  <p>  National population growth is set to continue and it is apparent that current trends do not yet fully align with the development patterns envisaged in the NPF.  In that context, the recent publication of the preliminary findings of the 2022 Census at a city and county level will also be considered, in the context of review and update of the NPF, although it must be highlighted that we are still only 4 years into a more than 20 year strategy.  My officials will continue to monitor these early patterns and preliminary findings, which will inform the forthcoming review of the NPF.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070600081#WRE01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1595"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff","counter":215,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070600081#WRE02000"},{"type":"question","counter":216,"qnumday":73,"qnumall":"[36479\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070600081#WRE02100","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the estimated full-year cost of recruiting an additional three whole time equivalent architects for his Department.","asker":"1495","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":217,"content":"<p>The payroll cost of recruiting an additional 3 Architects would be &euro;125,577.56.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070600081#WRE02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Housing Policy","counter":218,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070600081#WRE02300"},{"type":"question","counter":219,"qnumday":74,"qnumall":"[36504\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070600081#WRE02400","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the other supports, if any, that are available to assist with rental payments in order for a family to avoid homelessness in the instance that the family is removed from the social housing waiting list as a result of the income threshold being met and that the family is in receipt of only a payment from the Department of Social Protection.","asker":"1468","askee":"1561"},{"type":"question","counter":220,"qnumday":77,"qnumall":"[36548\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070600081#WRE02500","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the options that are open to persons who are in receipt of illness benefit and have been advised by their local council that they are not eligible to apply for social housing; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1572","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":221,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 74 and 77 together.<\/p>  <p>  Applications for social housing support are assessed by the relevant local authority in accordance with eligibility and need criteria set down in the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 and associated Social Housing Assessment Regulations. <\/p>  <p>  It is open to anyone to apply for social housing support, irrespective of their source of income.

Recent policy priorities for cooperation have included the implementation of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325 on women, peace and security and related resolutions, the protection of civilians, and the protection of children in armed conflict.  Potential additional areas of engagement include efforts to counter cyber and hybrid threats, building on the Government&rsquo;s recent decision to participate in NATO&rsquo;s Malware Information Platform and our involvement in the Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence in Tallinn.  <\/p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s partnership is conducted via our PfP Liaison Office in Brussels. My officials meet on an ongoing basis with NATO officials to take forward work on our shared priorities. In addition, EU-NATO cooperation is a regular item on the agenda of the Foreign Affairs Council in Defence format, which I attend in my capacity as Minister for Defence. This involves regular exchanges of views with the NATO Secretary General, Jens Stoltenberg. In common with other EU Member States who are not members of NATO, Ireland recognises the importance of enhanced cooperation between the EU and NATO, particularly where it benefits international peace and security, is focused on avoiding duplication of structures, systems and interoperability standards, and adds value in combating cyber or hybrid threats.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070600082#WRF03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":282,"content":"<p>Question No. 92 answered with Question No. 91.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Passport Services","counter":283,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070600082#WRF03500"},{"type":"question","counter":284,"qnumday":93,"qnumall":"[36544\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070600082#WRF03600","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he will retrieve the tracking numbers in respect of the passport applications of two children (details supplied).","asker":"1597","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":285,"content":"<p>With regard to the specific applications about which the Deputy has enquired, the Passport Service has provided an update on the status of the passport applications to the applicants parent and provided them with the application numbers.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070600082#WRF03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":286,"content":"<p>Question No. 94 answered with Question No. 81.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":287,"content":"<p>Question No. 95 answered with Question No. 81.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":288,"content":"<p>Question No. 96 answered with Question No. 83.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":290,"content":"<p>Question No. 97 answered with Question No. 83.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":291,"content":"<p>Question No. 98 answered with Question No. 81.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":292,"content":"<p>Question No. 99 answered with Question No. 81.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":293,"content":"<p>Question No. 100 answered with Question No. 88.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":294,"content":"<p>Question No. 101 answered with Question No. 81.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":295,"content":"<p>Question No. 102 answered with Question No. 81.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":296,"content":"<p>Question No. 103 answered with Question No. 81.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":297,"content":"<p>Question No. 104 answered with Question No. 88.<\/p>"},{"type":"question","counter":299,"qnumday":105,"qnumall":"[36586\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070600083#WRG01100","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if the passports of children (details supplied) will be expedited; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1606","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":300,"content":"<p>With regard to the first application about which the Deputy has enquired, the Passport Service has provided an update to the applicant's guardian as to the steps they must take to progress the application.

Instead, alternative arrangements were put in place and those students were awarded with a Junior Cycle Certificate of Completion as well as a school report on their learning and achievement at Junior Cycle.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070600084#WRH03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Physical Education","counter":366,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070600084#WRH03200"},{"type":"question","counter":367,"qnumday":128,"qnumall":"[36516\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070600084#WRH03300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the total funding allocated by her Department to schools, both primary and secondary, to fund the specific promotion of physical health, fitness and well-being for students for each of the years 2018 to date in 2022, in tabular form; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1568","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":368,"content":"<p>The funding allocated to my Department, as set down in the annual Estimates, is used to meet costs associated with the provision of educational services in our schools and various related functions and includes salaries of teaching and non-teaching school staff, development of school infrastructure, capitation funding, grant payments to Education and Training Boards and a range of programmes and initiatives. Funding specifically for the promotion of physical health, fitness and well-being for students is not identified separately within allocations, as is the case also for other areas of the curriculum. <\/p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that these core curriculum areas are addressed across all school stages. <\/p>  <p>  In regard to PE, this is one of seven curriculum areas within the Primary School Curriculum, while in Junior Cycle it is recognised as part of the Well-being area of learning. At Senior Cycle, PE is available through both the examinable subject, Leaving Certificate PE (LCPE), and the non-examinable subject, Senior Cycle PE. Across primary, Junior Cycle and Senior Cycle level the SPHE curriculum area aims to foster personal development, health, well-being and enable young people to make healthy decisions as appropriate to the various stages.    <\/p>  <p>  Provision of physical facilities for PE and sports forms part of the accommodation brief for all new school buildings or where a major building or refurbishment project is being delivered for an existing school. Furthermore, the Government is committed to a PE Hall build and modernisation programme, starting in the second half of the National Development Plan period. This will see an increasing focus on the upgrade and refurbishment of the existing school stock to ensure that students in all post-primary schools have access to appropriate facilities to support PE provision. <\/p>  <p>  The Active School Flag initiative in primary schools and the new Active School Flag Post Primary currently being piloted also address the goal of achieving a physically educated and physically active school community. <\/p>  <p>  I want to assure the Deputy that my Department is fully committed to ensuring that Well-being is at the core of the ethos of all schools in Ireland, through the implementation of the Well-being Policy Statement. This whole school and preventative approach has multiple components that include providing children and young people with opportunities to build core social and emotional skills and competencies, experience supportive relationships within the school setting and be part of a school environment and culture that feels both physically and psychologically safe, in which they feel a sense of belonging and connectedness, that their voice is heard, and they feel supported. Embedded in the whole-school approach is the recognition that members of the school community may have different needs at different times and that a continuum of support in relation to well-being should be made available.<\/p>  <p>  Work is now ongoing to realise the vision set out in the Well-being Policy. Following an action research project involving 30 schools, the Professional Development Service for Teachers (PDST) has developed Continuing Professional Development (CPD) to support schools as they engage in a well-being promotion process. The national rollout of CPD commenced in March 2022 and is available to all schools. A dedicated well-being portal has been developed on gov.ie making available all well-being supports and resources developed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070600084#WRH03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Teacher Training","counter":369,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070600084#WRH03500"},{"type":"question","counter":370,"qnumday":129,"qnumall":"[36519\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070600084#WRH03600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if there is a pathway into the masters programme in primary teaching for graduates whose pass grade in some of the core subjects in the Leaving Certificate, although sufficient at the time their Leaving Certificate was taken, is no longer adequate for entry into primary teaching; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1549","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":371,"content":"<p>My Department specifies the minimum entry requirements in the core subjects: Irish, English and Mathematics for entry into primary Initial Teacher Education (ITE) programmes to ensure that primary teachers have the capacity to lead in these significant areas of student learning. <\/p>  <p>  All candidates, including school leavers, mature students and university graduates must hold the required level of Leaving Certificate Irish, English or Mathematics or an approved equivalent for entry into primary ITE programmes.     <\/p>  <p>In the case of an candidate who does not meet the minimum entry requirement in Irish, English or Mathematics, it is open to the candidate to repeat the Leaving Certificate Examination or pursue a course of study leading to the one of the alternative qualifications in the subject(s) concerned as outlined in the published Professional Master of Education (Primary Teaching) Entry Requirements and Procedures for 2022.

This solution will require operational, legislative, and procedural changes and will also reflect the recent recommendations of the Comptroller and Auditor General. <\/p>  <p>  Information on the project is communicated regularly to all relevant staff in the Office and the Department and the management of both are committed to supporting staff in dealing with the necessary changes.  Communication with the relevant unions is ongoing and any concerns will also be discussed in that forum.<\/p>  <p>  This change process will ultimately provide a more efficient and streamlined service for people accessing the appeals service. <\/p>  <p>  I trust that this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070600086#WRK00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Benefits","counter":431,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070600086#WRK00800"},{"type":"question","counter":432,"qnumday":150,"qnumall":"[36618\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070600086#WRK00900","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the number of persons in counties Longford and Westmeath currently in possession of a free travel pass.","asker":"1596","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":433,"content":"<p>The free travel scheme provides free travel on the main public and private transport services for those eligible under the scheme.

Foster carers are paid a weekly allowance, which is a payment to meet the needs of the child in their care. The foster care allowance is currently &euro;325 per week for a child under 12 years of age and &euro;352 per week for a child aged 12 years and over. It is paid in respect of the child and provided in order to allow foster carers to meet all of the child's daily living needs, including food, clothing, basic travel, education costs and hobbies and sports activities. The allowance is not considered as means for social welfare purposes, and is not subject to tax. <\/p>  <p>  If required, Tusla can also provide additional financial supports to foster carers through either additional or enhanced payments.<\/p>  <p>  Additional payments refers to any payment made to a foster carer that exceeds the standard rate of the fostering allowance.  Such additional payments may be made in respect of children or young people who have additional needs that are not covered by the standardised fostering allowance.  Additional payments can only be made where a child has additional medical or educational needs and when authorisation has been received from the Tusla Area Manager.   Each application for an additional payment will be accompanied by supporting documentation evidencing the need.<\/p>  <p>  Enhanced allowances for foster carers can be made when a longer term financial need is identified for additional supports for the child. A maximum of twice the weekly allowance may be paid in respect of children aged between 0-18 years if they require significant care over and above the needs of other children in foster care.  This includes children who have been diagnosed with significant special needs and require a high level of personal care and supervision.  The purpose of considering an enhanced allowance in these cases is to support foster carers in providing care to these children who have additional needs. <\/p>  <p>  The foster care allowance is in respect of and for the benefit of the foster child and therefore must be used to meet the day to day costs associated with looking after the foster child. In considering any enhanced allowance the assessing social worker is required to evidence that the standard fostering allowance does not adequately provide for the cost of caring for the child.<\/p>  <p>  A request for enhanced supports must certified by the Principal Social Worker and approved by the Area Manager following submission of an assessment of the child&rsquo;s needs and supporting documentation.  A review arrangement for the enhanced allowance must be part of the submission for approval.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the foster care allowance, foster carers receive a number of targeted supports to ensure they continue to function as a recognised and valued part of the alternative care system. Key elements of this support include a link social worker, access to training and support group meetings and the allocation of a social worker for each child in care. Respite care for children may be arranged if it is part of their care plan.<\/p>  <p>  Pre-assessment and ongoing training are compulsory for foster carers in order to equip them with the skills and knowledge to provide high quality care. Recognising the specific dynamics and the personal nature of relative care, Tusla addresses the training needs of relatives who are foster carers separately. In addition, Tusla provides funding for the Irish Foster Care Association which offers a range of supports to carers, including advocacy, mediation, training and a telephone advice service.<\/p>  <p>  The foster care allowance is one element of the support that Tusla provides to carers when they offer a home and care to children some of whom may have additional, and sometimes significant, needs. <\/p>  <p>  The rate of the foster care allowance is kept under review by officials within the Department and at present there are no plans to change the rate. However, the Department is undertaking an extensive review of the Child Care Act 1991 and will examine foster care arrangements as part of this review.   <\/p>  <p>  Further, Tusla has advised that they have recently engaged with foster carers in a consultation to inform the development of a Strategic Plan on Foster Care. Through this consultation, foster carers highlighted their view that the foster care allowance should be reviewed in light of inflation and increases in social welfare allowances. Once the Strategic Plan on Foster Care is finalised by Tusla, it will then be considered by the Department. Any decision to review the current rate of the foster allowance shall be informed by the Tusla Plan and the consultations that have preceded it. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070600086#WRK02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Strategies","counter":448,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070600086#WRK02500"},{"type":"question","counter":449,"qnumday":156,"qnumall":"[36360\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070600086#WRK02600","dept":"Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","minister":"Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","question":"the number of actions contained in the National LGBT Strategy that remain incomplete; if he will provide a list of the incomplete actions; the reason that each action is incomplete; the expected timeline for their full completion; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1550","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":450,"content":"<p>The Government is committed to achieving its vision of a safe, fair and inclusive Ireland where people are supported to flourish and to live inclusive, healthy and fulfilling lives, whatever their sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, or sex characteristics.

In designing the National Childcare Scheme, extensive research and consultations have been carried out to ensure that this goal is achieved and that the Scheme can help as many families as possible.<\/p>  <p>  In recognition of the importance of early years care and education, an Inter-Departmental Group was established in 2015 to identify and assess policy options for increasing the affordability, quality and supply of early years and school-age care and education services in Ireland. It suggested that the new, streamlined scheme should provide means-tested support towards childcare costs based primarily on income reducing the administrative burden associated with previous schemes. In this regard the scheme was designed to ensure everyone is assessed on the same consistent, equitable basis having regard to their income and their need for childcare.<\/p>  <p>  The Childcare Support Act defines what may be considered as income for the purposes of the income assessment. This includes &ldquo;income whether in the nature of a benefit or allowance arising from social welfare, social insurance or other sources of a similar character&rdquo;. This category would include payments under a settlement, covenant, estate or a payment in respect of maintenance and also child benefit.<\/p>  <p>  The basis for &ldquo;allowable deductions&rdquo; from the income assessment are as described in Schedule 1 of the Childcare Support Act 2018.

Foster carers are paid a weekly allowance, which is a payment to meet the needs of the child in their care. The foster care allowance is currently &euro;325 per week for a child under 12 years of age and &euro;352 per week for a child aged 12 years and over. It is paid in respect of the child and provided in order to allow foster carers to meet all of the child's daily living needs, including food, clothing, basic travel, education costs and hobbies and sports activities. The allowance is not considered as means for social welfare purposes, and is not subject to tax.  <\/p>  <p>  If required, Tusla can also provide additional financial supports to foster carers through either additional or enhanced payments.<\/p>  <p>  Additional payments refers to any payment made to a foster carer that exceeds the standard rate of the fostering allowance.  Such additional payments may be made in respect of children or young people who have additional needs that are not covered by the standardised fostering allowance.  Additional payments can only be made where a child has additional medical or educational needs and when authorisation has been received from the Tusla Area Manager.   Each application for an additional payment will be accompanied by supporting documentation evidencing the need.<\/p>  <p>  Enhanced allowances for foster carers can be made when a longer term financial need is identified for additional supports for the child. A maximum of twice the weekly allowance may be paid in respect of children aged between 0-18 years if they require significant care over and above the needs of other children in foster care.  This includes children who have been diagnosed with significant special needs and require a high level of personal care and supervision.  The purpose of considering an enhanced allowance in these cases is to support foster carers in providing care to these children who have additional needs.  <\/p>  <p>  The foster care allowance is in respect of and for the benefit of the foster child and therefore must be used to meet the day to day costs associated with looking after the foster child. In considering any enhanced allowance the assessing social worker is required to evidence that the standard fostering allowance does not adequately provide for the cost of caring for the child.<\/p>  <p>  A request for enhanced supports must certified by the Principal Social Worker and approved by the Area Manager following submission of an assessment of the child&rsquo;s needs and supporting documentation.  A review arrangement for the enhanced allowance must be part of the submission for approval.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the foster care allowance, foster carers receive a number of targeted supports to ensure they continue to function as a recognised and valued part of the alternative care system. Key elements of this support include a link social worker, access to training and support group meetings and the allocation of a social worker for each child in care. Respite care for children may be arranged if it is part of their care plan.<\/p>  <p>  Pre-assessment and ongoing training are compulsory for foster carers in order to equip them with the skills and knowledge to provide high quality care. Recognising the specific dynamics and the personal nature of relative care, Tusla addresses the training needs of relatives who are foster carers separately. In addition, Tusla provides funding for the Irish Foster Care Association which offers a range of supports to carers, including advocacy, mediation, training and a telephone advice service.<\/p>  <p>  The foster care allowance is one element of the support that Tusla provides to carers when they offer a home and care to children some of whom may have additional, and sometimes significant, needs. <\/p>  <p>  Tusla have advised that they have recently engaged with foster carers in a consultation to inform the development of a Strategic Plan on Foster Care. Through this consultation, foster carers highlighted their view that the foster care allowance should be reviewed in light of inflation and increases in social welfare allowances. When the Strategic Plan on Foster Care is finalised by Tusla, it will then be considered by the Department. Any decision to review the current rate of the foster allowance shall be informed by the Tusla Plan and the consultations that have preceded it. <\/p>  <p>  The rate of the foster care allowance is kept under review by officials within the Department and at present there are no plans to change the rate. However, the Department is undertaking an extensive review of the Child Care Act 1991 and will examine foster care arrangements as part of this review. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070600086#WRK03900","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Proposed Legislation","counter":463,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070600086#WRK04000"},{"type":"question","counter":464,"qnumday":161,"qnumall":"[36652\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070600086#WRK04100","dept":"Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","minister":"Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","question":"the status of the work Life Balance and Miscellaneous provisions Bill 2022; when he expects to bring the Bill to Government; the expected timeline for the enactment of the legislation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1577","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":465,"content":"<p>On 21 April the Government gave its approval for the drafting of a Work Life Balance and Miscellaneous Provisions Bill, the main purpose of which is to transpose elements of the EU Work Life Balance Directive and provide new rights to parents and carers in order to support a better work life balance.

In some instances, completing the necessary checks can take a considerable period of time. <\/p><p>In addition, the combined impact of the 2019 High Court judgment in the Jones case and the necessary health restrictions arising from the pandemic, has unfortunately resulted in the processing time for standard applications increasing. <\/p><p>The current average processing time for naturalisation applications is 22 months. However it should be noted that, last year, my Department made 11,512 citizenship decisions, which is the highest level since 2015. To date this year, 7,967 citizenship decisions have been made. A significant effort has been made by my Department to issue decisions on the oldest applications in the system. <\/p><p>As previously advised to the Deputy, statistics are not maintained by my Department to provide for a breakdown between EEA and non-EEA applicants. However, to be of some assistance to the Deputy, I have provided in the table below the average processing time in months for citizenship applications for the years 2015 &ndash; 2021 and to date in 2022. <\/p><p>The citizenship application process is reviewed on an ongoing basis to continually improve customer service quality. Feedback from applicants is taken on board and, as a result, a much more simplified, customer-focused and streamlined mechanism for applicants to provide their proofs of residence has recently been introduced. <\/p><p>To further speed up the processing of applications, a number of digitisation measures have also been introduced to increase efficiency in the process, including eTax clearance, eVetting and online payments. The end result of the digitisation process will be to free up more staff to focus on processing applications in a timely and efficient manner, to improve service to our customers and reduce waiting times. Additional staff have also been assigned to the citizenship team.  <\/p><p>Since the beginning of this year, new applicants for citizenship no longer have to submit their original passport with their application. Instead, they can provide a full colour copy of their entire passport, including the front and back covers. This change in practice is welcomed by our customers and is also freeing up valuable staff time that up to now has been engaged in returning passports to applicants.<\/p><p> <table>    <tr>       <th><b>Year <\/b><\/th>       <th><b>Number of Applications decided   <\/b><\/th>       <th><b>Average Processing Time (Months)<\/b><\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2015 <\/td>       <td>12,869 <\/td>       <td>7 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2016 <\/td>       <td>11,081 <\/td>       <td>6 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2017 <\/td>       <td>9,190 <\/td>       <td>7 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2018 <\/td>       <td>11,139 <\/td>       <td>10 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2019 <\/td>       <td>9,319 <\/td>       <td>12 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2020 <\/td>       <td>3,551 <\/td>       <td>13 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2021 <\/td>       <td>11,512 <\/td>       <td>23 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2022 <\/td>       <td>7,967 <\/td>       <td>22 <\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070600088#WRM03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Visa Applications","counter":559,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070600088#WRM03900"},{"type":"question","counter":560,"qnumday":193,"qnumall":"[36587\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070600088#WRM04000","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if she will provide assistance to a person (details supplied) for a visa to re-enter Ireland with the rest of their family.","asker":"1504","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":561,"content":"<p>The person referred to by the Deputy created an online Long Stay Join Family (Irish national)(Spouse) visa application on 16 February 2022.

inclusive, together.<\/p><p>The latest available diagnostic waiting list data is outlined in the document attached, which sets out waiting list data for Quarter 1 2022 for CT, MRI and Ultrasound. The HSE advises that, at present, further diagnostic scans (including cholangiopancreatography, electroencephalogram, angiogram, and bone scan), are not yet captured as part of this project. The information is only collected quarterly, and is set out in standard 3 month time bands. <\/p><p>The HSE advises that a pilot project commenced in 2016 by the HSE Acute Hospitals Division to progress the collection of national radiology waiting list data. The project has been supported by the Radiology Clinical Care Programme and has involved key stakeholders across the system including the National Integrated Medical Imaging System (NIMIS) Team, Hospital Groups, and the support of the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) for data collection and data management expertise.<\/p><p>The information that is currently being collected is presently being tested and validated at hospital, hospital group and national level and as such should not be used\/reported without the context of the caveats set out below:<\/p><p>- Data is subject to inclusions and exclusions which are documented in the Data Profile Document. This document is available from Acute Operations and has been circulated to all Hospital Groups.<\/p><p>- Data contains urgent, routine and surveillance\/planned activity which is currently not broken down in detail, as such this includes surveillance\/planned activity which may not be exceeding planned date.<\/p><p>- Data is still undergoing validation at Hospital and Hospital Group level.<\/p><p>- Data does not take into account local nuances at site level (Site profile developed to support understanding of same).<\/p><p>- The purpose of this aggregate data is to provide a National Level overview of the number of patients waiting for modalities of CT, MRI and Ultrasound.<\/p><p>- This report is not intended to be used for the active management of hospital diagnostics waiting list, local reports and mechanisms should continue to be used for the management of diagnostics waiting lists at hospital level.<\/p><p>In Q1 2022, there were a total of 236,380 patients reported on the waiting list from all sites, this represents all outpatients waiting, urgent, semi urgent, routine and planned\/surveillance (where diagnostic access is planned at particular time intervals). <\/p><p>

It is not possible to disaggregate exact spend on physical activity from that supporting other areas of prevention; there is considerable overlap. <\/i><\/p><p>The &euro;15.39 million budget for 2022 covers actions supporting local communities, through both the Healthy Ireland Fund and the new Sl&aacute;intecare Healthy Communities Programme. The Healthy Ireland Fund provides supports at local level, through Local Community Development Committees LCDCs) and Children and Young People's Service Committees (CYPSCs) at local authority level. The Local Strand of the Healthy Ireland Fund supports projects and programmes that support health and well-being, including physical activity, diet and nutrition and positive mental health, with additional focus on families and young people, and supporting people and communities living with disadvantage.<\/p><p>The Healthy Ireland Fund also supports programmes at national level, including Age Friendly Ireland, Sport Ireland, co-funding for the Department of Education's Active School Flag programme and the Healthy Ireland at Your Library programme. <\/p><p>The Sport Ireland allocation includes Healthy Ireland support for programmes for people living with a disability, including the Special Olympics Young Athletes programme. Healthy Ireland is also supporting the development of a Physical Activity Pathways in Healthcare Model in 2022, in collaboration with the HSE and Sport Ireland. This support will fund development of a programme to increase access to physical activity for people who are older, frailer, living with a disability or disadvantage, and who otherwise experience more barriers to accessing physical activity, and will include elements of physical activity prescription. <\/p><p>Healthy Ireland also participates in the DTCAGSM Sports Leadership Group, led by the Minister of State for Sport and the Gaeltacht, Jack Chambers, T.D., which guides the implementation of the National Sports Policy. <\/p><p>The Healthy Ireland Fund is also used to empower citizens to adopt healthier behaviours through various citizen engagement campaigns.  These Healthy Ireland campaigns have been running since 2018, initially with a focus on three themes; Eat Well, Think Well and Be Well, representing healthy eating, positive mental health and being active. During the Covid-19 pandemic, the <i>In This Together <\/i>and <i>Be Well<\/i>campaigns were re-purposed to provide supports for resilience, health and well-being while necessary Covid-19 restrictions were in place. The promotion of physical activity across society, in partnership with DTCAGSM and Sport Ireland, continues to be a core element of this work.<\/p><p>Healthy Ireland sponsored Operation Transformation in 2021 and in 2022, which featured a wide range of relevant themes, including healthy eating, physical activity and sport participation, quitting smoking, losing weight, mental health and men's and women's health. The programme reached approximately 450,000 viewers in 2021.<\/p><p>Several settings-based initiatives are also supported, including Healthy Campuses, Workplaces and Clubs.  Finally, the Healthy Ireland Fund is also utilised to support development of various guidelines and policies, including Healthy Eating Guidelines and Mental Health Promotion.<\/p><p>There is overwhelming evidence that investment in prevention is cost-effective in both the short and longer term. In addition to pre-existing evidence that tobacco and excessive alcohol consumption, obesity and inactivity are key risk factors for chronic disease, there is increasing evidence that healthy behaviours provide protection against infectious disease also. <\/p><p>Public health advice from the Health Information Quality Authority (HIQA) to the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET), following a wide review of published studies, concluded that &ldquo;  <i>&hellip;in general those who are overweight or obese, who smoke, who have inadequate levels of Vitamin D, are physically inactive and consume excessive amounts of alcohol are more likely to contract COVID-19 or have poorer outcomes.&rdquo;<\/i><\/p><p>Needless to say, it is unlikely that Covid-19 is the only infectious disease where adherence to public health guidelines regarding activity levels, weight and tobacco and alcohol misuse is protective. This is borne out by the scientific literature; for example:<\/p><p>- Regular physical activity can reduce the risk from upper respiratory tract infections;<\/p><p>- High levels of regular physical activity has been shown to result in 31% decreased risk of contracting infectious disease in the community;<\/p><p>- Active individuals show a 37% decrease in risk of infectious disease mortality as compared with inactive individuals;<\/p><p>- Regular physical activity has been shown to increase antibody levels post-vaccination, with these effects more marked in older adults. <\/p><p>It is clear, therefore, that national policies, such as the National Physical Activity Plan and the National Sports Policy, that seek to tackle one or more of these risk factors and to improve public health, may be even more vital in terms of protecting public health and well-being than previously realised. <\/p><p>In summary, investing in public health generates cost-effective health outcomes and can contribute to wider sustainability, with economic, social and environmental benefits.  Healthy Ireland is a core framework for the implementation of the Sl&aacute;intecare Healthy Living Pillar and provides the central platform to address the social determinants of health that impact how people live their lives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070600095#WRT03900","answer":true,"speaker":"1608"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":839,"content":"<p>Question No. 298 answered with Question No. 297.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":840,"content":"<p>Question No. 299 answered with Question No. 297.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Nursing Homes","counter":842,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070600096#WRU00200"},{"type":"question","counter":843,"qnumday":300,"qnumall":"[36515\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070600096#WRU00300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the total funding allocated by his Department to nursing homes, both state and private, to fund the specific promotion of physical health, fitness and well-being for residents for each of the years 2018 to date in 2022, in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1568","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":844,"content":"<p>The NHSS, commonly referred to as &lsquo;Fair Deal&rsquo;, is a system of financial support for people who require long-term residential care.

This Group, whose membership consisted of senior officials from the Departments of DCEDIY, Social Protection, Housing, Further and Higher Education, Health, and the Health Service Executive, has now completed its work and the draft Action Plan is currently being finalised. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070600096#WRU01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1484"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Appointments Status","counter":860,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070600096#WRU02000"},{"type":"question","counter":861,"qnumday":306,"qnumall":"[36530\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022070600096#WRU02100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reason that a person (details supplied) remains waiting for their arthritis appointments; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1557","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":862,"content":"<p>Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.

As of Friday, 1st July, approximately 75,815 eligible HSE and Section 38 staff have received payment around the country. All payments across the HSE and Section 38 organisations are being progressed by local management and each site will assess the eligibility of their staff before processing payment.

Rolling out the payment to eligible non-HSE and non-Section 38 employees is a complex task, particularly as these employees are not normally paid by the public health service, duplicate payments need to be avoided, and there are many organisations to be covered. It is hoped that information will be published shortly for those certain non-HSE\/S38 healthcare employees that are covered by the Government Decision and the process available to their employers to implement this measure for their eligible staff.

The Task Force recommended a voluntary permanent cessation scheme for the whitefish polyvalent and beam trawl fleet segments with the objective of removing 8,000 gross tonnes and 21,000 kilowatts of fleet capacity, equivalent to 60 vessels approximately.  The Task Force recommended that special provision be made for tax treatment of the decommissioning scheme payments, similar to the decommissioning scheme that operated in 2008 and that complementary measures for buy-out of off-register fleet capacity be instituted in order to lessen the risk of fishers re-entering the fleet with new vessels.<\/p>  <p>  Following discussions with the Ministers for Finance and for Public Expenditure and reform, the recommended tax measures were included in the Finance (Covid-19 and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2022, which was signed into law on 2 June 2022.  <\/p>  <p>  On 14 March 2022, a State Aid Notification for a Brexit Voluntary Permanent Cessation Scheme was submitted to the European Commission for its consideration.
