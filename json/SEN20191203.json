Also at the time, the Minister stated that there would be an investigation into the cause of this event and what was going to happen maybe in terms of flood defence to resolve this ongoing issue because it is not the first time that Coonagh and this particular part of Coonagh has been flooded.  I would like to thank the Minister because certainly when we did contact him on the day, he was very quick to respond and he came down himself to see first-hand how everybody was affected across the sporting club as well as the residents.

The Office of Public Works undertakes routine inspections of all flood defences along the Shannon Estuary.  During the routine inspection by the OPW staff of the River Shannon flood defence embankment system, damage to the sluice outfall was noted.  The function of the sluice outfall allows for the discharge of water from the area protected by the embankment to the estuary and during the high tides prevented tidal waters in the estuary from entering into the protected area.  While repair works had been started in mid-August, due to the forecast of high tides, emergency repair works were carried out on Friday, 30 August and Saturday, 31 August 2019.  Unfortunately, these temporary works failed and the water breached the embankments.<\/p> <p>The OPW has now reconstructed an embankment at the breached area and is continuing to monitor the area in its current consideration of opinion on constructing a replacement to the sluice control.  The OPW acknowledges that in trying to repair the damage to the sluice, the temporary structure did not initially provide appropriate level of protection and did lead to the flooding in the area.  I visited the area on Saturday, 1 September 2019 and I met with those affected.  I take the opportunity again to thank the affected homeowners for their ongoing support and co-operation.  The OPW was in contact with the local authorities over the weekend in question, and sandbags were provided to the affected householders and several pumps deployed to the area.  I acknowledge and pay tribute to the council and its staff and to the people who helped out in the area in response to the incident.  <\/p> <p>In trying to agree a redress for the incident, the OPW acted promptly at all times.  In the week immediately following the incident, the OPW met and wrote to those homeowners and apologised for the damage to their homes and contents caused by the situation.  In that week, the OPW offered interim payment to the homeowners directly affected by the flood event so they could locate alternative rental accommodation if required and start restoring their homes to their pre-flood conditions.  The OPW also appointed a loss adjustor to visit the affected homes in the week following the incident.  In addition, the OPW contacted the State Claims Agency, which on behalf of the State is managing the claims for those affected homeowners as well as the GAA club and the Limerick Flying Club.  The State Claims Agency is working with the homeowners affected by this event to help establish the quantum of costs in restoring the houses and the contents affected to their pre-flood position.  Many of those affected have engaged their own loss assessor, and the State is covering the cost of that service.  The loss adjustor has also visited the GAA club and the Limerick Flying Club with a view to agreeing the quantum of costs to restore their facility to pre-flood position.  Given the numbers of houses and facilities involved and for reasons of privacy and confidentiality, the OPW cannot make comment on further details in relation to this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019120300002#B00300","speaker":"1363"},{"type":"speech","time":1575383400,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

I thank the Minister of State for his attendance here today and for his willingness to engage on this important matter.  During the Order of Business last week I highlighted an immediate threat to the provision of services for members of the disability community, specifically to the services provided by the National Platform of Self Advocates.  As the Minister of State will be aware, the platform is Ireland's first disabled persons' organisation and the only one to consist of and be directed solely at people with intellectual disabilities.  It was established in 2011 by people with intellectual disabilities and has been funded by a grant from a private philanthropy organisation.  It regularly seeks to progress vital employment opportunities for its members and its national meeting in July of this year focused on that theme.<\/p> <p>Unfortunately the private funding has now ceased and in the absence of direct Government assistance, the National Platform of Self Advocates will have to close at the end of the year.  I do not have to remind the Minister of State of the vital contribution made by the platform to the comprehensive employment strategy for people with disabilities which runs from 2015 to 2024, a fact he recognised during a debate on the strategy in this House in May.  Indeed, as I understand it, the Minister of State has been a significant supporter of the platform over the past 18 months and without his intervention, the platform would have closed at the end of last year.  <\/p> <p>I seek a response to four very practical questions.  My first question is whether the Minister of State will provide clarity on whether the Government, through his Department, has committed itself to respond positively to the requests that have come from the National Platform for Self Advocates.  I accept that the answer to my next question is conditional on the answer to the first.  Will interim funding be considered that would allow the organisation the space to seek out or apply for other sources of philanthropic or private sector support?  My third question is of particular importance.  Given that the issues surrounding the impending funding deficit were known for at least 18 months, why has the situation been allowed to deteriorate to this level once again?  Finally, I ask the Minister to clarify whether Ireland will stand in breach of its obligations under the terms of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, ratified in March 2018, if it does not support the National Platform for Self Advocates in the way that I am requesting.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2250\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2250&amp;amp;pid=RonanMullen&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=03\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->As the Minister of State is aware, states, including Ireland, are obliged to establish an initiative for building capacity among disabled persons' organisations in consultation with such groups.

I agree with him on it and am well aware of the valuable work of the National Platform of Self Advocates.  I am glad to have the opportunity to address this issue on this important International Day of Persons with Disabilities.<\/p> <p>The Government is committed to providing services and supports for people with disabilities which will empower them to live independent lives, provide greater independence in accessing the services they choose and enhance their ability to tailor the supports required to meet their needs and plan their Iives.  The overarching principle governing the planning and delivery of services and supports for adults and children with disabilities is that they should be as integrated as possible with services and supports for the rest of the population.  Significant year-on-year budgetary increases in the disability sector have positively impacted on the lived experience of people with disabilities.  However, I recognise that daily challenges remain for many people with disabilities and their families.<\/p> <p>Addressing the needs and rights of people living with a disability, as well as those of their families, is a priority for the Government and my primary focus as Minister of State with responsibility for disability issues.  As the Senator rightly pointed out, the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities supports that priority through providing a comprehensive and robust framework for the realisation of rights.  The Department of Health and the HSE have responsibility for a significant number of actions under the national disability inclusion strategy, as do several other Departments.  The HSE national service plan is focused on providing supports to people with disabilities and enabling them to maximise their full potential as independently as possible.<\/p> <p>I share with my ministerial and Government colleagues a strong desire to ensure that people with disabilities are afforded every opportunity to realise their potential in every dimension of their lives.  In this regard, disability advocates have been tireless champions in shaping the way we, as a society, think about disability in the context of moving towards social inclusion being accepted as the norm.  The National Platform of Self Advocates was established in 2011 by people with intellectual disabilities and was funded by a grant from Atlantic Philanthropies.  Unfortunately, that funding ended last year when Atlantic Philanthropies ceased operation.  Since then, I have remained in regular contact with the platform to secure its immediate future through interim funding and its long-term future by trying to secure long-term Government funding.  I am in constant contact with Government colleagues to secure this funding and will continue those endeavours.<\/p> <p>In 2019, the Disability Federation of Ireland, DFI, and Inclusion Ireland will receive HSE grants of &euro;1.2 million and &euro;632,000, respectively, enabling them to ensure that the voices of people with disabilities are heard when it comes to changes in services and legislation that will improve the quality of life and participation in Irish society of people with an intellectual disability.  The role of service users in informing health and personal social service provision through advocacy is well documented.  Effective service user involvement through organisations such as DFI and Inclusion Ireland enables services to anticipate problems, address complaints, develop appropriate and effective service provision.  It guarantees that service users will be at the centre of efforts to improve the quality and safety of service provision for many years to come.<\/p> <p>On the Senator's four particular questions, I strongly support the national platform.  Over the past two years, I have provided it with interim funding and I will continue to so do until the other issue is resolved.  On the Senator's second point, I will respond positively to the organisation because it makes a valuable contribution to Irish society.  Ten days ago, I sent a cheque of &euro;5,000 to assist it.  Further interim funding will soon be issued.  As the Senator rightly pointed out, and in line with the convention, we need a group such as the National Platform of Self Advocates which is involved with mainstream disability groups such as DFI and Inclusion Ireland.  Negotiations with it are currently under way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019120300002#D00200","speaker":"1359"},{"type":"speech","time":1575383400,"counter":22,"content":"<p>Would you like to ask a brief supplementary question, Senator Mullen?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019120300002#E00100","speaker":"1384"},{"type":"speech","time":1575383400,"counter":23,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his reply.  Of course what he said after his scripted speech will be welcomed.  It was more significant than much of what was in the scripted part.  It is on the record and that is appreciated.  Obviously, the questions of when and how much will be of great interest to the platform.  I thank the Minister of State for that.<\/p> <p>My underlying concern - one I have raised previously - is about the credibility of our commitment to truly advancing participatory decision-making for people with physical and intellectual disabilities.  I am sure the Minister of State will agree with me on this point.  The dimension of people advocating for themselves is absolutely critical.<\/p> <p>On paper, our commitments are always watertight.  However, recent experience with Cuisle as well as this immediate crisis for the national platform suggests that there is still work to be done towards actively realising those commitments.<\/p> <p>Representatives of the disability voluntary sector appeared before the health committee prior to the summer recess.  Their testimony, almost to a person, was that the existing framework of support is tottering on a knife-edge of financial and institutional collapse.  In fact, to use the words of the representative from Rehab when speaking about the broader disability sector, the house is falling down.  I do not mean to be political but it is hard to avoid concurring with that assessment when we see what is happening.  Anyway, I thank the Minister of State for his response.  We obviously look forward to seeing the meat put on the bones of that response, so to speak.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019120300002#E00200","speaker":"1401"},{"type":"speech","time":1575383400,"counter":24,"content":"<p>Clearly, a central goal of the Government's disability service reform is to support people with disabilities to enable them to live independent lives in the community and to make their own choices and decisions.  The national platform, as far as I am concerned, is one of the organisations that does this effectively.  I have worked with those involved during the past three years since I became a Minister of State.  I have them as consultants, I use them as advisers and I give them some interim funding because I respect the work they do.  The key thing for me is that I respect the fact that they are disabled people speaking for the disabled and not NGOs or chief executives from big organisations.  They are on the ground themselves.<\/p> <p>In 2018 I launched the Transforming Lives report on effective participation in decision making.  Working group 3 was an inclusive group of people with disabilities, family members and organisations working with people with disabilities and the HSE representatives, thus ensuring that a broad church of opinion was heard during a comprehensive consultative process.<\/p> <p>The recommendations arising from the report offer a roadmap - this is the key argument I make with the various Departments - to the effective participation of people with disabilities in making decisions about the design and delivery of the supports they need to live their lives and to live ordinary lives.  A representative of the national platform - this is a very important thing - was a member of the strategy group and the advisory group on personalised budgets, for example, thus ensuring that their opinions were taken into account at all times.  This led to the publication of the final role.  Those involved made a positive contribution.<\/p> <p>As I outlined earlier, the Disability Federation of Ireland and Inclusion Ireland receive considerable funding from the HSE to provide advocacy services for people with disabilities.  We tried to get some of those involved in assisting in the funding issue but there is something of a blockage - I will be straight with Senator Mullen about that.<\/p> <p>It is important to avoid duplication having regard to the availability of resources.  This is a point I accept.  However, I accept that the national platform has a role to play.  As far as I am concerned, those involved have my support and I am continuing to push this within Government.  In the meantime, there is no question of it closing.  As far as I am concerned, the organisation will get the interim funding from me.  However, I am keen to see stable funding.  As the Senator rightly pointed out, we need stability in the sector.  This organisation has a fantastic three-year plan which I support and which is supportive of me.  Senator Mullen can bring this message back to the national platform: I am in there supporting it.  It will have interim funding in the coming week or so to keep it going beyond January.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019120300002#E00300","speaker":"1359"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Road Signage","time":1575383400,"counter":25,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019120300002#E00400"},{"type":"speech","time":1575383400,"counter":26,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for coming in today.  He understands this situation well.  I will set out some background to this issue for those who may not be familiar with it.  Back in the 1990s, official road signs began popping up around Enniscrone and many other towns and villages throughout the country directing people to \"Inishcrone\".<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Frank Feighan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2014\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2014&amp;amp;pid=FrankFeighan&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=03\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Since then difficulties are being posed for tourists and visitors who want to visit Enniscrone but are confused by a different spelling.  When I was growing up, Enniscrone was our local seaside area and we never knew it as anything else.  Local people have articulated these concerns over several years, rightly believing that visitors intending to come to Enniscrone have difficulty finding the place and because it is confusing end up in an entirely different place.  There has been a welcome increase in visitor numbers due to the development of the Wild Atlantic Way but, unfortunately, many businesses have said these visitors are simply getting lost.  This is due to the fact that they cannot locate the town because they are looking for Enniscrone and the sign says \"Inishcrone\".  The problem is exacerbated by satnavs or Google Maps, which we all use in our vehicles, because many recognise only Inishcrone as opposed to Enniscrone.  The local economy is losing out. <\/p><p>These mounting concerns have led a strong community campaign, which has been lobbying for one placename spelling to be used consistently across the board.  Thankfully, this issue will be resolved through the use of a plebiscite, where local people will have their say on a preferred placename, to be carried out by Sligo County Council.  As part of the local campaign, I have made numerous representations to the Minister of State.  This included facilitating a meeting at the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment between the chief stakeholders and the Minister.  The Minister of State has been engaged on this important issue.  Certain legal work has to be completed in order that the plebiscite can be held.  I understand that legal provisions require updated regulations for the holding of plebiscites to change placenames.<\/p><p>I attended a public meeting well over a year ago.  There must have been 500 or 600 people there and the vast majority want this addressed as soon as possible.  I look forward to hearing the Minister of State's reply.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019120300002#E00500","speaker":"1424","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1575383400,"counter":28,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this important matter.  The name by which people know their own locality or by which others recognise it is pretty fundamental.  As well as being a beautiful place, Enniscrone is a popular destination.  It has been for years but, as the Senator pointed out,  it has benefited in recent years from the Wild Atlantic Way and golf tourism in particular.<\/p> <p>The changing of placenames should be possible at local level through a democratic process.  I fundamentally believe in the right of the residents of any area to be involved in resolving issues such as this.  This is also consistent with the spirit of a associated placename provisions in enactments given effect over the years by the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Placenames are a core part of people's identity and people hold strong views concerning the proper representation of a local placename.  A placename may also be a means by which, as the Senator pointed out, a town, village, or area is more widely recognised and markets itself to visitors.  It is, therefore, appropriate that there should be a mechanism or process that allows local people to express their views on such a matter.  <\/p> <p>Sligo County Council has contacted officials in the Department and expressed an interest in holding a plebiscite to determine the official placename that should be assigned to the town of Enniscrone.  As the Senator will be aware, I met a delegation of concerned residents from the area a few months ago.  Following the enactment of the Local Government Act 2019, provisions under Part 18 of the amended Local Government Act 2001 relating to the change of names of areas were finally commenced.  The commencement of these provisions allows for new regulations to be given effect for the holding of local plebiscites for the purpose of changing placenames.  My Department has prepared draft regulations for this purpose.  However, during the drafting process, a further complication and legal concern was identified regarding the interaction of this Part and provisions relating to placenames under Part 5 of the Official Languages Act 2003, which is under the aegis of my colleague, the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Madigan.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy John Paul Phelan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2004\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2004&amp;amp;pid=JohnPaulPhelan&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=03\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I have now received legal advice on the matter that it would not be possible under Part 18 of the Local Government Act 2001 to change a placename in a non-Gaeltacht area that is the subject of a placenames order under Part 5 of the Official Languages Act 2003.  The Department's legal unit has contacted its counterpart in the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht to invite its observations on the matter.  I have also spoken to the Minister, Deputy Madigan, and the Minister of State, Deputy Kyne, about it.  It is intended that both Departments jointly will seek the further advice of the Office of the Attorney General.  If there is an unintended conflict between the two separate statutory frameworks, it may be necessary to resolve the matter by additional amendments to the relevant provisions before giving effect to the regulations for the holding of local plebiscites.  I know this is a further complication and delay but it is better to ensure that the process we undertake in the form of a plebiscite would be legally supported.  Now that there is some further clarity on the complex legal issues involved, contact has been made between in the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government and those in the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, as I have said.  The aim is to try to seek agreement in principle as to how to proceed so that the matter can be resolved.  In this regard, I understand that a potential piece of legislation is on the schedule and that there is an Official Languages (Amendment) Act that on the parliamentary schedule.  The Department's policy objective is that it should be possible for a plebiscite to be held in any area to change a placename.  The same mechanism for doing so should apply everywhere in Gaeltacht and non-Gaeltacht areas.  Resolving this matter will allow the Department to make necessary regulations to allow the people of Enniscrone to have a say in the naming of their locality.<\/p><p>Senator Feighan is right to point out that there are other examples around the country where the provision of new signposting maybe 20 years ago resulted in names being used that were not the names that people locally recognised or at least not spelled in the manner the people locally would recognise.<\/p><p>I will conclude by welcoming the Senator's long-standing interest in the matter.  I will certainly keep him informed and updated with regard to any changes that may need to be made in the law by means of the amending legislation coming before the Oireachtas soon.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019120300002#F00200","speaker":"1265","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1575383400,"counter":30,"content":"<p>This has gone on quite a long time.

The Minister of State is welcome to the House.  I thank him for taking time to be here.  Ballybay community college applied for an extension to its school facilities in 2015.  The extension incorporated two classrooms, a science room and a science preparation area.  The school has been waiting patiently for some years for some good news from the Department.  Along with the local councillor for the area, the current cathaoirleach of Monaghan County Council, Seamus Coyle, I have raised this issue on numerous occasions, most recently three weeks ago, with the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy McHugh.  Yesterday, I requested that a Commencement debate on the matter be arranged for this afternoon and I am pleased it is going ahead.<\/p> <p>Ballybay community college is a successful school with more than 338 students.  The numbers, thankfully, are increasing year on year.  The school is located in the centre of County Monaghan and caters for a wide catchment area.  The school has a great record on the academic front and on the sporting field.  Last year the school won an all-Ireland football championship title for post-primary schools.  The school is very successful and is blessed with excellent, dedicated and hard-working teachers under the guidance of principal, Moyah Lynch, and deputy principal, Conall &Oacute; Grianna.  The school is progressing at a great rate.<\/p> <p>I understand the Minister of State may have some good news for us this afternoon.

I know he has been to the forefront of promoting this project for a long period.  On behalf of the Minister, Deputy McHugh, I wish to outline to the House the current position regarding a new building project for Ballybay community college.  I can confirm to the Senator that my Department has received a request from Cavan and Monaghan Education and Training Board, CMETB, for additional accommodation for Ballybay community college.  The request has been given careful consideration.  In that respect, I am pleased to inform the House that approval has been given for the provision of a stand-alone extension to the existing accommodation of the school.  As the Senator correctly said, this extension will include two general classrooms, a science lab and a science preparation area.  The project is being funded under my Department's additional accommodation scheme.<\/p> <p>As is usual with such projects, its delivery has been devolved to CMETB.  It is being progressed with a view to resolving the issues referred to by the Senator and to increasing the accommodation that it currently occupies.  Under my Department's additional accommodation scheme, the next step in progressing this project is for the CMETB to arrange for a consultant to carry out the work necessary to bring it through the various stages of architectural planning and onwards through construction in due course.  The board will also engage with the Department at various stages in the process in that context.  The first stage in the process will be the completion of a detailed design for the project.  In accordance with the terms and conditions of the scheme, the CMETB will be required to seek approval from the Department at this stage, namely, stage 2(a), of the design process.  The Department will review the designs presented to it in that respect.  Subject to the Department being satisfied with these proposals, it may then authorise the board to proceed to lodge a planning application for the project.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy John Halligan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2315\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2315&amp;amp;pid=JohnHalligan&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=03\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The CMETB will then bring the project through the planning process and may need to revert again to the Department, depending on the outcome.  At that stage, subject to departmental approval and the tender process, the board and its consultant will proceed to tender for the contractor to carry out the building works.  This project will supersede an earlier project, which, as the Senator will be aware, was for the provision of a science laboratory and preparation area only.  This project had been approved but could not proceed due to the significant cost and design challenges.  The entire approved provision for the project is now included in the revised provision.  I am delighted to make this announcement.

I acknowledge that it is halfway through the school year now but, if we are having a debate such as the one I am proposing, it should be had in a timely manner to give the Department a chance to prepare for such a scheme.  The cost of bringing in free schoolbooks would be 0.2% of the overall Department's budget.  It is a small thing that would be really valuable.

The Leader is aware that the programme for a partnership Government mentions it.  This is very important legislation that needs to be enacted.  There are things that could happen in the meantime, in particular with regard to the Standards In Public Office Commission, SIPO, which called for an electoral commission and legislation to deal with digital political campaigns and finance from outside this State and its impact on elections.  According to SIPO, the unregulated nature of social media campaigns \"allows for foreign actors to influence Irish elections and referendums, with potentially significant consequences\".  These actors do not even have to be foreign.  We know what is happening in here in terms of social media.  The Leader has spoken about it.  There are a significant amount of things happening in or around this area that influence the outcome of elections.  It is important that we have an electoral commission.  I spoke to a number of people who were involved in the by-elections who told me that the register is out of date by about 20 years.  A man in Wexford told me that he was told on one doorstop that the only two people entered on the register for that house had been dead for 15 years so we clearly have a lot of work to do with regard to cleaning up the register.  <\/p><p>We also have a lot of work to do in terms of engaging with, educating, encouraging and supporting people to engage in the political process.  This is a challenge for everyone in politics.  How can we get young and old people - all people - to engage in this process and make them feel that the question of who they put into Parliament is relevant to their lives?  It is important for us to have an independent electoral commission regardless of what type of election is involved.  I know the Government has committed to it and I also know that time is running out.  I would like something like a memorandum or update on where we with regard to this legislation because it is important.  I do not think anyone in either House disputes the need for an independent electoral commission because it is critically important.  <\/p><p>It is time for us to have a debate again about how we can engage with young people.  I have always been an advocate of allowing 16 year olds to vote in elections.  They are much more sophisticated than we were at that age.  They have much more access to information.  It is not always accurate information but it is information.  I read some commentary in the press today regarding allowing 16 year olds to register in order that they are registered on the system.  I think that is good but it is important that we revisit the question of giving them the vote.  Traditionally, Fine Gael led in this area.  Many years ago, the Young Fine Gael organisation was a great advocate for it.  Some of these people are now Members of the Seanad and D&aacute;il.  They led the way in terms of advocating for young people to engage in the political process.  It is important so I would like a debate at some point on how we can get 16 year olds in.  My focus today is on whether we can start and get this independent electoral commission up and running because it will serve democracy, the parliamentary process and the body politic well and is something with which we need to push ahead.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019120300002#N00400","speaker":"1379","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1575383400,"counter":47,"content":"<p>I extend my condolences to the families of Jack Merritt and Saskia Jones, who were both killed in the London Bridge attack.

We cannot merely pay lip-service to these issues.  We have to work on them.  We cannot say we agree with something and then do nothing about it.  There is a job of work to be done here.

In his opening address to the UN committee, the Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality, Deputy Stanton, stated that \"Ireland has also looked outwards with regard to its international obligations towards those fleeing conflict and persecution\", and that Ireland has \"developed family reunification initiatives to enable families and communities to bring to Ireland relatives living in areas of conflict.\"  This is not quite correct, or at least not correct according to the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC, which stated in an independent report on Ireland's compliance with the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, which was published last week that it has \"serious concerns regarding retrogressive measures on family reunification introduced in the International Protection Act 2015 that limit the statutory right to family reunification to members of the nuclear family, and requires family reunification applications to be made within 12 months of the grant of refugee or subsidiary protection status &ndash; a timeframe that is impossible for many refugees.\"<\/p> <p>My International Protection (Family Reunification) (Amendment) Bill 2017 offers a pathway forward in line with the IHREC report.

This would be a quick and easy step for the Government to take as the Bill has passed all Stages in this House and Second Stage in the D&aacute;il in December last with sizable majorities.  If there are improvements to the Bill from a Government perspective, these can be worked out on Committee Stage.  A money message for the International Protection (Family Reunification) (Amendment) Bill 2017 will allow us to expeditiously move forward and take prompt action on our responsibilities to refugees under the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination.  If passed, this Bill would bring the State into line with UN CERD obligations and would mean a great deal to people who are desperately seeking to reunite with family members.  I refer to people such as Mr. Izzeddeen Alkarajeh, who submitted a statement to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice and Equality for the detailed scrutiny of the International Protection (Family Reunification) (Amendment) Bill 2017 which took place in February last and who is desperately seeking to reunite with his mother who is in a very dangerous situation in Palestine.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Colette Kelleher:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2484\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2484&amp;amp;pid=ColetteKelleher&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=03\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->At a time of rising anti-immigration sentiment, it is important that we as legislators reaffirm our commitment to welcoming people in need of international protection with openness and warmth.

Many of these issues have also been raised in the Joint Committee on Key Issues affecting the Traveller Community, which I chair.  The UN rapporteur for CERD, Dr. Shepherd, commented favourably on the Traveller Culture and History in Education Bill 2017, which has passed all Stages in the Seanad.  We need to progress this Bill and pass it through the D&aacute;il, as the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy McHugh, promised on 16 October.  The passing of this Bill would be yet another brownie point for the Minister and the State and a step forward for Ireland in fulfilling its UN obligations.

Today, a number of people were here protesting about changes made by the Department of Justice and Equality to the circumstances and way in which bingo is operated in various centres in the country.  All of that is dealt under the Gaming and Lotteries Act, as amended.<\/p> <p>The simple fact is that there is a far more serious issue that is not being addressed at all.  I refer to the flagrant breaches of the law being perpetrated daily on our main streets in our main cities - Cork and Dublin I believe - whereby casinos, gaming arcades and amusement arcades are being operated without any appropriate legal foundation whatever.  In the city of Dublin the local authority, many years ago, resolved to cancel authority for amusement machines, one-armed bandits and gaming machines being operated in arcades in the city.  A case went to the Supreme Court about it.  The Supreme Court upheld the decision of the local authority and held that the operation of these machines in Dublin, thereafter, was illegal.  Since that time a number of these arcades, amusement places or casinos, as they call themselves on the outside, have cropped up now and are open.  One of them, I am reliably informed, has in its entrance an ATM machine.  This is absolutely illegal.  There is no possible basis for opening and maintaining these places.  They are exploiting the weak-minded, in my view, in an unconscionable way but, most important, they are breaking the law of the land.  Members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have the right to visit premises and seize gaming machines, which are being operated illegally.  That should happen right across Dublin.  The Garda authorities in Dublin are not doing that.  If this is being done on the advice of the Attorney General then I would like see why it is that a clear breach of the law of the land is being countenanced by the Attorney General.  If it is not being done on the advice of the Attorney General then it amounts to a gross dereliction of duty. <\/p> <p>Finally, I want to say that an awful lot of terrible misery arises from a gambling addiction.  Gaming machines, such as they have in Britain all over the place and in Ireland in certain restricted places, subject to the entitlement of local authorities to decide locations, are an easy entry into addictive gambling.  It is about time that the law was upheld.  It is about time these places were closed.  I would like the Leader to ask the Minister for Justice and Equality to come to this House and explain why it is that in the city of Dublin casinos and amusement arcades, with these machines, are operating flagrantly in breach of the law of the land?

Parents and children are frantic, and we need an immediate solution for next year.  September of next year will be along before we know it.  Parents are going to go through Christmas uncertain as to what lies ahead for their children.  They want their kids to be able to go to the same school as their friends who they have been in school with for the last number of years.  The clubs in Skerries want to ensure that they do not lose these children to other communities because they have to travel somewhere else to a secondary school.<\/p><p>What I am really asking for is for the Minister to ensure that this work starts as soon as possible before Christmas because this is not something that can wait.

The first was the data on private fee-paying schools.  We see that they still have a very strong grip on the most sought-after third level courses.  Half of the 25 schools which sent the highest proportion of their students to third level this year were fee-paying schools.  I would ask the Leader to reflect on the fact that while we invest &euro;60 million on DEIS schools, taxpayers lavish &euro;90 million on private fee-paying schools to pay for salaries.  To put that in perspective, even the British Tory Party - perhaps the most right-wing bunch of nutters we have come across in recent years - does not ask for private fee-paying schools to be subsidised by the taxpayer.  Apparently, this Government continues to do so.<\/p><p>I also want to highlight the special assignee relief programme, because we saw the figures released there, including a &euro;28 million subsidy to some of the richest people in the State, millionaires who get 30% tax relief on income over &euro;75,000.

This is a consequence of the enormous development that is taking place in the Drogheda and east Meath area.  Indeed, there will be future development.

The Tara Mines allowance is worth &euro;1,132 to those who work underground and &euro;655 to surface workers.  These are legitimate expenses accrued by them in the course of their work.  There are legitimate expenses that small business owners and sole traders are allowed to recoup from the Revenue Commissioners to allow them to do their business, but now the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Finance are going after the small expense allowances enjoyed by PAYE workers.  This must stop now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019120300002#U00200","speaker":"1398"},{"type":"speech","time":1575383400,"counter":91,"content":"<p>Today is International Day of Persons with Disabilities.

In the same way one would sympathise with a person who did not do the lotto on the weekend his or her favourite six numbers were picked out, we ought to sympathise with the person who would have won the fifth by-election that would have taken place in Cork North Central had the incumbent resigned and the Taoiseach moved the writ.  I suspect the unknown winner would probably have been Senator Colm Burke, who is present.  I am sure his day will come.  I congratulate him on his performance.<\/p> <p>I wish to support the amendment to the Order of Business in respect of St. Joseph's in Shankill, the largest dementia-only care home in Ireland.  As Senators are aware, it employs more than 100 people and offers 60 residential places.  In supporting the amendment, I appeal to the Leader to convey to his Government colleague, the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, the deep sense of alarm being created by the absence of a resolution or agreed way forward with the National Treatment Purchase Fund.  New admissions are being discontinued and there is to be day care only.<\/p> <p>As I understand it, the St. John of God hospital group has been covering the financial shortfall from its resources and has spent &euro;7 million covering debt since 2012, mainly due to upgrading facilities and increasing staff numbers to meet HIQA regulatory requirements.  It is clear that St. Joseph's and the St. John of God Order have been making every effort to keep this vital lifeline open.  The value of the service provided by St. Joseph's and the respite it offers cannot be overestimated.  It is fair to state we have known for some time that it has been facing a financial crisis which has been mainly attributed to the fact that the day care rate set by the HSE has not increased since 2006.  It is very important that we focus on that issue in the Seanad and I ask the Leader to convey our concern to the Minister.  <\/p> <p>On the somewhat related issue of Cuisle, I have not been playing politics.  I have no interest in giving an advantage to one political party over another.  However, I must state I was deeply disappointed by the response of the Minister of State in the House last week because, as Senator Leyden pointed out, he washed his hands of the issue like Pontius Pilate.  I used that phrase myself.  The Minister of State stated Cuisle does great work but it was up to others to make the decision.  That is not what being in power is about.  Rather, it is about deciding the matter should be sorted out, recognising that one cannot intervene directly and others must make the decision but ensuring one's preference is conveyed to them.  That ministerial clout can make all the difference.  That has not been done in the case of Cuisle, which is very regrettable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019120300002#W02000","speaker":"1401"},{"type":"speech","time":1575383400,"counter":163,"content":"<p>Today we found out from the Programme for International Student Assessment, PISA, which is published every three years, that Ireland ranked fourth out of the 36 OECD countries for the education of children.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator M&aacute;ire Devine:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2468\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2468&amp;amp;pid=MaireDevine&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=03\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We should be proud of our education system in enabling our children to reach such high standards.

When it comes to reading, science and mathematics we are out-performing other OECD countries.  As I said, we ranked fourth out of 36.<\/p><p>Gender balance and gender attainment produced interesting results.  Significantly, girls out-perform boys in reading but boys are holding their own in science and mathematics, where there are no significant differences.  It gives us an insight into our youth, their interests and what we are doing.  The low Internet use reported in Ireland is important.  Students here use school books.  It seems that they are less likely to report the negative feelings that heavy Internet users report.  One thing that is somewhat concerning is the data on their well-being.  Some three-fifths of teens said that they were not satisfied with their lives.  That is above the overall average.  They are significantly less satisfied than the average in OECD countries.<\/p><p>In July last year, the former Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Bruton, launched the well-being policy statement and framework for practice in schools, clearly outlining the strong policies and actions that need to be in place to ensure students' sense of belonging.

Last week the Taoiseach referred at the American Chamber of Commerce lunch to changing rules to enable spouses of US citizens who have a work permit to also work here.  This is a more general issue and it is important that we address it.  We are wasting a huge amount of talent among people who are not allowed to work.<\/p> <p>I renew my request to the Leader for Government time to debate Committee Stage of our Labour Party Bill to enable residency and citizenship status to be given to children born in Ireland whose parents are not Irish citizens.  We in Labour have been pushing this with the Migrant Rights Centre, the Immigrant Council of Ireland and others.  It is very important that over Christmas, families have certainty about immigration and residency status, in particular when they have children who have been born and brought up here and who know no other home.  At the very least they should be given clarity on their residency status.  Our Bill would give them a pathway to citizenship.

The first called on that council to prepare research on a change in constitutional status and future planning, and the impact that might have on the economy and prosperity of the city.  It is a very prudent and responsible decision that is planning for a future change adopted by a majority vote.  It is an example to other institutions the length and breadth of the island not to retreat from this necessary debate on planning but to engage positively and collaboratively.  That has been the view across the Chamber here.  Regardless of where we come down on the constitutional question and its nuances, we all agree that it is responsible, shows leadership and is necessary to engage in the preparations in an inclusive way.  I reiterate my call for that discussion.  The Seanad can act as a positive representative forum and place for that moving forward.<\/p> <p>The second motion agreed at Belfast City Hall last night was in favour of writing to An Taoiseach and the British Secretary of State asking them to outline the conditions and scenario under which a referendum on our constitutional future can be called.

At this crucial juncture in our political and societal life it would be positive if, immediately the Taoiseach could outline what his and the Government's understanding is of how those criteria can be met.

Senator Kelleher raised a very important issue concerning the family reunification Bill.  I do not have a response for her but I would be happy to discuss the matter with her.<\/p><p>Senators Humphreys, Bacik, Nash and Mullen raised the issue of Saint Joseph's, which is a very important one.  I must advise Senator Mullen that it is not the HSE that sets the rate, it is the National Treatment Purchase Fund.  The rate has been increased by the NTPF.  The Government has increased the funding to Saint Joseph's and I believe there has been positive engagement between the HSE and the chief executive of Saint Joseph's with a view to closing it.  I listened to Senator Humphreys's comments about the unit's imminent closure in January.  I do not want to divide the House on the proposal, in the same way as I did not last week on Cuisle.  It is a very important matter.  It is one the Minister spoke about in the D&aacute;il this afternoon.  I do not have an accurate transcript of what he said.  I am committed to bringing the Minister to the House.  The line Minister with responsibility for the issue is the Minister is the Minister of State, Deputy Daly.  Neither he nor the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, is available at the time suggested by Senators, but if they are agreeable I will endeavour to have them in some time today or tomorrow.  It is the prerogative of Members to call a vote but I am trying to work with them.<\/p><p>Members of the House raised the issue of Cuisle last week.  To be fair to Senator Hopkins, I should put on the record that she was the first Member of this House to raise the matter.  Others followed suit.  I have never divided the House on the matter.  I avoided a vote last week on bringing the Minister to the House.  It is a matter for the Irish Wheelchair Association, which has taken a decision to close the centre.  Senator Mullen has made the pertinent point that some direction should be given to encourage and support the opening of the centre by the Irish Wheelchair Association.  His contribution was far more helpful than the blatant politicisation of the issue by Senator Leyden.  The points Senator Mullen made are ones on which we should perhaps reflect and bring back to the Minister, the HSE and the Irish Wheelchair Association because it is about ensuring that those service users who want to be able to avail of the service and their families can have such a service.  I will be happy to go back to the Minister to inform him of what was said.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019120300002#Z01800","speaker":"1391","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1575383400,"counter":191,"content":"<p>If Fianna F&aacute;il was in government it would not close.

It is a relief on salaries between &euro;75,000 and &euro;1 million.  We know for a fact that some of those who benefit from the scheme have salaries of over &euro;3 million.  I recognise that they only get the special tax relief on that part of their salary between &euro;75,000 and &euro;1 million.  However, we have to look to the conversation which many people across the world are having around the pooling of extremely high levels of income equality at the very top.  We are not talking about people who have two families or who are on &euro;100,000.  We are talking about people on salaries of between &euro;1 million and &euro;3 million.  When 50% of people in the country earn incomes well under &euro;30,000, how can we justify massive amounts of tax relief for those at the top?<\/p> <p>There has been a conversation globally as to whether we need a higher level of tax or a third band.  The conversation from the Government is always that we are focusing too much on these higher earners and we cannot look at a wealth or a higher band of tax.  People are not aware that it is not simply that we are not putting an extra level of tax on the very highest earners in the State but we are actually giving them tax relief.  This means that somebody earning between &euro;40,000 and &euro;60,000 will pay a higher portion of their wages in tax than somebody on &euro;600,000.  This is simply not acceptable.<\/p> <p>The defence given is that this is basically to attract jobs to Ireland.  The fact is that those who are in a position to create jobs and are high earners are provisionally already benefiting from our corporate tax rate, which has continued support across the field.  We have corporate tax rates to attract corporations.  Tax reliefs like the knowledge box need to be reviewed to ensure they are more efficient and effective.  For example, if we are giving major international corporations tax reliefs, surely, we should not also be giving tax reliefs to every one of their executives.  The public would be shocked and appalled if they realised how this was going.<\/p> <p>I have an example of one individual who would pay &euro;111,000 less in tax next year than a PAYE worker who was earning the same salary.  That is some PAYE worker.  However, there is a real issue of equity involved.<\/p> <p>IMF research over 30 years in over 100 countries has consistently shown that when one increases the incomes of the top 10%, national GDP falls.  When one increases the incomes of the bottom 10% in society, however, then the economy does better.  That same IMF report states the trickle-down effect does not work.<\/p> <p>I hope the Minister of State will reconsider section 9.  If not, will he clarify what evidence there is for a job dividend from each person who is benefiting from the scheme and how we can be sure that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019120300002#EE00100","speaker":"1405"},{"type":"speech","time":1575383400,"counter":240,"content":"<p>Sinn F&eacute;in opposes this measure because of its cost.

The Government has provided only &euro;5 million for lone parents supports and &euro;18 million to increase medical card thresholds and alleviate the waiting lists for home help, for which we costed an allocation of &euro;59 million into our alternative budget, yet it is likely to give away &euro;105 million under this scheme, of which 1,084 employees availed in 2017.  This is a transfer of wealth from people who can least afford it to people who can afford it.

She did not refer to the &euro;20 billion budget for social protection.  The Senator gave a concocted figure of &euro;105 million for SARP without saying where it came from.  The figures I am giving come from the Indecon report.  It showed that the companies that availed of SARP for their employees in 2017 paid &euro;2.5 billion in corporation tax.  If we want to pay our bills, fund the health service and retain the social protection budget, we have to bring in the moneys that enable us to do so.  These companies employed more than 155,000 people directly and, for every employee, another is employed indirectly as part of the supply chain.  They also paid &euro;1.9 billion in PAYE taxes.  The cost to the State of the SARP scheme of which they availed was &euro;28 million in 2017, set against the &euro;4.4 billion paid directly by those companies to the Exchequer, which makes up some of our public service expenditure budget.  I would love to say that we do not need this programme but the reality is that the countries with which we are in competition for foreign direct investment have their own SARP schemes.

When it comes to smaller-ticket measures that come under the social protection budget, for example, we have to look at their exact impact and prove their benefit up, down and sideways if we want to see them extended or improved slightly.  It is a cause for concern that a scheme that cost &euro;28 million in 2017 - a not insignificant sum -  is being continued into next year without there being any information on what it cost in 2018 and 2019.  Any measure that is costing taxpayers almost &euro;30 million should be reviewed and we need to know what is happening with it.<\/p> <p>The figure Senator Conway-Walsh gave is an extrapolation of a percentile increase and was offered in the absence of actual numbers being given, which they should be in respect of any such decision.  The Minister of State makes the case for our corporation tax regime and the measures we have in place to attract corporations, referring to the &euro;2.5 billion in corporation tax paid by the companies in question.  However, it is a broad brushstroke to point to the taxes raised and the numbers employed and then make a causal link between that contribution and what amounts to a sweet set of deals for executives.   Let us bear in mind that tax relief is tax expenditure.  Is it the Minister of State's view that if the State did not give executives a massive subsidy from general taxation to encourage them to come to Ireland, then all of these companies would leave?  Is that how fragile our relationship with them is?  Surely the focus should be on investing in ecosystem supports and structures for foreign direct investment, which is not just about corporation tax but all the other aspects, as well.  These are important questions.<\/p> <p>I have two final questions for the Minister of State.  Does he agree that this scheme is inconsistent with the principle of progressive taxation and the sustainable development goals?  It is difficult to justify a measure that, instead of benefiting the bottom 40% of taxpayers, clearly benefits the top 10%, as shown by the international research to which I referred.  It is not enough to say that we want to encourage corporations to invest in Ireland.  Where tax relief deals are available, people will avail of them.  The Minister of State needs a much stronger evidence base for claiming a link between these measures and encouraging foreign direct investment.

I would love everybody to be on the same level, but if we are trying to attract a company to this country that will employ hundreds or thousands of people, the chief executive could say: \"There is no problem getting paid by my company but your levels of income tax are penal for high earners so I will go somewhere else.

It is extraordinarily poor practice for a CEO or senior executive to decide to move the company to the Netherlands, Ireland or Lithuania based a cushier cash deal for the CEO and his or her top five or six executives.  If that is the decision making, there are big questions.  It is shaky ground.  On Irish people who are returning, one must question the patriotism of people earning &euro;3 million who will not locate or contribute to the country to which they are supposed to be so attached unless they get a hefty tax relief.  They pay less tax than somebody on &euro;40,000 for the section of their income between &euro;75,000 and &euro;1 million.

The extraordinary hollowing out of our income tax base that is going to the very wealthy in Ireland is galling.  It is not a gesture of solidarity with those on &euro;40,000 because it is the people on &euro;40,000 who are paying 40% on all of their income above the threshold who are paying for this.  It is not a zero-sum game; it is tax expenditure.  People on &euro;40,000, &euro;50,000 and &euro;60,000 are paying for those on &euro;1 million under this provision.

It does not really matter to me very much what the internal thought processes of those people are; it is about the practical effect on the Exchequer in the long run.  That is the crucial question.  When I say that, I am not being cynical at all.  For instance, we had a very close shave very recently with the proposal to change the 183-day residency qualification to allow very rich people to fling a few euro at this, that or the other by way of philanthropy and get a further exemption in terms of the number of days for which they could stay.  That was very nearly enacted.  The then Minister for Finance seemed to be favourably disposed towards it in an Oireachtas committee considering a Finance Bill.<\/p> <p>Like Senator Higgins, I strongly believe we should have a fairer tax system.  I believe equally strongly that we should not have a system that distinguishes between Irish citizens radically depending on their financial circumstances or what they have done in the past while.  My theory is that an Irish citizen should be liable to some basic tax in Ireland, no matter where he or she lives in the world, if he or she has qualifying assets in Ireland or qualifying interests in assets in Ireland.  Thus, one could not just emigrate to a tax haven and pay nothing in tax to the Irish Exchequer.  That is my strong view.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019120300002#HH02500","speaker":"1403"},{"type":"speech","time":1575383400,"counter":307,"content":"<p>We are on section 9.

By doing so, even at that stage, when tax rates were not as high as they were after the economic crisis, he quintupled the yield from the tax.  One could say, if one wanted to be theoretical or ideological about it, that those making a very large capital gain should pay just as much as their secretaries or personal assistants on relatively modest salaries, or at least as much as they do in terms of marginal earnings since they are better off in that financial year on that basis.  The bottom line, however, is that the Exchequer yield went up by 500%.  All of the additional money was available to be spent by way of redistribution.  Having said what I said about citizens and not escaping completely the obligations of citizenship by becoming non-resident for tax purposes, I believe the yardstick we should apply to questions such as this is not an ideological one but a pragmatic one.  Forgetting about patriotism, if it is the judgment of those who study these things minutely and interact with foreign investors in Ireland that the total yield to the Irish Exchequer will increase by offering the kind of relief in question.  Anybody who suggests it is immoral or unprincipled should ask what might be done to get the money from the particular company in a way that would finance extra hours for home helps and the like at the end of the year.

I do not want to mention the names, but many of them are now becoming the modern multinationals.  Second, I want entrepreneurs to come to Ireland.  We are seeing it in the university sector.

My core issue is not with the measures concerning the extension, which relate to part-time, flexible working arrangements, although there is also a question mark over the movement between qualifying companies within the group.  My concern is that the KEEP scheme effectively allows for employees to take a large portion of the emoluments they receive for their work in a company in the form of shares and thereby reduce the taxation they pay on the income derived.  It is a really key concern as it benefits only those in private companies because it relates to companies that have shareholdings and where shares are an issue.  It does not benefit those working in the public service.  Persons may choose to have up to 50% of their wages paid in the form of stocks or share options.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=03\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->For example, they could get up to &euro;100,000 a year in stock and share options and up to 50% of the total emoluments could be treated and take the form of shares.  This is a real concern because it is another measure that means people will potentially be paying less tax to the Exchequer relative to their income because they are paying the rates for shares and stocks which, while they might be caught elsewhere, are not caught at the same rate, rather than as income.  I am concerned that we are creating a perverse incentive whereby we are encouraging people to move from a model of payment as income to a model whereby they will be getting portions of their income as shares.<\/p><p>I know the Minister of State may welcome co-operative schemes, employee dividend schemes and so forth.  If that was the case there would certainly be some merit in this but it is quite wide and can be used by a wide range of companies.  There is concern over the specific new measure inserted in section 11 - perhaps the Minister of State can clarify it - regarding people moving between companies within a group.  A group may have companies, one of which is profitable and one of which it chooses to make unprofitable for various reasons and tax reliefs.  We have had considerable concern over that kind of issue.<\/p><p>Could somebody be working for one company and be taking shares of another company owned by the same network of companies as part of his or her emoluments under the scheme?  That seems to be part of the new scheme allowing movement between qualifying companies within the group.  I ask the Minister of State to clarify that.  Could a person be working for one company while receiving shares of another company within that group?  I can see numerous concerns that might arise from that measure aside from my general concern about the KEEP scheme. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019120300002#KK01300","speaker":"1405","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1575383400,"counter":343,"content":"<p>The KEEP scheme is not for the wealthy elite.  The KEEP scheme was designed for people working in a particular sector.  The challenge for smaller companies in that sector is that they are not able to hold on to their staff.  Staff retention is a major issue in many sectors.  The objective here is to give an employee the opportunity to take shares as part payment of their salary in effect.  It is not that they are avoiding tax on that.  The Senator seems to be hinting that people are avoiding paying tax or that the scheme is hollowing out the tax base.  They pay tax on the shares when they exit and move off the shares, like many other investors.  This was designed to help those working with smaller companies have an incentive to stay with that corporate group, rather than be challenged by the larger entities that are household names and that gobble up the staff.<\/p> <p>In the circumstances the Senator outlined, somebody can receive shares in a company or holding company within a group.  The measure reflects what has emerged from the comprehensive stakeholder consultation held this year.  This was an SME event hosted by officials in June which allowed representatives of the sector to put forward their views on the changes required in KEEP and the incentives.

We disagree with this scheme.  The original costing suggested that the scheme would cost &euro;130 million in total, however, we know that by August 2019, the cost was &euro;206.4 million.  The aim of the scheme is to help first-time buyers raise the 10% deposit to purchase a property but we know that the average help to buy purchase was above the average price of residential properties in 2018.  There is no need for this scheme and it is using money that could be used to solve the housing crisis.  The report produced on it shows that the scheme has failed to benefit all of the regions of the country as well, with 60% of claims being made in Dublin.  More worryingly, the report shows that the scheme has been disproportionately availed of by higher-income earners so it is out of reach of the vast majority of earners.  Only 13% of sales through the scheme involved properties costing less than &euro;225,000 and more than a fifth of the houses were bought for more than &euro;375,000.  This is not an affordable housing scheme.  Basically, 40% of people who used this scheme already had the 10% deposit and did not need it so it failed to help the majority of people to get on the property ladder.  It has not done anything to reduce housing prices.  It is simply being priced in.  The cost of the scheme has been &euro;206.4 million but it has failed to benefit those who need help the most and has done nothing to reduce the cost of housing.

It just means one has a higher mortgage and one spends a higher percentage of one's take-home income on housing.  I made this point earlier at a meeting of the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach where we were discussing the fact that teachers in south County Dublin are being paid the same as teachers in rural Mayo or Longford but they are paying &euro;2,500 a month in rent whereas one might rent a house for &euro;400 or &euro;500, and certainly less than &euro;1,000, in other parts of Ireland outside the main cities in smaller towns and villages.<\/p><p>This is not about making people wealthy.

The view of this independent commission was that in the same manner that mortgage interest relief increased the cost of housing, rent relief increased the cost of private rental accommodation.  Accordingly, the result of reintroducing this relief would be a transfer of Exchequer funding directly to landlords, which would not have the intended effect of reducing the pressure on tenants.  In addition, a tax credit of this nature would be of little benefit to lower income workers, the unemployed and students, who may not receive the benefit of the relief because they may not be paying sufficient income tax.  The actions the Government proposes to take to address concerns about the cost of rental accommodation are set out in Rebuilding Ireland, the action plan for housing and homelessness.  Finally, at the time of its abolition, the rental tax relief was costing the Exchequer up to &euro;97 million per annum.

We tax wealth in a variety of ways, including capital gains tax and capital acquisitions tax.  These taxes are levied on individuals or companies on disposal of an asset in the case of capital gains or the acquisition of an asset through gift or inheritance in the case of capital acquisitions tax.  We also have a wealth tax on the highest form of wealth in the State.  This is a property tax.  Of course Sinn F&eacute;in is against the property tax because it is populist.  The local property tax was introduced in 2013.  It brings in approximately &euro;500 million.<\/p> <p>It is important to understand where Ireland stands in respect of the distribution of wealth.  Our officials examine all aspects, including taxation and wealth taxation, on an ongoing basis.  During 2016 and 2018 the Department jointly with the ESRI conducted two research projects into the distribution of wealth in Ireland and the potential implications of a wealth tax using the CSO household finance and consumption survey.  The resulting research papers are available on the ESRI website.  Both papers presented results on the composition of net wealth - assets less liabilities - across the wealth and income distribution sectors in Ireland.  A number of wealth tax scenarios, including regimes from other jurisdictions and other scenarios, were applied to the Irish data.  In each case the associated tax bases and revenue yields, the number of liable households across the income distribution and the characterisations of the households affected were outlined.  The composition of households under different tax scenarios was examined and the studies found that even with a narrow base and high threshold, some households in low-income deciles were affected.  This is because of the imperfect correlation between income and wealth.  Furthermore, the distribution implications of a wealth tax across different types of households should be taken into account.  A larger proportion of the wealth tax burden would fall on certain households than their share of net wealth might indicate.<\/p> <p>If a wealth tax were to be applied in addition to the related forms of wealth taxation, it could have the disincentivising effect of causing large changes in the level or types of assets held by Irish households.  Households could be expected to respond to high effective rates of tax on capital income, for example by reducing their holdings of assets in Ireland or reallocating their wealth holdings to asset types facing a lower wealth tax charge.<\/p> <p>Reference was made to increasing taxes on high-income earners.  In 2020 it is projected that the top 1.5% of those who have an annual income of over &euro;200,000 will pay 26.5% of all income tax and universal social charge payments.  This is a large proportion of the total of income tax take and USC take for such a small number of taxpayers.  In comparison, 72% of taxpayer units, which is the cohort of those with an annual income of less than &euro;50,000, will pay 15% of all the income tax and USC.<\/p> <p>To further demonstrate the high amount of tax being paid by high earners under the current income tax system and USC system I note that in 2020 it is expected that there will be approximately 2.78 million taxpayer units, including married couples under joint assessment.  The total yield from income tax and USC will be over &euro;24 billion.  The remaining yield of over &euro;17 billion will be paid by less than 440,000 people earning over &euro;70,000.  Of that yield, approximately &euro;7.2 billion will be paid in total by 2.34 million taxpayer units with incomes of under &euro;70,000 per annum.<\/p> <p>It is my view that a broad-base progressive income tax system where the majority of income tax earners make some contribution, according to their means, is the most fair and sustainable income tax system in the long term.  The Department will continue to monitor and consider any additional information and data that come to its attention.  The Department will continue to examine existing alternative potential taxation sources.  The Minister has no plans to introduce tax measures along the lines suggested and therefore the recommendation will not be accepted.  There is another aspect to this.

That is an extremely high level of wealth but lower than the current threshold.  As we know, people earning &euro;40,000 pay the same income tax rate as those earning &euro;60,000.  Those earning from &euro;75,000 to &euro;1 million may be able to avail of the SARP scheme, as we have already discussed, and pay a reduced rate.  My recommendation is about examining the introduction of some form of wealth tax for high wealth individuals.<\/p><p>To give some perspective, in the five-year period between 2013 and 2018, during which time many people throughout the country were experiencing straitened circumstances and many parents were relying on the working family payment, there was a 32% increase in the number of millionaires in Ireland.  We got 3,000 new millionaires last year alone.  There are more than 1,000 of what are called ultra high net worth individuals, that is, people who have net assets of &euro;30 million or more, living in the State.  In addition, the number of billionaires went from eight to nine in 2018.  During a period when the minimum wage was frozen, before starting to crawl back up, we had an extremely high increase in the numbers of people with immense wealth.<\/p><p>I have not gone for millionaires in my proposal, nor have I solely targeted our nine billionaires.  Instead, I have gone for a level in between, a little below that of the 1,000 people with assets of &euro;30 million or more.  I am asking that the Minister consider a threshold for the introduction of a wealth tax which would include persons with assets worth &euro;10 million or more.  It is absolutely fair enough that they should be eligible for such a tax.  They are not people who happen to own a family home that is valued highly because of where it is located.  They are not people with two family homes and a small number of shares in the company in which they work.  We are not going after people with property of any reasonable or normal level.  When we talk about a net worth of &euro;10 million or more, we are talking about people who can afford to contribute a little more to the State.  I reserve the right to introduce on Report Stage a further proposal in respect of ultra high net worth individuals if the Minister of State is of the view that &euro;10 million is too low a threshold in terms of people making an additional contribution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019120300002#WW00100","speaker":"1405"},{"type":"speech","time":1575383400,"counter":513,"content":"<p>Following a review, Revenue recently revised the threshold for high net worth individuals downwards from &euro;50 million to &euro;20 million.

This recognises the fact that growth in OECD economies is increasingly driven by investment in intangible assets.  When the capital allowances were introduced, a restriction was provided to cap the amount of income that the allowances could be used against in any year at 80%.  The cap was removed for a period between 2015 and 2017, to bring the tax treatment of intangible assets into line with the tax treatment of similar assets in other jurisdictions and to enhance the competitiveness of Ireland as a location for companies to develop intellectual property.  Following a significant increase in the use of the capital allowances in 2015, the 80% cap was restored in the Finance Act 2017.<\/p> <p>For the purposes of certainty, changes to tax law are generally made on a prospective basis, such that they apply only from the date on which they have legal effect.  Therefore, as the Senators are aware, this measure did not apply retrospectively.  Senators will also be aware that the cap has no effect on the overall quantum of capital allowances available to use against the relevant trading income.  Any amounts restricted in one accounting period as a result of a cap are available for carry forward and use against qualifying income in a subsequent accounting period, subject to the application of the cap in that period.  <\/p> <p>Revenue has advised that in the short term, there could be a large theoretical cashflow gain, tentatively estimated to be in the region of &euro;720 million, from the introduction of an 80% cap on intangible assets onshored between 2015 and 11 October 2017.  However it is important to be clear that such a change would not lead to more tax overall and this is simply a timing matter.  To present this as additional tax for the Exchequer would not be correct.  Senators may be aware that the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, made a commitment during debate on this Bill on D&aacute;il Committee Stage, that the terms of reference for a planned examination of the sustainability of corporation tax receipts will include examination of the contribution of intellectual property to tax receipts into the future.

I do not propose a recommendation but I ask the Minister of State to examine how diesel and petrol are treated differently.  There may be an issue on how hybrids are being treated and so on.  This is separate from the Finance Act but there is a different tax treatment for businesses between diesel and petrol, which significantly disadvantages both plug-in and self-charging hybrids in the company car market.  I ask the Minister of State to look into the removal of this anomaly, which allows a VAT reclaim on only diesel fuel and, thereby, excludes the drivers of hybrid company cars from this relief used for business mileage.  I ask the Minister of State to examine this policy again.  There does not appear to be a logical argument for allowing such relief on only one of the two current fuels that are widely used.  It is clearly the case that earlier arguments that suggested that petrol cars are more likely to be abused for private use than diesel cars are now wide of the mark since there is no clear demographic divide between the purchase of vehicles that use these two fuels with the purchase decision, more often than not, being simply economically motivated.<\/p> <p>Deputy Michael McGrath has tabled parliamentary questions on this matter.

In the context of Brexit, in particular, the situation is likely to get worse for retailers struggling to compete with illicit traders' smuggled products.  Solid fuel, for example, can represent up to half of turnover for some retailers, particularly in the winter months.  The illegal fuel trade is booming, at a cost to the Exchequer of more than &euro;9.7 million in lost revenue, including carbon tax.  This represents a loss of &euro;36.5 million to retail merchants and is putting many local traders out of business and more than 1,200 jobs at risk.  In 2018, an illegal cigarette production factory was discovered in County Louth, confirming fears that illegal tobacco is not only being smuggled into Ireland but is also being manufactured here.  An illegal tobacco products research survey by Ipsos MRBI found that approximately &euro;453 million worth of illegal cigarettes, or 23 million packs, were consumed in Ireland in 2018, representing 13% of the market and a loss to the Exchequer of some &euro;211 million.  In March of this year, Revenue uncovered an illegal alcohol bottling plant, also in Louth, which entails a potential substantial loss of revenue to the Exchequer and to alcohol retailers.  It follows the discovery of a large-scale counterfeit vodka production plant in the same county in 2017.  In the course of that year, Revenue seized 95,021 litres of illicit alcohol valued at almost &euro;1 million.<\/p><p>Currently, garda&iacute; are not in a position to do the job they would like to do because the powers of entry, search and seizure, as provided for in section 136 of the Finance Act 2001, may only be exercised by an officer of the Revenue Commissioners.  This needlessly restricts the resources of the State in tackling the problem of illicit smuggling.  My recommendation proposes that members of the Garda be given the same powers as customs inspectors to obtain a search warrant for the specific purpose of identifying excisable goods.  This requires a small amendment to the 2001 Act to redefine the term &quot;officer&quot; for this purpose.  It would support legitimate traders, shore up Exchequer revenues and increase enforcement authority against criminality.  If the Minister of State is not in a position to accept my proposal today, I hope he will at least take it on board for the future.  We have a confidence and supply agreement in operation and I do not intend to try to bring down the Government.  My colleague, Deputy Breathnach, is keen to see this matter addressed.  He represents Louth, which is one of the areas heavily affected by smuggling.  There are Senators in the Chamber today from Border areas who may agree with what I am proposing.

Section 136 of the Finance Act 2001 provides for a range of Revenue powers of entry and search of premises, other than a dwelling, for the purposes of investigation of fraud in excisable goods.  The section also allows Revenue to apply to the District Court for a search warrant to search any premises, including a dwelling, if it is satisfied that excise offences may be at issue.

One of the changes provided for in the Finance Bill is the imposition of the 13.5% rate of VAT on food supplements.  This provision was discussed at great length during the passage of the Bill through the D&aacute;il.  It was also discussed extensively at the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach, of which Senators Kieran O'Donnell, Conway-Walsh, Paddy Burke and I are members, as was the Minister of State before he was elevated to higher office.  That committee heard in detail from representatives of the health food sector, at which time the Minister announced that a review would be undertaken.  The Revenue Commissioners subsequently announced, on 1 March, that various food supplements would be charged at the 23% VAT rate.  Thanks to political pressure from my party and others, that decision was postponed until 1 November 2019.<\/p> <p>In the meantime, the Taoiseach referred to food supplements as snake oil, which was unhelpful and served to discredit the many positive health benefits of those supplements.  Many people, including the elderly and pregnant women, have achieved healthy outcomes from using food supplements.  I am not saying that every supplement or every product that purports to be a supplement is fantastic, but many of them are very helpful.  This move will serve to increase the cost of living for people and runs counter to positive health policy.<\/p> <p>We will continue to raise the matter with the Minister on the basis that we are all agreed that some of these products offer benefits.  With so many people using food supplements, there is a possibility that some of them, if they can no longer afford the products,  could end up ill in an emergency department.  If those people end up in a hospital bed, even for one night, it will add up to a significant demand on resources.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Gerry Horkan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2476\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2476&amp;amp;pid=GerryHorkan&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=03\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->There is a false economy in what we are trying to do here.  I appreciate that the rate of VAT on food is 0% and food supplements are effectively a form of food.  They supplement food.  This is a relatively short-sighted measure, which is unhelpful for public policy, the improvement of health and keeping people in this State as healthy as they can be.  People are going out and trying to be healthier.  Some will probably still do so and suck up the price increase but others may decide they cannot afford the increased cost.  On that basis they will get sick and end up in hospitals or accident and emergency departments with poor health outcomes that would be far more costly to the State than allowing a VAT rate of 0% on food supplements.  This recommendation seeks for a new report to be laid before the Oireachtas on the treatment of food supplements and whether they can still be zero-rated, within three months of the passing of the Bill.  I do not expect the Minister of State to accept the recommendation but it would be worthwhile if he did so. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019120300002#AAA01200","speaker":"1412","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1575383400,"counter":583,"content":"<p>I will not go over what Senator Horkan highlighted because much of it was cases presented.

Folic acid, vitamin and mineral products for human oral use, which are licensed by the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA, will continue to be zero-rated under a different VAT provision for human oral medicines.  The report the Senator is seeking will simply reiterate these points, about which we have spoken on a number of occasions.

This report was sent on 31 August 2018 and was also published on the Department of Finance's website.  This report discusses in some detail the potential implications of restricting the use of losses carried forward or the introduction of a specific time limit or sunset clause on loss relief for Irish banks, for the wider banking sector or for the corporate sector as a whole.  The report examines the possible effect of such a restriction on consumers, with the probability that an increased cost base for the banks would be passed on in the form of higher fees and higher interest rates on mortgages and business and personal loans or lower deposit interest rates, or both.  It also noted potential negative effects on the valuation of the State&rsquo;s bank shareholdings, on capital levels in the banks and the possible resulting regulatory impacts, the potential state aid implications and effects on competition within the banking sector in Ireland.  The report further noted that loss relief is a standard feature of corporate tax regimes worldwide.  Loss relief recognises the fact that business cycles run over a longer period than just a single year and that it would be inequitable to tax profits in one year and not allow relief for losses incurred in another.<\/p> <p>In relation to the detail of the Senators&rsquo; proposed amendment, the report estimated that a 50% restriction on the offset of losses against the three Irish pillar banks in 2017 would have yielded &euro;117 million.  However, these three banks contributed &euro;101 million in 2017 through the bank levy.  Furthermore, Irish banks currently pay Irish corporation tax, as the tax losses do not shelter all sources of income.  According to the most up-to-date figures available, Bank of Ireland paid corporation tax of &euro;21 million in 2018 in addition to a bank levy of &euro;29 million, while AIB paid &euro;25 million in corporation tax and a bank levy of &euro;49 million.  In total in 2018, Bank of Ireland, AIB and Permanent TSB combined paid approximately &euro;147 million to the Exchequer, of which &euro;101 million was from the bank levy and &euro;46 million was in corporation tax.  I also note that the Minister committed to provide the finance committee with updates on the figures in the published report, to reflect the additional year of data now available.  I commit to also provide Senators with a copy of that updated report for their information.<\/p> <p>Given the level of analysis that has been so recently completed and the commitment made to provide an update on the figures in the report, I do not accept the Senators&rsquo; recommendation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019120300002#BBB01500","speaker":"1364"},{"type":"speech","time":1575383400,"counter":597,"content":"<p>I was just reflecting when the Minister of State was talking that a significant amount of taxpayers' money went into the banks and is still in them.

The recommendation could provide for a situation where there would be a major drag on the possibility of getting the maximum value back for the taxpayer.  It is a view I share.  I am not glad that taxpayers' money ever went into the banks.  There was reckless trading.  At the same time, I would adopt a pragmatic view that we need to ensure that we get maximum value for the taxpayer in repayment of the investment in the banks and we need to have a normal banking sector.  There is need for the credit unions and public banking.  I do not believe it should come through the pillar banks into which we have put significant taxpayers' money.
