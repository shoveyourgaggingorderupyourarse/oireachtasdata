This is about inclusion and ensuring that people have the same opportunities for education, regardless of whether they pay fees.  There has been a major change in policy over the past decade whereby ASD special units have been set up throughout the country.  Every parish now has one of these units and this has given rise to a major improvement in the services being provided.  It is about inclusion and having these units in primary and secondary schools.  However, there is an anomaly in the system.  Fee-paying schools seemed to be looked upon differently by the Department of Education and Skills when it comes to these units.  In correspondence, I have asked the Department to explain its policy on fee-paying schools and these units.  The Department has replied that it currently has no policy to support the establishment of special classrooms in fee-paying schools.  That is a major step backwards.<\/p> <p>In 2017, Bandon grammar school was approved for such a unit but then had the approval pulled because it was deemed to be a fee-paying school.  The school was willing to waive all fees for any student who wished to attend the unit.  This is about inclusion and providing the opportunity for people to be educated in whatever setting they deem appropriate.  The fact the Department of Education and Skills has no policy to support such a scenario is bizarre.  We need to look at this in another light at how we can improve the actual scenario to ensure that people who want to be educated, whether privately or in a public school, will have the opportunity to go to these units.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Tim Lombard:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2466\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2466&amp;amp;pid=TimLombard&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=22\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->These special units are a major step forward.  They have brought clarity and freedom to families, as people have wanted for generations.  Unfortunately, we have a system breakdown.  We need to look at the establishment of a policy for fee-paying schools, so they have the opportunity, particularly in a scenario like that at Bandon Grammar School, to waive the fees they usually apply to students and the schools can provide the service that the community wants.  That is what this is about, namely, providing the service that the community wants.<\/p><p>I put the proposal to the Minister of State that there should be a change in policy.  The Department of Education and Skills needs to work with all schools, fee-paying and non-fee-paying, to ensure that these units, which are a godsend for so many families, can be established in every school.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019102200002#B00400","speaker":"1386","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571751000,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising the matter, which I am taking on behalf of the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy McHugh, who is in London on Government business today.<\/p> <p>It is the policy of the Department of Education and Skills that all children with special educational needs, including those with autism, can have access to an education appropriate to their needs, preferably in school settings through the primary and post-primary school network.  In 2019, &euro;1.9 billion is being invested in special education, almost one fifth of the overall education and training budget.  Investment in the area of special education continues to be a priority, with the budget for 2020 also providing for an additional 1,064 special needs assistants and over 400 additional special education teacher posts throughout the country.  The range of supports and services which are made available includes additional special educational support teaching, special needs assistant support, funding for the purchase of specialised equipment, services of the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, enhanced levels of capitation in special schools and special classes and additional teacher training.<\/p> <p>The National Council for Special Education, NCSE, which is an independent statutory body, is responsible for organising and planning provision for children with special educational needs, including the establishment of special classes and special schools, in consultation with the relevant education partners and the Health Service Executive.  An additional 1,050 specialised places have been provided this school year, with 167 new special classes being opened.  This brings the total number of special class places to over 9,700, almost a trebling of the provision since 2011.  Over 80% of these are autism-specific special class places.  The number of special classes in mainstream schools has increased from 548 in 2011 to 1,621 for the 2019-20 school year.<\/p> <p>Special classes offer a supportive learning environment to students who are unable to access the curriculum in a mainstream class, even with support, for most or all of their school day.  Students enrolled in special classes should be included in mainstream classes to the greatest extent possible, in line with their abilities.  Schools may apply to the NCSE to open a special class where a need has been identified in their area, for example, where a number of students have professional reports indicating they require the support of a special class.<\/p> <p>Before approaching a particular school to request the establishment of a special class, SENOs take into account both present and future potential need within the area and must be satisfied that the class is sustainable and appropriately located.  While it is not always possible to ensure that a special class placement will be available in the child's local school, the NCSE has informed the Department of Education and Skills that, in general, it is satisfied there are currently sufficient special class placements to meet existing demand.<\/p> <p>The Department of Education and Skills does not currently have a policy supporting the establishment of special classes in fee-charging schools, as the Senator outlined.  This is because the NCSE is required to satisfy itself that the class is both sustainable and available to all of pupils who may need special class placements in a particular area.  As learning needs change over time, a student's enrolment in a special class should also be kept under continual review by the school.  Where such a review indicates that the student's needs might be best addressed in a mainstream setting, the student should be supported in moving to a mainstream class in the school.  A special class is, therefore, not a separate provision within a school, but forms part of the overall educational provision within the school, with interaction taking place between the two settings.<\/p> <p>The Department of Education and Skills informs me it is satisfied that, based on the advice of the NCSE, schools in the free education system can continue to establish sufficient special classes to meet identified need.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy John Paul Phelan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2004\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2004&amp;amp;pid=JohnPaulPhelan&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=22\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Regarding the specific matter raised by the Senator, I will bring the details back to the Minister.  In an Irish context, there are two types of fee-paying schools.  In my constituency, Kilkenny college was one of the largest fee-paying schools in the country until it became part of the free school system a few years ago.  I do not want to resort to categorising people, but Bandon grammar school would traditionally have served the needs of members of the Church of Ireland community in west Cork and that part of the country.  I understand there would be specific issues regarding access for children from the Church of Ireland tradition who may have special educational needs.  It is a legitimate issue to raise.<\/p><p>In a broader sense, in respect of fee-paying schools, it is appropriate that the NCSE has to be satisfied that classes being provided are available to everybody.  By their very nature, fee-paying schools are not available to everybody.  There is, however, a specific question to be answered in this case.  I will ask the Minister to respond directly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019102200002#C00200","speaker":"1265","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571751000,"counter":19,"content":"<p>I acknowledge the Minister of State's recognition of the issue, particularly regarding Bandon grammar school.  The trustees of that school have stated that there will be no fees for any student who attends the unit.

Taking the sustainability issue into account, there is a real issue for the people of west Cork.  This is a unique issue and people there feel discriminated against in many ways.  They are doing the right thing in stepping up and stating that the unit is needed.  Can people imagine what would have happened if they had stated that they did not want the unit?  What kind of uproar would there have been?  These people have instead put their hands up and affirmed that they want to be part of an inclusive society, they want to do the right thing and, therefore, the fee will be waived.  They are now asking if we will work with them.

It may be peculiar for those watching to see us talking to the Minister of State with responsibility for local government about D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour, which is one of the finest harbours in Europe and the world.  It is renowned for its historic nature architectural beauty.  With that, however, comes major responsibility, including financial responsibility.  A number of heated responses in the House from the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, regarding this matter have shown that there is dissatisfaction in the community in the D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council area regarding ongoing obligations in respect of the maintenance and financial requirements needed to protect this national treasure.  It is unfair, and considered unfair, that that should be the case.  I want to agree with that sentiment.<\/p> <p>At the outset, I must state that I am a former director of the harbour company, having served in that position for ten years.  I left the post many years ago but I am intimately familiar with the workings of the company.  I refer to its finances, corporate governance and attendant issues.  Many Ministers with responsibility for transport have dealt with this issue, including the Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe and the Minister, Deputy Ross.  Those are all influential people in politics and in this Government.  They are also aware of the financial liabilities and difficulties.<\/p> <p>I do not want to open up the issue of the governance of the company today.  I want to focus on how we can secure from the Government some financial support and assistance for D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, its executive and elected members, to protect the future of this harbour.  Financial liabilities are part of this issue.  It is suggested that total liabilities might be some &euro;30 million, but it is hard to quantify.  Some provision, however, should be given.  It is not appropriate that a State agency should saddle another arm of the State, in this case D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, with a financial liability of this significance.<\/p> <p>I do not want to look back, I want to look forward.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Victor Boyhan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2463\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2463&amp;amp;pid=VictorBoyhan&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=22\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> Responsibility for this particular area now falls on the desk of the Minister of State.  Can he give an undertaking that he will secure an incremental transitional fund for D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown over a period of between three and five years?  I seek assurance about the status of the trading accounts for the D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour Company for the last year or two.  There is a statutory obligation in law, and the Houses of the Oireachtas enacted the legislation, that provides for the audited accounts of the company to be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The time is well lapsed and yet we still have not seen the accounts.  I ask the Minister of State to enlighten me on the following.  Where are the accounts?  What is their status?  Is he aware of any complications or reservations by anybody, including former directors or financial people who work for the company?  Have they any difficult signing off on them?  The Minister of State might share that information with us if he has it.  More importantly, when can we expect the accounts to be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas?  Can he give us and the local authority, its members and executive comfort by saying what he might do or might be able to do to provide financial support to them?  There may be elements of heritage and conservation and, therefore, the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Madigan, may be able to provide funding.  A number of State agencies may be able to provide funding for this particular issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019102200002#D00400","speaker":"1379","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571751000,"counter":23,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Boyhan for raising this important issue.  I am delighted to have the opportunity to address the House on the issue of D&uacute;n Laoghaire harbour and its future development.  He is correct to say that we should focus on the future at this stage.<\/p><p>The Senator referred to the document entitled National Ports Policy 2013 when he mentioned the time the Taoiseach was the Minister for Transport.  The policy provides for the transfer of certain ports to the relevant local authorities that they are located in and sets out the arrangements for giving effect to this.  In that context, the D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour Company transferred to the D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council on 3 October 2018, in accordance with Part 3 of the Harbours Act 2015, which provides, <i>inter alia<\/i>, for the dissolution of the port company and the transfer of its assets, liabilities and rights to the council.<\/p><p>The Harbours Act 2015 requires that the council presents final accounts for the former harbour company, which the Senator outlined, to the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government within six months of the date of dissolution.  Again, as the Senator pointed out, that time has passed.  It has taken longer than stipulated to finalise the accounts for the period 1 January 2017 to 2 October 2018 due to a technical legal issue regarding audit and sign-off of the accounts.  I understand that the council will present the accounts to me before the end of the year.  I will then lay the accounts before the Houses of the Oireachtas.<\/p><p>The Department has a prudential role with regard to the financial integrity of all local authorities and to ensure that local authorities' finances, as far as is practicable, are on a sustainable footing.  In that regard, it is my Department's position that in the case of all port transfers, the relevant local authority should not be unduly encumbered or exposed to financial risk by the effective transfer of a commercial body to its control.  As I said at the time, and reiterate here, there can be no question of all the costs falling on the local authority in question, which is D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council.<\/p><p>I understand that due diligence undertaken by the council prior to the transfer had estimated that remedial works costing in excess of &euro;33 million could be required if the port was to be brought to a standard to accommodate commercial shipping.  However, a smaller infrastructural deficit of &euro;10 million applies in the event that upgrading and maintenance for just recreational and amenity use needed to be addressed over a number of years.<\/p><p>It should be noted that D&uacute;n Laoghaire harbour is a substantial strategic asset and amenity, and a local and national one as pointed out by the Senator, which, notwithstanding its ongoing expenditure requirements, also generates income from a number of sources that can be directed towards investment needs.  The Senators is aware of the latter from his own time as a member of the county council.<\/p><p>D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council is currently working on an economic plan for the harbour.  While central government responsibility for ports policy and associated issues remains a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, I am anxious to see local authorities realising the potential of their assets, on a sustainable basis, in the context of Project Ireland 2040.  In that context, I look forward to seeing proposals from the council on the future development of this key strategic asset.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy John Paul Phelan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2004\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2004&amp;amp;pid=JohnPaulPhelan&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=22\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> The Senator is right to point out that there will be other Departments under the aegis of Project Ireland 2040 from which funding can be sourced.

Thousands of adults with type 1 diabetes will have to wait until next year to find out whether the HSE is prepared to lift restrictions on them accessing the new blood sugar monitoring technology known as FreeStyle Libre.

In August, according to a spokesperson, the HSE had 12 months of data collated for review within the coming months.  This would allow for the experience of patients and the \"societal aspects of benefit\" to be reviewed.  Members may be aware that FreeStyle Libre, made by Abbott, is a small sensor worn on the skin with readings taken by scanning a hand-held device over the sensor.  Unlike the finger prick test, there is no need to draw blood and continuous information about glucose levels can be obtained.  <\/p><p>Diabetes Ireland has described the upper age limit on availability as \"unfortunate\" as it means that many adults cannot access the technology despite the support of their medical team.  The HSE stated that it was committed to reviewing who can access this technology within a year but 18 months later, there is still no review.  The device has been made available to some adults with type 1 diabetes based on exceptional need.  However, diabetes specialist Dr. Ronan Canavan has said that he has made many applications over the past year with limited success.  One such application on behalf of a 22 year old patient was refused initially and again on appeal.  As I said, I am making representations on behalf of an adult woman.  She needs this technology but is exasperated by the delay.<\/p><p>Diabetes Ireland estimates that around 20,000 people have type 1 diabetes, including almost 3,000 children under 16.

The HSE must also, under its governing legislation, manage the provision of health services within the overall resources available to it.  In line with the recommendations of the HSE's health technology assessment group, the FreeStyle Libre product was made available in 2018 to children and young adults and, in some exceptional circumstances, to other patients.  The health technology assessment group is a medical technology evaluation group that provides assistance to stakeholders when considering the various health technologies and innovations in the medical devices field.  It includes expertise in medicine, pharmacy, health economics, devices and procurement.  It reviews the clinical and cost effectiveness of innovative medical devices.  <\/p> <p>The FreeStyle Libre product is intended to be used as an alternative to current glucose monitoring methods for people who administer multiple daily injections of insulin.  In contrast to self-monitoring blood glucose, this technology allows glucose readings to be taken non-invasively.  Unlike continuous glucose monitoring, it does not need to be calibrated with a blood sample.  On the advice of the health technology assessment group, the HSE decided that after 12 months the situation, including historical reimbursement data, would be reviewed to inform the next steps.  The intention is that an update to the initial report will then be published.  <\/p> <p>In recent months, the primary care eligibility and reimbursement service of the HSE has taken steps to gather the relevant data for review by the health technology assessment group.  It collated the reimbursement data on strip usage for persons approved for FreeStyle Libre, as notified to the HSE through individual pharmacy claims on a monthly basis.  It liaised with the national clinical programme for diabetes and shared material received with the health technology assessment group.  It collated the reasons for exceptional approvals, for example, in cases of older patients with visual impairment or dexterity issues and provided this quantitative data to the health technology assessment group for review.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Finian McGrath:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1822\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1822&amp;amp;pid=FinianMcGrath&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=22\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It provided the Diabetes Ireland survey on the use of this product to the health technology assessment group.<\/p><p>The HSE intends that an update to the initial report, including details of the review, will be published after the review has been completed.

The Government's ongoing priority is the safeguarding of vulnerable people in the care of the health service.  We are committed to providing services and supports for people with disabilities which will empower them to live independent lives, provide greater independence in accessing the services they choose and enhance their ability to tailor the supports required to meet their needs and plan their lives.  Significant resources have been invested by the health sector in disability services in recent years.  This year alone, the Health Service Executive has allocated &euro;1.9 billion to its disability services programme.<\/p> <p>As part of its ongoing service provision, the HSE will provide over 8,500 residential places this year to families in need right across the country.  In fact, residential services make up the largest part of the disability budget.  Our policy is for people with disabilities to be supported to achieve their full potential so that, where possible, they can live ordinary lives in ordinary places doing ordinary things.<\/p> <p>The need for increased residential facilities is acknowledged and the HSE continues to work with agencies to explore various ways of responding to this need in line with the budget available.  With regard to the particular centre mentioned by the Senator today, I am advised by the HSE that a procurement process for an external service provider to run the HSE Respond group home in Carrickmacross has been completed.  After the closing date, tenders from a number of service providers interested were assessed and one has met the criteria.  However, the cost of provision greatly exceeded the budget available to the HSE to deliver the service.  The HSE community healthcare organisation, CHO 1, has engaged with that provider with a view to bringing the cost of provision in line with the available budget.  However, this has not been successful.  CHO 1 has sought the additional funding required to open this group home through the 2020 Estimates process.  As it has not been notified to date of its 2020 budget allocation, CHO 1 is not in a position to confirm a start date for this service.  The budget has increased to more than &euro;2 billion this year.  Residential services are very important.

It raises the question as to what the potential in the Asian market is.  I read in a newspaper this morning how there is a major issue regarding the production of pork and swine flu and other related agricultural diseases that have been impacting enormously on China and the rest of Asia in the past few weeks.  Pork was not even mentioned in the recent release on this announcement concerning beef exports to China.  There is potential, particularly for the development of new markets in Asia.  The acceptance of the market for Irish beef indicates the high quality of our beef, which is predominantly grass fed, and the importance of traceability and quality over price.  This is one of the major things that have come out of this announcement.  They are looking for high-quality beef that is traceable.  <\/p><p>It is important to say that farmers must also experience and see the benefits of these additional markets and contracts.  One of the problems about which we hear, particularly with regard to the Beef Plan Movement, concerns the fact that there are members of the beef plan organisation who feel they will not get a fair share and will not be able to contribute to these markets.  New markets are great news for beef but the price must be reflected down the chain, which is a problem.  We know about the politics surrounding beef in the past few months, for example, who is and is not making the money, the conflicts around that and the primary producers.  I acknowledge the enormous work done by the Minister in this area.  There is significant potential for the development of the market.  I reiterate the importance of working closely with the Beef Plan Movement and its members, who do not want to be victimised as a result of their protests or to be locked out of this lucrative market.  They want to be incorporated and to have equal access and an equal opportunity to contribute to feeding these new growing markets.

They are locked and the Senators inside the doors are legally entitled to vote.  It is very serious in the context of how many times it has happened and whether this practice of voting has ever affected the passage of legislation.<\/p> <p>If the Acting Chairman, Senator Wilson, will not discuss it here today, I would ask the Leader to allow time to discuss the issue of voting within the Chamber at another time.

They provided the nation's electricity, gas, peat, radio, television, telecommunications, aviation and myriad other State services that we all take for granted.  They are represented by the retired semi-State staff associations, which presented in the audiovisual room this morning.  I acknowledge Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith and others for gathering there but there were so few people there this morning.  This is an enormously important issue, as Senators will see when there is a demonstration outside the gates here again tomorrow.  It is wrong that the rights under the contract of employment of these pensioners, because they are former workers, are ignored.  These pensioners have nowhere to go.  They do not have any body or organisation to which to refer grievances.  The 12-month time bar is a ludicrous impediment to these workers seeking justice under the equality tribunal in the same way that the industrial relations, unions and pension authorities all close the door on thousands of former workers seeking the address of their grievances.<\/p> <p>This legislation must be changed.  It is not about acquiring public money for these people.  As they stated this morning, these pensioners just want their own money back, but under current legislation there is no obligation on employers to fund deficits in their pension schemes and there is no real protection for these pensioners against efforts by solvent employers to renege on their responsibility to their pension schemes and to address a fund deficit.  The proposed new legislation, which was introduced in the Social Welfare, Pensions and Civil Registration Bill 2017, is an opportunity for the Minister, Deputy Regina Doherty, to introduce full legal protection for pensioners, and there has to be financial consequences for solvent employers who abdicate responsibility for their pension schemes and fail to make contributions to resolving pension fund deficits.  The debt on the employer concept for the amount of the unresolved pension fund deficit is urgently required and must be enshrined in pension law without further delay.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Rose Conway-Walsh:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2462\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2462&amp;amp;pid=RoseConwayWalsh&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=22\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Will the Leader ask the Minister to come to the House to address this issue specifically?

There is a suggestion by some sort of income review board that some of the top civil servants should be given pay increases that are more than the entire salaries paid to Members of this House.

I appeal to the powers that be to get rid of all these bloody allowances, the need for accountants and certified accountants, and so on - they would drive a person bewildered - and give us the rate for the job.

In 2016, we proposed an amendment to the Social Welfare Bill which would have addressed some of those anomalies.  It was an opportunity to do it in a timely way and it is very regrettable that, for the last three years, we have not seen promised legislation to give security, particularly where there are solvent companies that failed to have regard to the needs of the pensioners for whom they are responsible.<\/p> <p>I want to propose an amendment to the Order of Business to ask the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment or the Taoiseach to address and engage with this House specifically in regard to the inclusion of the proposed liquefied natural gas, LNG, terminal at Shannon in the European projects of common interest.  Since the LNG terminal was first proposed, the debate has changed and what we understand and know has changed.  Since we first discussed this proposal, for example, Ireland has signed up to the Paris climate targets, which are global targets.  We have acknowledged the damage done by fracking and, therefore, banned it in terms of hydraulic fracturing in our own State, so we should not be facilitating it elsewhere.  We have also made commitments to fossil fuel divestment.  It is deeply inconsistent with both of those policies at a national level that we would, effectively, be those who come to the aid of the stranded assets of fracked gas, largely from the United States, and, more specifically, Pennsylvania - in fact, we hear that up to two thirds of the LNG for Shannon may come from the latter - and that we would contribute to climate change.<\/p> <p>There is yet another new reason, if such a reason were needed, to remove this terminal from the projects of common interest.  That is the testimony we heard just two weeks ago at the Joint Committee on Climate Action, where Dr. Robert Howarth of Cornell University, who has been cited 2,700 times and is the world expert on shale gas, spoke specifically about the damage that is done during the extraction of this gas and when it is being transported.  I refer to the leaking of methane, which is contributing to 1 watt per square metre of global warming currently and, crucially, the fact the Earth's climate system responds more quickly to methane than to carbon dioxide.  What that means is methane, which is a key by-product of the fracking process, is absorbed and causes warming at a quicker rate, so, while it does not stay as long in the atmosphere, its impact is more immediate.<\/p> <p>This, and all the other science, has put the lie to the idea of gas as a transition fuel.  It is not a transition fuel; it is an accelerant.  It is shortening the period in which we have to act in respect of so many other areas.  For example, if we wish to change in a proper, just transition way our agricultural processes, we must make sure we are not losing space in those areas to make the transitions we need by adding a new, unnecessary element into the mix in terms of fracked gas.<\/p> <p>A just transition is needed.  In that context, there is the opportunity for the Taoiseach to act because, up to tomorrow, Wednesday, 23 October, this State still has the opportunity to remove the LNG terminal from the European projects of common interest.  Regardless of how people feel about that project, and even if they are in favour of the terminal, we do not need to tie ourselves into this being the highest priority for Ireland at European level, with the highest priority access to our electricity grid and to the energy grid across Europe.  I urge action by 23 October.  I would like the Taoiseach or the Minister to come to the House today and I propose an amendment to the Order of Business to that effect.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019102200002#R00200","speaker":"1405"},{"type":"speech","time":1571751000,"counter":94,"content":"<p>We are all concerned about the housing crisis.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Gabrielle McFadden:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2399\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2399&amp;amp;pid=GabrielleMcFadden&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=22\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Nobody thinks it is okay for families to live in hotels or bed and breakfasts.

It is not okay.<\/p><p>We know that the biggest problem with housing is supply.  No social housing was built for more than 15 years and that is why we have a crisis now.  Houses are being built and more will be built this year.  That is not enough, however.  There are other ways in which we can help to ease this problem.  One such aspect was contained in the action plan for housing developed by the then Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Coveney.  I refer to the repair and lease scheme.  That is a really good idea because there are many houses and flats over businesses empty and in a state of disrepair.  A small amount of money would repair those units and allow them to be put into use.  That is not happening, however.  I drive down the quays on Wednesday or Thursday evening and I glance up and see empty housing units over businesses at street level.  I always wonder why those properties are vacant and why are families not living in them.   Last night's edition of \"Claire Byrne Live\" showed families living in hotels.  That does not work and I cannot understand why that is the case.<\/p><p>I raised this issue previously with the Minister and he informed me of the vacant homes officers appointed to each local authority.  Those officers are supposed to go around, find out why houses are vacant, find out if they can be put back into use and then help put them back into use.  That does not seem to be working, however.  I would like the Minister to come to this House and talk us through this issue.  There is much bureaucracy and red tape.  In the old days, vacant homes officers would take practical steps to get people into these homes.  Now, there seem to be many more bureaucratic requirements to be gone through, including different forms and criteria to be met.  That is happening when many people have to live in hotel rooms and bed and breakfasts.  It is not good enough.<\/p><p>I ask, therefore, that the Leader use his good offices to see if the Minister will come to the House to have a discussion on the repair and lease scheme, with particular focus on the vacant homes officers in each county.  My home county of Westmeath, for example, needs more than one vacant homes officer to look after Athlone, Mullingar, Kilbeggan and Moate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019102200002#R00300","speaker":"1375","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571751000,"counter":96,"content":"<p>I would like to raise an issue relating to agriculture and weather.  I have raised it before in connection with different aspects of the farming calendar.  I refer to farmers being constrained in their activities by calendar dates.  The last issue of this kind that I raised concerned an extension of the date for slurry-spreading because of inclement weather.  Today, I want to raise the issue of winter crops.  Twice the average rainfall fell in August and September.  Much ground has been ploughed, but it has not been possible to sow the crops meant to go into those fields because the earth is completely saturated.  This situation has major implications in the context of the nitrates directive, which states there has to be green cover on fields within six weeks of ploughing.  That will not be possible in many cases because the crops it was intended to sow will not have been established before the onset of winter.  Even if they were to survive, there will be a potential yield loss.<\/p> <p>It is time for the Leader to ask the Minister to come to the House in order that we can have a debate on this issue and to ensure that we do not have to stand up here, year in and year out, seeking extensions and derogations.

We saw a photograph of one of them, Sam, eating from a carton on Grafton Street.  Figures are one thing, but when one puts a face to the child, it makes the situation very different.  I wish to highlight a report I launched last Friday in Cork.  It was undertaken by Young Knocknaheeny, which is a brilliant project that is supporting child and infant mental health.  Its efforts are being undermined by the housing conditions in which the children are living.  The report refers to couples rearing three children all under eight years of age, the housing assistance payment, HAP, not being accepted, borrowing money from loan sharks to pay the rent, zero-hour contracts, notices to quit and going to a hotel in the country and not in the city where the children are at school.

It is little wonder that one of the parents attempted suicide and that one of the children expressed suicidal thoughts.  Another family with three children was camping out in the attic of a house.  The attic had damp and mould and this resulted in respiratory problems for them.  The family has been on the local authority waiting list for seven years but could not find a place to rent that accepted HAP.  There is another account of a family of seven, comprising six children from infancy to teens, living in a house which had damp patches in the bedrooms, with cloths and rags blocking up windows.  There was no heating system in the house, only open fires and electric heaters and there was rubbish in the garden.  These accounts are shocking and they should shock us but we are not acting.

These provisions provide for the decriminalisation of abortion, as Senator Bacik said, and a moratorium on abortion-related criminal prosecutions from 22 October onwards.

It points to terrible political and social irresponsibility and destructiveness.  Instead of engaging in a sensitive and constructive manner, these parties went the route of ridicule and political point-scoring.  At no point was there even a minimal attempt to respond to the gravity of the legislation and to what it entails, namely, the ending of a life of an unborn child, for any reason up to the point of viability and perhaps beyond.  Thanks to a political vacuum that seems to have been happily embraced insofar as it eased the passage of this inhumane Act, even while people were decrying the disrespect for minorities in the context of Brexit and consent arrangements and so on, we now have a situation where unborn children in the North may be subjected to acts of intolerable cruelty in the name of progressive politics.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2250\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2250&amp;amp;pid=RonanMullen&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=22\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It is not just that there is something deeply unfair about abortion, though there is.

Not only has one of the most liberal and extreme abortion regimes in Europe been foisted on the North, through British legislation which Sinn F&eacute;in supported, but the promotion of its ideological foundation is being forced onto schools.  If left unchallenged, this legislation will make it very difficult for schools to maintain an ethos that regards abortion as a tragedy and an injustice which erodes fundamental respect for human dignity, and will also make it harder for those schools to encourage positive alternatives to abortion.  This is a long way from what some early feminists, who were staunchly pro-life, would have wanted.  This is not about men versus women.

Molex, a large employer that has been located in Shannon for over 48 years, announced today that it is looking to close its facility at the end of 2020, resulting in the loss of 500 jobs.  This is of huge significance, particularly for the workers and their families.  I am conscious that workers are currently being informed of this decision by Molex so I do not wish to go into it in detail.  Suffice it to say that I met with the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Humphreys, about the matter in the last half an hour.  The Government first became aware of this late last night and the Minister had a discussion with the global CEO of Molex today.  She is very concerned and is aware of the impact this could have, particularly on the 500 workers in Molex, their families, and the Shannon and Limerick regions.<\/p> <p>Many of the people working in Molex live in Limerick city, which I represent, and I am conscious of the potential impact of this closure.  Every effort must now be made to engage with Molex at a global level, and IDA Ireland should also engage with Molex to see whether new, alternative, creative jobs can be provided in the area with Molex.  Molex is part and parcel of what Shannon and the region are about.  It has been there since 1971, which is nearly 50 years.  I am conscious of the impact of this breaking news on the families involved.  The key thing is that the Minister is engaging with the company and with IDA Ireland.  It is a very difficult time for Molex staff and workers in Shannon.  Every effort must be made by IDA Ireland to engage with Molex to see whether it can provide alternative jobs in Shannon.  I will continue to bring this up with the Minister, the Government and IDA Ireland to ensure we get a proper resolution for the staff.  This is a shock for the staff and people in the region.  I want to put on the record that the Government is very supportive of what those people are currently going through and direct engagement is happening at the highest level between the Minister, the CEO of Molex and IDA Ireland.  Every effort will now be made to ensure that alternative jobs can be provided, ideally with Molex in other areas, and that the interests of the workers are represented.  This is a huge blow for the region and the Government is looking to ensure it is addressed in the best possible way, in the interests of workers, their jobs and their families.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019102200002#Y00200","speaker":"1374"},{"type":"speech","time":1571751000,"counter":129,"content":"<p>Tugaim 100% taca&iacute;ocht don phointe a rinne an Seanad&oacute;ir &Oacute; Domhnaill mar gheall ar Molex.

This report that people, including the Leader, were party to and participated in gives a strategy and a direction.  I would like an open and honest debate about that as soon as possible.

I understand it has lost in the region of &euro;8 million this year.  It has lost the rights to a number of sporting events like the Six Nations and others.

The Senator referred also to Paul Quinn who was appointed in a personal capacity and who has also resigned in a personal capacity.  While he is the State's chief procurement officer, I assure the House that the national children's hospital is continuing.  There is good progress in many aspects of the work and we are up nearly to roof level.  I would be very happy to have the Minister come to the House for a debate on the matter.  Senator Davitt referred also to the matter of the sewerage centre for Mullingar.  The Senator could raise that as a Commencement matter.  I do not have the information to hand but he makes pertinent points.<\/p> <p>Senators Boyhan and Mullen raised the issue of the beef market.  I congratulate the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed, and Bord Bia on the opening of new markets in Asia.  China is an important market.  As Senator Boyhan said, it is important to have high-quality, traceable beef and that we have fair pricing for Irish farmers.  I would be happy to have the Minister come to the House to discuss the matter.  He was here a couple of weeks ago to discuss beef and we will have him again.<\/p> <p>Senator Conway-Walsh referred to voting behaviour in the Lower House.  The Acting Chairman made a comment on the matter also but I will not stray into it.  The Ceann Comhairle has launched an investigation and we await the completion and publication of his report.  I share Senator Conway-Walsh's view that it is a serious matter.  As parliamentarians, we are all privileged to be here and one of the most important parts of our job is to be present to vote in a locked Chamber.  Something on which we should all reflect is the decorum appropriate to that voting block.  I may be guilty of being slightly cavalier during voting but in terms of being here, it is a matter we should take very seriously.  All of us who have the privilege to be here cast our votes properly in this House and we are not tainted by what has happened.  I hope I am not proven wrong in that but I do not think I will be.  In the three and a half years of the current Seanad, all Members have taken their job very seriously.  I would be happy to have a debate on the matter at a later time.<\/p> <p>Senator Conway-Walsh also raised the important issue regarding 70,000 semi-State pensioners.  They feel aggrieved and there is an issue which needs to be addressed.  I would be happy to have the Minister come to the House to discuss the matter.<\/p> <p>Senators Norris and McDowell referred to a missive from AIB.  I have sympathy for Senator Norris with regard to the matter he raises and what is being asked of him.  I am not sure if it is a matter for the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, but the Senator might raise it there to see how his ideas can be progressed around the imposition he identifies rather than to have it debated in the House.  The Senator also referred to pay increases.  Public sector pay is an important matter and the issue the Senator raises is one many of us are alarmed about.  That is particularly so regarding the pay and conditions of local authority members but also around the pay and conditions of top civil servants in light of that.  Senator Norris knows well that Senator McFadden has been a champion of the pay and conditions of members of the Defence Forces.  Public sector pay is a matter on which we can have a debate to include Members of the Oireachtas, local authority members and people at different levels of the Civil Service and public service generally.<\/p> <p>Senator Higgins proposed an amendment to the Order of Business which I will not accept.  The Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Bruton, is coming to the House on 5 November and Senator Higgins has the opportunity to have a one-on-one discussion with him during a Commencement matter.

As half a layman in agriculture, it is about ensuring we can farm.  We are accustomed to rainfall in our climate.  I share the Senator&rsquo;s view that it is not a case of one size fits all and farming cannot just be done by the calendar.  That is a personal observation.  I am happy to have a discussion with the Minister on derogations and extensions.<\/p><p>Senators McDowell and Paddy Burke raised the issue of the scrutiny of EU legislation.  I am happy to support any role this House can play in the ongoing and deepening scrutiny of EU legislation.  Senator Burke&rsquo;s point that the House could do more in this regard was particularly relevant.  I do not share Senator McDowell&rsquo;s view that we are heading towards Armageddon.  However, I am happy for the Minister to come to the House to debate this issue.  It is important we take the scrutiny of EU legislation seriously.  I subscribe to the view that we need to do more in this House on this matter.  I am happy to work with all Members to ensure this happens.<\/p><p>Senator O&rsquo;Reilly welcomed the deployment of new Garda recruits, as well as the armed support unit, to Cavan.  I commend John McCartin on his appearance on \"Claire Byrne Live\", his comments and his courage in his particular situation.  I hope people will take notice of what he said.<\/p><p>In the case of Cavan, the Border area needs further Garda strengthening.  I hope Cork city receives new garda&iacute; in the new allocation to be announced in the coming months.  It is important the second city receives its fair share of new recruits.<\/p><p>Senators Warfield, Bacik, Kelleher and Mullen referred to the changes in the situation in the North of our country around the decriminalisation of abortion services and the introduction of marriage equality.  The points made on all sides are important and I hope we will take notice of what is said.  I am not going to wade into the debate, other than to say that, in the case of the decision in question, it has shown there is a lacuna and a need for an assembly.  It highlights the importance of the assembly.  I hope it will be up and running soon.<\/p><p>Senator Kelleher raised a report she launched last week related to the issue of housing and homelessness.  Regarding the young boy who was pictured on social media last week eating on the street, it is important that those who know his identity or whereabouts will engage with the authorities to ensure his well-being is catered for.  I engage with homeless services every week.  Last Friday night, I participated in the Focus Ireland sleep-out on Spike Island.  It is important to recognise a significant amount of work is being done around homelessness and performance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019102200002#AA00300","speaker":"1391","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571751000,"counter":141,"content":"<p>It is not enough, however.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019102200002#BB00200","speaker":"1430"},{"type":"speech","time":1571751000,"counter":142,"content":"<p>We can never do enough.

Much of the debate or the mood music has been to the effect that we are somehow irresponsible or that we are enemies of the environment.  This designation of land as national heritage areas is above and beyond what we are strictly required to do under birds and habitats directives, which give us SACs and so on.  We are actually being responsible.<\/p> <p>We know there are issues in the environment.  They receive coverage.  We know that in areas such as biodiversity or climate change, things are not as they ought to be.  However, sometimes the debate in the House becomes academic.  What is happening on the ground around designated land is quite a different story.  The amendment seeks to provide to the Minister permission to recognise that in some instances a community may gain from a project, which would override certain concerns.  It is not that we do not mitigate to protect the environment or wildlife - we do - but that there is a greater objective.  We should not be ashamed to say that in addition to conservation objectives and objectives around the public good, we acknowledge that socio-economic objectives are included in the public good.  There is never a debate about that.<\/p> <p>The western seaboard has a great deal of designated land and special areas of conservation, which has proven a serious impediment to the socio-economic growth of some areas.  Senator Burke alluded to certain projects such as a national primary road, Cloongullane Bridge, which has been held up for some time while An Bord Plean&aacute;la grants planning permission because an area designated as a special area of conservation, the River Moy SAC, and the presence of freshwater pearl mussel and alluvial woodland.  Prior to that, in 2010, An Bord Plean&aacute;la refused a major road project, the N26 phase 2, from Mount Falcon to Bohola.  Some &euro;5 million had been spent on that before it was refused because of hooper swans and overdesign due to SACs.<\/p> <p>For anyone unfamiliar with the west and the particular areas we are discussing, the designation of SACs and so on can give the impression that we are discussing some wilderness away from people.  It is not.  The River Moy SAC passes through one major town, Ballina, as well as Foxford and Swinford.  These are towns that have existed for hundreds of years with major population settlements and roads.  We are unable to remove dangerous turns from the road because of environmental objectives being put over and above proper roads and infrastructure for people, which is what the Government wants to deliver.  Nobody thinks projects such as the bridge at Cloongullane are not needed.  Some &euro;2 million was secured for a new bridge in Glenisland in Mayo where there is a bad road, the R312.  Again, freshwater pearl mussel is an impediment.  I do not have to tell the Minister of State about how environmental designation is proving an impediment.  Think of the Galway ring road.  For Galway to continue to thrive, it requires proper road infrastructure around it.  Since the road was refused, I understand there is now planning permission for a road that requires tunnelling under Menlo and Ballybrittas.  The road from Galway out to Clifden requires the bends being taken out of it.  It is highly dangerous.  There have been 18 consultations with the National Parks and Wildlife Service.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la has never granted planning permission with more conditions.<\/p> <p>The root of the problem is not with local authorities or the Government trying to ride roughshod over environmental objectives but with legislation that is so overwhelmingly in favour of habitats and the species in them.  I am not saying that national heritage areas are exactly the same as SACs but I wish to put paid to the idea that if the House does not scrutinise and amend this, the environment will be degraded somehow.  That is not correct.  I can take anyone who is seriously interested in the issue through several projects.  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, provided me with a good list of all the projects that have been held up.  These areas have been left behind and it is costing the Exchequer millions.  The people have to live too.  There are ways to mitigate and we must be responsible.  Many people in the country are proud and responsible when it comes to the environment.<\/p> <p>Any time these planning applications or proposals for development go before the appropriate authorities, the county council, An Bord Plean&aacute;la, or other bodies such as the Office of Public Works, OPW, in the case of flood relief measures, they are afraid of their lives they will be sued and brought to the European Court of Justice because an i has not been dotted or a t crossed in relation to environmental designation.  It is a quagmire.  We are practically paralysed in the delivery of projects.  People must examine and re-examine.<\/p> <p>The Minister of State, Deputy Moran, was in Crossmolina.  The town has been on the capital plan for the delivery of flood defences since September 2015.  Prior to that, the OPW had a scheme in mind that it shelved.  There was more environmental work done.  It wanted to do a channel to bypass the town when the water reached a certain height.  It is absolutely devastating there.  If there is another flood there, and this has been threatened many times, no one has insurance and the town centre is old, so they are in a terrible predicament.  After an environmental impact assessment report in May 2018, we thought there would be construction this summer, based on a response to me at a joint committee by OPW commissioners, although that was not written in stone.  Needless to say, that has not happened.  Last February they told us that we needed to do more environmental designation because they were going to put some sort of mechanical piece in the river.  At some point we must call it.  I am not disrespecting or saying that there is not a scientific need for certain things, but it will be poor comfort for people in the event that they are flooded again this winter.  I sincerely hope nothing like that happens.  No one wants that.

It is very important to have a provision that allows for a community or a Minister, following the appropriate consultation provided for in the legislation, to decide there is a socioeconomic objective that needs to be pursued and fulfilled, where nobody is objecting to it and it is necessary to work around whatever designation is in place.  Nobody is going to be reckless.  There is such a thing as engineering mitigation and that is the way we need to proceed.  I expect that these will be exceptional circumstances.  That is the reality.  People could be bewildered by this if they are watching the debate, as if we are going to become hooligans and do something terrible to the countryside.  The west and rural Ireland is not a theme park or somewhere to go for the weekend.  It is where people live and want to raise their families.  They want to have a chance.  The aim of Government policy, and everybody might not agree with it, is that we develop not just the big cities, but also rural areas in an appropriate fashion.  We are all mature and responsible enough to do that.

It is scientifically acknowledged that we are in the midst of the sixth mass extinction.  Some 200 species become extinct every day.  Since 1970, humanity has wiped out 60% of mammals, birds, fish and reptiles.  The assessment of the overall status of habitats in Ireland is that 85% of habitats are in unfavourable conditions and 46% are demonstrating declining trends.  In terms of peatlands in Ireland, 26% of Ireland's mammal species utilise peatland.  Some 75% of the world's organic store carbon is in peatlands.  Blanket bogs are key.  As regards our native flora and fauna, given that people talk about wanting to enjoy the birds and the bees, 49% of all endangered species are found on our peatlands and 23% of Ireland's endangered plants - the relationship between our pollinators and our indigenous plant life is key - are peatlands species.  When talking about the balance we should be clear that the balance has been skewed.  It has been particularly skewed over the last few decades because this generation has extracted peat at a level and in a different way from what previous generations may have done.  It has been machine led.  Let us be clear about that.<\/p> <p>With regard to all these projects and development being discussed, we are not discussing all peatland in this debate, only peatland in the natural heritage areas.  We are discussing peatland strategy as a whole, but the bogs that may be de-designated under this are bogs that have been identified as a small number of natural heritage areas which are of particular heritage importance.  This is not to say that one cannot do anything in Ballina; it says what happens in these recognised heritage areas.<\/p> <p>It was said that we would work around any designation.  The Bill allows for there to be no designation.  These areas would be de-designated and open to activities.  The key point is the decision on de-designating them.  The Minister has already made far too much of a concession to this amendment.  We talked about regional, social, cultural and economic needs.  They are already referred to in the Bill.  The decision on de-designation and designation already involved a balancing of environmental criteria, which are poorly defined in my opinion, against economic, social and cultural needs.  What this amendment seeks to do is not green projects, necessarily, but greens.  It involves sporting projects or facilities.  It refers to enhancement of a community, but that is already covered under social, cultural and economic needs.  However, the amendment adds \"sporting projects or facilities, golf courses, sports fields, greenways, community gain or strategic infrastructural projects\".  In talking about sporting and recreational needs, which is the Minister of State's version of it, I have yet to hear an assurance from him that he is not including golf courses in his definition.  The definition he has added through the addition of sporting and recreational needs as a ground or one of the factors to be considered in de-designating a protected area covers all these things.  That is the reason I will propose amendments later to explicitly exclude golf courses.  A golf course is not in any way a green or biodiverse environment comparable to peatland.  It is a straight misrepresentation to do this.<\/p> <p>I also wish to appeal against the idea that this is about the west of Ireland versus others.  I am from the west, and I have talked to people from Carna to Clare Island about this Bill.  They care about their environment.  They want community development and projects in their local areas, but many young people across the west want thought-through planning that works in terms of biodiversity, which means that they, their communities and the environment can work together.  They have many brilliant new ideas on how that should be done.  They are passionate about this and want it to be done.<\/p> <p>Some of the projects will need to be changed.  Flooding was mentioned.  Bad planning without due regard to environmental considerations has been one of the massive contributors to flooding.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019102200002#JJ00400","speaker":"1405"},{"type":"speech","time":1571751000,"counter":199,"content":"<p>Not in Mayo.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019102200002#JJ00500","speaker":"1425"},{"type":"speech","time":1571751000,"counter":200,"content":"<p>In east Galway.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019102200002#KK00100","speaker":"1405"},{"type":"speech","time":1571751000,"counter":201,"content":"<p>Not in Mayo.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019102200002#KK00200","speaker":"1425"},{"type":"speech","time":1571751000,"counter":202,"content":"<p>The Senator should come to east Galway and see the flooding there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019102200002#KK00300","speaker":"1405"},{"type":"speech","time":1571751000,"counter":203,"content":"<p>Not in Mayo.

Regarding amendment No. 19,  Government amendment No. 11 provides that within the context of a review of natural heritage areas and selecting the most suitable bog habitats to be designated or to cease to be designated, regard would be had to recreational sporting needs, including greenways, appropriate to bog habitats as well as to national, regional and local economic, social and cultural needs, as already provided for in the Bill.  I have also ensured that any regard to the recreational sporting needs appropriate to bog habitats in a review of a natural heritage area would be subject to a strategic environmental assessment, including public consultation in the carrying out of any other screening for assessment or, as the case may be, the assessment if required.<\/p><p>The Wildlife (Amendment) Bill 2016 strikes a balance between the need to maintain or restore bog habitats to a favourable conservation status, to live up to our EU obligations, and to work with landowners, turf cutters and local communities.  I am endeavouring to ensure this delicate balance is maintained and there is not increased pressure to dedesignate certain sites where there is a valid environmental reason to keep such sites designated as natural heritages areas.  If such dedesignations were to interfere with any national conservation objective target area for bog habitat within the special areas of conservation and natural heritage area networks, this would lead to difficulties, for example, with the European Commission.<\/p><p>Natural heritage areas are also part of the national conservation objective target, for example, for raised bog habitat within the special areas of conservation and natural heritage area networks.

If the Minister of State indicates that he is amenable to any one of these approaches, I will be happy to withdraw the other amendments and press forward with the preferred approach.  These amendments attempt to address the issue of what happens when an area ceases to be a natural heritage area.  It is an attempt to address the fact that land that is de-designated under this Act could potentially be open to commercial exploitation.  We know that the Government's overall national strategy is moving away from the commercial cutting of turf.<\/p> <p>Amendment 29 provides that \"without prejudice to turbary rights [...] harvesting using machinery shall not be permitted\".  This gets to the issue.  Amendment No. 30 sets out clear criteria with regard to household use.  I will be very clear, as I have been throughout proceedings, that I do not contest the importance of the relationship societies and families have with bogs and peatland.  Many people have, for many generations, exercised their turbary rights.  It is one of the lingering features of commonage.  I understand the relationship we have with bogs right across the west of Ireland.  I do not wish to automatically inhibit that relationship.  I note that most natural heritage areas already allow for the exercise of turbary rights.  Any area currently designated as a natural heritage area, and where turf cutting has previously been practised, can already allow for the exercise of turbary rights.  There is already a precedent of good practice in this regard.  In that sense, I wish these areas would remain natural heritage areas.  Perhaps an examination of how turbary rights are exercised on those lands might be carried out.  The Minister of State might look to that.  <\/p> <p>If areas are to be de-designated and no longer protected, we need to look to additional layers of protection or clarification.  Amendment No. 29 suggests that harvesting using machinery should not be permitted.  Amendment No. 31 specifically says that only peat extraction by sle&aacute;n may be permitted.  We have heard people speak very poetically in this house about their love of the birds and the bees, the days they have had on the bog, being out with the flask of tea, and all of the rest.  I know of this too because my family has done it in Mayo.  I know that it is part of people's experience and an experience they want to pass on, but we are increasingly moving towards a point at which turbary rights will have to recognised as part of a shared heritage.  We cannot have people maximising exploitation.  It is a very different thing to exercise one's turbary rights by cutting and spreading on the bog oneself or with one's family or neighbours as opposed to simply hiring a contractor and having a sausage machine come in and hoover up a section of bogland.  My amendment seeks to respect turbary rights, but to clarify those rights and define inappropriate activity.  That is why amendment No. 29 respects household use while not permitting harvesting using machinery.  The Minister of State has previously indicated that there were questions and thoughts with regard to what kinds of machinery might be appropriate, especially as we move into an era in which carbon emissions are becoming a concern and scale is becoming an issue.<\/p> <p>Amendment No. 31 provides that those who wish to cut by sle&aacute;n can do so, but it makes clear that the use of machinery is not appropriate.  Amendment No. 30 seeks to address another specific issue.  Under this amendment, people exercising their turbary rights to extract peat for their household use is fine.  That is what is envisaged by turbary rights.

It is my understanding that, in the past, in circumstances where people had turbary rights but the location had become a special area of conservation, for example, and turf cutting was longer allowed or appropriate under European law, compensation packages were put forward.  In some instances, persons were informed that their turbary rights would effectively be relocated to new areas.  Some of these areas may be de-designated under this Act.  It is my understanding that people given the right to exercise turbary rights in new areas would be subject to a restriction whereby they would not be allowed to sell that turf and it would not be considered a part of the agreement that the State makes with somebody granted new rights of turbary access in an area.<\/p><p>This is an attempt to ensure that everybody, including those with long-standing or historic turbary rights in respect of a site, as well as those who have turbary rights relocated to a site, would have consistency and where an area ceases to be designated as a natural heritage area, any turf subsequently extracted may not be sold.  These amendments are all trying to address not the activity of turf cutting but the way in which it happens, its scale and, in particular, the commercial aspect.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 32 is consequential and would be relevant if one of the others is agreed.  Amendments Nos. 45 and 46 relate to something quite similar but they put the regulations base a little further down the line.  If the Minister of State indicated an openness in respect of those amendments, it could affect whether I must press any of those in my name.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019102200002#NN02300","speaker":"1405","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571751000,"counter":239,"content":"<p>They are not part of this group; they will be taken in their own time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019102200002#OO00200","speaker":"1384"},{"type":"speech","time":1571751000,"counter":240,"content":"<p>Of course.

It is proposed that when a natural heritage area is de-designated, domestic turf cutting may continue on the site while larger scale or commercial turf cutting will continue to be regulated through other consent systems, such as through the planning system and integrated pollution control licensing by the Environmental Protection Agency.  Under the cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme administered by the Department, turf cutters seeking to relocate to a non-designated bog, may opt for the delivery of 15 tonnes of turf per year for household use while awaiting relocation.  In addition, the legal agreement signed by each relocating turf cutter includes a provision that the turf extracted from the relocation site is for domestic use and is not to be sold.  Other than that, it would not be appropriate for the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht to endeavour to regulate turf cutting in non-designated sites.  The focus of the Minister is on protected sites.<\/p> <p>The Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government has advised that the development of a new regulatory framework for smaller scale peat extraction will be initiated and progressed.  I am willing to write to the Minister requesting that his Department take into account the provisions of the amendments proposed by Senators in the development of this framework.

It was a disgraceful decision by those backbenchers.  Nonetheless, all these considerations are in play, including those brought by the Minister of State.  There was a concession too far but I supported social, economic and cultural considerations.  The addition relates to recreational and sporting concerns.  There are a number of factors so how is the Minister of State considering social, economic and cultural factors while also examining what happens to the peat or to the ground after extraction?  The bog may in future be used as a car park for a hotel or it may become an amenity and that is already allowed.  I appreciate that did not come from the Minister of State's amendments.  If there is an economic case and an economic benefit may come from the bog, it can be considered.  The Minister of State is already considering what will happen afterwards.  We could consider the case made locally in respect of economic, social, sporting or recreational considerations.  We would be considering the future life of this potentially de-designated bog.<\/p> <p>It is appropriate, given that the Minister of State is considering what happens next as part of the review, that he should also consider what happens next in terms of turf cutting.  There is a logical consistency in that.  I do not wish to press the Minister of State but it is an illogical inconsistency to say it is beyond the ambit of the Department to say whether the turf could be cut by machine afterwards or the bog could be opened to commercial exploitation.  Whatever steps may be needed to avoid that likelihood is part of the Department's consideration.<\/p> <p>The Minister of State mentioned there may be future regulation on small-scale cutting as every bit of cutting is still cutting, whether it is on a vast or a small bog.  For example, the Minister of State could assure me no bogs would be de-designated prior to the existence of regulations on small-scale cutting but we do not have such an assurance in the Bill.  Perhaps it is something people may put forward in the D&aacute;il but I do not know that.  Currently, a bog may be de-designated and there is a lacuna in the context of what happens afterwards.  The Minister of State has recognised the issue in the contracts for relocation and I just seek consistency.  I do not need to press all of these and I come with multiple approaches in the hope of finding one that is amenable to the Minister of State or which might work.

The Bill states: \"...includes a candidate special area of conservation or a special area of conservation, within the ... European Communities (Birds and Natural Habitats) Regulations\".  I have a concern about including these bog habitats in the Government's consideration.  The Minister of State will tell me he is not at liberty to de-designate or remove protections from these areas.  However, I am extraordinarily grateful for the fact the European Union is not opening them up because I have no doubt all kinds of wonderful plans might be made for these internationally recognised, massively significant areas of natural heritage, and there are many great schemes and many things people would like to do with them.  However, that is not open to the Government as it is prohibited by the EU.<\/p> <p>The danger, and my concern, is that the Bill later uses the method of simple comparison as the means by which to justify a de-designation.  For example, in regard to de-designation, the Minister of State said the Government is going to be looking at any bog that is on the list for potential de-designation and comparing it to another bog, for example, a raised bog could be compared to another bog, and it is basically considering or comparing whether the bog has a better or worse environmental value than the other bog.  Perhaps the Minister of State can address this concern and I will not have to press the amendment.  My concern is that, effectively, natural heritage area bogs would be compared with special area of conservation bogs, and it will be determined that the special area of conservation bogs are of better environmental, habitat or other value, and that will be used to justify the de-designating of the natural heritage area bog.<\/p> <p>Does the Minister of State understand my concern?  We already have something that has been determined by independent actors to be of an additional level of environmental value and given that additional protection of special area of conservation.  These have already been shown to have an even higher level of environmental importance than natural heritage areas.  However, the existence of there being something more precious, under the provisions of the Bill, is used as a justification for de-designating, so we would rate our bogs and say one is of supreme importance and another is just of importance.<\/p> <p>I understand that, in terms of general policy, the Government wishes to look at special areas of conservation as well.  However, I want assurances that special area of conservation bogs will never be used as comparators to justify removing protection from natural heritage area bogs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019102200002#RR01200","speaker":"1405"},{"type":"speech","time":1571751000,"counter":266,"content":"<p>I understand this amendment seeks to exclude special a1reas of conservation, SACs, from the definition of \"bog habitat\" in the Bill.

The individual raised bogs examined comprised the 53 raised bog SACs, the existing 75 NHA raised bogs and more than 100 non-designated sites.

He referred to elements in a review.  The amendment relates to the main element of the environmental criteria that will be considered in deciding whether to designate or de-designate a bog.  The section relating to raised bogs states: \"'environmental criteria' in so far as it relates to a raised bog, means the conservation value of the raised bog taking into account a comparison made between the area, range, habitat, structure, function and ecological features of that raised bog and those of one or more than one other raised bog\".  All that is required in terms of the environmental criteria is to compare a bog from which one is about to remove protection with any other bog.  It may be an expression of delight for people who think this is wonderful and they will all be in a particular project, but it is actually very sad.  One simply compares a bog with any other bog.  That is why I asked that question of the Minister of State on the previous amendment and why I believe it will need to be addressed in the D&aacute;il.  It may be subject of complaint in Europe if special areas of conservation are effectively used to justify de-designation.<\/p> <p>Will it be the same bog?  Will each bog of the 36 mentioned by the Minister of State be compared to the same bog?  There are 100 de-designated sites.  There are already far more unprotected sites.  Let us be clear that protected bogland is in the minority.  There are 100 de-designated sites which are not protected, but there are 36 natural heritage areas of raised bog.  There is a similar number of quite specific protected blanket bogs.  The Minister of State will be deciding whether to remove protection from a particular natural heritage area bog based on a comparison with another bog.  Will each of them be compared with the same bog?  Will one bog be chosen as a gold standard and each bog in question be compared to it?  Will the 36 bogs be compared to all the other 36?  Will the bog with which comparison is made be one of the 36 natural heritage areas or will it be a special area of conservation bog?  This is a very rough tool.  I appeal to the Minister of State to consider accepting the amendment.  It would probably do more to improve the Bill than any other thing one could do at this stage.<\/p> <p>The Minister of State outlined that he wishes to look at a consideration.  Rather than comparing each bog with another and deciding which will be destroyed because it is assumed that one of them is up for the chop, perhaps each bog could be considered with reference to the factors outlined, including area, range, habitat, structure, function and the ecological features of each bog.  Those are not necessarily the factors I would have included.  Does each bog deserve consideration on its terms, values and contribution to ecology, biodiversity, habitat and climate, rather than using a comparator mechanism in making the decision?  Once one goes into comparators, the game is over.  One may decide to de-designate 20 bogs and decide which 20 of the 36 one wishes to de-designate.  It is a very rough tool.  I appeal to the Minister of State to consider replacing \"a comparison\" with \"a consideration\".  It would mean a lot and it would make clear that, at least, each individual act of de-designation was given proper consideration on its own terms and value.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019102200002#SS01100","speaker":"1405"},{"type":"speech","time":1571751000,"counter":278,"content":"<p>The Senator queried the definition of &ldquo;environmental criteria&rdquo; as it relates to raised bog.

Amendment No. 36 is a straightforward proposal to delete the inclusion of blanket bog.  This is possibly the last place in the Bill where we can constructively remove blanket bogs.  The Bill was originally designed to deal with raised bogs, as we have discussed previously.  I am seeking to ensure that with the small number of natural heritage areas we have, the small number of areas that have been designated as protected compared with most peatland in this country, we are dealing with what the 12-year process was designed to do.  Raised bogs are where the consultations have taken place and the scientific research already exists.  I may not like it but I respect the process.  It is clear that it has been rigorous to some extent and involved public consultation.  I emphasise that it was public consultation prior to proposals to de-designate.  There has been a series of conversations on raised bogs and how they are managed in this country.  Including blanket bogs at the last minute is a step backwards.<\/p> <p>We must seize this last opportunity to ensure that the Bill only does what it was originally designed to do, which is address the designation, de-designation, protection and other issues in respect of raised bogs, and does not inappropriately drag in another environment with its own ecosystem, species, habitats, plant life - I have spoken previously about the levels of endangerment - and its natural wildlife corridors.  It plays a role and has particular vulnerabilities due to soakage and because it is low lying.  The question of wetting is more important and the draining is both more onerous and more dangerous in those areas.  The specific issues with blanket bogs that have not been properly considered and reviewed are reasons that blanket bogs should be removed from the Bill.  This is the last section where they could be removed from the Bill and the process of de-designation.  That is why I am pressing amendment No. 36.<\/p> <p>Amendment No. 37 refers to carbon sequestration, biodiversity and pollination.  I have addressed those issues.<\/p> <p>Amendment No. 36a deals with comparison and consideration.  With the previous amendments, Nos. 33a, which referred to comparison and consideration, and 34, I acknowledge that Fianna F&aacute;il, Sinn F&eacute;in, Independent Senators, my colleagues in the Civil Engagement group and others voted for those improvements in the process and to ensure that the process would be one of appropriate consideration rather than the clumsy mechanism of comparison.  When I raised this previously the Minister of State did not answer.  How does he see comparison working?  When he talks about one bog being compared with one or other bogs, can he tell us unequivocally he will not be comparing a natural heritage area bog that is due for potential de-designation and the loss of its status with a special area of conservation bog?  Will the same single comparator, the gold standard as it were, be used in respect of multiple bogs?  Where there is a proposal that five bogs be de-designated, for example, is there the potential that each of those five will be compared with the same single bog?  What is the mechanism?  I am not asking for a list of other things that go into the review in other parts or the things the Minister must do because Europe requires it.<\/p> <p>How does the mechanism in the comparison work?  Is it the case that if one bog is compared with another bog and the other bog has a better habitat and perhaps a better environmental component in the criteria, the bog that loses out in the comparison will automatically be open to de-designation?  Will it be regarded as having failed the environmental criteria test because it did not win in a one-on-one comparison?  The approach being proposed is unusual.  Yes, we did a comparison at the original point when we were looking at which areas needed to be protected, but that was a national review and comparison.  However, this is one-on-one.  It is a type of a grand slam league between bogs.  In a comparison mechanism one loses.  I have not heard one word on it.  There are other areas in the Bill where the Minister of State has made progress, added issues and addressed matters, but I have not heard a single word from him that the scenarios I have described are not how it will work.  We have not heard how comparison works.  That is why I propose that it be consideration rather than comparison.  Each bog should be considered on its merits.  If it is decided then to de-designate it, so be it.  At least the bogs will have been considered in terms of what they do, the value they have and the wildlife and habitat there.  Each bog will have been given proper consideration on its own merits.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019102200002#WW01600","speaker":"1405"},{"type":"speech","time":1571751000,"counter":318,"content":"<p>The Senator makes valid points on this.

My point is that if there is a natural heritage area in a community which people want to continue to be protected and it is used in a comparator mechanism with another area of protected peatland in different community, it should not be the case that a natural heritage area valued by one community and a second valued by different community will be set against each other in terms of only one being preserved as a protected area.  It is a very simple example.  This is not a comment on anybody.  This is a comment on a comparator mechanism.  I continue to speak to people about this matter.  There is a generation of people coming up who are really concerned about these issues.  They do not solely live in cities; they are located all around the place.  I have spoken to young people.  As stated, a specific young person from Clare Island came to me and a number of people from Achill have talked to me, as well as people from across Carna.  They have really good ideas.  They like the greenways proposal, for example, and if that had been a proposal from the Minister, that would have been fine.
