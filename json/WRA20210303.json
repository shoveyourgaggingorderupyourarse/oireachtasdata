This is a significant modernisation project which greatly increases the range of documents that can be filed electronically, with resulting efficiency gains for both business and the CRO.   The new CRO cloud-based IT platform is designed to provide improved and faster user experience for presenters and a fully paperless interaction with the CRO for certain transactions, including the most common ones carried out by companies such as the filing of annual returns and the changing of directors and their details. The introduction of a fully paperless system for these transactions provides certainty of delivery for companies. In addition, the new system allows for the \"go live\" of the new one-stage filing deadline of 56 days from a company's annual return date, over-hauling the previous two stage annual returns filing process.<\/p>  <p>  I am aware that some issues have arisen as the system has bedded in, but have been assured that the majority of these are of a relatively minor nature and generally not impeding the filing of documents. I am also assured that any remaining issues continue to be addressed on a prioritised basis.<\/p>  <p>  As for the issues referred to by the Deputy, applications to incorporate companies can be submitted under one of two schemes, operated by the CRO &ndash; F&eacute; Phr&aacute;inn (which is an expedited process) and the ordinary online process. The CRO target is to register applications under the former within 5 working days and the latter within 10 working days. Processing times have improved in the past week following further enhancement to the CRO ICT system. At present, registration is taking 8 and 9 working days respectively. In relation to registering changes to company details, such as changes to company director \/ secretary details, a backlog in this area has recently been cleared and progress is being closely monitored by the CRO with a view to taking further remedial action, if required. In situations where customers are seeking to order hard copy documents in the post, this can take a number of days due to lower levels of staff being present in the office due to COVID 19 level 5 restrictions. In general, online requests for electronic copies are being dealt with as they arise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021030300074#WRB01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1474"},{"type":"question","counter":33,"qnumday":14,"qnumall":"[11035\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021030300074#WRB01300","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"if the Companies Registration Office has plans to accept recognised platforms such as a platform (details supplied) for electronically submitted documents; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1473","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":34,"content":"<p>The Registrar of Companies is a statutory role and the Registrar has administrative independence in the exercise of this function. <\/p>  <p>  I understand that documents filed electronically with the CRO can be authenticated using ROS (Revenue Online Signature).

Approximately 2,000 people are employed in manufacturing operations. This includes Dairy Operations employing 597 staff and Consumer Foods employing 1,182 full-time and 140 part-time staff. The remaining 1,819 jobs in Ireland are made up of R&amp;D, administration, back office, agri-business, and headquarter staff based in locations in Tralee, Charleville, and Naas. I understand the manufacturing and production operations will not be impacted.   <\/p>  <p>  The employment services of the other State agencies including Intreo will be available to all impacted workers as they assess their options. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021030300074#WRB02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1474"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Company Law","counter":44,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021030300074#WRB02500"},{"type":"question","counter":45,"qnumday":18,"qnumall":"[11057\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021030300074#WRB02600","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"the impact that the outsourcing of the functions of a company (details supplied) to Malaysia will have in terms of reporting to the Company Registration Office; if issues of oversight or compliance will transfer to Malaysia; the discussions there has been with the company; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1489","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":46,"content":"<p>Firstly, my thoughts are with any employees losing their jobs at this time and I would encourage any companies which are restructuring their operations to do all they can to provide support and practical assistance to such employees.

The Government has put in place a comprehensive package to help businesses and workers during the pandemic, including the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS), the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP), the COVID-19 Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS), low-cost loans, the deferral and warehousing of tax liabilities and the waiver of commercial rates. Full details are available here at: <\/p><p>At an early stage of this crisis, it became apparent that the impacts on economic activity were going to remain with us for much longer than originally anticipated. It also became clear that many businesses were incurring costs such as rent, rates, insurances, maintenance, security and other utilities, on an ongoing basis without the ability to generate the revenues required to meet these costs. Most of these costs are associated with the running costs of a premises, while for businesses without a fixed premises, fixed costs will likely be lower as a proportion of their total expenses.  <\/p><p>I acknowledge that many businesses who do not trade from a commercial premises have been severely impacted, and for those individuals and businesses, Government has already moved to provide income supports in the form of the PUP, TWSS and EWSS which are payable regardless of sector and are available to employees, sole traders and proprietary directors. Where gaps have been identified, Government has moved quickly to fill those gaps and to ensure that nobody is left behind. Self-employed individuals can now earn up to &euro;960 over an 8-week period and still remain eligible for the PUP. The Enterprise Support Grant, introduced by my colleague the Minister for Social Protection was a one-off grant introduced to reimburse certain non-rate paying businesses who had closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, for re-opening costs up to a maximum of &euro;1,000. <\/p><p>In the 2021 Budget, the Government allocated significant additional resources to Departments to provide help to different sectors. I would highlight the &euro;395m provided to the Department of Transport and the &euro;222m allocated to the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media.<\/p><p>These additional monies will go towards helping businesses, including self-employed and those that are not rate paying businesses, such as through the &euro;30m for private bus operators, &euro;55m for a focused business scheme for strategic tourism businesses along with a &euro;50m scheme for the live entertainment sector.<\/p><p>These are in addition to financial assistance and other schemes provided to businesses via Enterprise Ireland, InterTrade Ireland and Local Enterprise Offices.  <\/p><p>The three main schemes, the CRSS, EWSS and PUP compare favourably with any other packages on offer in other countries.

This is a payment for people aged between 65 and 66 years who are no longer engaged in employment or self-employment.  Eligibility for the payment is determined by a person&rsquo;s PRSI contributions.  A person in receipt of this payment will not be required to be available for full-time work or genuinely seeking work and they will not be required to sign on the Live Register.  <\/p><p>The Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) is an independent statutory office under the aegis of my Department. The WRC has produced a code of practice on longer working hours which sets out guidance for employers, employees and their representatives, best principles and practices to follow during the engagement between employers and employees in the run up to retirement including responding to requests to work beyond the retirement age in the employment concerned.  The Code outlines the matters to be considered by both the employer and employee in relation to a request by an individual to work longer than the contracted retirement age.<\/p><p>Where a decision is taken to refuse a request to work beyond the retirement age, the grounds for the decision should be set out and communicated in a meeting with the employee. This will help the employee to understand why the request has not been granted, give the employee confidence that his\/her case has been given serious consideration and that there are good grounds for refusing the request. The applicant should have recourse to an appeals mechanism, for example through the normal established grievance procedures in the organisation. The WRC's code can be accessed at the following link: <\/p><p>The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission has also published guidance material for employees and employers who use fixed-term contracts beyond what was the normal retirement age of 65 years, this  information can be accessed at the following link:<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021030300074#WRB05400","answer":true,"speaker":"1474"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Workplace Relations Commission","counter":74,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021030300074#WRB05500"},{"type":"question","counter":75,"qnumday":28,"qnumall":"[11565\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021030300074#WRB05600","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"the number of court prosecutions initiated by the Workplace Relations Commission in each of the years 2018 to 2020, in tabular form.","asker":"1476","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":76,"content":"<p>The Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) is an independent, statutory body under the aegis of my Department, established on 1st October 2015 under the Workplace Relations Act 2015.

Under this architecture the Commission represents Ireland and other Member States, taking into account the needs of individual Member States and the collective good of the Union in international trade negotiations.  <\/p>  <p>  The EU's Trade Policy Committee (TPC) advises and assists the Commission in negotiating agreements with third countries, such as Canada, or in international organisations in the area of the common commercial policy.  It also acts as one of the preparatory bodies in the decision-making process of the Council as regards EU trade policy.  My Department represents Ireland at the TPC and engages with other Government Departments, as relevant issues arise, to ensure Ireland&rsquo;s interests are considered in all EU Trade Policy related matters. <\/p>  <p>  EU-Canada negotiations for a Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) started in May 2009 and were concluded at the EU-Canada Summit on 26 September 2014.  CETA is currently applied on a provisional basis, since September 2017, with the ratification process still ongoing at the EU Member State level.  Canada has already completed its ratification process. <\/p>  <p>  The Agreement covers virtually every aspect of economic activity and will provide new market opportunities in many sectors for Irish firms given the extensive bilateral business links between Ireland and Canada.  Indeed, outside of Europe, the US and China, Canada is our largest indigenous export market.  More than 400 Enterprise Ireland clients are doing business in the Canadian market employing over 6,000 people.  Since the commencement of provisional application, duties on 98% of products that the EU trades with Canada have been removed.  Furthermore, exports of Irish goods and services to Canada totalled approximately &euro;3.9 billion in 2019, a 35% increase compared to 2016, the last full year, prior to the provisional application of CETA.  <\/p>  <p>  CETA will enhance Canadian consumer&rsquo;s access to the EU&rsquo;s and Ireland&rsquo;s all important creative and cultural goods.  For example, under CETA, Canadian tariffs on EU jewellery of up to 8.5% are now eliminated, benefiting Irish and European exporters, including SMEs and individual designers\/ craftspeople.  With Canada ending 99% of its tariffs on European goods, numerous European creative and cultural goods have become cheaper on the Canadian market.  Furthermore, textiles and clothing made in the EU, once taxed at 18% - are now tariff-free. <\/p>  <p>  CETA has an entire chapter dedicated to protecting the intellectual property of EU and Canadian producers.  This is of particular benefit to the EU&rsquo;s film, music and publishing industries.  Both the EU and Canada largely align their intellectual property laws and commitments to international agreements such as the Berne Convention for the Protections of Literary and Artistic Works and the Rome Convention for the Protection of Performers, Producers of Phonograms and Broadcasting Organisations. <\/p>  <p>  Under CETA&rsquo;s conformity process, the EU&rsquo;s cultural and creative industries now benefit from the same intellectual property protections in Canada as they do domestically.  Canada has also committed to strengthening its border inspections for counterfeit trademark goods, especially coming as a benefit for the EU&rsquo;s textile, clothing and interior designers; while they will also enhance their effort to tackle pirated copyright goods, which would greatly help the EU and Irish artists, musicians and writers.<\/p>  <p>  The global economy is changing in ways that are making trade more important than ever before.  As a small, open economy, Ireland has benefitted immensely from our export orientated enterprises trading across the globe and, therefore, we fully support balanced international trade and the suite of EU Free Trade Agreements, including CETA, that seek to underpin this.  Diversifying trade is a key priority for this Government and an important part of our Brexit response and it will be an important factor in Ireland&rsquo;s economic recovery post-pandemic.  The best way to achieve export growth and market diversification is by improving the terms of trade for Irish firms.

Almost a million people of working age are now in receipt of weekly payments including the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP), Employment Wage Subsidy (EWSS) and Jobseekers Benefit or Allowance. Support for business includes the weekly CRSS payment for businesses forced to close their doors to the public, reduced VAT rates, a commercial rates holiday, the Sustaining Enterprise Fund, the Tourism Business Continuity Scheme as well as low cost loans.<\/p>  <p>  Budget 2021 provided a significant package of tax and expenditure measures to build the resilience of the economy and to help vulnerable but viable businesses across all sectors. Details of the wide range of supports available are on my Department&rsquo;s website.<\/p>  <p>  These measures are in addition to the &euro;7 billion July Stimulus of enterprise measures, which includes the Wage Subsidy Scheme extended through 2021, the Pandemic Unemployment Payment, grants, low-cost loans, write-off of commercial rates and deferred tax liabilities, all of which will help to improve cashflow amongst self-employed. We are providing for an extension of the tax warehousing scheme to include repayments of Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme funds owed by employers and preliminary tax obligations for adversely affected businesses.<\/p>  <p>  As announced in the July Stimulus, the Enterprise Support Grant was extended to assist eligible self-employed, including sole traders, who exit the PUP or jobseekers schemes, to re-start their business. Further information is available at www.gov.ie. The PUP and EWSS are now extended to end of June. <\/p>  <p>  I acknowledge that many businesses who do not trade from a commercial premises have been severely impacted, and for those individuals and businesses, Government has already moved to provide income supports in the form of the PUP, TWSS and EWSS which are payable regardless of sector and are available to employees, sole traders and proprietary directors. Where gaps have been identified, Government has moved quickly to fill those gaps and to ensure that nobody is left behind.  Self-employed individuals can now earn up to &euro;960 over an 8 week period and still remain eligible for the PUP.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy should also note that in the 2021 Budget, the Government allocated significant additional resources to Departments to provide help to different sectors. I would highlight the &euro;395m provided to the Department of Transport and the &euro;222m allocated to the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media.<\/p>  <p>  These additional monies will go towards helping businesses, including self employed and those that are not rate paying businesses, such as through the &euro;30m for private bus operators, &euro;55m for a focused business scheme for strategic tourism businesses along with a &euro;50m scheme for the live entertainment sector.<\/p>  <p>  These are in addition to financial assistance and other schemes provided to businesses via Enterprise Ireland, InterTrade Ireland and Local Enterprise Offices.   <\/p>  <p>  The three main schemes, the CRSS, EWSS and PUP compare favourably with any other packages on offer in other countries. The Government is very much open to proposals as to how we can help further but the Government schemes are generally designed to help meet fixed costs that cannot be avoided and it is not possible to provide compensation for loss of personal income or profits.<\/p>  <p>  I will continue to monitor closely the range of government schemes in place along with my Ministerial colleagues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021030300075#WRC02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1474"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Broadband Plan","counter":133,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021030300075#WRC03000"},{"type":"question","counter":134,"qnumday":48,"qnumall":"[12117\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021030300075#WRC03100","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"if he has engaged with National Broadband Ireland on any aspect of broadband provision in the past six months; and the outcome of any engagement.","asker":"1514","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":135,"content":"<p>I am meeting with National Broadband Ireland this week.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021030300075#WRC03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1474"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":136,"content":"<p>Question No. 49 answered with Question No. 16.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","counter":138,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021030300075#WRC03500"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Post Office Network","counter":137,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021030300075#WRC03400"},{"type":"question","counter":138,"qnumday":50,"qnumall":"[11943\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021030300075#WRC03500","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"if the necessary financial support as proposed by a union (details supplied) will be provided to establish an annual public service obligation with a view to supporting, underpinning and safeguarding the network of post offices throughout the country; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1517","askee":"1465"},{"type":"question","counter":139,"qnumday":58,"qnumall":"[11133\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021030300075#WRC03600","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the actions his Department is taking to support and strengthen the rural post office network and the wider post office network; if he will support the recommendations of a report (details supplied) on this issue; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1592","askee":"1465"},{"type":"question","counter":140,"qnumday":61,"qnumall":"[11398\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021030300075#WRC03700","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"when the recommendations of a report (details supplied) in relation to the post office network will be implemented.","asker":"1500","askee":"1465"},{"type":"question","counter":141,"qnumday":81,"qnumall":"[11626\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021030300075#WRC03800","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"if he has studied the proposals in a report (details supplied) for the support mechanism for postal services; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1549","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":142,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 50, 58, 61 and 81 together.<\/p>  <p>  I have reviewed the report referred to.

LULUCF includes activities associated with forestry, croplands, grasslands, wetlands, settlements and other lands. Hedgerows, as landscape features within the cropland and grassland categories can form part of the emissions and removal estimates for these land use categories.    It is important to note that in line with international reporting guidelines, emissions and removals of greenhouse gases associated with land based activities are reported in a different category to those associated with agricultural activity, which are accounted for under the Effort Sharing Regulation. The LULUCF (Regulation (EU) 2018\/841) has established the mechanisms whereby LULUCF activities, including forestry, are to be included in Member States emissions reduction targets for 2021 to 2030 under the Effort Sharing Regulation (Regulation (EU) 842\/2018).<\/p>  <p>  Data capture and measurement are core pillars for any accounting of carbon sequestration potential. As noted in the Climate Action Plan 2019, the biggest challenge in the data capture for Irish hedgerows is the quantification of the above and below ground biomass. To address the lack of data on the potential for hedgerow carbon sequestration, Teagasc has recently commenced a research project called &ldquo;Farm-Carbon &ndash; Farm Hedgerows and Non-forest Woodland Carbon&rdquo;. This project is due to be completed by the end of 2022.

Information for past years is extremely important in the context of establishing change in land use and landscape features given that the base years for the LULUCF Regulation (Regulation 842\/2018) are the 2005-2009 period. \u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021030300075#WRC05700","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Warmer Homes Scheme","counter":161,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021030300075#WRC05800"},{"type":"question","counter":162,"qnumday":57,"qnumall":"[11067\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021030300075#WRC05900","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the position regarding the availability of SEAI grants for those in private homes to retrofit and insulate their homes; the take-up of such grants; the current waiting time for a person that may wish to avail of same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1564","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":163,"content":"<p>My\u00a0Department funds a number of SEAI grant schemes to support homeowners to improve the energy efficiency of their properties.

The activities of commercial operators delivering high speed broadband within BLUE areas are not planned or funded by the State and my Department has no statutory authority to intervene in that regard. There may be a choice of operators offering this service in any given\u00a0area\u00a0and further information in this regard is available at www.comreg.ie\/compare\/#\/services. \u200b <\/p>  <p>  My Department receives a high volume of queries on the National Broadband Plan which cover a range of issues including those premises in BLUE areas which are experiencing broadband difficulties. Queries are dealt with on a case by case basis and the specific information sought in the Question is not available. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Complaints about service provision are a matter between the consumer and the service provider in the first instance. If this avenue has been exhausted without a satisfactory resolution, the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg) may be able to assist further. ComReg is the independent body that issues licences to broadband service providers and investigates complaints to make sure that companies are delivering services in line with their licence obligations.<\/p>  <p>  In the event that, having exhausted the above options, a premises located in the BLUE area still cannot get high speed broadband from service providers in the area, they should contact my Department at broadband@decc.gov.ie with full details and the matter will be investigated by my officials. The NBP High Speed Broadband Map is dynamic. This means that the intervention area can be\u00a0updated to reflect\u00a0new commercial plans, or\u00a0previous plans that have failed to materialise.\u00a0This flexibility allows for an increase or decrease in the number\u00a0of premises included in the State Intervention area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021030300076#WRD06800","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Waste Management","counter":249,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021030300076#WRD06900"},{"type":"question","counter":250,"qnumday":90,"qnumall":"[11898\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021030300076#WRD07000","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"when legislation will be introduced to enable a deposit return scheme for cans and bottles; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1588","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":251,"content":"<p>The roadmap for the\u00a0introduction of a deposit and return scheme (DRS) for plastic bottles and aluminium cans in 2022 is\u00a0outlined in\u00a0the Waste Action Plan for a Circular Economy launched last September.\u00a0   The legislative basis for the delivery of a DRS will be provided through the transposition of Directive (EU) 2019\/904 of the European Parliament\u00a0on the reduction of the impact of certain plastic products on the environment- commonly referred to as the Single Use Plastics Directive.

The majority of these chargers have been rolled out by the ESB through its eCars programme, with some public chargers being provided by local authorities, retail outlets and private companies.<\/p>  <p>  The Climate Action Fund (CAF) has also allocated up to &euro;10 million to a project from ESB eCars that will further enhance its current network and complete a nationwide EV charging network capable of facilitating large-scale electric vehicle uptake over the next decade. In addition to the CAF project, the Government is also providing support for home charging and on-street charging.<\/p>  <p>  Home charging is considered the primary method of charging for the majority of EVs in Ireland and is a convenient, cost effective and environmentally-friendly means of charging, especially when using night-rate electricity. It accounts for circa 80% of EV charging sessions and will continue to be the primary method of charging in the future. The EV Home Charger Grant Scheme has been in operation since January 2018 to support the installation of home chargers for purchasers of new and second-hand BEVs and PHEVs.  The grant provides generous support towards the full cost of installation of a home charger, up to a maximum of &euro;600. <\/p>  <p>  Currently, work is being progressed to expand the EV Home Charger Grant to include shared parking (e.g. in apartment blocks). There are a number of complex planning issues to address before it will be possible to expand this grant and the Department and the SEAI are working to address the issues involved. <\/p>  <p>  Since September 2019, the Public Charge Point Scheme has been in place to provide funding to local authorities for the development of on-street public chargers. The primary focus of this scheme is to provide support for the installation of infrastructure which will facilitate those owners of EVs who do not have access to a private parking space but rely on parking their vehicles on public streets to charge their EVs near their homes.  Infrastructure installed could also provide the opportunity for people visiting the area to park and charge their EVs. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Department is also making &euro;2 million available this year through the SEAI to support the installation of destination charge points in locations such as hotels and shopping centres.

It was concluded that such an initiative should be driven centrally. A whole of Government perspective allows the development of a set of principles outlining quality customer service for offline consumers, which could include bundling service delivery using existing nationwide customer facing networks.

This, coupled with the need to significantly reduce normal daily capacity to comply with occupational and public health requirements, led to further delays for those wishing to take the DTT.<\/p>  <p>  The DTT was not deemed to be an essential service under Level 5 restrictions, and the service has been closed since late December 2020.  The service will remain closed while level 5 restrictions remain in place.  While I fully appreciate the inconvenience this poses, I am sure you will agree with me that the limiting of the spread of the virus and the safeguarding of public health takes priority. <\/p>  <p>  The RSA, together with its service provider, have put plans in place to significantly increase capacity within the service when it is allowed to re-open. To cope with the initial four-month suspension, the service increased capacity from an average pre Covid19 capacity of 15,000 to over 25,000 monthly. A plan is being progressed to increase this capacity up to 50,000 per month when service resumes, to manage the backlog of customers and shorten waiting times. <\/p>  <p>  In addition to the increased capacity initiative, and at the request of the Department, the RSA is also working on a plan to rollout an online driver theory test service, Pro Proctor. Pro Proctor has been trialled on a pilot basis for those taking a theory test for trucks and buses during the months of December and January. The pilot is now being evaluated and the RSA is committed to extending the service for all theory test customers during 2021. There will be a limit on the number of customers that can avail of the service during the initial rollout phase but the objective is that it should be an option for all theory test customers during later phases of the rollout, in line with enhancing access to public services.   However, scaling up operations to facilitate higher numbers will take time to achieve.<\/p>  <p>It is important to recognise that there are no quick fixes and that the continuing build-up of applications as the pandemic goes on means that it will take time to return to a normal waiting time. It is also important to emphasise that the review of Level 5 restrictions will impact on how quickly the backlog plan can be delivered.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021030300077#WRE04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1578"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tourism Industry","counter":310,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021030300077#WRE05000"},{"type":"question","counter":311,"qnumday":110,"qnumall":"[11085\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021030300077#WRE05100","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the extent to which concerns raised by an organisation (details supplied) can be addressed in the short term; when a decision is likely to issue regarding same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":312,"content":"<p>I would remind the Deputy that under the Regulation 3(b)(xi) of the Road Safety Authority Act (Conferral of Functions) Order (S.I.

To date, the value of these supports to the Irish aviation industry is estimated to be over &euro;200 million with many extended into 2021.  I understand that Cork Airport is availing of these general business supports.  <\/p>  <p>  In addition, in recognition of the very difficult circumstances being faced by airports and taking account of the recommendations of the Taskforce for Aviation Recovery, the Government announced an &euro;80 million funding package specifically for Irish aviation in November 2020, which includes funding for State airports in 2021.<\/p>  <p>  As part of that package, &euro;32.1 million has been allocated to Cork and Shannon Airports in 2021 under a new Programme for Regional State Airports.  Capital funding requests under this Programme are currently being assessed by my Department.  These include a significant proposal for a runway reconstruction project at Cork Airport. This project is vital for the future of the airport and management of Cork Airport aim to to complete the project as quickly and efficiently as possible this year, using the optimum technical solution, at the lowest cost. <\/p>  <p>  My Department has also developed supplementary support schemes to help address liquidity issues at our airports as a result of Covid-19.

Cork Airport will shortly be invited to apply for funding under this new Scheme. <\/p>  <p>  In light of the above, and the support being provided, I am confident that Cork Airport will be in a position to build on its former success when it is safe for international travel to resume in earnest.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021030300077#WRE06700","answer":true,"speaker":"1578"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tourism Data","counter":327,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021030300077#WRE06900"},{"type":"question","counter":328,"qnumday":118,"qnumall":"[11169\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021030300077#WRE07000","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the number of admissions to Bunratty Folk Park in each of the years 2015 to 2019 by adult, seniors, children and members admission; the number from the USA, UK or Europe; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1520","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":329,"content":"<p>As the Deputy may be aware the operation of Bunratty Folk Park is the responsibility of Shannon Heritage which is managed by Shannon Group.

This, coupled with the need to significantly reduce normal daily capacity to comply with occupational and public health requirements, led to further delays for those wishing to take the DTT. <\/p><p>The RSA, together with its service provider, have put plans in place to significantly increase capacity within the service when it is allowed to re-open. To cope with the initial four-month suspension, the service increased capacity from an average pre Covid-19 capacity of 15,000 to over 25,000 monthly. A plan is being progressed to increase this capacity up to 50,000 per month when service resumes, to manage the backlog of customers and shorten waiting times. <\/p><p>In addition to the increased capacity initiative, and at the request of the Department, the RSA is also working on a plan to roll out an online driver theory test service. This has been trialled on a pilot basis for those taking a theory test for trucks and buses during the months of December and January. The pilot is now being evaluated and the RSA is committed to extending the service for all theory test customers during 2021. There will be a limit on the number of customers that can avail of the service during the initial roll out phase but the objective is that it should be an option for all theory test customers during later phases of the roll out, in line with enhancing access to public services.However, scaling up operations to facilitate higher numbers will take time to achieve.<\/p><p>As you can appreciate, the first priority has to be public safety &ndash; we want to provide services, and we know that people are looking for services, but services can only be provided to the limit possible while preserving public health.<\/p><p>The extension of Level 5 restrictions will impact on how quickly the backlog plan can be delivered and the position  will be reviewed again when Level 5 is lifted  <b>.<\/b><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021030300078#WRF06500","answer":true,"speaker":"1578"},{"type":"question","counter":404,"qnumday":143,"qnumall":"[11622\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021030300078#WRF06700","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the reason a person (details supplied) cannot finish their driving lessons.","asker":"1557","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":405,"content":"<p>Announcements made by An Taoiseach on the 23rd of February confirmed that level 5 restrictions are set to continue until the 5th of April, at which point the situation will be reviewed.<\/p>  <p>  As before, Approved Driving Instructors (ADIs) may continue to provide lessons under these restrictions, but only in such circumstances where the learner in question has already been scheduled a test date.<\/p>  <p>  While I very much regret the difficulty this poses to learners who had previously commenced, but not yet completed, the 12 mandatory lessons required to book a test, I must remind the Deputy that this decision has been taken in line with official public health recommendations that everyone in Ireland work to limit the spread of the virus by staying at home in so far as is possible.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021030300078#WRF06800","answer":true,"speaker":"1578"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Pension Provisions","counter":406,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021030300078#WRF06900"},{"type":"question","counter":407,"qnumday":144,"qnumall":"[11672\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021030300078#WRF07000","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the status of the CI&Eacute;

This has been further exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic as households continue to stay at home and save and businesses defer investment decisions. This excess liquidity which has grown significantly in the European system has to go somewhere and in large part it gets placed back on deposit with the ECB who charge the banks -0.50%. The application of negative deposit rates by the ECB has resulted in European banks incurring a consequent cost on deposit accounts.

The banks across Europe have looked to pass some of the costs associated with negative rates to deposit holders with larger balances.

In relation to the particular issue of new mortgage lending, the main retail banks previously confirmed that they are considering mortgage applications and mortgage drawdowns in relation to their customers who were impacted by COVID-19 on a case by case basis and that they are taking a fair and balanced approach.  Lenders continue to process mortgage applications and have supports in place to assist customers impacted by COVID-19. Therefore, if mortgage applicants have any queries or concerns about the impact of COVID-19 on their mortgage application or mortgage approval-in-principle they should in the first instance contact their lender directly on the matter.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding the particular issue of extending the period of a mortgage approval in principle, the Central Bank has advised that there are no specific regulatory requirements relating to the duration of an approval in principle. That is a commercial and business matter for individual lenders.  However, the Central Bank advises that when a lender offers a mortgage to a consumer, the Consumer Protection Code provides that the lender must include the length of time for which the mortgage offer is valid in the offer document.<\/p>  <p>  More generally there are certain consumer protection requirements which govern the provision of mortgage credit to consumers.  For example, the European Union (Consumer Mortgage Credit Agreements) Regulations 2016 (CMCAR) provide that, before concluding a mortgage credit agreement, a lender must make a thorough assessment of the consumer&rsquo;s creditworthiness with a view to verifying the prospect of the consumer being able to meet his or her obligations under the credit agreement.  The CMCAR further provide that a lender should only make credit available to a consumer where the result of the creditworthiness assessment indicates that the consumer&rsquo;s obligations resulting from the credit agreement are likely to be met in the manner required under that agreement.  The assessment of creditworthiness must be carried out on the basis of information on the consumer&rsquo;s income and expenses and other financial and economic circumstances which are necessary, sufficient and proportionate. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code 2012 imposes &lsquo;Knowing the Consumer and Suitability&rsquo; requirements on lenders.  Under these requirements, lenders are required to assess affordability of credit and the suitability of a product or service based on the individual circumstances of each borrower. The Code specifies that the affordability assessment must include consideration of the information gathered on the borrower&rsquo;s personal circumstances and financial situation.  Furthermore, where a lender refuses a mortgage application, the CMCAR requires that the lender must inform the consumer without delay of the refusal. In addition, the Code requires that the lender must clearly outline to the consumer the reasons why the credit was not approved, and provide these reasons on paper if requested.<\/p>  <p>  If a mortgage applicant is not satisfied with how a regulated entity is dealing with them, or they believe that the regulated entity is not following the requirements of the Central Bank&rsquo;s codes and regulations or other financial services law, they should make a complaint directly to the regulated entity. If they are still not satisfied with the response from the regulated entity, the response to their complaint from the regulated entity is required to include details for the borrower on how to refer their complaint to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021030300080#WRH01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Value Added Tax","counter":506,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021030300080#WRH01400"},{"type":"question","counter":507,"qnumday":182,"qnumall":"[11033\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021030300080#WRH01500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the status of a VAT registration application made by a company (details supplied); when he expects the VAT number will be issued to the company; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Details of CRSS are set out in Finance Act 2020 and detailed operational guidelines, which are based on the terms and conditions of the scheme as set out in the legislation, have been published on the Revenue website at: .<\/p><p>To qualify under the scheme, a business must carry on a trade or trading activities, the profits from which are chargeable to tax under Case I of Schedule D. The trade must be carried on from a business premises that is located in a region subject to restrictions introduced in line with the Government&rsquo;s &lsquo;Living with Covid-19 Plan&rsquo;, with the result that the business is required to prohibit or considerably restrict customers from accessing its business premises.<\/p><p>To make a claim under the CRSS, a business must be able to demonstrate that, because of the Covid restrictions, the turnover of the business in the period for which the restrictions are in operation, and for which a claim is made, will be no more than 25% of an amount equal to the average weekly turnover of the business in 2019 (or average weekly turnover in 2020 in the case of a new business) multiplied by the number of weeks in the period for which a claim is made.<\/p><p>A qualifying business may make a claim to Revenue under the CRSS for a cash payment known as an &ldquo;Advance Credit for Trading Expenses&rdquo;. This payment will be equal to 10% of the average weekly turnover of the business in 2019 (or in 2020 in the case of a new business) up to &euro;20,000 and 5% thereafter, subject to a maximum weekly payment of &euro;5,000, for each week that the business is affected by the Covid restrictions.<\/p><p>As of 25 February 2021, 20,500 businesses have registered 23,800 premises for CRSS with Revenue. 89,000 claims for CRSS payments of &euro;328.8 million in respect of 22,200 premises have been made and &euro;326.9 million of this has been processed for payment.<\/p><p>I have no plans to remove the &euro;5,000 maximum weekly payment which ensures that support is targeted at smaller SMEs.<\/p><p>The objective of the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) is to support all employment and maintain the link between the employer and employee insofar as is possible. The EWSS has been a key component of the Government&rsquo;s response to the continued Covid-19 crisis to support viable firms and encourage employment in the midst of these very challenging times. To date, subsidy payments of over &euro;2.1 billion have been made and PRSI relief worth over &euro;360m granted to over 47,200 employers in respect of over 532,000 employees.<\/p><p>I have been clear that there will be no cliff-edge to supports and, as Deputies will be aware from announcements made on Tuesday 23 February, it has been decided that both the EWSS and the CRSS are now to be extended until the end of June 2021.<\/p><p>With the agreement by Government on the revised plan, COVID-19 Resilience and Recovery 2021: The Path Ahead, a cautious and measured approach will be taken as we lay the foundations for the full recovery of social life, public services and the economy. It is, therefore, appropriate that key business supports should remain in place until the end of the second quarter of 2021.<\/p><p>As the revised plan is implemented, the EWSS will play an important role in getting people back to work as public health restrictions are eased, thereby reducing the numbers dependent on social welfare payments over time, including the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP).<\/p><p>Consideration is being given to the fact that continued support could be necessary out to the end of 2021 to help maintain viable businesses and employment and to provide businesses with certainty to the maximum extent possible.

The measures included flexible loan repayment arrangements where needed, including loan payment breaks initially for a period up to three months and then subsequently extended for up to six months. The implementation of this voluntary moratorium by the banking industry was a flexible response to the emerging Covid-19 crisis and ensured that a large volume of affected customers could benefit quickly during a fast moving and evolving public health crisis.<\/p><p>The Deputy may wish to note that borrowers whose payment break has ended are been given an option to return to full repayments based on the same term of the loan or to extend the term of the loan or to engage further with their bank on suitable arrangements. The BPFI reported, that as of 31 December 2021, approximately 49% of SMEs returned to repaying on the existing term whilst 46% returned to repaying on extended term basis and just over 5% returned on reduced repayments.<\/p><p>The Central Bank has confirmed that there is no regulatory impediment to lenders offering payment breaks to borrowers, providing they are appropriate for the individual borrower circumstance. The BPFI has also reiterated that standard payment breaks continue to be part of the wide range of tailored solutions which are being made available to customers upon assessment of their situation.<\/p><p>SME borrowers have regulatory protections via the Central Bank's SME lending regulations. The SME Regulations set out the required treatment of SMEs by regulated entities in relation to various aspects of business lending. This includes detailed provisions around the credit application process, requirements regarding security or collateral, credit refusals and withdrawals, handling complaints, managing arrears and having in place policies for engaging with SMEs in financial difficulty. The options could include additional flexibility, and this could be a short-term arrangement such as additional periods without payments or interest-only repayments, or if appropriate more long term arrangements. The Central Bank recently wrote to all lenders indicating that lenders are to ensure that they have sufficient expert resources to assess individual borrower circumstances, and to offer appropriate and sustainable solutions to affected borrowers in a timely manner in line with regulatory requirements.

This scheme ended on 31 August 2020 and was replaced by the Employer Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) from 1 September 2020.<\/p><p>The transitional phase of TWSS operated until 3 May 2020 and provided a subsidy of 70% of the average net weekly pay up to a maximum of &euro;410 in respect of eligible employees. The operational phase of the scheme was introduced from 4 May 2020 and included increased subsidy rates up to 85%, to a maximum subsidy payment of &euro;410. The operational phase also included a tapering mechanism that ensured the subsidy amount plus any additional payment by the employer did not exceed the employee&rsquo;s &lsquo;normal&rsquo; average weekly wage (ARNWP). The ARNWP for each employee was based on the average wages received over the months of January and February 2020.<\/p><p>Under the TWSS, employers were expected to make best efforts to maintain employees&rsquo; net incomes for the duration of the scheme. However, there was no requirement in the scheme for employers to pay an additional gross (top-up) payments. That said, participation in the scheme does not affect an employee&rsquo;s rights and entitlements.<\/p><p>TWSS payments are treated similarly to normal pay for taxation purposes and as such are subject to income tax and the Universal Social Charge (USC). However, the TWSS along with the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) were not taxed in the normal real-time manner in 2020 and were instead taxed at year end. This arrangement was put in place to ensure payments were available to employees through the scheme as quickly as possible given the urgency and suddenness of the pandemic.<\/p><p>On 15 January 2021, Revenue made a <i>Preliminary End of Year Statement <\/i>for 2020 available through its online myAccount facility to all PAYE taxpayers, including those who received TWSS and PUP payments. The statement provides employees with a preliminary calculation of the amount of tax and USC paid for 2020 and indicates whether the year is balanced, overpaid or underpaid, before any additional credits such as health expenses are claimed.<\/p><p>Revenue has advised me that the spouse of the person in question received TWSS payments for the months of March, April and May 2020. The spouse&rsquo;s employer also &lsquo;topped up&rsquo; her earnings by varying amounts during that period. The &lsquo;topped up&rsquo; amounts were taxed in real-time while the TWSS payments were taxed at year-end. The person&rsquo;s spouse also received a small amount in tax and USC refunds through her pay during this period, arising from unused tax credits, as well as payments from the Department of Social Protection during the year, which were untaxed at that point.<\/p><p>The person&rsquo;s <i>Preliminary End of Year Statement<\/i>shows a liability of &euro;858.67 for 2020. The underpayment is made up of &euro;716.86 in income tax and &euro;141.81 in USC and for the most part arises because the TWSS payments received by his spouse were not taxed until year end. This liability cannot be finalised until the person completes his 2020 Income Tax return and may be reduced if the couple have additional tax credits to claim. If there is still an outstanding liability after any additional tax credits are allocated, the amount due can be collected, interest free, over four years from 1 January 2022 by reducing their tax credits, thereby minimising any financial hardship to the greatest extent possible.<\/p><p>It is important to understand that the amount of tax and USC due by any employee is based on the gross income received during 2020, comprising of, TWSS, any top-up payment made by the employer, and any PUP payments received. The level of top-up wages (if any) paid by the employer to the employee in addition to the TWSS is a matter between both parties. Revenue&rsquo;s role is to ensure the correct amount of subsidy is paid to the employer and subsequently passed on to the employee and that the correct amount of tax\/USC is deducted from the employee based on the total gross earnings received.<\/p><p>Revenue has confirmed that some employers have agreed to pay, on behalf of its employees, underpayments of tax and USC for 2020 that have arisen due to the non-taxation in real-time of TWSS payments.

While Ireland is broadly in favour of tax transparency, we have opposed this proposal as the legal base is not in keeping with the Treaties and that as it relates to tax, it should be the responsibility of Finance Ministers to negotiate in the ECOFIN Council formation rather than at COMPET Council. Proposals on taxation at EU level, should be progressed on the correct legal basis to ensure that laws are legally robust and secure against any future challenges so that shared objectives for transparency and good governance are comprehensively realised.  The principled position Ireland is taking is shared by a number of other Member States and indeed the Council Legal Service. Further, it is relevant that the Oireachtas adopted a Reasoned Opinion in June 2016 to the effect that this proposed Directive is a tax matter and does not meet the principle of subsidiarity.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland has long been a supporter of, and a beneficiary of tax transparency. Ireland has continuously implemented the necessary measures to ensure we are up to date with international best practice on tax transparency and exchange of information negotiated at the OECD, as well as supporting the parallel EU efforts through agreement of the Directive on Administrative Cooperation in the field of taxation. This covers administrative cooperation between EU Member States on tax matters, and automatic exchange of tax rulings, financial account data as well as mandatory disclosure of cross-border tax arrangements.  It should be noted that of the 78 jurisdictions reviewed to date by the Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes, Ireland is one of only a small number of jurisdictions to have been found to be fully compliant with new international best practice. <\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding Ireland's views and those of other EU Member States and the Council Legal Service on the legal basis, this Proposal now has the necessary support to proceed from COMPET Council.

In relation to the particular issue of new mortgage lending, the main retail banks previously confirmed that they are considering mortgage applications and mortgage drawdowns in relation to their customers who were impacted by COVID-19 on a case by case basis and that they are taking a fair and balanced approach.  Lenders continue to process mortgage applications and have supports in place to assist customers impacted by COVID-19. Therefore, if mortgage applicants have any queries or concerns about the impact of COVID-19 on their mortgage application or a mortgage 'approval-in-principle' they should in the first instance contact their lender directly on the matter.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding the particular issue of extending the period of a mortgage 'approval in principle', the Central Bank has advised that there are no specific regulatory requirements relating to the duration of an 'approval in principle'. That is a commercial and business matter for individual lenders.  However, the Central Bank advises that when a lender offers a mortgage to a consumer, the Consumer Protection Code provides that the lender must include the length of time for which the mortgage offer is valid in the offer document.<\/p>  <p>  More generally there are certain consumer protection requirements which govern the provision of mortgage credit to consumers.  For example, the European Union (Consumer Mortgage Credit Agreements) Regulations 2016 (CMCAR) provide that, before concluding a mortgage credit agreement, a lender must make a thorough assessment of the consumer&rsquo;s creditworthiness with a view to verifying the prospect of the consumer being able to meet his or her obligations under the credit agreement.  The CMCAR further provide that a lender should only make credit available to a consumer where the result of the creditworthiness assessment indicates that the consumer&rsquo;s obligations resulting from the credit agreement are likely to be met in the manner required under that agreement.  The assessment of creditworthiness must be carried out on the basis of information on the consumer&rsquo;s income and expenses and other financial and economic circumstances which are necessary, sufficient and proportionate. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code 2012 imposes &lsquo;Knowing the Consumer and Suitability&rsquo; requirements on lenders.  Under these requirements, lenders are required to assess affordability of credit and the suitability of a product or service based on the individual circumstances of each borrower. The Code specifies that the affordability assessment must include consideration of the information gathered on the borrower&rsquo;s personal circumstances and financial situation.  Furthermore, where a lender refuses a mortgage application, the CMCAR requires that the lender must inform the consumer without delay of the refusal. In addition, the Code requires that the lender must clearly outline to the consumer the reasons why the credit was not approved, and provide these reasons on paper if requested.<\/p>  <p>  If a mortgage applicant is not satisfied with how a regulated entity is dealing with them, or they believe that the regulated entity is not following the requirements of the Central Bank&rsquo;s codes and regulations or other financial services law, they should make a complaint directly to the regulated entity. If they are still not satisfied with the response from the regulated entity, the response to their complaint from the regulated entity is required to include details for the borrower on how to refer their complaint to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021030300081#WRJ01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Horse and Greyhound Fund","counter":581,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021030300081#WRJ01100"},{"type":"question","counter":582,"qnumday":209,"qnumall":"[11739\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021030300081#WRJ01200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if the minimum allocation to the Horse and Greyhound Fund is bound by the wording of Part 3 section 12(4) of the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act 2001, which specifies an amount equivalent to the revenue from excise duty on off-course betting paid into the Exchequer in the preceding year or the year 2000 increased by reference to the consumer price index, whichever is the greater; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1486","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":583,"content":"<p>Under Section 12 of the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act, 2001, the horse and greyhound racing industries receive financial support from the State through the Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund (the Fund).

PUP payments are classified in legislation as income supports and are subject to income tax. The taxation arrangements for the PUP were legislated for in Finance Act 2020 which reflects the standard approach to taxation of social welfare type payments, which means they are liable to income tax but exempt from the Universal Social Charge (USC) and Pay Related Social Insurance (PRSI). <\/p>  <p>  The mechanism to tax the PUP, in common with other Department of Social Protection (DSP) payments, including Jobseekers&rsquo; Benefit and Illness Benefit, is by reducing the recipient&rsquo;s tax credits and rate bands. However, in 2020 the PUP was not taxed in &lsquo;real-time&rsquo; in the normal manner, meaning the collection of any tax due was deferred until year end. Likewise, employees that received subsidies under the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS), which ran from 26 March 2020 to 31 August 2020, were not taxed in &lsquo;real-time&rsquo; on those payments. Instead the collection of tax and Universal Social Charge (USC) was deferred until the end of 2020. <\/p>  <p>  Revenue advise me that this approach to the taxation of both schemes was based on an expectation at the time that the emergency supports would be short-term in nature, which turned out not to be the case due to the continued prevalence of COVID-19. Revenue has also advised me that the continuation of the PUP into 2021 and the operation of the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS), which replaced the TWSS from 1 September 2020 have re-established the practice of operating PAYE in the normal (real-time) manner for such payments. As such the &lsquo;year-end&rsquo; taxing arrangement that applied to both the PUP and TWSS in 2020 is no longer applicable in 2021. <\/p>  <p>  Finally, it is important to note that Revenue acts independently in the administration of the tax system.

This is a temporary measure to provide support to the sector, where many businesses remain closed for now and those that are open are operating at significantly reduced capacity, and will apply from 1 November 2020 to 31 December 2021. <\/p>  <p>  The Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) continues to be a key component of the Government&rsquo;s response to the COVID-19 crisis to support viable firms and encourage employment in the hospitality and tourism sector and beyond.

The measures included flexible loan repayment arrangements where needed, including loan payment breaks initially for a period up to three months and then subsequently extended for up to six months. The implementation of this voluntary moratorium by the banking industry was a flexible response to the emerging Covid-19 crisis and ensured that a large volume of affected customers could benefit quickly during a fast moving and evolving public health crisis.<\/p><p>The Deputy may wish to note that borrowers whose payment break has ended are been given an option to return to full repayments based on the same term of the loan or to extend the term of the loan or to engage further with their bank on suitable arrangements. The BPFI reported, that as of 31 December 2021, approximately 49% of SMEs returned to repaying on the existing term whilst 46% returned to repaying on extended term basis and just over 5% returned on reduced repayments.<\/p><p>As Minister for Finance I have no function in the commercial decisions made by banks. However, the Central Bank has confirmed that there is no regulatory impediment to lenders offering payment breaks to borrowers, providing they are appropriate for the individual borrower circumstance.  The BPFI has also reiterated that standard payment breaks continue to be part of the wide range of tailored solutions which are being made available to customers upon assessment of their situation.<\/p><p>SME borrowers have regulatory protections via the Central Bank's SME lending regulations. The SME Regulations  set out the required treatment of SMEs by regulated entities in relation to various aspects of business lending. This includes detailed provisions around the credit application process, requirements regarding security or collateral, credit refusals and withdrawals, handling complaints, managing arrears and having in place policies for engaging with SMEs in financial difficulty. The options could include additional flexibility, and this could be a short-term arrangement such as additional periods without payments or interest-only repayments, or if appropriate more long term arrangements. The Central Bank recently wrote to all lenders indicating that lenders are to ensure that they have sufficient expert resources to assess individual borrower circumstances, and to offer appropriate and sustainable solutions to affected borrowers in a timely manner in line with regulatory requirements. The Central Bank&rsquo;s clear expectation is that lenders engage effectively and sympathetically with distressed borrowers.<\/p><p>In addition, Credit Review  was established to assist those SMEs and farm borrowers that have had credit applications of up to &euro;3 million refused or indeed an existing credit facility withdrawn or amended by the participating bank. SMEs can apply to Credit Review after exhausting the internal appeals process in the participating institution, which are currently AIB, BOI, Ulster Bank and Permanent TSB.<\/p><p>It should be noted that the Central Credit Register does not produce credit scores; rather the information on a credit report provided by the Central Credit Register is factual in nature and the information is provided to the Central Credit Register by lenders.

An increase in the supply of new housing remains a priority aim of Government policy. <\/p>  <p>  The scheme is designed to stimulate the supply of new houses in the housing market and to assist first-time buyers in accumulating a deposit for a new home.  In order to further help meet these goals, I announced an enhancement to the existing scheme with effect from 23 July last for the remainder of 2020 as part of the July Stimulus Package. The legislation that gives effect to this is set out in the Financial Provisions (Covid-19) (No.2) Act 2020. The Finance Act 2020 further extended the period of application of the enhanced levels of support until 31 December 2021.  <\/p>  <p>  As regards the negative impact of Covid-19 related restrictions on employment and the ability to qualify for HTB, the Deputy may wish to be aware that Revenue have advised as follows.  Where an underpayment of tax arises for the year 2020 as a result of amounts received under the TWSS or PUP, Revenue will allow a claim for HTB relief for the amount of income tax paid for 2020 and will not require the outstanding tax liability to be paid in advance where the underpayment of tax is due to be collected from 2022 by reducing the claimant&rsquo;s tax credits.

This excess liquidity which has grown significantly in the European system has to go somewhere and in large part it gets placed back on deposit with the ECB who charge the banks -0.50%. The application of negative deposit rates by the ECB has resulted in European banks incurring a consequent cost on deposit accounts.

However it should be noted that the details supplied refer to a matter occurring prior to 2015 and the Deputy will be aware that the film relief has been completely restructured since that time. Prior to 2015 the scheme provided tax relief to individuals investing in the film industry.  In Finance Act 2015 the relief was restructured to a corporation tax credit which now provides direct support to film producer companies.  The details supplied therefore relate to a time when the tax relief was claimed by investors, rather than the film production companies.<\/p>  <p>  I am aware that there have been reports of industrial relations concerns in the industry and the Deputy will be aware that I have taken steps in recent Finance Acts to address these issues. Finance Act 2018 amended the section 481 certification process to provide that the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, after considering an application and applying a set of tests, may issue a Cultural certificate to a producer company stating that a film is qualifying film for the purpose of the credit.  One of these tests relates to employment on the qualifying film. The application includes an &ldquo;Undertaking in respect of quality employment&rdquo; concerning employment practices on the film being certified and any adverse decisions of the Workplace Relations Commission against the company or companies within the film group.<\/p>  <p>  The Film Regulations provide for the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media to set conditions relating to employment when issuing a certificate for a qualifying film. Regulation 4 details that these conditions are to be met not just by a producer company but also by the qualifying company (a designated activity company wholly owned by the producer company which exists solely for the purpose of making the one qualifying film). <\/p>  <p>  Where a producer company or qualifying company fails to satisfy or comply with a condition or obligation specified in a certificate, any credit claimed subsequent to that certificate may be an unauthorised amount and may be subject to recoupment by Revenue.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to any clawback of the film credit, I would note that the Revenue Commissioners are independent in their administration of the tax system. However I am advised that Revenue carries out a comprehensive programme of compliance operations each year across a broad range of economic sectors, including the film industry. Many of the operations are carried out on a multi-agency basis, which can include officials from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection (DEASP) and the Workplace Relations Commission. The primary role of these joint investigation units, JIUs, is to detect non-compliance with tax and duty obligations, which includes non-operation of the PAYE system on foot of bogus self-employment. <\/p>  <p>  Additionally, I am informed by Revenue that it monitors developments in labour market trends in conjunction with the DEASP. As part of that ongoing work, Revenue are assisting DEASP in developing a new Code for Determining Employment or Self-employment which is expected to be finalised early in 2021. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021030300081#WRJ07500","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Broadband Plan","counter":644,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021030300081#WRJ07600"},{"type":"question","counter":645,"qnumday":232,"qnumall":"[12119\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021030300081#WRJ07700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he has engaged with National Broadband Ireland on any aspect of broadband provision in the past six months; and the outcome of any engagement.","asker":"1514","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":646,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the Deputy that I have not engaged with National Broadband Ireland on any aspect of broadband provision in the past six months.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021030300081#WRJ07800","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":647,"content":"<p>Question No. 233 answered with Question No. 216.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":649,"content":"<p>Question No. 234 answered with Question No. 198.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","counter":651,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021030300082#WRK00400"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mortgage Lending","counter":650,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021030300082#WRK00300"},{"type":"question","counter":651,"qnumday":235,"qnumall":"[11015\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021030300082#WRK00400","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"when additional sections of the construction industry will reopen in view of the fact that many mortgage approvals will be due to expire in the coming weeks and mortgage providers seem to be unable or unwilling to extend approval periods.","asker":"1596","askee":"1459"},{"type":"speech","counter":652,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware, the revised plan for the Government&rsquo;s response to COVID-19 &ndash; &quot;COVID-19 Resilience and Recovery 2021: The Path Ahead&quot; &ndash; sets out our approach to the next phase and our path forward.

The approach to be taken with the transposition will examine not only what changes to the 2014 Act are needed to meet the requirements of the Directive but will also take into consideration the findings of the statutory review where relevant.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021030300082#WRK01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1459"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Procurement Contracts","counter":659,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021030300082#WRK01200"},{"type":"question","counter":660,"qnumday":238,"qnumall":"[11382\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021030300082#WRK01300","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the details of contracts of &euro;25,000 or more that have been awarded by his Department or bodies under his aegis that were found to be non-compliant with procurement guidelines in 2018, 2019, 2020 and to date in 2021; the value and nature of the contact work carried out in each case; the year of each contract in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1579","askee":"1459"},{"type":"speech","counter":661,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the Deputy that the procurement processes for all contracts in my Department were carried out in accordance with the Office of Government Procurement&rsquo;s (OGP) Public Procurement Guidelines for Goods and Services which aim to promote an open, competitive and non-discriminatory public procurement regime which delivers the best value for money.<\/p><p>The following table sets out the procurement processes valued over &euro;25,000 (excluding VAT) that were undertaken from 2018 to date by my Department under the terms of Article 32 of the Public Sector Procurement Directive (2004\/18\/EC).

In addition there was &euro;5.4 billion held back in Contingency Funds to be made available for further measures to address the challenges of Covid-19, bringing the overall expenditure ceiling for the year to &euro;87.8 billion. Within the overall allocated amount of &euro;6&frac12; billion, as set out in Expenditure Report 2021, there was &euro;3.2 billion allocated to the Department of Social Protection for additional expenditure on employment and income supports arising from Covid-19. This includes &euro;1.2 billion in respect of the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) and &euro;0.6 billion for the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP).<\/p>  <p>  Included in the expenditure figures in the recently published Fiscal Monitor is just under &euro;0.8 billion in expenditure incurred by the Department of Social Protection on the EWSS, which is broadly in line with profile at the end of February. Further to this nearly &euro;1.1 billion has been spent on the PUP to the end of February reflecting the impact of Level 5 restrictions. This leaves expenditure on the PUP &euro;0.7 billion ahead of profile at the end of February.  However, taking into account underspends on other schemes, overall gross voted expenditure for the Department of Social Protection is just over &euro;0.4 billion ahead of profile at the end of February.<\/p>  <p>   Given that the aggregate expenditure of &euro;1.9 billion to date this year on the EWSS and PUP is above the aggregate allocation of &euro;1.8 billion for both schemes, as we move forward through March and quarter 2, additional expenditure would be fall to be met by reallocating from the Contingency Funds.<\/p>  <p>  In this current week, payments of &euro;140 million are being made by the Department of Social Protection to 468,847 people in receipt of the PUP. If this was maintained through March, overall expenditure on the PUP would be approximately &euro;1.8 billion, which would leave expenditure on this scheme c. &euro;1.2 billion ahead of profile.<\/p>  <p>  The extent of the demand on these funds in quarter 2 will depend on the situation with the virus and the restrictions in place. Based on current restrictions, there is aggregate expenditure of over &euro;0.2 billion per week on the PUP and EWSS. In addition to utilising the Contingency Funds, as the assumptions underpinning the REV allocations saw recipients transferring from the PUP to jobseekers payments, it can be expected that relative to the REV allocations there will be some underspends on jobseekers payments that will partially offset the additional expenditure on the PUP.<\/p>  <p>  This additional expenditure on the EWSS and PUP would place a significant demand on the Contingency Funds. However, with the vaccine rollout underway, the significant measures in place for households and for businesses should support the commencement of a recovery in the Irish economy as restrictions are eased. The question of the need for the allocation of additional funding over and above the amount set aside in the Contingency Funds would be considered taking into account the overall spending and fiscal position at that time and the Government's commitment to support the recovery in employment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021030300082#WRK02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1459"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Sector Staff","counter":673,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021030300082#WRK02800"},{"type":"question","counter":674,"qnumday":244,"qnumall":"[11673\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021030300082#WRK02900","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if there are limits on the amount of sick leave a public servant can take; the provisions available to a person who is suffering repeated bouts of illness; and whether annual leave entitlement can be affected.","asker":"1549","askee":"1459"},{"type":"speech","counter":675,"content":"<p>The arrangements for paid sick leave in the Public Service are set out in the Public Service Sick Leave Regulationsand the administration of the Scheme is managed on a sectoral level by each public service employer. <\/p><p>The access to paid sick leave as provided for in the Scheme is as follows.<\/p><p><b>Ordinary Sick Leave<\/b><\/p><p>Under the Scheme, public servants have access to the following paid sick leave:<\/p><p>- a maximum of 92 days (3 months) on full pay in a rolling one year period;<\/p><p>- followed by a maximum of 91 days (3 months) on half pay;<\/p><p>- subject to a maximum of 183 days (6 months) paid sick leave in a rolling four year period.<\/p><p><b>Critical Illness Protocol (CIP)<\/b><\/p><p>In order to provide support to public servants who suffer from a critical illness or injury, the Scheme provides for up to 365 days paid sick leave in a four-year period (comprising 183 days on full pay in a rolling one-year period, followed by 182 days on half pay).<\/p><p><b>Temporary Rehabilitation Remuneration (TRR)<\/b><\/p><p>In addition, public servants may be awarded Temporary Rehabilitation Remuneration (TRR).<\/p><p>If the required eligibility criteria are met for the payment of TRR, as set out below, the maximum period payable is 547 days in the case of ordinary illness.

The Government's clear message at the present time is for people to stay in their homes, unless necessary for those essential reasons set out in the public health regulations.<\/p><p>I understand the difficulties these restrictions pose for couples on their special day and the impact on musicians and bands.  However, COVID-19 is a highly infectious disease, which spreads when individuals and groups come into close contact with one another, enabling the virus to move from one person to another.  In certain settings, such as weddings, higher noise levels due to music, can force people into close proximity, requiring them to raise their voices or shout to communicate thus increasing the risk of spreading virus to others.  Dancing is also problematic given the close contact involved.  Such activities present a higher risk of transmission of COVID-19.  Accordingly the Government has decided that no live or loud music is permitted at weddings and this is reflected in the relevant tourism sectoral guidelines published on the F&aacute;ilte Ireland website. <\/p><p>Last week, the Government published the <i>COVID-19 Resilience and Recovery Plan 2021 &ndash; The Path Ahead<\/i>and agreed that the public health restrictions will be subject to ongoing review taking account of the evolving epidemiological situation and available evidence in relation to vaccine deployment, uptake and effectiveness. The public health advice is that it is too early to say how and when restrictions should be eased given current uncertainties. Government will meet in advance of the 5th of April to review the level of restrictions. The focus of the assessment, based on the public health advice, will be on achieving the following before any significant easing of measures is contemplated:<\/p><p>1.  Disease prevalence (case numbers\/incidence) is brought to much lower levels that can be managed and controlled by public health and that the reproduction number (&ldquo;R&rdquo; number) is such that we can be confident that we can continue to suppress the disease e.g. at or below 1.<\/p><p>2.  Hospital and critical care occupancy are reduced to low levels to protect the health service and allow for the safe resumption of non-COVID-19 care.<\/p><p>3.  Ongoing and steady progress on the vaccination programme such that the most vulnerable are protected through vaccination.<\/p><p>4.  Emerging information on variants of concern.<\/p><p>Any easing of measures should be slow and gradual with sufficient time between phases to assess impact and to respond if the epidemiological situation was to deteriorate. It will take account of emerging international and national evidence and experience and with a specific focus on supporting mental health and wellbeing.<\/p><p>In regard to the levels at which the activity in question will be permitted, Public Health advice is that the Framework for Restrictive Measures continues to provide an appropriate mechanism to guide decision-making.  As set out in <i>The Path Ahead, <\/i>this will continue to be applied in a flexible manner, adapting measures to address the public health risk at a given time in addition to any specific contextual considerations.<\/p><p>Officials in my Department have also recently met with the Wedding Bands Association, as partof the ongoing engagement with the live performance sector.

These measures have been put in place to protect us all, however I remain acutely aware of the continuing challenge that these restrictions present to the sectors supported by my Department.<\/p><p>The COVID-19 pandemic has utterly changed the operating landscape for the Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media.  These sectors are the hardest hit by every escalation in the level of restrictions applicable under the Living with COVID-19 Plan and are essentially closed between levels 3 and 5. This has been the situation for these sectors for the majority of 2020 and appears set to continue for some months.<\/p><p>As we set out in the <i>Path Ahead <\/i>launched last week, we will continue to review the situation based on up to date information on the roll-out of the vaccination programme, information on new variants, levels of virus transmission, and the situation in our health sector.  Given the ongoing and evolving nature of this situation, it is not possible to say definitively what the total impact of COVID-19 will have on these sectors.<\/p><p>That said, I have been actively working with and for the sectors within my remit to ensure that they are supported during the pandemic.  Throughout these challenging times I and my officials have kept in contact with a broad range of stakeholders and I have established a number of groups and taskforces to ensure that I have the most up to date information about the difficulties facing these sectors. These include:<\/p><p>- The Tourism Recovery Taskforce;<\/p><p>- The Hospitality and Tourism Forum;<\/p><p>- The Arts and Culture Recovery Taskforce;<\/p><p>- The Sports Monitoring Group.<\/p><p>In addition to these groups I have established the Night-time Economy Taskforce and the Future of Media Commission, both of which are looking at longer term polices in respect of night time culture and media respectively.<\/p><p>In response to the information I have been given, I have put in place a number of substantial measures to support and strengthen the sectors through 2021.  These include:<\/p><p>- A new &euro;55m support fund for strategic tourism businesses;<\/p><p>- VAT on the sector reduced to 9%, will improve competitiveness and viability of businesses;<\/p><p>- New &euro;50m support for live entertainment - a range of supports for live entertainment events to take place in 2021 in venues across the country, other measures to support music, and a new grant scheme for equipment;<\/p><p>- &euro;130m for the Arts Council &ndash; a record level;<\/p><p>- Over &euro;78m funding allocation for Gaeltacht and Irish language sector &ndash; up &euro;14.8m on initial 2020 allocation;<\/p><p>- Funding for TG4 up to &euro;40.733m;<\/p><p>- Sport Ireland allocated &euro;104.5m &ndash; up &euro;36m.<\/p><p>I have also worked with my colleagues across Government to ensure the availability of horizontal supports that are critical to the survival of many in our sectors.  These include the universal income supports of PUP and the wage subsidy scheme which continue to be key to supporting to all sectors thorough this crisis.  I am pleased to note that the extension of both of these schemes until June 2021 has provided some much needed certainty around income support. Additionally, Government is providing a range of enterprise supports such as the CRSS (Covid Restrictions Support Scheme), the CBAS (Covid Business Aid Scheme), commercial rates waivers etc., which many businesses in the sectors my Department supports can avail of.<\/p><p>I am resolved to continue to work with stakeholders across my sectors to monitor the evolving situation and to work with my Government colleagues to support these sectors not just during this pandemic, but into the all important recovery phase which will follow it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021030300084#WRM00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1471"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tourism Promotion","counter":814,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021030300084#WRM01000"},{"type":"question","counter":815,"qnumday":294,"qnumall":"[11853\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021030300084#WRM01100","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the degree to which she has considered a programme to encourage renewed interest in Ireland for foreign tourists as soon as it becomes possible after the Covid-19 pandemic; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1471"},{"type":"speech","counter":816,"content":"<p>Tourism is one of Ireland&rsquo;s most important industries.

The Water Services Policy Statement 2018-2025 sets out the range of policy objectives across the key thematic areas of quality, conservation and future proofing that will be pursued between now and 2025. The Policy Statement supports the promotion of water conservation and water resource management as an important element of water services policy that is to be reflected in strategic investment planning by Irish Water. For the period of the Policy Statement, this will involve the prioritisation of multifaceted programmes around leak detection and repair, network improvements, cost effective metering, public awareness campaigns and funding to the 'Find and Fix' scheme for addressing domestic customer leaks.<\/p>  <p>  The concentration on leakage reduction first and foremost will ensure the greatest return on capital investment in terms of the overall impact on conserving water supplies and reducing the overall demand for treated water. Accordingly, there are no plans at present to introduce a grant scheme along the lines suggested.<\/p>  <p>  It is worth noting that non-domestic customers of Irish Water, including community centres and sports centres, are charged by Irish Water for their use of water services based on their actual metered consumption. This is in keeping with Ireland's obligations under the Water Framework Directive. It is understood that some sports organisations may already have arrangements in place to capture and store rainwater for use for purposes (such as watering green areas) which do not require potable water. By doing so they are conserving the use of treated water and reducing their water bills. It is a matter for the property owners or trustees concerned to consider whether rainwater harvesting makes economic sense in their particular case.<\/p>  <p>  It may be helpful to note that while water sustainability systems (e.g. rain water recovery systems, grey water usage, etc.) are not mandatory, they are being used increasingly in homes and buildings, and my Department has ensured that appropriate standards are referenced under Part H &ndash; Drainage and Waste Water Disposal &ndash; of the Building Regulations and the accompanying Technical Guidance Document H 2010. My Department also publishes design guidance for local authorities - Quality Housing for Sustainable Communities &ndash; which emphasises environmental sustainability and resource efficiency.

Section 4 of the Act and Schedule 2 of the Planning and Development Regulations 2001, as amended (the Regulations), set out various exemptions from the requirement to obtain planning permission.  Any such exemptions are subject to compliance with any general restrictions on exemptions set out in the Act or the Regulations and to the specific conditions set out in each class of exempted development in Schedule 2 of the Regulations. Included in the specific exemptions set out in the Regulations are those applying to the installation of solar infrastructure on a variety of building types, including houses, businesses, industrial and agricultural.<\/p>  <p>  As part of the Climate Action Plan 2019, my Department is currently undertaking a review of the solar panel exemptions, and is actively engaging with the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications as well as other key stakeholders, with a view to finalising a proposal for draft amending Regulations to reflect, inter alia, technical developments in the sector. One of the key considerations of the review is to ensure that solar panels can be erected - subject to certain siting and size conditions - without the need to obtain planning permission, thereby facilitating more widespread generation of renewable energy for self-consumption. Also included in this review are solar panel exemptions for educational and community buildings.<\/p>  <p>  The main outstanding issue that remains to be addressed in the current review is the potential for \"glint and glare\" impacts for aircraft and the need to ensure that they do not result in any real or potential threat to aviation safety. Accordingly, my Department is presently engaging with the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications as well as the Irish Aviation Authority, in order to find a safe and workable solution in relation to this particular aspect of the review. My Department has begun the tendering process for this project, which will involve the development of aviation safeguarding maps for each airport\/aerodrome in the country, and has received feedback from potential tenderers estimating a timeline of up to 9 months for its completion. As such, these maps, which are a fundamental aspect of any amendments to the exemptions, are expected to be finalised in Q3 2021.<\/p>  <p>  In recognition of the length of time that it is expected to take to complete the aviation safeguarding maps, my Department has decided to adopt an interim measure which would allow revised regulations to be introduced prior to the completion of these maps, but with defined exclusion zones around airports and aerodromes for solar installations. My Department is consulting with the Irish Aviation Authority on this matter, and is working towards the development of draft regulations in this regard, the precise details of which have yet to be finalised.<\/p>  <p>  As required under planning legislation, any such proposed exempted development regulations must be laid in draft form before the Houses of the Oireachtas and receive a positive resolution from both Houses before they can be made. The draft regulations will also be subject to screening under the Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) Directive 2001\/42\/EC to determine whether they are likely to have significant environmental effects. If there are significant effects, the undertaking of an SEA will be required, which will include public consultation.<\/p>  <p>  The process for finalising the interim solar panel planning exemptions as referred to above, with exclusion zones around airports and aerodromes, is now expected to be completed by the end of Q1 2021, with the interim regulations expected to be submitted to the Oireachtas in the coming weeks. These interim regulations will allow for the vast majority of the country to be covered by the solar panel exemptions apart from those areas in close proximity to airports and aerodromes.<\/p>  <p>  The overall process for updating the solar panel planning exemptions to include the completed aviation safeguarding maps for airports and aerodromes is still expected to be completed by Q4 2021.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021030300084#WRM07200","answer":true,"speaker":"1595"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Renewable Energy Generation","counter":875,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021030300085#WRN00200"},{"type":"question","counter":876,"qnumday":318,"qnumall":"[11065\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021030300085#WRN00300","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the position regarding the proposed wind turbine guidelines; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1564","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":877,"content":"<p>My Department is currently undertaking a focused review of the 2006 Wind Energy Development Guidelines in line with the &ldquo;preferred draft approach&rdquo; which was announced in June 2017 by the then Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, in conjunction with the then Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment.

All local authorities have Severe Weather\/Flood Plans in place to support the response to weather emergencies as part of their individual Major Emergency Plans. Local authorities also have a Severe Weather Assessment Team in place, monitoring Met &Eacute;ireann weather warnings and OPW and EFAS flood advisory\/ warnings and High Tide Advisories. <\/p>  <p>  My Department is designated as 'Lead Government Department', as set out in the Government approved Strategic Emergency Management (SEM) Framework (2017), in relation to coordination of  response to flooding emergencies at national level where warranted. My Department's National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management undertakes this role, and works closely with Local Authority Severe Weather Assessment Teams.<\/p>  <p>  The Covid-19 pandemic has necessitated some changes in established practices, and my Department has made necessary changes, including hosting\/ providing a direct link for situation briefing between Met &Eacute;ireann's forecasting and flood forecasting division and the local authorities in advance of any predicted severe weather event. <\/p>  <p>On the morning of February 22nd, an Orange level warning for very heavy rain was issued by Met &Eacute;ireann for counties Cork, Kerry, Tipperary, and Waterford for the period from 19:00 on February 22nd to 21:00 on February 23rd. Heavy rain in such a short period brings with it the potential for both pluvial and fluvial flooding. In advance of the event my Department liaised with potentially affected local authorities and other key stakeholders to support the coordination of necessary support for any anticipated vulnerabilities within those local authorities. While some flooding was experienced, with road closures in the South and Southwest of the country, the predicted impacts were less than had been anticipated and were further mitigated by the early intervention of local authorities, who took preventative measures to protect infrastructure, homes and businesses from flood water inundation. Generally, the costs of their response to weather events, such as that experienced by Cork, Kerry, Waterford and Tipperary on 22 and 23 February 2021, would be funded by the local authorities themselves in the first instance. <\/p>  <p>  Since 2009, it has been the established practice of this Department to assist local authorities in meeting the unbudgeted costs such as staff overtime and hire of plant and contractors, associated with the clean-up and necessary immediate works following very severe weather emergency events, including flooding. This is in recognition of the exceptional nature of activities carried out by local authorities in responding to these types of emergencies and the fact that the costs of these un-programmed activities cannot be met from within existing resources. This practice is considered a vital enabler of local authority response, providing the assurance that availability of resources is not a limiting factor in providing a very effective local response.<\/p>  <p>  As severe weather events and their impact and response are unplanned, a dedicated line of funding is not set aside annually to fund these measures. However, where a very severe event occurs, my Department request additional funding to support local authorities with the exceptional costs associated with the response to and clean-up of the event. <\/p>  <p>  In the period, 2009 to 2020, funding in excess of &euro;90 million has been made available to local authorities from this Department to support the costs associated with the response to severe weather related emergency events including flooding.<\/p>  <p>  Funding of repair of public infrastructure is undertaken by the relevant Department in line with its sectoral responsibility. Capital costs associated with infrastructural damage, for example damage to the roads network and coastal protection infrastructure (where relevant), are not included therefore under the above arrangements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021030300085#WRN06300","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Natural Heritage Areas","counter":937,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021030300085#WRN06400"},{"type":"question","counter":938,"qnumday":340,"qnumall":"[11682\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021030300085#WRN06500","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 123 of 25 February 2021, the timeframe for this designation given that it has been ongoing for quite some time; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

This was acknowledged in the Comprehensive Review of the Special Needs Assistant Scheme (SNAs) published by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) in 2018. <\/p>  <p>  The Review made a number of recommendations regarding SNAs and the need for a more broadly based set of supports including therapeutic supports for pupils with complex needs.  The Review also referenced the training needs of SNAs.  In this regard, the NCSE recommended that a new national training programme at Level 5 of the National Qualification Framework be developed for existing SNAs who do not have the requisite level of training and for new SNAs on appointment.  The NCSE also recommended that training tailored to the specific complex needs of some students being cared for by SNAs would also be provided.  <\/p>  <p>  The policy advice has been considered by the Department. It was decided that priority should be given to the development of a training programme for SNAs who may not have had a recent opportunity to access a training programme tailored to their role.  <\/p>  <p>  A public procurement competition was held for the development and delivery of a new national training programme for SNAs. A detailed specification of need and learning outcomes was developed and published for the competition. Formal accreditation to the National Qualifications Framework was not a requirement for the programme. Following evaluation of the tenders received, the contract was awarded to University College Dublin (UCD) School of Education, in conjunction with UCD School of Nursing, Midwifery and Health Systems.  <\/p>  <p>  UCD has a strong reputation in the world of education and training.  It brings with it a wealth of experience and research knowledge in the training and has very strong quality assurance arrangements for its programmes.  Feedback from programme participants is a key feature of this quality assurance process.  <\/p>  <p>  This new programme aims to enhance the knowledge, skills and expertise of SNAs whose work is central to the inclusion of students with additional care and complex needs in school life. <\/p>  <p>  The programme consists of five modules, delivered online over a 10-month period. Flexibility is a key part of the approach to the delivery of the programme and participation is voluntary. <\/p>  <p>  The programme is fully funded by my Department and delivered at no cost to the SNA.<\/p>  <p>  Completion of the programme may serve as a stepping stone to further education opportunities in the area. <\/p>  <p>  Each participant who completes the programme successfully will receive a certificate from UCD School of Education which may be of assistance in pursuing further education.  <\/p>  <p>  &euro;2.45m will be allocated to this programme over the next 4 year period based on a full uptake of 3,500 SNAs. The first cohort of 500 SNAs enrolled in January and this phase was oversubscribed.  <\/p>  <p>  This is the first national training programme for SNAs employed in our schools and is tailored to their needs.  The programme will be evaluated and the outcome will inform the approach to the training of SNAs in the future.<\/p>  <p>  The Department recognises that a more strategic approach is required for the training of SNAs.

Also, due to the uncertainties of how GLPs would happen, any scheduled placements were put on hold for the 2020\/2021 academic year. <\/p><p>My Department has been working for some time with stakeholders, including the Teaching Council, the Higher Education Institutes (including the College referred to by the Deputy), the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media and CONCOS (umbrella body for Gaeltacht Colleges), to develop contingency arrangements to allow for the completion of GLPs in the current academic year. An agreement has now been reached to proceed with the delivery of an online version of the course in 2021. <\/p><p>These contingency plans allow for all placements scheduled to take place this year, related to the 2020\/21 academic year, along with those postponed from 2020.

The grant was previously funded by my Department up to the 2012\/2013 academic year, when it was ceased due to financial constraints.  The rate of the re-introduced student grant for 2021 has been set at an average of &euro;650.  This will cover the cost of the undertaking the fortnightly online course in 2021. The re-introduced grant will be made available for undergraduate and post-graduate students in State-funded primary Initial Teacher Education (ITE) programmes.

While the accommodation costs do not arise this year, it is acknowledged that Gaeltacht College providers do face a number of additional costs associated with the preparation, design and delivery of a new online programme. It should be noted that in normal circumstances, Gaeltacht householders who provide accommodation to trainee teachers attending recognised courses in Gaeltacht regions also qualify for a daily grant of &euro;10 per night under the terms of <i>Sc&eacute;im na bhFoghlaimeoir&iacute; Gaeilge<\/i>which is administered by the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media. <\/p><p>It is the shared aim of all of the stakeholders involved that students experience a quality online programme.

Also, due to the uncertainties of how GLPs would happen, any scheduled placements were put on hold for the 2020\/2021 academic year. <\/p><p>My Department has been working for some time with stakeholders, including the Teaching Council, the Higher Education Institutes (including the College referred to by the Deputy), the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media and CONCOS (umbrella body for Gaeltacht Colleges), to develop contingency arrangements to allow for the completion of GLPs in the current academic year. An agreement has now been reached to proceed with the delivery of an online version of the course in 2021. <\/p><p>These contingency plans allow for all placements scheduled to take place this year, related to the 2020\/21 academic year, along with those postponed from 2020.

The grant was previously funded by my Department up to the 2012\/2013 academic year, when it was ceased due to financial constraints.  The rate of the re-introduced student grant for 2021 has been set at an average of &euro;650.  This will cover the cost of the undertaking the fortnightly online course in 2021. The re-introduced grant will be made available for undergraduate and post-graduate students in State-funded primary Initial Teacher Education (ITE) programmes. This is in line with normal practice for other grant payments per students qualifying requirements. <\/p><p>In recent years, it is understood that students had paid an average of &euro;750 for undertaking a fortnightly GLP in the Gaeltacht. This average cost has been in place for many years and included a contribution to cover accommodation costs associated with attending the course in the Gaeltacht. While the accommodation costs do not arise this year, it is acknowledged that Gaeltacht College providers do face a number of additional costs associated with the preparation, design and delivery of a new online programme. It should be noted that in normal circumstances, Gaeltacht householders who provide accommodation to trainee teachers attending recognised courses in Gaeltacht regions also qualify for a daily grant of &euro;10 per night under the terms of <i>Sc&eacute;im na bhFoghlaimeoir&iacute; Gaeilge<\/i>which is administered by the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media. <\/p><p>It is the shared aim of all of the stakeholders involved that students experience a quality online programme.

This is in addition to previously announced one-point reduction for Senior Urban Band 1 schools from 24:1 to 23:1.

The arrangements include the following provisions: <\/p><p>- 2019\/20 mainstream class SNA allocations were frozen, from the date of issue of Circular 0030\/2020, and have automatically rolled over into the current school year. This means that no school will receive an allocation less than that which they have on the date of issue of this Circular and existing SNAs currently in standard SNA posts were allowed to continue in these posts for the current school year in the normal way. <\/p><p>- A diagnosis of a disability, or a psychological or other professional report, is not necessary for this process.  <\/p><p>- The role of the SNA to support the care needs of students in mainstream classes, as set out in Circular 0030\/2014, remains unchanged.<\/p><p>It is expected that schools will review and reprioritise the deployment of SNAs within mainstream settings and allocate resources to ensure those with the greatest level of need receive the greatest level of support. Providing access to SNA support continues to be based on primary care needs as outlined in DES Circular 0030\/2014.<\/p><p>Schools may apply to the NCSE for additionality where they can demonstrate that the current SNA allocation does not meet additional care needs within the mainstream classes in the school. Applications for additionality arising from significant new or emerging additional care needs, which cannot be catered within existing allocations, are dealt with by way of the exceptional review process.<\/p><p>This arrangements do not impact on the way SNAs are allocated to special classes and special schools.

Research carried out by the Inspectorate has captured a range of perspectives, including those of principals, teachers, parents and students, on how schools have operated, on teaching and learning, and on pupils&rsquo;-students&rsquo; experience of school and their engagement in learning. This research has included surveys of different stakeholders, discussions with school principals and inspectors meeting with focus groups of students and parents. A number of reports from this research have been published on my Department&rsquo;s website and further publications are expected in the near future. <\/p>  <p>  A number of academic institutions and bodies such as the ESRI have conducted research on various aspects of the impact that Covid has had on students&rsquo; learning. The outcomes of this research carried out by a range of national research and academic institutions together with the Inspectorate research, have informed the ongoing supports and guidance provided by the Department to schools to ensure that teaching and learning experiences are as meaningful as possible for all pupils\/students in both a remote and a face-to-face schooling context. The Department will continue to monitor the impact of the pandemic on learners in light of the ongoing research from the Inspectorate and academic institutions and research agencies.<\/p>  <p>  Monitoring the learning attainment of students will also help to inform policy approaches and practice in schools. At individual primary school level, standardised tests of reading and Mathematics will be administered as normal in 2020\/21. The results of these tests will allow teachers to establish a baseline of pupils&rsquo; performance in reading and to identify areas of the mathematics curriculum that may need to be revisited. They will also help teachers to identify pupils who may be in need of further diagnostic assessment with a view to putting appropriate support plans in place, either at classroom or school support level, in accordance with the continuum of support. Information from ability tests, teacher observations, parental reports as well as the views of the pupils are also very important aspects of a thorough assessment of needs.<\/p>  <p>  At a system level, the National Assessment of Mathematics and English Reading (NAMER) will be administered in 150 schools in May 2021, public health advice permitting.  Although adapted and reduced significantly in scope in 2021, NAMER remains an important source of information about national standards in pupils&rsquo; performance in English reading and Mathematics. The adaptations made to the study design for 2021 have been done in such a way as to ensure that the study will still produce sufficiently accurate estimates of achievement. Furthermore, contextual data will still be gathered from teachers, pupils and principals. The outcomes of NAMER will contribute to my Department&rsquo;s policy initiatives which aim to improve learners&rsquo; experiences. Given the extraordinary circumstances of the past twelve months, this will be a valuable opportunity to gather up-to-date information and to look closely at our primary pupils&rsquo; performance in English reading and Mathematics in a range of school contexts across the country. A sample of students in Irish primary schools will also participate in the Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS) - the international assessment of reading - in autumn 2021, and a sample of students in Irish post-primary schools will participate in PISA 2022 next year. In both cases, these research studies are expected to provide valuable international comparative data on the effects of Covid-19 on students&rsquo; learning. <\/p>  <p>The Covid-19 crisis has demonstrated clearly that the best learning opportunities for students are provided when they are enabled to attend schools and my Department invested an additional &euro;600m  to put in places a range of measures  to ensure schools can  operate in a safe and sustainable manner  in the current school year. The suite of measures to support schools including minor building grants to allow for modifications to schools for social distancing purposes, additional staffing for supervision and substitution, robust hygiene and cleaning measures as well as guidance documentation and training for staff have all been underpinned by public health advice. School reopening has commenced on a phased basis since 11 February with the return of special schools, special classes and now students in mainstream primary and post primary setting with a gradual phased return to schooling  expected to be completed by Easter 2021. <\/p>  <p>  Nevertheless, my Department is also working to ensure that the supports which students will require to mitigate learning loss arising from school closures are provided.  Schools have been asked to use all available supports, both in-school and community-based, to promote a positive, solution-oriented approach that will support all pupils to achieve, to learn and to progress in their education and to help minimise any further educational inequality among those at risk of educational disadvantage or arising from a special educational need.  Guidance documents provided by the Department have also emphasised the need for teachers on the re-opening of schools to take time to identify where pupils\/students are at in their learning and to build on these starting points. Teachers should continue to observe pupils&rsquo;\/students&rsquo; progress in learning, reflect on their needs and identify pupils\/students who require specific short-term or medium-term interventions after periods of sustained school closures\/absences in order to continue to make progress.<\/p>  <p>  An enhanced programme of summer provision for children with special educational needs and those at most risk of educational disadvantage, similar to that which was provided in summer 2020, is being developed.  The details of how this programme will operate will be worked through with the education partners in the coming months.<\/p>  <p>  In summer 2020, my Department provided funding for an enhanced Summer Programme targeted at learners at risk of educational disadvantage in DEIS primary schools.  The programme was made available to all DEIS primary schools for the first time. In total, over 9,000 pupils availed of these summer camps across 215 schools. Also, for the first time, my Department developed a Summer Programme for DEIS post-primary schools.  In total, over 2,200 students attended the week-long programme in 72 schools.   <\/p>  <p>  Recognising the particular challenges faced by students with complex special educational needs in engaging in remote learning, my Department also provided an enhanced Summer Programme for these students.  The eligibility criteria for the programme were expanded to include a much broader range of students from a broader range of settings.  Approximately 14,000 students availed of the programme which could be accessed in either school or home settings.    <\/p>  <p>  The three programmes were offered at a cost of over &euro;20 million.  Decisions regarding a programme of measures to be offered in 2021 will be made in accordance with public health advice. I hope to be in a position presently to provide further details on what is proposed.  However, it is my intention to make the programmes available to as wide a group of learners as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021030300089#WRR04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Special Education Review","counter":1231,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021030300089#WRR04200"},{"type":"question","counter":1232,"qnumday":446,"qnumall":"[11462\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021030300089#WRR04300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if she plans to include hydrocephalus as a condition requiring additional supports in the education system.","asker":"1514","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":1233,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the Deputy that Special Education teachers support the mainstream class teacher by providing additional teaching support for pupils with special educational needs, or additional learning needs, in schools. <\/p><p>DES Circular 007\/2019 for primary schools and 008\/2019 for post primary schools set out the details of the model for allocating special education teachers to schools.<\/p><p>The Special Education Teaching allocation provides a single unified allocation for special educational support teaching needs to each school, based on each school&rsquo;s educational profile.

The guidance is available at www.gov.ie\/backtoschool.<\/p>  <p>  Transition Year is an optional programme. It is designed to act as a bridge between junior and senior cycle. It provides students with an opportunity to experience a wide range of educational activities, including work experience, over the course of a year that is free from formal examinations.  The aim of TY is to educate students for maturity with an emphasis on personal development, social awareness and skills for life. <\/p>  <p>  The TY guidelines and make it clear that TY should not form part of the Leaving Certificate Programme and should not be seen as an opportunity for spending three years rather than two studying Leaving Certificate material. The Returning to School Transition Year 2020\/21 guidelines confirms that teachers are best placed to review all aspects of their current programmes and to adapt those programmes as necessary. Much of what is in existing TY programmes can be built on and, for the current school year, the main additional task involves establishing continuity with Junior Cycle and monitoring student re-engagement with learning so that skills could be built upon for further senior cycle learning.<\/p>  <p>  The programme content for Transition Year, while not absolutely excluding Leaving Certificate material, should be chosen largely with a view to augmenting the Leaving Certificate experience, laying a solid foundation for Leaving Certificate studies, giving an orientation to the world of work and, in particular, catering for the students&rsquo; personal and social awareness\/development.<\/p>  <p>  The guidance issued in the Covid-19 context enables schools to plan for teaching, learning and assessment in a way that builds on and progresses students&rsquo; learning from junior cycle.

However, the updated guidance indicates that it is a matter for individual schools to consider whether they wish to use some of their minor works grant funding for this purpose or alternatively schools may wish to use some of their minor works grant funding for provision of permanent background ventilation, where required, as referenced in the guidance.<\/p>  <p>  This guidance is one of a number of prevention and control measures in place to ensure schools are very safe.<\/p>  <p>  An expert group on ventilation has recently been formed to advise the national public health emergency team (NPHET) across a range of settings. The work of this group will help guide whether any further update on the Department&rsquo;s guidance is required.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021030300090#WRS04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Special Education Review","counter":1313,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021030300090#WRS05000"},{"type":"question","counter":1314,"qnumday":475,"qnumall":"[11724\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021030300090#WRS05100","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if her Department will consider conducting an analysis or doing a report to quantify the impact of school closures on children with special needs during the Covid-19 pandemic; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1521","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":1315,"content":"<p>COVID-19 has negatively impacted across all aspects of society including in the area of education which has seen the closure of schools on two occasions. <\/p>  <p>  My Department has recognised that such school closures can have a particular impact on children with special educational needs and accordingly has &ndash;<\/p>  <p>  - Prioritised children with special educational needs for the earliest possible return to in school teaching, with pupils in special schools and special classes having now returned to school.<\/p>  <p>  - Urgent consideration is underway as to when children with special educational needs who attend mainstream education can return <\/p>  <p>  - Specific guidance and supports have been provided to schools to support continuity of learning for these children during the school closure period. <\/p>  <p>  - A significantly expanded summer education programme for children with complex special educational needs was provided last year which aimed to prevent regression among children with special needs. <\/p>  <p>  - A supplementary education programme is currently being provided for children with special educational needs who have missed in person education <\/p>  <p>  However, notwithstanding these efforts, my Department is aware from discussions with disability and parental representative groups, that pupils with special educational needs have been impacted to a significant extent by school closures.

This was acknowledged in the Comprehensive Review of the Special Needs Assistant Scheme (SNAs) published by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) in 2018. <\/p>  <p>  The Review made a number of recommendations regarding SNAs and the need for a more broadly based set of supports including therapeutic supports for pupils with complex needs.   The Review also referenced the training needs of SNAs.  In this regard, the NCSE recommended that a new national training programme at Level 5 of the National Qualification Framework be developed for existing SNAs who do not have the requisite level of training and for new SNAs on appointment.  The NCSE also recommended that training tailored to the specific complex needs of some students being cared for by SNAs would also be provided.  <\/p>  <p>  The policy advice has been considered by the Department. It was decided that priority should be given to the development of a training programme for SNAs who may not have had a recent opportunity to access a training programme tailored to their role.  <\/p>  <p>  A public procurement competition was held for the development and delivery of a new national training programme for SNAs. A detailed specification of need and learning outcomes was developed and published for the competition. Formal accreditation to the National Qualifications Framework was not a requirement for the programme. Following evaluation of the tenders received, the contract was awarded to University College Dublin (UCD) School of Education, in conjunction with UCD School of Nursing, Midwifery and Health Systems.  <\/p>  <p>  UCD has a strong reputation in the world of education and training.  It brings with it a wealth of experience and research knowledge in the training and has very strong quality assurance arrangements for its programmes.  Feedback from programme participants is a key feature of this quality assurance process.  <\/p>  <p>  This new programme aims to enhance the knowledge, skills and expertise of SNAs whose work is central to the inclusion of students with additional care and complex needs in school life.   <\/p>  <p>  The programme consists of five modules, delivered online over a 10-month period. Flexibility is a key part of the approach to the delivery of the programme and participation is voluntary. <\/p>  <p>  The programme is fully funded by my Department and delivered at no cost to the SNA.<\/p>  <p>Completion of the programme may serve as a stepping stone to further education opportunities in the area. <\/p>  <p>  Each participant who completes the programme successfully will receive a certificate from UCD School of Education which may be of assistance in pursuing further education.  <\/p>  <p>  Some &euro;2.45m will be allocated to this programme over the next 4 year period based on a full uptake of 3,500 SNAs. The first cohort of 500 SNAs enrolled in January and this phase was oversubscribed.  <\/p>  <p>  This is the first national training programme for SNAs employed in our schools and is tailored to their needs.  The programme will be evaluated and the outcome will inform the approach to the training of SNAs in the future.<\/p>  <p>  The Department recognises that a more strategic approach is required for the training of SNAs.  This would deal with a number of matters including the identification of need and the provision of appropriate training programmes.  The issue of programme accreditation will be considered further in this context.  I look forward to its development.<\/p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the new training programme for SNAs now in place is of high quality and will help to enhance the experience of children with special needs in our schools.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021030300091#WRT02287","answer":true,"speaker":"1472"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Tests","counter":1374,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021030300091#WRT02300"},{"type":"question","counter":1375,"qnumday":497,"qnumall":"[11978\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021030300091#WRT02400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"her plans to introduce regular Covid-19 testing for teachers and students in all schools across the State; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1577","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":1376,"content":"<p>The response to confirmed cases or outbreaks of COVID-19 in the community or in a school is the responsibility of, and will be led and managed by, Public Health HSE.

This was acknowledged in the Comprehensive Review of the Special Needs Assistant Scheme (SNAs) published by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) in 2018. <\/p>  <p>  The Review made a number of recommendations regarding SNAs and the need for a more broadly based set of supports including therapeutic supports for pupils with complex needs.   The Review also referenced the training needs of SNAs.  In this regard, the NCSE recommended that a new national training programme at Level 5 of the National Qualification Framework be developed for existing SNAs who do not have the requisite level of training and for new SNAs on appointment.  The NCSE also recommended that training tailored to the specific complex needs of some students being cared for by SNAs would also be provided.  <\/p>  <p>  The policy advice has been considered by the Department. It was decided that priority should be given to the development of a training programme for SNAs who may not have had a recent opportunity to access a training programme tailored to their role.  <\/p>  <p>  A public procurement competition was held for the development and delivery of a new national training programme for SNAs. A detailed specification of need and learning outcomes was developed and published for the competition. Formal accreditation to the National Qualifications Framework was not a requirement for the programme. Following evaluation of the tenders received, the contract was awarded to University College Dublin (UCD) School of Education, in conjunction with UCD School of Nursing, Midwifery and Health Systems.  <\/p>  <p>  UCD has a strong reputation in the world of education and training.  It brings with it a wealth of experience and research knowledge in the training and has very strong quality assurance arrangements for its programmes.  Feedback from programme participants is a key feature of this quality assurance process.  <\/p>  <p>  This new programme aims to enhance the knowledge, skills and expertise of SNAs whose work is central to the inclusion of students with additional care and complex needs in school life.  <\/p>  <p>  The programme consists of five modules, delivered online over a 10-month period. Flexibility is a key part of the approach to the delivery of the programme and participation is voluntary. <\/p>  <p>  The programme is fully funded by my Department and delivered at no cost to the SNA.<\/p>  <p>  Completion of the programme may serve as a stepping stone to further education opportunities in the area. <\/p>  <p>  Each participant who completes the programme successfully will receive a certificate from UCD School of Education which may be of assistance in pursuing further education.  <\/p>  <p>  &euro;2.45m will be allocated to this programme over the next 4 year period based on a full uptake of 3,500 SNAs.

The programme will be evaluated and the outcome will inform the approach to the training of SNAs in the future.<\/p>  <p>  The Department recognises that a more strategic approach is required for the training of SNAs.  This would deal with a number of matters including the identification of need and the provision of appropriate training programmes.  The issue of programme accreditation will be considered further in this context.

Minister McHugh received the NCCA's advisory report in July 2019 and subsequently the decision was made to afford History a special core status within the Framework for Junior Cycle. The support of the NCCA was requested in formulating how best this special core status for History could be achieved within the Framework for Junior Cycle.<\/p>  <p>  Minister McHugh announced in February 2020 the arrangements to be put in place in order to facilitate History&rsquo;s special core status in the Framework for Junior Cycle. Since September 2020, all post-primary schools have been required to offer History as a Junior Cycle subject and all students entering first year are required to study History as part of the curriculum. Students will follow the existing Junior Cycle History specification, which is of a minimum of 200 hours&rsquo; duration and will be assessed at a common level. Further details in this regard are set out in Circular Letter 16\/2020.<\/p>  <p>  The NCCA is also developing a short course in History for certain students with general learning difficulties\/needs. Students in this category will not be required to study the subject ahead of the new short course being made available in September 2021.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021030300091#WRT05800","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic","counter":1415,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021030300091#WRT05900"},{"type":"question","counter":1416,"qnumday":513,"qnumall":"[12061\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021030300091#WRT06000","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if she will provide further information on the scheduled reopening of schools particularly with regard to supports and advice for high-risk staff and ventilation within school buildings; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1604","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":1417,"content":"<p>The general principles to apply to the management of COVID-19 includes the safety and welfare of teachers and special needs assistants (SNAs) and the minimisation of the impact of COVID-19 on teaching and learning. The current COVID-19 arrangements in place for teachers and SNAs are outlined in my Department&rsquo;s Circular Letter 0049\/2020.  <\/p>  <p>  My Department has an enhanced Occupational Health Service (OHS) in place, to provide employers with occupational health advice in relation to teacher\/SNAs&rsquo; fitness for work.  The current OHS provider has a process in place for school staff with health concerns about their risk of serious illness from contracting COVID-19, through workplace attendance.<\/p>  <p>  A detailed on-line questionnaire is submitted by the teacher\/SNA to the OHS, along with detailed medical evidence to provide clarity with respect to the medical complaint(s) in question.  All of this information is reviewed by the OHS specialist occupational health physician, including the combined and cumulative risk that can arise when a teacher\/SNA suffers from more than one health condition.   The risk categorisation is comprehensive and follows the same process that is being applied across other sectors.  A teacher\/SNA is categorised into one of three COVID-19 risk categories.  These are &lsquo;Normal Risk&rsquo;, High Risk&rsquo;, and &lsquo;Very High Risk&rsquo;. The outcome of the risk categorisation is governed by the HSE guidance.  My Department is following the same guidance that is in use across the public sector. <\/p>  <p>  Where a teacher\/SNA considers the OHS \"Covid-19 Health Risk Categorisation report\" places him\/her in an incorrect risk category, he\/she may request review. The teacher\/SNA may provide additional medical evidence as part of the review process. <\/p>  <p>  Based on HSE advice, a teacher\/SNA categorised by the OHS as &lsquo;Very High Risk&rsquo; must not attend the workplace.  However he\/she remains available for work and the employer should prioritise alternative working arrangements to the maximum extent possible e.g. working from home.<\/p>  <p>  The employer has a responsibility to assess the school environment using the COVID-19 Response Plan for the school, to ensure that all the appropriate HSE recommendations for safe school operations during Covid-19 are being implemented in full. <\/p>  <p>  During the current period of partial re-opening of schools, an employer should temporarily facilitate more flexible working arrangements where a teacher\/SNA has been categorised by the OHS as &lsquo;High Risk&rsquo;. A teacher\/SNA who is over 60 years of age should also be temporarily facilitated by these arrangements. This may include re-assignment of a teacher\/SNA to other duties within the school or facilitated to work remotely i.e. working from home. <\/p>  <p>  The HSE has recently published guidance for the education sector in respect of pregnant employees. Upon the full re-opening of schools, this HSE guidance will be implemented in the education sector. The Department will provide employers with details of these new arrangements in advance of a full re-opening of schools.   In the meantime, during this period of partial re-opening of schools, a pregnant teacher\/SNA should consider themselves in the &lsquo;High Risk&rsquo; category and she should temporarily continue to work remotely i.e. working from home.<\/p>  <p>  These temporary arrangements for teachers and SNAs are outlined in my Department&rsquo;s Information Note 0005\/2021 for primary teachers, Information Note 0006\/2021 for primary SNAs, Information Note 0007\/2021 for post primary teachers and Information Note 0008\/2021 for post primary SNAs.<\/p>  <p>  Schools have put in place significant mitigation measures to reduce the risk of coronavirus within the school environment.  Minor works funding of &euro;160m has been put in place to support these measures. Practical steps for the deployment of good ventilation practices was provided to the school system in the context of re-opening for September 2020. This guidance was reviewed and updated on 30 November.<\/p>  <p>  In summary, the overall approach for schools should be to have windows open as fully as possible when classrooms are not in use (e.g. during break-times or lunch-times (assuming not in use) and also at the end of each school day) and partially open when classrooms are in use. It is worth noting that windows do not need to be open as wide in windy\/colder weather in order to achieve the same level of airflow into the classroom. This will assist in managing comfort levels in classrooms.  Managing comfort levels will be easier for schools now than during the winter period.<\/p>  <p>  In updating the guidance in November, my Department&rsquo;s Planning and Building Unit reviewed the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) guidance that consideration be given to installing an indoor air quality monitor in classrooms.  The updated guidance sets out that in the main windows are likely to be required to be open at a frequency and level in the classroom irrespective of whether the opening of windows is prompted through the indoor air quality monitor (re-active approach) or through the pro-active approach outlined in my Department&rsquo;s guidance and that therefore it is not considered necessary to install such monitors in classrooms.  However, the updated guidance indicates that it is a matter for individual schools to consider whether they wish to use some of their minor works grant funding for this purpose or alternatively schools may wish to use some of their minor works grant funding for provision of permanent background ventilation, where required, as referenced in the guidance.<\/p>  <p>  This guidance is one of a number of prevention and control measures in place to ensure schools are very safe.<\/p>  <p>  An expert group on ventilation has recently been formed to advise the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) across a range of settings. The work of this group will help guide whether any further update on my Department&rsquo;s guidance is required.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021030300091#WRT06100","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Pupil-Teacher Ratio","counter":1418,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021030300091#WRT06200"},{"type":"question","counter":1419,"qnumday":514,"qnumall":"[12070\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021030300091#WRT06300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if her Department is actively examining the creation of additional classes with additional teachers at primary level (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1585","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":1420,"content":"<p>Primary schools are currently provided with class teachers on the basis of one teacher for every 26 pupils which is at its historically lowest level.

For the vast majority of pupils, this will ensure progression is as seamless a manner as possible.<\/p><p>Teachers are very well placed to identify and support the emerging learning needs of their pupils through on-going revision and consolidation activities that will support learning for all. They will continue to monitor and reflect on the needs of the pupils in their class and identify pupils who may not have needed additional support in the past, but who require specific short-term or medium-term interventions after periods of sustained school closures \/ absences in order to continue to make progress. <\/p><p>The Department has not issued guidance to schools in relation to the 2021\/2022 school year specifically. However, many of the messages outlined in the existing guidance, <i>Returning to school: Curriculum guidance for primary school leaders and teachers<\/i>, published in July 2020 for the 2020\/21 school year will be relevant to teachers as they prepare for the 2021\/2022 school year. <\/p><p>It is important to note, however, that the school closures for this school year have been for a shorter duration, and schools have also used the start of the 2020\/21 school year to put contingency plans in place for remote teaching and learning, meaning that they have been able to move to remote teaching and learning with greater ease than during the 2020 school closures.<\/p><p>In <i>Returning to school: Curriculum guidance for primary school leaders and teachers,<\/i>schools were advised that <\/p><p>- Curriculum considerations for the new school year must take account of the variable learning experiences of pupils during the period of school closure and the practical contexts in which teaching and learning will be taking place in the new school year. It is likely that pupils with special educational needs, pupils at risk of educational disadvantage, pupils with English as an additional language (EAL) and pupils experiencing homelessness or living in direct provision have been the most adversely affected by the lack of classroom contact time. The school community and relevant organisations and agencies need to ensure that those pupils receive the necessary supports in their learning in the 2020\/21 school year.<\/p><p>- Teachers continue to provide a broad range of active learning experiences for all pupils. These include play-based learning, inquiry-based learning, talk and discussion, use of digital technologies, and learning in the environment. Care should be taken to avoid the over use of teacher-directed and didactic approaches to teaching and learning in an effort to &lsquo;catch up&rsquo; or &lsquo;cover lost ground.&rsquo;<\/p><p>- Methodologies that support language learning, learning in the outdoor environment, play-based learning, thematic and integrated approaches to learning and collaborative learning are all effective ways of addressing pupils needs<\/p><p>- It will be important to reinforce and consolidate pupils&rsquo; learning from their previous class. Teachers might find it useful to work with the curriculum content, objectives and learning outcomes for the previous class level for at least the month of September in order to ensure that pupils are ready to commence new learning. Again, it is worth noting that this message will likely not be as necessary in September 2021 as it is hoped all pupils will return to school in the coming weeks for the remainder of the school year.<\/p><p>- They should prioritise Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE), Physical Education (PE), language and mathematics in the initial weeks of the school year. Many schools will prioritise these subject areas when schools reopen in Term 2 2021, but the need to prioritise these areas will be lessened if schools reopen as planned in the coming weeks.<\/p><p>In summary, schools have received advice on how to address pupil needs since the initial school closure in 2020. Special Education schools returned on the 11th February followed by Special-education classes in mainstream primary schools on 22nd February. As of Monday 1st March junior infants to second class have returned to primary school with the 15<sup>th<\/sup>March the target date for the return to in-school provision of the rest of primary school children &ndash; third to sixth class. This date will be reviewed during the period following 1 March. As it is envisaged that the school closures for 2020\/2021 will not have lasted for as long as the previous school year and schools are more adept at providing for remote teaching and learning, no specific advice for the 2021\/2022 school year has yet been published. If there is a need for such advice, this will be issued in due course. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021030300091#WRT06700","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1424,"content":"<p>Question No. 516 answered with Question No. 417.<\/p>"},{"type":"question","counter":1426,"qnumday":517,"qnumall":"[12083\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021030300091#WRT07000","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if the shortening of the Easter school break has been considered in the context of the discussions on the return to education.","asker":"1549","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":1427,"content":"<p>The scheduling of the school holiday periods during the academic years is agreed between the managerial authorities of schools, the teacher unions and my Department for the purposes of standardising breaks at Christmas, Easter and mid-term.

The scheme provides financial incentives to private sector employers to hire people with a disability for between 21 and 39 subsidised hours per week under a contract of employment.  Estimated expenditure on the Wage Subsidy Scheme in 2021 is expected to be almost &euro;26 million. <\/p><p>The basic rate of subsidy is &euro;5.30 per hour giving a total annual subsidy available of &euro;10,748 per annum based on a 39-hour week.  The contract of employment offered must be for a minimum of 6 months and the employee should be subject to and have the same rights as per the conditions of employment as any of the other employees.  Included in these conditions is the requirement that the employee must be paid the going rate for the job which must be at least the statutory minimum wage. <\/p><p>It should be noted that the subsidy rate contribution paid to the employer under this scheme is not linked to the statutory minimum wage - it is a subsidy claimed, subject to certain conditions, against the cost incurred where a productivity shortfall arises from a disability. <\/p><p>The financial supports for employers are structured under three separate strands and companies could benefit under one strand or under two or three strands simultaneously, as the case may be, depending on the number of people with a disability employed, as below. <\/p><p>Strand I is a general subsidy for any perceived productivity shortfall in excess of 20% for a person with a disability, in comparison to a colleague without a disability.  The subsidy is based on the number of hours worked. <\/p><p>Strand II subsidy is payable when an employer employs three or more people with disabilities who are supported by a Wage Subsidy Scheme Strand I payment.  Strand II is intended to cover the additional supervisory, management and other work-based costs relating to such employees.  This top-up payment is a percentage of the Strand I subsidy and is based on the overall number of employees with a disability employed under Strand I.  It ranges from an additional 10% of wage subsidy for 3 to 6 employees with a disability to a maximum of 50% of wage subsidy for 23+ employees with a disability. Therefore, when an employer has 23 or more Wage Subsidy Scheme employees a 50% top-up is applied to the hourly rate increasing the payment rate to &euro;7.95 per hour for each employee. <table>    <tr>       <th><\/th>       <th>%<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>3 to 6 employees with a disability<\/td>       <td>10% top-up of wage subsidy paid <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>7 to 11 employees with a disability<\/td>       <td>20% top-up of wage subsidy paid <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>12 to 16 employees with a disability<\/td>       <td>30% top-up of wage subsidy paid <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>17 to 22 employees with a disability<\/td>       <td>40% top-up of wage subsidy paid <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>23+ employees with a disability<\/td>       <td>50% top-up of wage subsidy paid <\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> Strand III subsidy enables employers who employ 25 or more workers with a disability on the Wage Subsidy Scheme to be eligible for a grant of up to &euro;30,000 per year towards the expense of employing an Employment Assistance Officer to support these employees.<\/p><p>The WSS is a demand-led scheme and there are currently 1,586 private sector employers availing of the subsidy in respect of 2,581 participant employees.  <\/p><p>I am aware of the redundancies recently announced at the facility referred to by the Deputy.

I am advised that that is not the case and is, in fact, a misunderstanding of the approach taken by the Chief Appeals Officer.  <\/p>  <p>  The Chief Appeals Officer has advised me that the discussion in relation to the use of &lsquo;test cases&rsquo; before the Joint Committee on Employment Affairs and Social Protection on 5th December 2019 specifically related to a number of cases considered in the 1990s.  These cases, involving workers in a particular sector, were selected as so called 'test cases' not to determine the employment status of all workers in that sector but rather to identify criteria that could be used by Deciding Officers and Appeals Officers for the purpose of assessing each case on an individual basis and to improve the quality and consistency of decision making in relation to the determination of whether an individual was employed or self-employed.  The Chief Appeals Officer has advised me that the test cases were not used to determine a particular outcome on a 'group basis' that would be applied to all cases from that employment sector, as seems to have been inferred by some observers, but instead that the cases informed the identification of criteria  that could be applied to each individual case in that sector. Decision makers (both Deciding Officer and Appeals Officers) would then apply these criteria to all cases that came before them and depending on the circumstances of each case, as assessed by reference to these criteria, an individual decision would be made in each case.  This approach was a precursor to the subsequent development on a tripartite basis of the Code of Practice for Determining Employment or Self-Employment Status of Individuals under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, a code which was subsequently updated in 2007 under the Towards 2016 Social Partnership Agreement. <\/p>  <p>  The Chief Appeals Officer has also advised me that every individual making an appeal to her office always has the opportunity of having any evidence in their own case presented to and considered by an Appeals Officer.  On rare occasions, usually where a number of workers engaged by the same employer are concerned, she may be asked either by the workers or the employer to make decisions on a &lsquo;sample&rsquo; number of cases.  The Chief Appeals Officer has agreed to this approach in very limited circumstances and only with the agreement of both the employer and the workers concerned.  This approach has not been adopted during the period of her tenure in any case of an appeal where the classification of a worker as an employee or self-employed is the issue under appeal.  <\/p>  <p>  This approach can be an efficient way of dealing with issues that are common in appeal cases and where there are a number of workers attached to an appeal.  However, the approach cannot compromise the integrity of the appeal process or deny any individual interested party due process.  Each individual always has the opportunity of having any evidence in their own case presented to and considered by an Appeals Officer.  Importantly, an individual decision issues in each case, and can be individually submitted for review to the Chief Appeals Officer or indeed, appealed to the Courts.<\/p>  <p>  I am advised that, in the circumstances and in light of this clarification, the Chief Appeals Officer does not consider that a contradiction has occurred. <\/p>  <p>  The Social Welfare Appeals Office functions independently of the Minister for Social Protection and of the Department and is responsible for determining appeals against decisions in relation to social welfare entitlements. <\/p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the position for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021030300093#WRV01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Invalidity Pension","counter":1522,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021030300093#WRV01700"},{"type":"question","counter":1523,"qnumday":551,"qnumall":"[11644\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021030300093#WRV01800","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if a person (details supplied) is entitled to an invalidity pension.","asker":"1454","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":1524,"content":"<p>Invalidity Pension (IP) is payable to an insured person who satisfies certain Pay Related Social Insurance (PRSI) contribution conditions and who is permanently incapable of work due to an illness or incapacity and for no other reason.<\/p><p>Claimants must have at least 260 (5 years) paid PRSI contributions (class A, E, H or S) since entering social insurance and 48 contributions paid or credited in the last or second last complete contribution year before the relevant date of their Invalidity Pension claim. <\/p><p>The relevant date is:<\/p><p>(a) any date after the completion of one year of continuous incapacity for work, or<\/p><p>(b) any lesser period that may be prescribed, subject to the conditions and in the circumstances that may be prescribed<\/p><p>where the insured person has entered into a continuous period of incapacity for work and he or she is subsequently proved to be permanently incapable of work.<\/p><p>A qualifying condition for IP is that a person must be regarded as being permanently incapable of work.

The levels of support include:<\/p>  <p>- Level 1, which aims to embed an inclusive culture in services, includes the national inclusion policy and guidelines for ECCE, the funding of the LINC training programme in Leadership for Inclusion, the establishment of Inclusion Co-Ordinator roles in ECCE settings, and a small increase in capitation for services with qualified Inclusion Coordinators.<\/p>  <p>- Level 2 involves provision of information for parents and providers on AIM, through the AIM.gov.ie website and information provided by County\/City Childcare Committees.<\/p>  <p>- Level 3 recognises the requirement to continue to develop a qualified workforce that can confidently meet the needs of all children participating in the ECCE Programme. Supports include funding of training courses such as Hanen, L&aacute;mh and Sensory Processing E-Learning (SPEL).<\/p>  <p>- Level 4 addresses the needs of early years practitioners to have timely access to advice and support from experts in early learning and care (and disability in particular) to assist them meet each child&rsquo;s needs.<\/p>  <p>- Level 5 recognises that some children require specialised equipment, appliances, assistive technology and\/or that some early learning and care settings may require minor structural alterations to ensure children with a disability can participate in the ECCE programme. Supports include grants for equipment and some capital building works for a service.<\/p>  <p>- Level 6 provides access to therapeutic supports where they are critical to enable a child be enrolled, and fully participate, in the ECCE programme.<\/p>  <p>- Level 7: Additional assistance in the pre-school room involves additional capitation for service providers where an application process has demonstrated that supports Level 1-6  have not, or will not, by themselves, meet the child&rsquo;s needs. Funding can be used by the provider to buy in additional support, or reduce the staff \/ child ratio, supporting the pre-school leader to ensure the child&rsquo;s optimal participation.<\/p>  <p>  County\/City Childcare Committees (CCC) can provide information on AIM, the application process and local pre-schools that may have capacity for children, including those with physical and intellectual disabilities, to attend.

The effect on those in our society who are already vulnerable, or who have additional needs, can be even greater.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has worked closely with Tusla, the Child and Family Agency to support services across Ireland, and those working directly with children and young people have taken a leading role in delivering an innovative response to this crisis.  Tusla has developed Child and Family Support Networks (CFSNs) across Ireland, through the Prevention, Partnership and Family Support Programme. The CFSNs consist of local services that play a role in the lives of children and families. The networks aim to ensure that there is no wrong door for families seeking help, by directing them to the right support in their community. There are 118 CFSNs across Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  A key structure for service planning in Ireland are Children and Young People's Services Committees (CYPSC). CYPSC help children and young people by co-operating across agencies. In 2020 CYPSC diverted 50% of funding allocated by DCEDIY towards COVID-19 related initiatives in their communities. These initiatives include school meals provision and distribution, mental health and wellbeing supports, delivery of activity packs to children and families, working with homelessness accommodation services, working with the Children Rights Alliance on a privately funded food provision scheme in local communities in disadvantaged areas and the co&ndash;ordination of school supports\/digital divide supports. In 2021 CYPSC continue to utilise DCEDIY funding to co-ordinate various initiatives in response to COVID-19.<\/p>  <p>  Tusla also directly supports family support services through structures including Family Resource Centres (FRCs) and the Tusla ABC Programme. FRCs are Ireland&rsquo;s largest family support programme delivering universal services to families across the country such as education, community groups and counselling services. With 121 Centres nationwide, FRCs work to meet the needs of many local areas.<\/p>  <p>  In response to COVID-19 public health measures, organisations delivering parenting and family supports adapted their services throughout 2020. Services have coordinated with School Completion Programmes, Tusla and the Garda&iacute; to distribute essential goods, and adapted to remote service delivery. For parents, many family support and home visiting services are working remotely or delivering online resources including learning and play plans for young children.<\/p>  <p>  The Tusla ABC Programme is an area based prevention and early intervention initiative  delivered across 12 areas of significant socio-economic disadvantage in areas across the country, operating as part of the wider Tusla Prevention, Partnership and Family Support Programme (PPFS). I am conscious that ABC sites have taken numerous measures to address effects of COVID-19, including remote delivery of some interventions with particular attention to those who are vulnerable. Tusla have implemented a 5 Level Roadmap aligned to wider Government efforts.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, I wish to note that my Department recently re-launched the Supporting Children campaign. Supporting Children was designed to acknowledge the potential harms of the current public health crisis and to draw attention to the robust network of supports which exist for those in need across areas including Parenting and Family Support, Domestic, Sexual and Gender Based Violence and Child Protection and Welfare. It also encourages all of us to look out for vulnerable children and young people and highlights many significant adaptions of services across Ireland to COVID-19.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021030300094#WRW05400","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Foster Care","counter":1641,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021030300094#WRW05500"},{"type":"question","counter":1642,"qnumday":592,"qnumall":"[11540\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021030300094#WRW05600","dept":"Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","minister":"Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","question":"the number of young persons due to age out of foster care and who are at risk of living in poverty or becoming homeless; the supports in place for young persons at risk of poverty of homelessness on leaving foster care; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1604","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":1643,"content":"<p>I would like to thank the Deputy for the question.

These include an obligation, under section 43 of the Act, on every licensee to issue a letter of engagement to his or her client which must be signed by both parties within 7 working days of starting to provide a property service or agreeing to provide such a service. The Act sets out the minimum contents of a letter of engagement, including details of the services to be provided to the client, details of any fees or commission payable by the client and requirements in relation to the deposit of client moneys. Failure to comply with section 43 is improper conduct under the Act.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, the Property Services (Regulation) Act 2011 (Minimum Standards) Regulations 2020 (S.I. No. 564 of 2020), which came into effect on 30 November 2020, set out a range of minimum standards to be observed in the provision of property services by licensees to their clients.  In accordance with these Regulations, where a licensee holds a security deposit, in relation to the letting of property, which is due to be paid to a client or returned to a tenant, the licensee is required to make such payment to the client or tenant as provided for in the letter of engagement or, if not so specified, not later than 10 working days after the day the tenant vacates the property, save in exceptional circumstances. Failure to comply with the standards set out in the Regulations amounts to improper conduct.<\/p>  <p>  The PSRA is empowered to investigate complaints of improper conduct made against licensed property services providers, and to launch investigations on its own initiative for the purpose of ensuring compliance by property services providers with their statutory obligations. Where a finding of improper conduct is made by the PSRA, it can impose a range of sanctions: namely, issue a reprimand, warning, caution or advice, suspend or revoke a licence, or direct the licensee to pay a financial penalty (up to &euro;50,000 into the Property Services Compensation Fund, up to &euro;50,000 to the PSRA towards the cost of the investigation, up to &euro;250,000 to the PSRA by way of financial penalty or any combination of the foregoing).<\/p>  <p>  While my Department keeps the operation of the Property Services (Regulation) Act 2011 under review, my Department has no plans at present to amend the Act in the manner suggested by the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021030300096#WRY05500","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Alcohol Sales","counter":1806,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021030300096#WRY05600"},{"type":"question","counter":1807,"qnumday":650,"qnumall":"[10979\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021030300096#WRY05700","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if she will address a matter in relation to proposed licence reforms (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1598","askee":"1502"},{"type":"question","counter":1808,"qnumday":659,"qnumall":"[11040\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021030300096#WRY05800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"her plans to engage in a formal public consultation process in respect of her reported proposals to reform licensing laws to develop the night-time economy; when the process will commence; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1599","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":1809,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 650 and 659 together.<\/p>  <p>  The Justice Plan 2021, which I published last week, commits to reviewing and modernising alcohol licensing.<\/p>  <p>  Our hospitality and cultural sectors have been hardest hit by the pandemic, with many pubs and venues not opening their doors for a year.

I can assure the Deputy that it is my intention to engage constructively with stakeholders as that work progresses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021030300096#WRY05900","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Crime Data","counter":1810,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021030300096#WRY06000"},{"type":"question","counter":1811,"qnumday":651,"qnumall":"[10980\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021030300096#WRY06100","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of murders, attempted murders, conspiracy to murder, rapes, aggravated sexual assaults and assaults causing serious harm that have been reported in each Garda division over the past five years; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1568","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":1812,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware the Central Statistics Office (CSO), as the national statistical agency, is responsible for the compilation and publication of all crime statistics.

My officials are examining ways to update and take forward that work, while fully respecting the independent role of the Coroners as set out in the Coroners Act 1962.<\/p>  <p>  The Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence and DNA Database System) Act 2014 commenced on 20 November 2015, providing for the establishment of a DNA Database System for use by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. The DNA database system has two key functions:<\/p>  <p>  1. To match the DNA profile from an individual to an unidentified crime scene profile and\/or match the crime scene profiles across different crime scenes; and<\/p>  <p>  2. To assist with identifying missing and unknown persons.<\/p>  <p>  Different sections of the database hold samples from crime scenes; DNA profiles from suspects \/ offenders for matching against crime scenes; elimination samples from members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Crime Scene Investigators etc. left inadvertently at crime scenes; and samples to identify missing persons and DNA profiles of persons whose identity is not known.<\/p>  <p>  The missing and unknown persons section of the database hold the DNA profiles developed from biological samples relating to missing persons, such as from their clothing or other belongings. It also holds profiles from their close blood relatives (where their consent is forthcoming), who will have similar DNA. Profiles of persons who are unable to identify themselves due to illness or injury can also be entered on the DNA database, as can profiles from bodies of unidentified deceased persons.<\/p>  <p>  The database can link missing persons or persons who are unable to identify themselves to their close family relatives through DNA matching. It is also able to match missing people (sometimes via their relatives) to unidentified bodies, helping to bring some element of closure for families searching for their loved ones. The database can also serve to eliminate a missing person if an unidentified body is found matching their description, assisting the Garda&iacute; with their investigations.<\/p>  <p>  The Act also provides for the exchange of DNA profiles of missing or unknown persons with law enforcement authorities in other jurisdictions. The database therefore facilitates searches for missing or unknown persons abroad as well as in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  Forensic Science Ireland and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have worked in partnership over the past number of years to deliver a DNA testing facility for families of missing persons at the national Missing Persons Day ceremony. This partnership has served to enhance the ceremony from that of a largely commemorative event to one which has contributed to raising awareness of the significant contribution made by DNA testing to the conclusion of a considerable number of missing persons cases over recent years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021030300096#WRY07100","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Asylum Seekers","counter":1822,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021030300096#WRY07500"},{"type":"question","counter":1823,"qnumday":657,"qnumall":"[11018\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021030300096#WRY07600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of persons seeking asylum who arrived in each month from January 2020 to date; the countries travelled from in tabular form; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1547","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":1824,"content":"<p>The International Protection Office (IPO) of my Department is responsible for examining all applications received.

The PSA is an independent statutory body under the aegis of my Department and I have no involvement in the day-to-day operations of the Authority.<\/p>  <p>  In April 2020, the Board of the PSA submitted proposals to my Department for a change in the licence fee for contractors. This proposal took account of the impact of the COVID-19 restrictions on the security industry at that time, and also the additional costs which will arise from implementing the new health and safety requirements in the workplace. Having considered this matter against the backdrop of evolving arrangements for reopening society and business, I requested the Board of the PSA to review their proposal in light of what might be the continuing impact of COVID-19 on the security industry.<\/p>  <p>  An updated proposal was received by my Department from the PSA in October 2020 and as the Deputy can appreciate, due to the potential impact on exchequer receipts it was deemed prudent to first seek the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform approval in this regard. While following consideration the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform were of the view that the proposal would at the time be a disproportionate response, they also put forward an alternative proposal in the form of a four month transitional moratorium. <\/p>  <p>  Having considered the proposal from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the PSA advised my Department that this option was similar to the instalment payment arrangements already available from the PSA to contractors. <\/p>  <p>  My Department will remain available to continue engagement with all stakeholders in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021030300097#WRZ05300","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Visa Applications","counter":1876,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021030300097#WRZ05400"},{"type":"question","counter":1877,"qnumday":677,"qnumall":"[11527\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021030300097#WRZ05500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"when a person (details supplied) who has been granted a stamp 1 G visa will receive the visa; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1508","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":1878,"content":"<p>I am informed by the Detective Chief Superintendent of the Garda National Immigration Bureau that the person concerned received their Irish Residence Permit (IRP) card on 27 February 2021, at their local Immigration Office.<\/p><p>Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to my Department by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility at: <i>INISOireachtasMail@justice.ie<\/i>, which has been specifically established for this purpose.

This model of care will ensure that infertility issues will be addressed through the public health system at the lowest level of clinical intervention necessary. It will comprise three stages, starting in primary care (i.e., GPs) and extending into secondary care (i.e., Regional Fertility Hubs) and then, where necessary, tertiary care (i.e., IVF and other advanced assisted human reproduction (AHR) treatments). Structured referral pathways will be put in place and patients will be referred onwards for further investigations or treatment as required and as clinically appropriate. It is intended that, in line with available resources, this model of care for infertility will be rolled out on a phased basis over the course of the coming years. As such, no decisions have been made on the eligibility criteria which will need to be satisfied to a enable a person to access advanced AHR treatments through the public system. <\/p>  <p>  An important consideration in developing the model of care, and in determining the parameters that would frame it, was its interplay with the broader AHR regulatory framework and the provision of safe, effective and accessible infertility services at all levels of the public health system as part of the full range of services available in obstetrics and gynaecology. <\/p>  <p>  It should be noted that while AHR treatment is not currently funded by the Irish public health service, a defined list of fertility medicines needed for fertility treatment is covered under the High Tech Arrangements administered by the HSE. Medicines covered by the High Tech Arrangements must be prescribed by a consultant\/specialist and authorised for supply to the client&rsquo;s nominated community pharmacy by the High Tech Hub managed by the Primary Care Reimbursement Service. The cost of the medicines is then covered, as appropriate, under the client&rsquo;s eligibility, i.e., Medical Card or Drugs Payment Scheme. Given the costs associated with certain fertility medicines, I am aware that these schemes can have a material impact on the total cost of AHR treatment for individuals who avail of them.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, there is other support available in that patients who access IVF treatment privately may claim tax relief on the costs involved under the tax relief for medical expenses scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021030300098#WRAA08100","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Staff","counter":1984,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021030300098#WRAA08200"},{"type":"question","counter":1985,"qnumday":711,"qnumall":"[10987\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021030300098#WRAA08300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of primary care posts in Ballymun, Dublin 11 for speech and language therapy, occupational therapy, physiotherapy and psychology;

Given that there will be initially limited vaccines available, it will take some time for all to receive those vaccines and that has necessitated an allocation strategy to ensure that those most at risk of death and serious illness receive the vaccine first.<\/p><p>The priority is to first vaccinate and protect directly the most vulnerable amongst us, that is, those most likely to have a poor outcome if they contract the virus. The priority is to directly use vaccines to save lives and reduce serious illness, hence the focus on the over 65 year old cohort in long term residential care facilities, and healthcare workers in frontline services often caring for the most vulnerable.<\/p><p>The next group to be vaccinated are those aged 70 and older in the following order: 85 and older, 80-84, 75-79, and 70-74. Vaccination of this group began in February.<\/p><p>On the 23<sup>rd<\/sup>of February, I announced an update to Ireland&rsquo;s COVID-19 Vaccine Allocation Strategy. <\/p><p>In comprising the initial Vaccine Allocation Strategy, the NIAC listed several conditions associated with increased risk of severe disease and death. In the intervening period, national and international evidence has become available which has enabled a more detailed analysis of underlying conditions that may increase the risk of developing severe disease or death.<\/p><p>The NIAC has now been able to more comprehensively identify those medical conditions and to distinguish between those which place a person at very high or high risk of severe disease if they contract the virus. Medical conditions and the magnitude of the risk they pose will continue to be monitored and periodically reviewed. <\/p><p>The NIAC continues to monitor data around this disease and indeed emerging data on effectiveness of vaccines on a rolling basis.<\/p><p>Further details are available at the following link:<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021030300099#WRBB03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"question","counter":2023,"qnumday":725,"qnumall":"[11027\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021030300099#WRBB03200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when healthcare staff in a nursing home (details supplied) will be vaccinated;

The priority is to directly use vaccines to save lives and reduce serious illness, hence the focus on the over 65 year old cohort in long term residential care facilities, and healthcare workers in frontline services often caring for the most vulnerable.<\/p><p>The next group to be vaccinated are those aged 70 and older in the following order: 85 and older, 80-84, 75-79, and 70-74. Vaccination of this group began in February.<\/p><p>On the 23<sup>rd<\/sup>of February, I announced an update to Ireland&rsquo;s COVID-19 Vaccine Allocation Strategy. <\/p><p>In comprising the initial Vaccine Allocation Strategy, the NIAC listed several conditions associated with increased risk of severe disease and death. In the intervening period, national and international evidence has become available which has enabled a more detailed analysis of underlying conditions that may increase the risk of developing severe disease or death.<\/p><p>The NIAC has now been able to more comprehensively identify those medical conditions and to distinguish between those which place a person at very high or high risk of severe disease if they contract the virus. Medical conditions and the magnitude of the risk they pose will continue to be monitored and periodically reviewed. <\/p><p>The NIAC continues to monitor data around this disease and indeed emerging data on effectiveness of vaccines on a rolling basis.<\/p><p>Further details are available at the following link:<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021030300099#WRBB07600","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Staff","counter":2068,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021030300099#WRBB07800"},{"type":"question","counter":2069,"qnumday":738,"qnumall":"[11089\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021030300099#WRBB07900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when the psychologist position will be filled at the Phoenix Centre, County Longford, to allow for diagnostic assessments to be carried out for children.","asker":"1596","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2070,"content":"<p>The Programme for Government, Our Shared Future, recognises the need to improve services for both children and adults with disabilities through better implementation and by working together across Government in a better way.<\/p><p>The Government commits to prioritising early diagnosis and access to services for children and ensuring that the most effective interventions are provided for each child, to guarantee the best outcomes.<\/p><p>As this is a service matter I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the deputy directly, as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021030300099#WRBB08000","answer":true,"speaker":"1484"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Appointments Status","counter":2071,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021030300099#WRBB08100"},{"type":"question","counter":2072,"qnumday":739,"qnumall":"[11091\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021030300099#WRBB08200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if further appointments will be arranged in the case of a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2073,"content":"<p>It is recognised that waiting times for scheduled appointments and procedures have been impacted in the last year as a direct result of the COVID-19 pandemic. <\/p>  <p>  The HSE is currently recommending that only critical time dependent elective procedures are undertaken at this time due to the on-going and significant increased demand for bed capacity related to Covid-19.<\/p>  <p>  This decision was made arising from the rapid increase in Covid-19 admissions and to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for Covid-19 related activity and time-critical essential work. <\/p>  <p>  Patient safety remains at the centre of all hospital activity and elective care scheduling.

The importance of continued social interaction of residents and their families cannot be overstated and every effort should be made, in line with public health advice, to ensure that these interactions continue, including through window visits. <\/p><p>Notwithstanding this, it is also important to be cognisant of the wider epidemiological situation and the risks associated with same. On the 19th November, the European Centre for Disease Control published its latest risk assessment with regard to long-term care facilities. It highlights that the probability of COVID-19 introduction into a long-term care facility depends on the level of COVID-19 circulation in the community, with a higher risk associated with higher incidence rates in the community. <\/p><p>Data indicates that 155 nursing homes are actively dealing with a COVID-19 Outbreak. We continue to see new outbreaks being notified with on average, approximately one new outbreak per day being notified in the week up to 27<sup>th<\/sup>February. Noting that on 27<sup>th<\/sup>February approx. 600 confirmed cases of COVID-19 had been reported, the level of risk, including to residents of nursing homes remains high. The public health advice remains clear as noted  in the statement from the National Public Health Emergency Team on 24<sup>th<\/sup>February &ldquo;<i>Given the increased transmissibility of the virus now, we must continue to limit our social contacts and do all we can to starve this disease of opportunities to spread<\/i>&rdquo;.<\/p><p>Nursing home providers are ultimately responsible for the safe care of their residents. Under Regulation 11 of the Health Act 2007 (Care and Welfare of Residents in Designated Centres for Older People) Regulations 2013 it is the legal responsibility of each registered provider to make arrangements for a resident to receive visitors, having regard to any risks that may present for the resident or other residents. Public health guidance has been developed in order to assist and support providers in this regard.  <\/p><p>I recently wrote to all nursing home providers, through HIQA&rsquo;s communication portal, to emphasise the importance of adopting a holistic and person-centred approach, noting the important role that visiting, social connections and communication with family and friends has in the context of residents&rsquo; overall health and wellbeing. The importance of ensuring that visits take place to the greatest extent possible, in line with public health guidance and risk assessments was reiterated and providers were encouraged to frequently communicate with residents and families on the matter of visiting and to respond to phone to calls by family members, in so far as is practicable, given the constraints on staff.<\/p><p>The Government&rsquo;s revised plan, COVID-19 Resilience and Recovery 2021 - The Path Ahead, published on 23<sup>rd<\/sup>February, recognises that the challenge of balancing protective health measures and normal living has been particularly important in the context of visitations to long-term residential care settings (LTRC). LTRC visiting guidance has remained under ongoing review throughout the pandemic. <\/p><p>In light of the advanced stage of rollout of the COVID-19 vaccine in LTRCs for both residents and staff, the NPHET (the National Public Health Emergency Team) has requested that the HSE progress a process for considering the scope and application of LTRC visiting restrictions in the context of the Framework of Restrictive Measures, having regard to international and national evidence, the rollout of the COVID-19 vaccine and the level of disease in the community.

This must be integrated across the care pathway, and provided as close to home as possible or in specialist centres where necessary. <\/p>  <p>  These services should be configured into population based managed clinical rehabilitation networks (MCRNs).

The Minister for Health requested Dr Scally to undertake an independent review of the Implementation Plan.  The Implementation Plan was revised to take account of further formal observations submitted by Dr Gabriel Scally.  A further revision of the Implementation Plan took place to encompass two further recommendations identified by Dr Scally in the Supplementary Report, which was approved in June 2019. 170 actions, across 58 recommendations, are in the final Implementation Plan, with actions across the Department of Health, the HSE and the National Cancer Registry of Ireland (NCRI).<\/p><p>Quarterly progress reports on implementation have been carried out by the Department of Health since Q1 2019. They are published on the Department&rsquo;s website. That reporting continues with the Q4 2020 report published recently.<\/p><p>As of the end of 2020, there were 148 of 170 actions, arising from the 58 recommendations, completed.<\/p><p>Dr Scally was requested to undertake a further implementation review, and this took place in late 2019. The report of this Review of the Implementation of the Recommendations of the Scoping Inquiry into CervicalCheck was received by the Department in April 2020. It was published on the Department&rsquo;s website in December 2020. In this review report, Dr Scally says that substantial progress has been made, the vast majority of actions were on track or were completed, and he is satisfied with the approach and structures in place for implementation.<\/p><p>The Department of Health engages on an ongoing basis with the HSE and the National Cancer Registry of Ireland as part of the oversight of the implementation of the remaining recommendations and actions.  The CervicalCheck Steering Committee, chaired by Professor Anne Scott, will also have a role in oversight of the implementation of the remaining recommendations.<\/p><p>Dr Scally suggested, in his second review report, that he &ldquo;conduct one final progress review at a suitable point sometime after the coronavirus crisis has abated&rdquo;.<\/p><p>I am supportive of this and will raise it with the CervicalCheck Steering Committee at the appropriate time. <\/p><p>In April 2020, the Department of Health commissioned Crowe, a management consultancy firm, to provide an evidence review and to support the Independent Patient Safety Council to make recommendations for a Policy Framework for Open Disclosure in Healthcare in Ireland.

In the interim, additional national and international evidence has become available which enables a more detailed examination of specific underlying medical conditions which increase the risk of developing severe disease or dying following infection with SARS-CoV-2. This has allowed NIAC to sub-divide those with specific medical conditions into those at very high-risk and those at high risk of serious disease and death.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the categories of very high risk and high risk conditions, this list is not exhaustive.

There is flexibility to introduce new measures in the second half of the strategy (2021-2025) to address issues which may emerge in the first four years.<\/p><p>As the national drugs strategy is at the mid-way point, the Department has commenced a review of progress on the actions contained in the strategy.  The review will consider progress achieved to-date under the action plan, any new issues that have arisen including the impact of Covid-19. It will also reflect commitments in the Programme for Government as part of a health-led approach to drug use and misuse and the EU drugs strategy 2021-2025.<\/p><p>In addition, the review will be informed by a focussed policy assessment of expenditure on drugs and alcohol services being carried out by the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service (IGEES), new data on trends and indicators in drug and alcohol for 2019\/2020, and the impact of Covid-19 on drug and alcohol services.<\/p><p>I am committed to working in partnership with all stakeholders on the mid-term review of the actions in the national drugs strategy. An update on progress on the review will be considered at the National Oversight Committee meeting at the end of this week. I will clarify the timeframe for finalising the review at this meeting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021030300106#WRJJ04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1608"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Vaccination Programme","counter":2596,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021030300106#WRJJ04700"},{"type":"question","counter":2597,"qnumday":928,"qnumall":"[11815\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021030300106#WRJJ04800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of healthcare workers who are in direct patient contact who are yet to receive the first dose of the vaccine; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1567","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2598,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021030300106#WRJJ04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"question","counter":2600,"qnumday":929,"qnumall":"[11817\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021030300106#WRJJ05100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the protocol to vaccinate agency healthcare assistants and agency nurses; the number of these staff in the country; the number who have received the first dose and the second dose of the vaccine; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1567","askee":"1623"},{"type":"question","counter":2601,"qnumday":930,"qnumall":"[11818\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021030300106#WRJJ05200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of homecare agency staff; the number that have been vaccinated to date; the number yet to be vaccinated; the number who have declined to take a vaccine; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1567","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2602,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 929 and 930 together.<\/p><p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the deputy directly, as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021030300106#WRJJ05300","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Respite Care Services","counter":2603,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021030300106#WRJJ05500"},{"type":"question","counter":2604,"qnumday":931,"qnumall":"[11827\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021030300106#WRJJ05600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the details of the locations of the recently announced nine respite houses across Ireland; if he will provide more details in relation to same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1481","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2605,"content":"<p>The Government is committed to providing services and supports for people with disabilities which will empower them to live independent lives, provide greater independence in accessing the services they choose, and enhance their ability to tailor the supports required to meet their needs and plan their lives.<\/p>  <p>  In Budget 2021, I committed to provide funding to the HSE to develop nine additional respite services across the country.

Medical conditions and the magnitude of the risk they pose will continue to be monitored and periodically reviewed.<\/p><p>The NIAC continues to monitor data around this disease and indeed emerging data on effectiveness of vaccines on a rolling basis.<\/p><p>Further details are available at the following link: www.gov.ie\/en\/press-release\/b44b2-minister-donnelly-announces-update-to-vaccine-allocation-strategy\/.<\/p><p>Frontline healthcare workers (HCWs) in direct patient contact roles will be vaccinated in Group 2.

Hospital and critical care occupancy are reduced to low levels to protect the health service and allow for the safe resumption of non-COVID-19 care. <\/p>  <p>  3. Ongoing and steady progress on the vaccination programme such that the most vulnerable are protected through vaccination. <\/p>  <p>  4. Emerging information on variants of concern. <\/p>  <p>  The period between now and the 5 April is to allow for a fuller assessment of the status of the disease, including the impact of priority services reopening in the context of the more transmissible variant. There will also be considerably more data in relation to vaccines which will enable more detailed modelling.  <\/p>  <p>  Information on the current public health measures is available here - www.gov.ie\/en\/publication\/2dc71-level-5\/.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021030300107#WRKK02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Primary Care Centres","counter":2645,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021030300107#WRKK02600"},{"type":"question","counter":2646,"qnumday":946,"qnumall":"[11900\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021030300107#WRKK02700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when the Athy primary medical centre will be fully operational; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1588","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2647,"content":"<p>As the HSE has responsibility for the provision, along with the maintenance and operation of Primary Care Centres and other Primary Care facilities, the Executive has been asked to reply directly to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021030300107#WRKK02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Occupational Therapy","counter":2648,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021030300107#WRKK02900"},{"type":"question","counter":2649,"qnumday":947,"qnumall":"[11901\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021030300107#WRKK03000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when occupational therapists will return from secondment to contact tracing in County Kildare; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1588","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2650,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the deputy directly, as soon as possible. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021030300107#WRKK03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic","counter":2651,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021030300107#WRKK03200"},{"type":"question","counter":2652,"qnumday":948,"qnumall":"[11903\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021030300107#WRKK03300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will introduce safeguards and an appeal system to counteract persons giving false names to avoid fines under the Covid-19 travel restrictions; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1588","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2653,"content":"<p>SI No. 45\/2021 provides the legislative basis for the COVID-19 Passenger Locator Form and sets out an offence where the form is not completed in the manner specified or where false or misleading information is provided on the on the form.

Where the health research does not involve, give rise to or become associated with personal data the Regulations, the Act and GDPR do not apply.  In that same context, the Health Research Regulations do not change the law on, for example, taking or using bio-samples for research purposes. That is very important to bear in mind. <\/p>  <p>  As with all aspects of data protection law and across all sectors, it is for the data controller to determine whether personal data is involved and, if so, whose personal data.   The definition of personal data is set out in Article 4 of the GDPR as is the definition of genetic data.  Those definitions are binding on the Health Research Regulations and those involved in genetic and genomic research should make sure that they are fully conversant with those definitions, compliant with the law in this area and also adhere to international best ethical practice. <\/p>  <p>  I will deal now with the specifics of Regulation 3B of the Health Research Regulations.  Emergency care and treatment is a real-life reality that saves lives.  It is also an internationally recognised reality that the only way to develop new emergency care treatments and procedures is through research studies that are carried out side by side with the care being provided to the patient.  That is what Regulation 3B of the Health Research Regulations is designed to help facilitate to the extent that it can do so as secondary legislation that deals only with information processing. <\/p>  <p>  The amendment is a tightly drawn provision that allows for deferred consent of the data subject for the processing of his or her personal data in health research in limited and specified circumstances subject to safeguards.  <\/p>  <p>  In fact, it is expressly provided in Regulation 3B that the circumstances must be exceptional and that the principal purpose of the processing or further processing of the personal data concerned by the data controller is necessary for the provision of health care to an individual and necessary to protect the vital interests of the individual.  It is further expressly provided that the research must be &ldquo;related health research&rdquo; which means research that is related to the care and treatment being provided to the individual.  It is difficult to see how genomic research, given its nature, would fall under this provision.<\/p>  <p>  On the question of the processing of personal data of a deceased individual, the provisions of data protection law apply only to the personal data of living individuals.  That rule is applicable equally in the limited cases covered by Regulation 3B.  Ethical matters associated with health research are considered by RECs and Regulation 3B requires REC approval. <\/p>  <p>  Where an individual is alive, the GDPR does not give consent rights to other individuals to act on behalf of an adult data subject where the data subject lacks capacity to consent so the question of next of kin is moot and enduring powers of attorney are not generally viewed as extending into the health-related realm.<\/p>  <p>  However, the duty of confidentiality survives death so health professionals holding the medical records of deceased individuals should exercise considerable care in releasing that information to a third party.  In that regard, the Medical Council&rsquo;s advice to doctors is &ldquo;if it is unclear whether the patient consented to the disclosure of information after their death, you should consider how the disclosure might benefit or cause distress to the deceased&rsquo;s family or carers. You should also consider the effect of the disclosure on the reputation of the deceased and the purpose of the disclosure.&rdquo; <\/p>  <p>  Given that the thrust of these questions relates to protecting the privacy of individuals in the complex area of genomic research, I want to take the opportunity afforded by the Deputy&rsquo;s questions to provide some contextual elaboration.  Genomics is applied to health, especially within rare disease and cancer, to provide diagnosis, prognosis and uncover links between genetic variation and disease.  Genomics can bring significant benefits to healthcare systems, by accelerating clinical research and drug development, personalizing treatment regimens, improving patient outcomes, and reducing the cost of care.  <\/p>  <p>  While genomic research opens up exciting possibilities such research also poses particular societal, ethical and regulatory challenges.   From a privacy perspective, one of the ways that genomic data are special is in their potential to yield information that relates to more than one individual. This means that genome sequence data should be handled carefully even if, for example, it is derived from a deceased individual, and otherwise out of scope of the GDPR.  It could be argued that aspects of the genome that are highly likely to be shared with living family members will constitute &lsquo;personal data&rsquo; if they can be connected with those data.  For example, if a tissue block or sample from a deceased relative is analysed to inform the treatment of a living individual, the data should be treated as &lsquo;personal data&rsquo; relating to the living individual because the GDPR does not regulate based on the source of the information but focuses on its content.  <\/p>  <p>While those matters are for the Data Protection Commission to determine and are likely to feature in the European Data Protection Board Guidelines on processing personal data for scientific research purposes (currently in preparation and due sometime this year) I will conclude by repeating a point I made at the beginning of this answer: namely, that those involved in genetic and genomic research should make sure that they look very carefully at the relevant definitions in Article 4 of GDPR, comply fully with the law in this area and meet international best ethical practice in the conduct of their research.  Such an approach will be critical to achieving the necessary public support for such research.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021030300109#WRMM06100","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"question","counter":2838,"qnumday":1017,"qnumall":"[12165\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021030300109#WRMM06600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reason explicit consent or ethical approval is not required when a controller obtains personal data to establish if a person may be suitable or eligible for inclusion in research; the criteria used to ascertain if research is preliminary or substantive (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1567","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2839,"content":"<p>The Health Research Regulations include explicit consent as a safeguard when an individual&rsquo;s personal data is being processed for health research.

It seems reasonable to allow that process to be undertaken without explicit consent and that is what the pre-screening amendment to the Health Research Regulations allows subject to very clear rules and safeguards.

Furthermore, the fixing and allocation of fishing opportunities is the exclusive competence of the Council. Any changes to these fundamental principles would require a renegotiation of the Treaty.<\/p>  <p>  The Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) provides the framework for the long term conservation and sustainability of fish stocks around our shores and is designed to ensure the long term sustainability of fishing in Ireland and throughout EU waters. The CFP specifically calls for the progressive restoration and maintenance of populations of fish stocks above biomass levels capable of producing Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY). This will lead to healthy fish stocks, higher quotas for both Irish and EU fishers and to more sustainable fishing patterns.<\/p>  <p>  In 2020, 45% of the stocks of interest to Ireland were fished at or below MSY - this increased from 34% in 2013. In 2009, at EU level only 5 stocks were fished at MSY. This shows that the many years of intensive, industry-led conservation measures within the framework of the CFP are paying off.<\/p>  <p>  Under the CFP, EU fishing fleets are given equal access to EU waters and fishing grounds subject to allocated fish quotas. Fishing vessels, irrespective of size, must comply with the rules of the CFP, including rules on access and catch limits\/quota.<\/p>  <p>  The share allocation of stocks between Member States was established as a principle of the first CFP in 1983 and was based on the average catch of each Member State over a period of reference years (track record). The only exception to this relates to the Hague Preferences, on the basis of a special recognition agreement of the underdeveloped nature of the Irish fleet and the heavy control responsibility on us when Ireland joined the EU. The Hague Preferences give Ireland an increased share of traditional stocks (cod, whiting, haddock, sole and plaice) when Total Allowable Catch (TAC) levels reduce below a specified level.<\/p>  <p>  As regards Bluefin Tuna, Ireland does not have a national quota for this stock but a small Bluefin Tuna by-catch quota is available to Ireland, primarily for use in our important Northern Albacore Tuna fishery and Celtic Sea Herring fishery. The UK also had also a share of the Bluefin Tuna by-catch quota and, under the EU\/UK Trade and Co-operation Agreement, a share of the EU&rsquo;s Bluefin Tuna quota (0.25%) has been transferred to UK. We are seeking that this transfer to the UK is taken from the overall EU quota and is not taken from the by-catch quota available to Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  In 2018, Ireland was successful, for the first time, in securing agreement that allowed countries without a commercial quota to set up a catch-tag-release fishery to contribute to the collection of scientific data. A Catch-Tag-Release science-based fishery for authorised recreational angling vessels has been in place in Ireland since 2019 and supports the collection of valuable data on the migratory patterns of Bluefin Tuna in Irish waters.<\/p>  <p>  The EU percentage share of the international Bluefin Tuna TAC is set down and there is no likelihood that an international country will concede any share to the EU. The only way to obtain a share of the EU quota now would involve changing relative stability within the EU and would require a majority of Member States to agree under the qualified majority voting system.  This means that EU Member States, with a national quota, would have to give up a share of their allocation to Ireland. Any change to relative stability - for any fish stock - would involve a loss for some other Member States and therefore poses particular challenges in a qualified majority voting context.  <\/p>  <p>  The EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement will, unfortunately, have a negative impact on our fishing industry. However, this impact would have been far greater had the Barnier Task Force agreed to UK demands or had we been in a no-deal scenario which would have seen all EU vessels barred from UK waters and subsequent displacement into Ireland's fishing zone. <\/p>  <p>  While the outcome on fisheries was a difficult compromise, this Government is working to ensure that the fisheries sector, and the coastal communities that depend on it, are supported. I advised the EU Fisheries Council in January and February that we consider that the quota transfers that fall to us in Ireland are disproportionate in terms of burden sharing. I have also made it clear that the inequitable relative contribution of quota share by Ireland is contributing to a strong sense of grievance within our fishing industry, and indeed more broadly, and Ireland will continue to push for a mechanism to be found within the EU Commission and relevant Member States to find solutions. Ireland intends to continue to keep the focus on this situation and use any opportunity available to seek constructive solutions that would help to alleviate this unacceptable position.<\/p>  <p>  The European Commission Brexit Adjustment Reserve (BAR) will provide support to counter the adverse consequences of the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union in Member States, regions and sectors, in particular those that are worst affected by that withdrawal, and to mitigate the related impact on the economic, social and territorial cohesion. I have listened carefully to the representatives of the fishing industry and I am reflecting on how to ensure that the funding made available to the sector is focused to meet the challenges of the sector and of the coastal communities most impacted. <\/p>  <p>  Last week I announced the establishment of a Seafood Sector Taskforce, under the chairmanship of Aidan Cotter, barrister and former CEO of Bord Bia, and involving a broad range of seafood industry representatives and other stakeholders, to make recommendations to me on measures to mitigate the impacts of the reductions in quota share on the Irish Fishing Industry and on the coastal communities that depend on fisheries. I will be asking the Task Force to focus immediately on possible arrangements for a temporary fleet tie-up scheme to counter the impacts of the reduction in quotas which will impact our fishing industry from the beginning of April.  The final report, to be delivered in 4 months, will address their recommendations for re-balancing and any other recommended initiatives to support our seafood sector and coastal communities. The Taskforce will also consider and recommend constructive actions that would help to alleviate the inequitable relative contribution of quota share by Ireland in the EU\/UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement.<\/p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s forthcoming Seafood Development Programme 2021-27 under the European Maritime Fisheries and Aquaculture Fund will also play an important role over the next seven years in assisting our seafood sector adjust to the impacts of the TCA.<\/p>  <p>  The CFP is reviewed every 10 years and the next review is scheduled to be completed by 31 December 2022 when the European Commission will report to the European Parliament and the Council on the functioning of the CFP. The EU Commission has advised that it intends to commence the Common Fisheries Policy review process following clarity on the future relationship between the EU and the UK. The review is expected to be detailed and comprehensive.

The EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement sets out new arrangements for the joint management of more than 100 shared fish stocks in EU and UK waters.

The EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement will unfortunately have an impact on the Irish fishing industry.

During the review, Mr. Mackinnon met with various industry stakeholders, administrative and technical personnel of my Department, other State agencies, landowners and interest groups.<\/p><p>His report, &lsquo;<i>Review of Approval Processes for Afforestation in Ireland&rsquo;<\/i>, which was published in November 2019, made various recommendations or &ldquo;Ways forward&rdquo; aimed at improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the licensing approval process, as well as dealing with broader issues relating to encouraging woodland creation. In response to these recommendations, a draft Implementation Plan was set up, in co-operation with the Forestry Programme Implementation Group, DAFM personnel, the COFORD promotion group, and other stakeholders.<\/p><p>Work on the implementation of the actions included in the draft plan started straight away and has been ongoing since. Significant progress has been made on a variety of the recommendations included in the Mackinnon report and I would in particular like to highlight the following developments:<\/p><p>- Additional resources have been recruited in my Department, including 21 ecologists, to deal with the new Appropriate Assessment work. Further resources will be recruited shortly and requirements are constantly reviewed.<\/p><p>- The Forestry Miscellaneous Provisions Act came into force in October 2020. Such has been the effect of this legislation that we now expect the Forestry Appeals Committee to be in a position to clear all cases that are currently before it by the end of June this year.<\/p><p>- Guidance and templates on the new licence application process have been provided to registered foresters with a view to improving the quality of applications received by my officials.<\/p><p>- A Forestry Licence Viewer was launched towards the end of 2020 giving all members of the public full visibility on forestry licence applications.<\/p><p>- The &lsquo;Creation of Woodlands on Public Lands&rsquo; Scheme was published in autumn 2020.<\/p><p>Work on finalising the Mackinnon Implementation plan was recently carried out by Jo O&rsquo;Hara, former head of Scottish Forestry. Ms. O&rsquo;Hara interviewed a variety of stakeholders as part of her review and has completed her report with recommendations and findings on the implementation of the Mackinnon Report. Minister Hackett, who has responsibility for forestry, has accepted Ms O'Hara's recommendations and we jointly announced on 25<sup>th<\/sup>February 2021 the establishment of  Project Woodland which will  adopt the project management structure set out in Ms. O&rsquo;Hara&rsquo;s report. The report is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link: <\/p><p>This project management structure will consist of a Project Board, Project Manager and 4 individual workstreams working with the principles of clear accountability and reporting. The workstreams will work concurrently, focusing on different areas. The first one will concentrate on the backlog, the second on a vision for forestry, the third on devising a fit for purpose organisational structure, and the fourth on streamlining the licensing process for the future. Project Woodland will be held to account by a Project Board which will report to my colleague Minister Hackett. The Project Board will be chaired by the Secretary General of my Department and will have another 3 members from outside the Department, including Ms O'Hara, with specific expertise in relevant areas. The Project Manager will be responsible for co-ordinating the work carried out in the 4 workstreams and will report to the Project Board. <\/p><p>Each workstream will be supported by a working group made up of stakeholders and will be chaired by an experienced external person. I believe that this new structure will help us draw on the expertise and input of all stakeholders in the forestry sector as we develop a new vision for forestry.

My Department introduced an exchequer-funded reconstitution in 2013 to restore affected forests and paid out some &euro;7 million to forest owners.<\/p>  <p>  While that scheme was a reasonable response at the time, it became evident that given the progression and reach of the disease and based on the scientific knowledge available, a review of the scheme was needed. The original aims of the scheme i.e. eradication of the disease from Ireland, were no longer achievable, as the disease is now considered endemic here. Given that the scientific outlook had changed, a new approach was clearly needed.<\/p>  <p>  A review process was undertaken to decide on the best approach going forward. This included stakeholder and public consultation and detailed field consideration of damage level evaluation, together with an examination of a broader range of silvicultural and management options available to forest owners. Advice from Teagasc and international experts was also received. Current support schemes were examined to ensure their continued relevance and that they represent value for money and to ensure that the forest owner is provided with a broader range of silvicultural and management measures. On foot of the review, a new Ash Dieback scheme known as the Reconstitution and Underplanting Scheme was launched in June 2020.<\/p>  <p>  This Scheme aims to encourage the active management of ash plantations in the context of the control and spread of ash dieback disease. It categorises plantations into three groups based on the plantation age and tree size. Different support options are available, depending on the category into which the ash plantation may fall. It also aims to promote the vigorous growth of ash through thinning to realise as much of the potential value of the crop as possible.<\/p>  <p>  Since its launch in June, over 268 applications have been submitted.

As outlined previously, there is no basis in EU Regulations under which this group can meet the eligibility requirements for the Young Farmers Scheme payment.<\/p>  <p>  The Young Farmers Scheme and the separate and distinct &lsquo;Young Farmer&rsquo; priority category of the National Reserve were introduced under Pillar I of the reformed CAP in 2015 to provide support to young farmers in the initial period following the commencement of their agricultural activities.<\/p>  <p>  In line with the EU Regulations governing the operation of the Young Farmers Scheme, the payment is limited to a maximum period of five years. Payment is based on the number of payment entitlements activated in the scheme year, subject to a maximum of 50. Since the introduction of the Young Farmers Scheme in 2015, support has been granted to young famers who have commenced their agricultural activities since 2010. There is no provision within the EU Regulations governing the Young Farmers scheme to provide for support to young farmers who commenced their agricultural activity prior to 2010.<\/p>  <p>  Separately, from 2015 the &lsquo;Young Farmer&rsquo; priority category of the National Reserve has also provided support to young farmers who have commenced their agricultural activity since 2010. The National Reserve provides an allocation of payment entitlements on eligible &lsquo;naked&rsquo; land or increases the value of entitlements  that are below the national average to bring them up to the national average. In 2015, the National Reserve also provided support on a once-off basis to a group of farmers called Old Young Farmers. This was a category of young farmers who had commenced their agricultural activity in 2008 and 2009 but had suffered the disadvantage of not having had access to Installation Aid available at the time of their initial set up.<\/p>  <p>  EU Regulations governing the National Reserve provide that the two categories of young farmer and new entrant to farming must receive priority access to the Reserve. Since 2018, under the Omnibus Regulation, Member States may use the proceeds of a linear cut to fund specific disadvantage categories under the National Reserve but only if a linear cut is required to fund the two priority categories of young farmer and new entrant to farming in that particular year. Since 2018, the National Reserve has been funded without the requirement for a linear cut to the value of all payment entitlements and this is also the case for 2021. Decisions in relation to the National Reserve, including the basis of funding the Reserve, are made in consultation with the Direct Payments Advisory Committee which comprises members of the main farming organisations and farm advisory services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021030300110#WRNN07000","answer":true,"speaker":"1546"},{"type":"question","counter":2917,"qnumday":1047,"qnumall":"[11244\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021030300110#WRNN07200","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he will outline the criteria and eligibility terms for schemes (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1557","askee":"1546"},{"type":"speech","counter":2918,"content":"<p>My Department offers an attractive suite of options for landowners to plant forestry as part of the Afforestation Grant and Premium scheme, to suit most land types and scenarios.

Research demonstrates herds are at risk of introducing infection into their herd through a number of routes including direct or indirect contacts - such as contiguous contacts, purchasing animals including so called 'trojan animals' &ndash; pregnant animal carrying a BVD positive calf. Ireland records a large number of farm to farm movements, approximately 2.8 million moves direct farm to farm and through marts annually.<\/p><p>Post mortems are not conducted on badgers and deer as part of the BVD programme. International research suggests that wildlife does not play a key role in the transmission of BVD within or between farms.<\/p><p>The three week standstill period is used to allow for any likely transient infection (TI) to reduce in the herd and\/or any potentially newly infected animal to react to the test. The BVD technical working group has recommended to the BVD Implementation group that a three-week standstill period after the removal of the test positive BVD animals is necessary  to ensure a more comprehensive evaluation of the health status of all the animals in the herd and to ensure the best outcome for the individual herds and for the success of the programme.<\/p><p>As agreed by the BVD Implementation Group, the arrangement for the 2021 and 2022 programme is that blood collected during the whole herd sampling will be sent to private laboratories designated for BVD virus testing in blood. Compulsory screening testing continues as is through the laboratories designated for BVD virus testing in ear notch samples. The turnaround time can vary with the different samples submitted i.e. tissue or blood. Tissue tag testing is a high throughput and highly automated test, with over two million samples tested a year in Ireland, and laboratories involved have to comply with strict turnaround times as indicated in their designation criteria. It is estimated that up to a maximum of 45,000 blood samples will be collected in 2021 as part of the BVD compulsory herd testing programme, and samples submitted can greatly vary from week to week, thus the testing process is more manual and there  is likely that some variation around turnaround times will occur.<\/p><p>Thus far in 2021, only a small number of herds have completed the whole herd test and they have been tested in DAFM laboratories, so turnaround times are not yet available that would reflect the full group.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021030300111#WROO01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1546"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Animal Identification Schemes","counter":2941,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021030300111#WROO02300"},{"type":"question","counter":2942,"qnumday":1059,"qnumall":"[11274\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021030300111#WROO02400","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"when knackeries will become live for the cattle movement monitoring system, CMMS;

NBI also outlined its plans to improve information to the public on when individual areas are likely to be connected.<\/p>  <p>  NBI also explained the work they are undertaking to carry out a comprehensive survey of the requirements of each area, including pole and ducting infrastructure, to prepare for the installation of broadband.  The potential to accelerate the rollout of the NBP project was also discussed. <\/p>  <p>  The National Broadband Plan will have a profound impact on the future of our country and will provide new opportunities for rural areas in particular.  These include improved career opportunities for those living in rural areas, facilitating smart farming, allowing employers to access the pool of talent that resides outside our large towns and cities, and the provision of services such as eHealth and eLearning.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021030300112#WRPP07000","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"}]
